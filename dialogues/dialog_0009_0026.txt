DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor... Petrimoulx, was it? It's... well, it's something the nice nurse mentioned. Something about being awfully tired, and… numbers being off? Honestly, I don't keep up with these things. My husband usually handles all that. He said something about my muscles… being unhappy. Is that right? It feels like a bother, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right, Ardelle. The nurse let me know you've been experiencing fatigue and some concerning lab results, including potentially elevated muscle enzymes. It is good your husband is so involved in your care. It sounds like he’s very attentive. When you say "tired," could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, he is. Always fussing. A good man, but… fussing. As for the tiredness… well, it’s just… everything feels like a great effort. Getting out of a chair, even. Walking to the market is… quite the ordeal these days. It wasn’t always like this, you know. I used to be… quite spry, even after a long day working with the team. It's just... draining. Like someone’s let all the air out of my sails. Do you understand? I don't know what "enzymes" are, but if it's making me feel like this, it’s not good.
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Ardelle. "Like the air has been let out of your sails" is a very good way to describe it. It sounds incredibly frustrating to feel that loss of energy, especially when you’re used to being active. And it's perfectly alright not to know what "enzymes" are – that’s what I’m here for. They're essentially proteins in your body that help with many processes, and sometimes when they’re elevated, it can signal something is going on with your muscles. I see here you've been generally healthy, but have had some routine checkups. Do you have any other symptoms alongside the fatigue?
PATIENT: Well, I wouldn’t say I’m ailing, if that’s what you mean. Just…old. A few aches and pains, naturally. My knees aren't what they used to be, but who’s is at my age? Let me think… hmm. Sometimes, a bit of a dull ache in my shoulders, but I put that down to sleeping in a funny position. Oh! And my hands… they get a bit clumsy sometimes. Dropping things. Not all the time, mind you. Just… occasionally. Is that important? I really don't want to make a fuss. Perhaps it’s just the summer heat. It’s been awfully oppressive.
DOCTOR: It's good you’re keeping track of those things, Ardelle. Aches and pains are common, absolutely, and it's helpful to know what's new or different. The clumsiness in your hands is something I want to explore a little further, especially in combination with the fatigue and muscle enzymes. It could be related, or it could be something else entirely. Do you have any difficulty swallowing, or have you noticed any changes in your skin rash or color?
PATIENT: Swallowing? No, I haven't had any trouble swallowing. Not that I've noticed, anyway. Food goes down just fine. My husband makes a lovely stew, and I eat it every week, so I’d certainly notice if that was a problem! As for my skin… well, it’s getting a bit thin, naturally. And a few age spots here and there. Nothing unusual. I used to have a bit of a rash when I was younger, working with the team, but that cleared up years ago. It was from the salt water, I think. A bit of a nuisance, but the doctor at the time said it wasn't anything serious. Really, I think I'm just… wearing out. Is there anything I should be doing? Other than resting, of course. My husband keeps telling me to rest, but I get bored.
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the swallowing and the rash, Ardelle. It's helpful to rule things out. I understand the feeling of wanting to stay active, even when you’re feeling tired. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past health. Do you have any history of heart problems, lung disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... My mother had a bit of trouble with her heart when she was very old, but that was decades ago. And my uncle, he had a cough… always a terrible cough. I think it was something with his lungs, but I wasn’t very close to him. Diabetes? No, I don’t think so. My husband is always watching my sugar intake, though. He’s very careful about that. He says I have a sweet tooth. I used to be very strong, you know. Very active. Working with the team… that was hard work. Lifting and hauling things all day. My hands were like iron. Now... well, they aren’t. I really don’t understand why I’m feeling so weak. It’s quite distressing.
DOCTOR: It’s good to know about your mother and uncle’s health, Ardelle. And it’s wonderful your husband is so attentive to your diet. Now, I'd like to ask about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements. Also, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. I take a little something for my blood pressure, a small white pill. My husband gives it to me every morning with my tea. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take ibuprofen, the over-the-counter kind. Just when it’s really bad. Nothing else, really. As for allergies… well, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. Except maybe pollen, sometimes. Makes my eyes a bit itchy in the spring. But that’s just a minor annoyance. Really, I don’t take many medications. My husband believes in natural remedies. He makes me a lot of herbal teas. Mostly for calming my nerves. He worries too much, if you ask me. .
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful to know, Ardelle. Blood pressure medication, ibuprofen as needed, and some herbal teas – and occasional pollen allergies. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a little strength test, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
