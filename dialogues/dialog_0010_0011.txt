DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I’m Dr. Annesley. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Look, I ain’t got a whole lot of time, so let’s get this over with. I need a… a paper, or somethin’. To say I can get this done. A procedure. Cosmetic. That’s what the young lady on the phone said. I need to know if I’m… allowed. You understand? I just want the okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Mr. Honcoop. You’re looking for medical documentation to allow you to proceed with a cosmetic procedure. I can certainly help with that, but I do need to gather some information first to ensure your safety and determine if I can provide that documentation. It's standard procedure, I assure you. To begin, can you tell me a little bit more about the procedure you're interested in?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I don’t rightly remember all the fancy names. It’s… for my face. It’s gettin’… old. Saggy. The young lady said somethin’ about liftin’ it. A face lift. That’s it. I don’t need to explain why, do I? It’s my face. Just tell me if I’m healthy enough for it, or not. I ain’t got time for a long list of questions.
DOCTOR: I understand you’d like to know if you’re a suitable candidate for a facelift. Of course. And I respect your desire to keep things concise. However, even for cosmetic procedures, I have a responsibility to ensure your well-being. To do that, I need to ask a few questions about your medical history. It won't be a long list, I promise. First, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I been workin’ with towers and radios since… well, a long time. Hard work. Climbin’ and such. I ain’t been to a doctor in… years. Probably decades. I don’t have any conditions. Never have. A few aches and pains, what can you expect? But no diagnoses. No fancy names for nothin’. Just… old. Is that good enough? Can we move on?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Honcoop. No diagnosed medical conditions. That's helpful. Just aches and pains from your work. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think. There was somethin’ when I was a young man. Fell off a tower, broke my arm, I think. But that was… a long, long time ago. They fixed it, and I got back to work. That’s all I remember. No other surgeries. Definitely nothin’ recent. Look, I told you, I ain’t one for doctors and hospitals. It’s a waste of time. Can we please get to the point? Is my face lift okay, or not?
DOCTOR: Alright, a broken arm as a young man, repaired. No other surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s good to know. Now, just a couple more quick questions, and then we can discuss the next steps. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, I drink coffee. That’s it. Black coffee. Every mornin’. Helps me stay awake on these towers. No pills, no fancy vitamins, nothin’. Just coffee. And maybe a little sugar sometimes. Is that what you want to know? Are you tryin’ to trick me into sayin’ somethin’ I don’t know? I told you, I’m a simple man. Just coffee and hard work. Now, about this face…
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Honcoop, I am not trying to trick you. Just covering all the necessary bases. No medications, just coffee. That's helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, I work outside. All day. Pollen, dust, you name it. I’m allergic to everything! But I ain’t sick from it. I just… deal with it. A little sniffle now and then. That’s it. No serious allergies. No bee stings, no peanuts, nothin’ like that. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I’m a grown man. I know my own body. Can we please be done? This is a waste of perfectly good time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. No serious allergies, just some environmental sensitivities. Now, to determine if I can provide the documentation you need, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Just a quick look at your overall health. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your face. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I ain’t one for pokin’ and proddin’. But if you gotta, I guess. Just make it quick. I got things to do. Towers don’t climb themselves, you know. And don’t tell me nothin’ about my blood pressure bein’ high. I’ve been climbin’ these things for fifty years. I’m tougher than I look. Just… get it over with. And be gentle. This face is important.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Honcoop. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, blood pressure is 148 over 92. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your activity level and some environmental factors. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is audible. Lungs are clear, with no wheezing or crackles. Skin elasticity is decreased, as expected with age. Some areas of sun damage are visible. Overall, your face appears healthy, but there are some signs of aging, as you mentioned. Okay, Mr. Honcoop, that concludes the physical exam.
PATIENT: So? What does it mean? Am I allowed to get this… fix? Don't tell me about "murmurs" and "sun damage." Just tell me if I can do it. I haven't got all day to listen to doctor talk. I need a straight answer. Yes or no. Can I get this face lift, or not?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, given your age, your reported history, and the findings of the exam – slightly elevated blood pressure and a mild heart murmur – I cannot, in good conscience, provide documentation approving you for a major cosmetic procedure like a facelift without further evaluation. The murmur needs to be investigated to rule out any underlying heart condition. And the blood pressure should be monitored and controlled. Proceeding with a surgery without addressing these issues could pose a significant risk to your health. I recommend a consultation with a cardiologist for a complete cardiac evaluation and a follow-up with your primary care physician to manage your blood pressure. Once those issues are addressed, and you have medical clearance from both specialists, we can revisit this discussion. I understand this isn't the answer you were hoping for, but my priority is your safety. Would you like me to provide you with referrals to a cardiologist and primary care physician?
PATIENT: Referrals? Specialists? Doctor, are you serious? I climbed a tower this mornin’! A tower! I don't need fancy tests and opinions. I need a face lift. This is ridiculous. A waste of my time and money. I've been perfectly healthy for sixty-four years. Forget the referrals. Forget everything. I'll find another doctor. One who understands what it means to be a man, and not bother with silly tests. You know what? Maybe I don't even need a face lift. I'm a perfectly good-lookin’ man.
