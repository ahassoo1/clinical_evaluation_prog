DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Renzi. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Renzi, you say? Hmm. Yes. New here, you know. Just… checking things. Old man problems, I guess. Not really sick sick. Just… gotta get it done. Medicare, they send me.
DOCTOR: Alright, “getting it done” is a perfectly good reason to come in. And Medicare is smart to encourage preventative care. I understand. “Old man problems” is… a very broad description, though. Perhaps we can narrow it down a bit?
PATIENT: Narrow down? Eh. What is there to narrow down? Everything hurts a little. Back, knees… sometimes my hands feel funny. I put makeup on people, you know? Very precise work. Used to, anyway. It’s all… fading. Not important. Just tell me I'm not… dying. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all, Mr. Szmyd. And we will figure things out. It sounds like you’re experiencing some aches and pains, and some changes in your hands that are concerning you. We can definitely explore those. “Fading,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Fading. Can’t… hold the brushes like I used to. Not steady. Used to be… very good. Famous, even. Small town famous, maybe. Now… they send young ones. Faster. More… modern. It’s alright. Everything changes. But… the hands. I worry about the hands. They’re important.
DOCTOR: I understand. Your hands are important to you, and it’s natural to be worried about changes that affect your ability to do things you enjoy and take pride in. We'll definitely take a close look at them. Now, when did you first notice these changes in your hands?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. A while now. Maybe… six months? A year? Everything blurs, you know? I do remember… dropping a brush. Very expensive brush. The girls, they laughed. Not nice. It’s… harder to grip things. Opening jars, even. Used to be nothing. Now… it's a struggle. Is that what you want to know? Stupid questions.
DOCTOR: No, these aren’t stupid questions at all, Mr. Szmyd. It's important for me to get a clear picture of what's going on. And it is helpful to know these things. So, the difficulty with gripping – is that in both hands, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, I think. But… the left one is worse. Always been a little clumsy with the left. Not as strong. Now… it feels like it might just… stop working. Silly, yes? Old man talk. But it aches, you know? Especially at night. Keeps me awake. Do I need… tests? X-rays? I don't like those.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all to be concerned, and the pain is definitely worth investigating. We may need to do some tests, yes. X-rays are sometimes helpful, but we can talk about the risks and benefits, and explore other options if you're particularly uncomfortable with them. Before we get to that, let's talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No. Blood pressure… maybe? The doctor back home, he gave me pills. Small white pills. Don't remember what for. Just took them. Still alive, yes? Heart… a little fluttery sometimes. When I get excited. Or… scared. But nothing serious. Old age, I think. Everything’s broken. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t keep track of these things. Too busy… was busy. Making people pretty. Does that count for anything? .
DOCTOR: Making people pretty absolutely counts for something, Mr. Szmyd. It sounds like you've had a very fulfilling career. And it's alright that you don't remember all the details of your medical history. That’s what I’m here for. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
