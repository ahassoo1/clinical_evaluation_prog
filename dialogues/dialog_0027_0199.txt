DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Chayer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It's… my breathing. It’s been kinda short lately, you know? Like, I get winded really easy. Honestly, I don't really remember when it started, exactly. Just… happened gradually, I guess. It’s just… hard to catch my breath sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. Hard to catch your breath… and it's been happening gradually, you said. Hmm. Can you tell me a little more about when you notice it’s the hardest?
PATIENT: When… uh. It’s tough to say. Not, like, always. But definitely when I’m… working. I work at the water plant, you know? Lots of walking, checking things… even just climbing stairs gets me. And sometimes even just talking. It’s weird. Not all the time though, which is why I didn’t rush to come in right away, I think. It’s… frustrating. I don't know if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. Intermittent symptoms can be tricky. So, it's worse with exertion – walking, climbing stairs, even talking. And it doesn’t happen when you're resting?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty much. When I’m just sitting, watching TV with my wife, I’m okay. No problem. It's mostly when I’m doing stuff. Though… sometimes I feel a little… tight in my chest even when I’m relaxed. But it's not… bad enough to really worry me, usually. It's just… there. You know? I’m not sure if that’s related, though. Honestly, I’m terrible at remembering all this stuff. My wife probably has a better idea of when it started.
DOCTOR: Okay. Chest tightness sometimes even at rest… and you're unsure if it’s connected. Alright. Let's try to get a bit more detail. When you feel this tightness, can you describe it?
PATIENT: Uh… it’s not… a sharp pain, exactly. More like… a squeezing? Like someone’s… hugging my chest really tight. Not painful, but… uncomfortable. And it doesn't last long, usually. Just a few minutes, maybe. It’s hard to explain. I've never really… felt anything like it before, so I don't have a good way to describe it. Sorry. I just… feel a little breathless when it happens, too. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Squeezing, with breathlessness. Alright. Have you had any cough with this, Mr. Chayer?
PATIENT: Cough? Uh… not really. I mean, I get a little tickle in my throat sometimes, but no… not a cough. Not like a bad cough, anyway. Nothing that’s kept me up at night or anything. Just… a little clearing of the throat, sometimes. Mostly when the air is dry, I think. Does that count? I'm really not sure. I don't get sick very often, so I don't really pay attention to those things.
DOCTOR: Okay. No significant cough, just a little throat clearing. Have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? No, not that I've noticed. I wear work boots all day, so… it's hard to tell, maybe? They're pretty tight. But I don't think so. My wife would probably notice if my feet were swelling, and she hasn't said anything. I mostly just notice being tired, to be honest. Especially after work. But I figured that was just from the walking.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tiredness after work, no swelling. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like asthma, COPD, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not that I know of. I haven't really been to the doctor much, honestly. Just for check-ups, usually. Nothing serious. I've always been pretty healthy, I think. My wife keeps telling me I need to get more regular checkups, but I always put it off. I don't like going to the doctor, to be honest. And I don't remember ever being told I had anything wrong with my heart or lungs. Does that help? I don't really know much about those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions. And you haven’t had any surgeries, as far as you recall?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that’s it. I think. It was a long time ago. They put a cast on it, but I don’t think they did any… actual surgery. Just a cast. And… no, I don't think I've had any other surgeries. Definitely not as an adult. My wife would remember if I had surgery, right? She's got a good memory.
DOCTOR: Yes, your wife would likely remember. Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That's a tough one. My parents… they both passed away a few years ago. And I don’t… I don’t really know much about their medical history. They lived back in Venezuela, and we weren’t very close, to be honest. I think my father had… high blood pressure, maybe? But I’m not sure. And my mother… I don’t really remember. Sorry. I wish I knew more. It's just... hard to recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, difficult to recall family history. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I’ve never had any problems with medications or anything like that. I can take pretty much anything without any reaction. My wife always asks me that, and I always tell her the same thing. No allergies. I'm pretty sure. I haven't had any… rashes or trouble breathing after taking medicine, so… I think I’m good.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Chayer?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I haven't needed anything, really. Just… vitamins sometimes, but that’s it. And I haven't taken any vitamins in months, to be honest. My wife keeps trying to get me to take them, but I forget. I just… don't take any medicine. Nothing regular, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if that's alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your oxygen levels. Just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. That sounds… helpful. I’m glad you want to listen to my lungs. I’m not sure what you’ll hear, but… sure. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up on the table for me. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Try to breathe normally. Okay. I'm hearing some… wheezing in your lungs, especially on exhale. Your heart sounds regular, but a bit… fast. I’m also going to check your oxygen saturation with this clip on your finger. Your oxygen is… 92%. That's a little low, but not critically low. Do you feel short of breath right now?
PATIENT: Wheezing? I didn’t know what that meant, but… yeah, maybe a little. I… I do feel a little breathless now that you mention it. Not terrible, but… definitely not as easy as it usually is. It’s been like that since I sat down, actually. I thought it was just nerves, maybe? I don’t really like being at the doctor. 92%… is that bad? I just want to be able to breathe easier, you know? I hate feeling like I have to… work to breathe.
DOCTOR: 92% is a bit lower than we’d like to see, and combined with the wheezing, it’s concerning. I’m going to ask a few more questions, and then we'll discuss some possible next steps. Have you been exposed to any irritants lately?
PATIENT: Irritants… what do you mean? Like… chemicals? At the water plant, yeah, we deal with chlorine and stuff, but we have all the safety equipment, you know? Masks, gloves… I always wear them. I don't think so. No… nothing unusual. Maybe a little dust when I’m doing some repairs, but that’s about it. And I always wear a mask for that too. Nothing out of the ordinary. Unless… my neighbor was burning leaves yesterday. Does that count? But I wasn't even outside.
DOCTOR: Okay. Leaf smoke is a potential irritant, but unlikely to cause this. Do you have a fever, or any chills?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not that I've checked, but I haven't felt sick or anything. No chills, either. Just… this breathing thing. It's just… frustrating. I just want to be able to do my job without feeling like I'm going to pass out, you know? I haven't felt any pain or anything like that. Just… tired and a little breathless. It’s just… weird. I really don’t understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Considering your symptoms—the gradual onset of shortness of breath, the wheezing I heard, the slightly low oxygen levels—and given your history, I'm concerned about the possibility of asthma or COPD. It's also possible this is related to some kind of infection, though you don't have a fever right now. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test. The X-ray will help us rule out any other issues in your lungs, and the pulmonary function test will measure how well your lungs are working. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? And… a test? I don't like tests. Are they… painful? And… what if it's something bad? I just want to be able to breathe again, you know? I don't want to know if I have some… serious illness. I just want some medicine to make it stop. Is there… is there anything else we can do? I really don't like the sound of tests. My wife is going to kill me if I have to go back for more appointments.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Chayer. Tests can be unsettling, and it's natural to worry about the results. The X-ray is painless – it’s just a quick picture of your lungs. The pulmonary function test involves breathing into a machine – it doesn’t hurt, but it does require some effort. These tests are the best way to determine what’s causing your shortness of breath, and to make sure we’re giving you the right treatment. Without knowing the cause, we could be masking a more serious problem. I can prescribe you an inhaler to help with your breathing right now, but it’s just a temporary fix. It won't address the underlying issue. Do you have insurance that would cover these tests?
PATIENT: No… no insurance. I… we haven’t been able to afford it. That’s… that’s why I haven’t really gone to the doctor much. I just… I don’t know what to do. I can’t afford tests. And even if I could, I don’t want to know if it’s something bad. I just want this to stop. I’m a water plant operator, you know? I need to be able to breathe to do my job. I… I just want to go home. Is there anything else you can do? Anything at all? An inhaler… is that the only option? I… I don’t know what to do. My wife is going to be so worried.
DOCTOR: I understand. Lack of insurance makes things much more difficult. Given your financial situation, and the fact that you are experiencing some shortness of breath, I can prescribe you a trial of an inhaler, as you requested. It's a bronchodilator, which helps to open up your airways. We’ll start with a commonly used one, albuterol. However, it’s important to understand that this is not a long-term solution. If your symptoms don't improve after a week, or if they get worse, you must come back to see me. I will also give you a referral to the local free clinic. They may be able to provide you with the tests you need at a reduced cost or even for free. They can also connect you with resources for health insurance. Here is a prescription for albuterol. Use it as directed. And please, don't hesitate to come back if things don’t improve. Do you have any questions about the inhaler or the referral?
PATIENT: Okay… albuterol. I can try that. And… a free clinic? I didn't know there was one. That… that might be helpful. My wife will be glad to hear that. Um… how do I use the inhaler? I’ve never used one before. And… what if it doesn’t work? What if it is something bad? I… I just want to be able to breathe normally again. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate you trying to help. I really do. I just… I'm scared. And I don’t want my wife to worry. I just want to go home now. Can I go?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Chayer. It's understandable to be scared, and I'm here to help in any way I can. Here's a pamphlet with instructions on how to use the inhaler. The nurse will also go over it with you before you leave. Essentially, you shake the inhaler, exhale fully, put the mouthpiece in your mouth, and press down on the canister while inhaling slowly and deeply. If the inhaler doesn't improve your symptoms within a week, or if you experience any new symptoms, please come back immediately. We'll reassess the situation and explore other options. Let’s have the nurse show you how to use the inhaler, and we’ll get you on your way. Please, try to get some rest and focus on your breathing. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I… I just want to go home to my wife. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Chayer. Get home safely to your wife, and please, don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Take care. .
