DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it's rather embarrassing, to be frank. I don’t usually… bother with doctors, you understand. But it’s something I simply must have looked at. It’s a… discharge. A rather unpleasant one, I assure you. From… down there. My son insisted I come. He worries too much, naturally.
DOCTOR: Right. A discharge. And how long has this been going on, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… at least a week, I suppose. Perhaps a little longer. It’s difficult to say precisely. I haven’t been… actively monitoring it, if you understand. It just sort of… appeared. And it’s not getting any better, which is why I’m here, despite my better judgement. Honestly, the things one has to endure these days…
DOCTOR: Can you describe the discharge for me, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: Well… it's not… normal. Not at all. It’s… yellowish, mostly. And rather… thick. Not watery, thank goodness. And there’s a… a smell. A rather unpleasant smell, I must say. I’ve been using… feminine hygiene products, of course, but they don’t seem to be helping much. It’s just… quite bothersome, really. It's making me quite self-conscious, if you must know.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any other symptoms, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, yes. A little. There's a slight… burning sensation, when I… well, when I use the facilities. It’s not excruciating, mind you, just… uncomfortable. And a bit of itching, too. Not constant, but… present. Honestly, Doctor, it's just a dreadful mess. I haven’t felt this… unclean in years.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your vaginal odor recently, aside from the unpleasant smell you've already mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, definitely. It’s… fishy, actually. A rather distinct fishy odor. Not all the time, but it comes and goes. It’s quite… distressing, I assure you. My son, bless his heart, suggested it might be something… serious. He reads too many things on the internet, that boy. Still, it’s enough to make one worry, isn't it? I've always been very… fastidious about my hygiene, so it's quite shocking, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. I'm going to need to perform a pelvic exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. We'll need to rule out a few possibilities. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… that’s rather unpleasant. A pelvic exam? Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t had one of those in… decades. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn't we simply try some… medication? Perhaps an ointment or something? I really do dislike being… poked and prodded. It’s quite… invasive, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, while I understand your reluctance, a physical exam is necessary to properly diagnose the cause of your symptoms. Simply prescribing medication without knowing the underlying issue would be irresponsible – and potentially harmful. It's a standard procedure, and I assure you, I will be as gentle as possible. It’s the only way to determine if this is a simple infection, or something more concerning. We need to rule out things like bacterial vaginosis, yeast infection, or even STIs. Do you understand?
PATIENT: STIs?! Oh, good heavens, no! Absolutely not. I’ve… I’ve never! My late husband and I were… devoted, you understand. Very devoted. I would never. I mean… this must be something simple, surely? A little irritation, perhaps? I use a lovely scented soap, you know. Perhaps it's a reaction to that? Really, Doctor, I'd prefer to avoid anything… invasive if at all possible. It's quite… undignified.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, while I appreciate your reassurance, it's important to be thorough. A negative history doesn't always rule out certain possibilities. And while scented soaps can cause irritation, your symptoms – the discharge, the odor, the burning, the itching – are concerning enough to warrant a proper examination. I understand your discomfort, but refusing a simple exam based on… preferences… is not in your best interest. I will explain everything step-by-step, and we can proceed at your pace. However, I need to assess the situation firsthand. Do you consent to the examination, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. This is all rather… overwhelming. Very overwhelming. And… undignified. I suppose… if you insist. But you must promise me you’ll be very gentle. And quick. Very quick. And please, explain everything as you go. I don’t like surprises. And I’d prefer if… if you didn’t have any… male colleagues present. I’m rather… sensitive, you see. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wartick. I assure you, I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. We're alone in the room, and I will explain each step before I proceed. Let's begin by having you lie on the examination table in the stirrups. I'll need you to relax your legs. Do you need assistance getting situated?
PATIENT: Oh, gracious. Stirrups? I haven’t been in stirrups in… well, a very long time. Assistance would be most appreciated, thank you. My knees aren’t what they used to be, you understand. And please, be quick about it. This is all very… unsettling. I feel quite vulnerable, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. I’m going to begin by visually inspecting the external genitalia. Then I'll use a speculum to gently open the vaginal canal, allowing me to examine the cervix. This may cause some mild discomfort, but it shouldn't be painful. Please let me know if you feel any sharp or intense pain at any point. I will then collect a sample to be sent to the lab for testing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, "mild discomfort," you say? That’s hardly reassuring. A speculum? It sounds… dreadful. And a sample? What sort of sample? Honestly, Doctor, this is all very unpleasant. Are you certain there isn’t anything else we can try? Perhaps a cream? Or a strong antibiotic? I really do dislike the sound of all this… poking and prodding. And please, don't rush. I’m rather… easily startled.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I understand your anxiety, but I have explained why a physical exam and lab work are necessary. We need to identify the cause of your symptoms before we can determine the appropriate treatment. Prescribing medication blindly could mask the underlying issue and potentially lead to more serious complications. The sample I’ll be collecting is a vaginal swab – a small cotton swab used to collect cells for analysis. It’s quick and relatively painless. Are you prepared for me to proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, a "small cotton swab," you say? That sounds… less dreadful, I suppose. But please, be gentle. Very gentle. And quickly. I really do dislike being… examined. It feels quite… immodest. And please, explain everything as you go. I like to know what's happening. Don't just… do things without warning. Is that alright? And try not to make any… surprising noises. I'm rather sensitive, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. I’m going to gently insert the speculum into your vagina. You may feel some pressure, but it should not be painful. I will then slowly open the speculum to visualize your cervix. I’ll be looking for any signs of inflammation, discharge, or abnormalities. I will explain each step as I go. Take a few deep breaths, and try to relax. Here we go… You’re doing very well, Ms. Wartick. Just a little more pressure now…
PATIENT: Oh! Oh dear! That is rather cold! And… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. Are you certain you’ve lubricated it properly? It feels… dry. And… tight. Very tight. Honestly, Doctor, this is quite distressing. I don’t think I like this at all. Are you absolutely certain this is necessary? It feels like… like a violation. Please, be gentle! Very, very gentle. And hurry, please, hurry!
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wartick. I apologize if that was uncomfortable. You’re right to tell me. I’ll apply a bit more lubricant and proceed much more slowly. It’s important to me that you feel safe and comfortable. I can stop at any time if you prefer. It appears there may be some vaginal dryness contributing to the discomfort. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and we’ll take breaks as needed. Just breathe deeply. Just a little bit more… How does that feel?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh, no! That’s… worse! Very much worse! It feels like… like a pinching sensation! And a burning! Stop, please, stop! I can’t… I can’t tolerate that! Honestly, Doctor, this is excruciating! I told you this was a bad idea! I want it out! Out now! I feel quite faint, actually. This is… barbaric! Absolutely barbaric! I demand you stop immediately! I am not consenting to this anymore! Stop!
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wartick, okay. I am stopping immediately. I apologize for the discomfort. It appears this is simply not tolerable for you at this time. Please sit up slowly. I’ll get you a cool cloth and some water. We will discontinue the examination. Can you get Ms. Wartick a glass of water and a cool compress for her forehead?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. I feel… quite shaken. And humiliated, actually. This has been a dreadful experience. Absolutely dreadful. I don’t think I’ll ever forgive myself for agreeing to this. And I certainly won’t be coming back. Never! I just want to go home. And lie down. And forget this ever happened. Honestly, Doctor, this is… simply unacceptable. Unacceptable!
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. I understand your distress, and I apologize again for the discomfort you experienced. We can arrange for you to be discharged shortly. I will provide you with a summary of our discussion and recommend a referral to a gynecologist who may be able to address your concerns with a more gentle approach. Would you like me to call someone for you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please. Call my son, Edward. He insisted I come here, so he should be informed of this… fiasco. His number is 555-123-4567. Tell him… tell him I’m quite upset. And that I’m never trusting his medical advice again. Never! Honestly, this has been a terrible day. Absolutely terrible. And please, hurry. I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: “Hello, this is Dr. Deschane’s office. I’m calling regarding Jinnie Wartick. She’s here at the clinic today, and she would like to speak with you regarding her visit… Yes, she’s a bit upset and wants to discuss the experience with you.” I'll ensure she has a comfortable discharge summary and the referral information before she leaves. Is there anything else I can do for you at this time, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: No. Just… just get me home. And try to forget this ever happened. Honestly, Doctor, this has been a complete and utter waste of time. And a very unpleasant experience. I'm never trusting a doctor again. Never! Thank you… I suppose. But mostly, I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wartick. I'll have the medical assistant arrange for your transportation. Have a… good day.
