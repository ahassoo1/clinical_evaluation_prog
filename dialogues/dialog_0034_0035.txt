DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor Seil. It’s lovely to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… goodness, I think it’s been three days now. Just keep coming and coming, and it’s getting a bit tiresome, to be honest. Not dangerous, I don’t think, but certainly annoying!
DOCTOR: I understand. Three days of hiccups is quite bothersome. And you’re right to want to get it checked out. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe the hiccups themselves?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. Well, they're… regular, I suppose. Not a crazy fast pattern, but pretty consistent. They feel like a normal hiccup, you know? That little jerk in your chest and then… hic! …there it is. Happens when I'm sitting, standing, even sometimes when I’m just relaxing in my chair. Doesn’t seem to be triggered by anything in particular, which is what’s strange. I haven’t been eating anything unusual, and I’m not nervous about anything I can think of. It’s just… hic! …there. Do you need me to, like, make them happen? I can usually get one going if I think about it too hard.
DOCTOR: No, no need to force one, Ms. Sucich. That’s helpful to know they aren’t easily triggered, though. And you say they aren’t associated with anything specific – no sudden changes in temperature, eating quickly, or feeling stressed?
PATIENT: No, not that I've noticed. I eat at a pretty steady pace, always have. I had a lovely, cool glass of mango juice yesterday, but that didn't seem to do it, and I've had mango juice before with no problems. Temperature's been fairly consistent here in town too, hasn’t been much change. Honestly, Doctor, I’m usually a pretty calm person. Worked with folks for years, you need to be! I don’t feel stressed, not any more than usual. Maybe a little frustrated with the hiccups themselves, but that’s it. It’s just… odd. I’ve never had them go on this long before.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. Persistent hiccups can be quite puzzling when there isn’t an obvious cause. To get a better picture of what might be happening, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no cough. My appetite’s been normal, maybe a little less because I don’t want to trigger them, but I’m still eating. No nausea or vomiting. Bowels are regular, if you don’t mind me saying so. I sleep alright, though hic! …they do wake me up sometimes. Oh! And my tummy feels a little bloated, now that you mention it. Not painful, just… full. Is that important? I mostly just chalked that up to getting older, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful information, Ms. Sucich. The bloating is certainly worth noting. And it’s good to know about the interrupted sleep. Now, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? Well, I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago, no problems since. High blood pressure for a bit, but it’s well-controlled with medication now - a small dose of lisinopril. I had a touch of arthritis in my knees, but that's pretty typical for someone my age, managed with over-the-counter pain relievers when needed. Nothing major, really. I used to be a psychiatric aide, so I’m pretty good about keeping on top of things. And I don’t smoke, haven't for decades, and I only have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Does that sound like a lot?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not a lot at all. Thank you for sharing that with me. And being proactive about your health is excellent. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully! I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Not to food, not to bee stings, nothing. I'm very lucky in that regard, I suppose. My mother, on the other hand, was allergic to everything under the sun. I always figured I’d inherit something, but nope. Clear as a bell. Although… hic! …sometimes I get a little itchy when I use certain soaps, but that’s about it. And that’s not a true allergy, I don’t think. Just sensitive skin.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Okay, Ms. Sucich, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. It will be fairly quick and simple.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m used to being poked and prodded, you know, from my days working in the hospital. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. And don’t worry about the hic! …they might pop up while you’re listening. Wouldn't want you to think it's something serious with my heart!
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Now, I’m just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I notice some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, but no guarding or rigidity. Your abdomen is slightly distended, consistent with your report of bloating. No masses are palpable. Okay, everything seems normal aside from the mild tenderness and distension. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, it seems likely these hiccups are related to some mild gastrointestinal upset. It could be as simple as a bit of trapped gas.
PATIENT: Oh, trapped gas! That doesn't sound too dreadful. I do sometimes feel a bit… puffy, I suppose. It’s just unusual for it to last this long, and to be accompanied by the hiccups. So, what do you recommend, Doctor? Some sort of medicine? Or just wait it out? And is there anything I can do? I don’t like feeling helpless, you know? Is there a particular food I should avoid? Or a position I should sleep in? hic!… Honestly, I'm just hoping it will go away soon. It's starting to wear me down a bit.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Sucich. It's good you're asking what you can do. Since it seems to be related to mild gastrointestinal upset, I recommend a few things. Firstly, we can try an over-the-counter medication like simethicone – that can help to reduce the gas. Secondly, avoiding carbonated beverages and foods known to cause gas – like beans, broccoli, and cabbage – might help. As for positioning, sleeping on your left side can sometimes help with digestion. I also recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals, rather than large ones. Since the hiccups have been persistent for three days, and you've reported some bloating, I'd like to order a simple blood test to rule out any underlying issues – just to be on the safe side. It'll check your electrolyte levels and basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, those are all sensible suggestions, Doctor. I can definitely cut back on the fizzy drinks - I do enjoy a bit of sparkling water now and then. And smaller meals… yes, I suppose that makes sense. I do tend to fill my plate, old habits! And sleeping on my left side… I can give that a try. A blood test… yes, that sounds prudent. Better to be safe than sorry, as they say. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. It’s just… hic! …it's a bit unsettling when your body decides to act like this. But thank you for taking it seriously. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood test? Do I need to fast? Or anything?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sucich. I’m glad you feel comfortable with the plan. For the blood test, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand – meaning no food or drinks other than water. We can schedule it for tomorrow morning, and I’ll give you a requisition form when you leave today. In the meantime, try the simethicone and dietary changes. If the hiccups don’t improve within a week, or if you develop any new symptoms – like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or difficulty breathing – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything, Doctor. Fasting…simethicone… smaller meals… keep an eye out for anything new. hic! …I think I can manage that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, and for not dismissing it as just “a bit of gas!” It really puts my mind at ease. I appreciate your thoroughness. And thank you for your patience with all the… interruptions. I think that’s all for now. I’ll see you tomorrow for the blood test then?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sucich. It's my pleasure to help. And you’re right, it’s always better to investigate things thoroughly. I understand hiccups can be quite bothersome, and I'm glad I could offer some reassurance. Yes, tomorrow morning will be fine. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll be expecting you. In the meantime, try to relax and take things easy. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good afternoon, Ms. Sucich.
PATIENT: Oh, you too, Doctor Seil. Thank you again for everything. I will. And I definitely will take it easy. .
