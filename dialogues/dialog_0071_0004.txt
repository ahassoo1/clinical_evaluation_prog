DOCTOR: Alright, good afternoon. I’m Dr. Galena. So, Teah, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Galena. Just a routine check-up, mostly. My husband, Ben, said it was time I got my shots updated. You know, just keeping on top of things. I don’t always remember what I’ve had, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right, routine check-up and vaccinations. Good on Ben for encouraging that! And don't worry about remembering, that's perfectly common. We can certainly look everything up. Let's start with a general overview… Have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Yeah, I feel pretty good, all things considered. No big complaints! Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who isn’t these days? Work keeps me moving, you know? I’m a construction inspector, so lots of walking around sites, checking things. Nothing I can’t handle, though.
DOCTOR: Construction inspector, that is a lot of walking! Good for you staying active. A little tiredness is understandable then. Just to be thorough, are we talking just regular fatigue after a long day, or is this something new, or more persistent?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s probably just the regular kind. I mean, sometimes it’s a really hot site, and that just knocks the wind out of you. It’s been happening for a while, honestly, as long as I’ve been doing this work. I don’t think it’s worse lately, if that makes sense? Just…normal tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. "Normal tired" from the job… we'll keep that in mind. Now, any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. No aches or pains, no fever, no cough… Everything seems to be working okay. My eyesight's not what it used to be, but that’s just getting older, I guess! I got new glasses last year, so that helps.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. That's good to hear. New glasses are a lifesaver! Now, have you had any significant changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Not really. I tend to stay pretty steady. Maybe a couple of pounds here or there depending on the time of year, but nothing major. I haven’t been sick or anything, so no big changes. Ben keeps telling me I should eat more, though. He worries I’m too thin.
DOCTOR: Ben sounds like a good man, looking out for you. And steady weight is good. Now, I'm just going to go through a quick review of systems. Just a few questions about how different parts of your body are doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Go ahead. I’ll try my best to answer. Sometimes I get a little confused about what exactly you’re asking, but I’ll let you know if I don’t understand.
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright. No need to worry about that at all. Okay, let’s start with your heart. Have you noticed any palpitations, or shortness of breath, or swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No palpitations, thankfully. I’ve always been a little worried about that, with my mom having some heart trouble. No shortness of breath either, even when I’m running around on a job site. And my ankles and feet are okay… Ben sometimes complains his feet swell, but mine haven't been bothering me. They feel normal.
DOCTOR: Good. No swelling, good heart health... that's reassuring. Let's move on to your lungs. Any cough, wheezing, or chest pain?
PATIENT: No cough, no wheezing. And no chest pain. I used to smoke a long time ago, when I was younger and… well, let’s just say not very smart. But I quit about twenty years ago, and my lungs feel fine. I haven’t had any trouble breathing, even with all the dust on the construction sites. I try to wear a mask, though. Ben makes sure of that.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, quitting twenty years ago is a big accomplishment. And wearing a mask on the job site is very wise. Alright, let's talk about your digestive system. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Um… not really. Everything’s pretty regular, if you know what I mean. I eat a lot of salmon, if that helps. Ben’s Tlingit too, so we eat a lot of traditional foods. It keeps things moving, I guess. No pain or anything like that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That sounds good, a healthy diet is very important. Alright, now let's move on to your urinary system. Any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning. Everything’s working okay down there, if you don't mind me saying so. I’m not getting any younger, but thankfully that part still works! No trouble at all.
DOCTOR: Good, good. No urinary issues. And finally, just a quick question about your neurological system – any headaches, dizziness, numbness, or weakness?
PATIENT: No major headaches, thankfully. Maybe a little tension sometimes, if I've been staring at paperwork all day, but nothing I can’t handle with a cup of tea. No dizziness, no numbness, and no weakness. I’m still pretty strong for my age, if I do say so myself. I still help Ben with some of the heavier lifting around the house.
DOCTOR: That's all good to hear. Alright, Teah. Before we move on to the physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I had chickenpox when I was a kid, like everyone else. I broke my wrist once, when I was younger, clumsy as could be. And I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago, but that was pretty routine. I don't really have any other major medical problems. No diabetes, no high blood pressure, nothing like that. My mom had some heart trouble, like I mentioned before, and my dad had arthritis, but I haven't had any trouble with either of those, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful to know. Any surgeries besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. Nothing else. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. I try to stay active and eat healthy, like my mom always told me. And Ben keeps a close eye on me too, making sure I don't push myself too hard. He’s a good man.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve been very mindful of your health. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a little bit of ibuprofen sometimes, if I’ve got a headache, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed, nothing regular. I try to avoid taking pills as much as possible, if I can help it. I prefer to just rest and drink some tea. Ben’s got all sorts of herbal remedies, but I don’t really trust those, to be honest. I stick with the basics.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. And just to be complete, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I can eat pretty much anything. Ben's family is really good at foraging for food, and I've never had any trouble with anything they've brought back. I did get stung by a bee once when I was a kid, but that was just a normal reaction, no swelling or anything like that. I don't think I'm allergic to anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Teah. Alright, well, I think we’ve covered most of the basics. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just checking your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a few other things. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Go ahead. I’m a little bit nervous about getting shots, but I know it’s important. Just let me know if it’s going to hurt!
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll let you know. We can take it slow. First, let’s just listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, your heart sounds regular, a normal rate and rhythm. Lungs are clear on both sides, good breath sounds. Blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is good. Now, let's just check your reflexes. Can you please extend your arms out in front of you?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? Is there anything else I need to do? I sometimes forget what you’re asking, so just let me know.
DOCTOR: Perfect, that’s good. Reflexes are normal. And now, just a quick look in your ears and throat. Open wide for me, please.
PATIENT: Aaaah… Is everything alright? It’s kind of hard to open my mouth that wide, if you don’t mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: Everything looks good, ears are clear, throat is normal. No signs of infection. Alright, Teah, physical exam is complete. Everything seems to be in good working order. Now, let's talk about vaccinations. Based on your age and medical history, I recommend a tetanus booster, a flu shot, and a pneumonia vaccine. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That's… a lot of shots. I really don’t like shots, Dr. Galena. But I guess if you think it's important… What’s the difference between them? And will they hurt a lot? Ben always says I’m a big baby when it comes to needles.
DOCTOR: I understand, it’s perfectly alright to be nervous. They are important to help protect you against serious illnesses. The tetanus booster protects against a bacterial infection, especially important if you're working with construction. The flu shot helps prevent the flu, which can be particularly dangerous for older adults. And the pneumonia vaccine helps protect against pneumonia, a lung infection. As for the pain, it's usually just a quick pinch, and it doesn’t last long. We can do them one at a time if you’d prefer, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. Would you like me to explain any of them in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay. That makes a little more sense. Construction sites are dirty. Maybe the tetanus one is a good idea. The flu… I got the flu really bad a few years ago. That was awful. Okay, maybe all of them. But please, go easy on me! And can you tell me which arm is going to hurt the least? Ben always says my left arm is weaker.
DOCTOR: Alright, we'll get through this. I'll start with the tetanus shot in your left arm, just as Ben suggested. Then we’ll do the flu shot, and finally the pneumonia vaccine in your right arm. I'll use the smallest needle possible, and I’ll be as quick and gentle as I can. Just take a deep breath, and relax your arm. This might sting for a moment...
PATIENT: Okay… okay… just do it quickly, please. Oh! That wasn't so bad. But hurry up with the next one!
DOCTOR: Alright, all done! That wasn’t too bad, was it?
PATIENT: That was…a lot. I think my arms are going to be sore for a week. But… it’s done. Thank you, Dr. Galena. You were really gentle, even if it did sting a little. Is there anything else I need to do? Like, should I avoid lifting anything heavy? Or anything like that?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teah. You did great! Your arms might be a little sore for a day or two, but it should subside. Just avoid any strenuous activity for the rest of today, and you can use a cold compress if it helps. Otherwise, just keep an eye on it. Any redness, swelling, or fever, let me know. Now, I recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment in six months for another check-up. And Ben can remind you when it’s time for your next flu shot. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Ben is really good at keeping track of those things. He makes a whole chart with everyone’s appointments and shots. I’ll let him know about the follow-up. Well, I guess that’s everything. Thank you again, Dr. Galena. You were very kind and patient with me. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Teah. It was a pleasure meeting you. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day! .
