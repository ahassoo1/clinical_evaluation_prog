DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Oriley, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Oriley. Though, honestly, these forms… so much paperwork for a simple check-up. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: Look, I didn’t make the forms. It’s… standard procedure. Now, if we could just get to why you’re here today, that would be helpful. Are you experiencing any specific issues, or is this just a routine visit?
PATIENT: Routine, I suppose. Though, my… associate insisted. Something about needing to be “certified” for… well, I don’t recall the specifics. It’s all rather bureaucratic, isn’t it? I haven’t noticed anything particularly wrong, not that I’m aware of. My ears seem to be functioning adequately, and I can still read the newspaper, though the print is getting smaller these days. Perhaps that's just age.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no complaints, specifically. Just… pressure from someone else. Hmm. And how long have you been feeling… adequately?
PATIENT: “Feeling adequately?” A rather odd way to phrase it, Doctor. I suppose… for as long as I can remember. Which, admittedly, isn’t always a great length of time. Let’s say… the last few months have been adequate. Before that… honestly, it all blurs together. It’s the nature of things, I suspect. Though, I do recall a rather unpleasant ringing in my ears a while back, but that might have been the neighbor’s dog. A dreadful yapper, that one.
DOCTOR: Ringing in the ears… and when was this ringing, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking me to pinpoint dates. That’s… difficult. It was… last year, I believe? Or perhaps the year before? It wasn’t constant, just… intermittent. It would come and go. I mostly ignored it. One gets used to a certain level of… irritation in life, don’t you think? It was probably nothing. Though, it was quite bothersome when I was trying to enjoy a quiet evening with a good book. I really can't recall the specifics.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me see… well, my wife left some years ago, which was a change, I suppose. A rather unwelcome one. And I’ve had to adjust to living alone, which requires… a certain amount of self-sufficiency. Aside from that… no, not that I recall. My vision feels… somewhat diminished, perhaps. But again, that could simply be age. I used to have remarkably sharp eyesight. I was quite the marksman in my youth. Though, that was a long time ago. Do you need me to be more specific? It's all rather hazy, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Let’s move on to your past medical history, then. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… hmm. I’ve seen doctors, of course. One accumulates a certain number of visits over sixty years. But diagnosed… I honestly can’t recall. I believe I had a bout of… something… a few years back. Perhaps a chest infection? It required antibiotics, I think. And I had a rather nasty fall last winter, but it was just a sprained wrist, nothing serious. My memory for these things isn’t what it used to be. I’m generally a rather healthy individual, though. I’ve always taken pride in my constitution. Though, now that I think of it, my associate did mention something about needing to rule out any… neurological issues. Do you have any idea what that entails? It all sounds rather ominous.
DOCTOR: Right. No major diagnoses noted here, thankfully. And no neurological concerns flagged previously. Let's do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline, shall we?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Very well. Though I must say, I’m not particularly fond of being prodded and poked. I trust you’ll be gentle? And please, try not to take too much of my time. I have… commitments, you understand. What exactly will this involve? I’d like to have a clear understanding of the procedure. And do you have a comfortable chair? My back isn’t what it used to be, either.
DOCTOR: Standard procedure, Mr. Oriley. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, look in your ears and eyes… the usual. And yes, there’s a chair. Please, just sit. We’ll get this over with quickly. First, let's check your blood pressure. Relax your arm, please.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must say, I find this entire process rather… impersonal. One used to receive a more thorough examination in my day. Still, if you insist. Though, I do hope this cuff isn’t too tight. My circulation isn’t what it used to be. And please, be careful. I bruise easily. Do you have any experience with elderly patients?
DOCTOR: 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally, though slightly diminished breath sounds.
PATIENT: Diminished breath sounds? That doesn’t sound particularly encouraging, does it? Is that something I should be worried about? Perhaps I’ve been spending too much time indoors. My associate is quite insistent that I remain… sheltered. She’s rather protective, you see. Though, it does lead to a certain degree of… stagnation. Is there anything you can prescribe for… stagnation? Or perhaps a tonic for diminished breath sounds?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily cause for alarm, Mr. Oriley. Diminished breath sounds can be common with age, and as you mentioned, limited activity. We can discuss some breathing exercises, and I might suggest a short course of bronchodilator if it bothers you. But let's finish the exam first. Now, let's check your reflexes.
PATIENT: A hammer? Are you quite sure that’s necessary? I’ve always been rather sensitive. And I have a rather low pain threshold, I must confess. I’d prefer to avoid any unnecessary… percussive stimulation, if possible. Perhaps we could simply… discuss my reflexes? I’m certain I have perfectly adequate reflexes for a man of my age. Though, I do sometimes forget where I’ve placed my spectacles. Does that count as a diminished reflex?
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, with all due respect, a quick reflex check is standard procedure. It helps assess your nerve function. It won’t be painful. Just relax. Hmm. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Normal. Now, let’s check your cranial nerves. Follow my finger with your eyes… don’t move your head.
PATIENT: Cranial nerves? This is becoming increasingly… invasive, isn’t it? I’m starting to feel quite… exposed. And my eyes are rather dry. Perhaps I should have brought my lubricating drops. Though, I can’t recall if I even have lubricating drops. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. Are you quite certain this is all necessary? I’m beginning to suspect my associate has… exaggerated my symptoms. She tends to do that. A rather anxious woman, you see. Is there any way we can expedite this process? Perhaps we could simply… sign off on it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, with all due respect, I’m trying to conduct a basic examination. Your associate mentioned concerns about possible neurological issues. Skipping steps won't address those concerns. Now, let's at least look in your ears and eyes. This will only take a moment. Please open your mouth and say "Ah."
PATIENT: Honestly, the indignity of it all. Though, I suppose I should be grateful for your attention. It's just... all this poking and prodding brings back rather unpleasant memories of childhood doctors. They weren’t particularly gentle, I assure you. And my throat is rather dry. Perhaps a glass of water would be helpful? Though, I can't recall if I've had my fill of fluids today. My memory is simply… atrocious. Do proceed, I suppose. But please, be careful with that… instrument. It looks rather menacing.
DOCTOR: Ears appear clear, no signs of infection. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Fundi appear normal. Alright. Everything appears grossly normal. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but no acute concerns. We can discuss some lifestyle modifications – diet, exercise, stress management – to help lower your blood pressure. And I'll write you a prescription for a bronchodilator to try for a week, just in case. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That’s another thing I can’t quite recall. I believe I had a rather unpleasant reaction to something many years ago… a rash, perhaps? Or maybe it was hives. It was rather blurry, honestly. Though, I don’t recall what the medication was. I suppose it doesn’t matter much. My associate handles all my prescriptions. She’s very particular about… interactions. Do you have a list of potential side effects for this… bronchodilator? I’d like to be fully informed before ingesting anything. And please, ensure it doesn't interact with my… dietary supplements. She's quite insistent that I maintain a rigorous supplement regimen. Honestly, it's all rather overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Alright. The bronchodilator can cause some mild side effects – tremor, nervousness, increased heart rate. We’ll start with a low dose. As for interactions, I’ll send the prescription to your associate, and she can cross-reference it with your supplements. Anything else I can address today, Mr. Oriley?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… Yes, actually. My associate also mentioned something about… cognitive testing. She’s convinced my memory is deteriorating at an alarming rate. Though, honestly, I think she's simply… overly anxious. But she’s very insistent. Is that something you offer here? Perhaps a simple questionnaire? Though, I do hope it doesn't involve too much… mental exertion. It’s rather tiring, you know. And please, ensure it's not too… condescending. I have a rather sensitive disposition. Honestly, I'm starting to wish I hadn't come at all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, I can certainly order a basic cognitive assessment. It's a simple test to evaluate your memory and thinking skills. It won’t be strenuous. However, if you're feeling overwhelmed, we can postpone it for another day. We can address the blood pressure and the potential breathing issues now, and revisit the cognitive testing later, if you prefer. What would you like to do?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I suppose… postpone it, then. I'm simply not up to it today. My mind feels rather… foggy, as it is. And honestly, the thought of being… evaluated is rather unsettling. Let’s focus on the blood pressure and the breathing, as you suggested. Though, please, don’t expect any miraculous improvements. I’m afraid I’m simply… getting old. And please, ensure the instructions are very clear. I have a tendency to… misinterpret things. Honestly, this has been rather exhausting. Are we nearly finished?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll write you a prescription for amlodipine 5mg daily for your blood pressure, and albuterol inhaler as needed for breathing. I’ll also send a printout with detailed instructions and potential side effects for both medications. Here you go. And please, follow up with me in a month to discuss your progress. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Amlodipine… albuterol… Honestly, it’s all rather daunting. No, I believe that’s all. Though, perhaps you could remind my associate to schedule the follow-up? She’s terribly busy, you see. And please, thank you for your… patience. It’s not easy dealing with someone of my age. Honestly, I’m simply glad it’s over. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
