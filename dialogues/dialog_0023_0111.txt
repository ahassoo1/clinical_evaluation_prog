DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s…a matter of the complexion, Doctor. I seem to be…darkening. And rather tired, naturally. One does get tired, you know, at my age. Though I assure you, I’ve always kept a rigorous schedule. It’s simply…unbecoming. Let’s get this over with, shall we? I have commitments.
DOCTOR: "Darkening," you say. And you attribute this to…age, primarily?
PATIENT: Primarily, yes. Though, one must consider the sun, of course. Though I assure you, I take precautions. A sensible hat, and so forth. It’s just…it’s not right. And the fatigue…it’s draining. Not that you’d understand. Young people always have energy to spare. Is this going to be a lengthy examination, Doctor? I do have a very particular schedule to maintain.
DOCTOR: We'll need to determine the cause of the "darkening," as you put it, and the fatigue. It's not simply a matter of age, Mr. Drahota. There are many possibilities. Let’s start with a thorough history. Have you noticed any changes in moles or any new growths anywhere on your skin?
PATIENT: Moles? Goodness, no. I wouldn't notice such things. My wife handles all of that. She’s…particular about appearances, you see. Honestly, Doctor, I can't say I’ve been closely inspecting my own skin lately. It seems rather…undignified. Is this truly necessary? Perhaps a stronger tea would suffice? I’ve always found a good oolong to be remarkably restorative.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Mr. Drahota. I understand you’d prefer a simpler solution, but we need to rule out potentially serious causes for these changes. Alright. Let’s move on from the skin for a moment. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this fatigue?
PATIENT: Symptoms… well, there's a general…discomfort. A heaviness, if you will. And I seem to be…less robust than I once was, naturally. One doesn't bounce back as easily. My appetite hasn't been what it once was either, though my wife insists I'm eating perfectly well. She fusses over me, you see. Is this leading somewhere, Doctor? Because frankly, I’m not prone to ailments. It’s simply…a decline. A natural process.
DOCTOR: “Less robust,” heaviness…and a decreased appetite. And your wife believes you are eating adequately, despite your own perception?
PATIENT: Naturally. She's a very…efficient woman. Monitors everything, you see. Diet, exercise… even my social engagements. Honestly, Doctor, I suspect she believes I’m exaggerating. She has a very…practical outlook. It’s… tiresome. Are we nearing the conclusion? I have a luncheon scheduled, and I must be punctual. It's a rather important engagement with… business associates.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. Let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Significant conditions? Goodness, no. I've always been remarkably healthy. A slight cold now and then, perhaps. Nothing of consequence. My wife keeps meticulous records, of course. She’ll remind me if anything was of note. Though honestly, I doubt she will. I've always prided myself on my constitution. Is this truly necessary, Doctor? I feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I need to understand your medical background to properly assess your current condition. Even minor illnesses can be relevant. Have you ever had any surgeries, even something seemingly small?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Hmm… let me see. There was something, decades ago. A minor procedure, I believe. Appendicitis, perhaps? Or was it…gallstones? Honestly, it was so long ago, and so insignificant, that I’ve quite forgotten. My wife would know, naturally. She remembers everything. I assure you, Doctor, it was hardly worth mentioning. Can we please move on? This is becoming quite tedious.
DOCTOR: We will verify with your wife. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications? Goodness, no. I believe in maintaining a natural constitution. A sensible diet and regular exercise, that's all one needs. Though, my wife occasionally insists on a multivitamin. She's rather…fussy about preventative measures. Honestly, it's probably just marketing nonsense. Can we conclude this, Doctor? I feel perfectly capable of self-diagnosis, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. Let’s briefly discuss your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. They passed away… some time ago. A long time ago. My mother, I believe, succumbed to…well, I don't recall precisely. A general decline, I think. My father…something with the heart, perhaps? Honestly, it was decades ago, and I wasn't particularly close to either of them. My wife might remember more details, but she tends to dwell on the past, and I find it…unproductive. Can we please be done with this now? I have a luncheon awaiting.
DOCTOR: Very well. One final question for now. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! I am a respectable businessman! Do you take me for some sort of…dissolute individual? I maintain a strict regimen, as I’ve already explained. A glass of sherry with dinner on occasion, perhaps, but nothing more. And certainly no… recreational pursuits. Honestly, Doctor, the very suggestion is…insulting. Now, may I be excused? I am quite certain I’ve answered all your…probing questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. I've documented your responses. Now, with your permission, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination. It will allow me to assess your condition more accurately. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: A physical examination? Honestly, Doctor, I hardly think it's necessary. I assure you, I'm perfectly healthy. But… very well. If it will expedite matters. But be quick about it. I have a luncheon awaiting. And please, no probing. I’m a man of… dignity. But do try not to take up too much of my time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll start with your vital signs. Blood pressure is 148/92. Elevated. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Abdomen is soft, but there is some mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant. No rebound tenderness or guarding. Peripheral pulses are present, but weak. Skin appears slightly hyperpigmented, particularly on the hands and face. No obvious lesions or masses. I’ve completed the examination. Your blood pressure is elevated, and your heart sounds are slightly diminished. The hyperpigmentation is noted. The abdominal tenderness is of mild concern, though not immediately alarming.
PATIENT: Well? What does it all mean? Is it serious? I knew I shouldn’t have bothered. My wife will say, “I told you so.” Honestly, Doctor, I don’t have time for vague pronouncements. I have a luncheon. And please, don’t tell me I need to change my diet. I eat perfectly well, thank you very much. Just give me a straight answer. Is it anything to be concerned about? And can I finally be excused?
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, based on this preliminary examination, I can’t give you a definitive diagnosis without further investigation. Your elevated blood pressure is concerning and needs to be addressed. The mild tenderness in your right upper quadrant could indicate a number of things—possibly related to the liver or gallbladder. The hyperpigmentation is also something we need to investigate. Given your age and these findings, I recommend a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a liver function test, and a CT scan of the abdomen. This will help us rule out any serious underlying conditions. I also strongly advise you to monitor your blood pressure at home. I can provide instructions. And while I understand you prefer to maintain your current lifestyle, some dietary and lifestyle modifications may be necessary depending on the results of these tests. I'm also concerned about the fatigue and decreased appetite. These could be symptoms of a more serious underlying condition. Finally, you have a family history of unspecified illness. I want to speak with your wife to clarify this. I need her permission, of course. I believe it is essential to gain a comprehensive understanding of your medical background.
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I will not subject my wife to your…probing questions. And I certainly will not undergo a battery of tests based on a few superficial observations. This is preposterous! Honestly, Doctor, I’ve wasted enough time here already. I’m perfectly capable of managing my own health. I have always been a robust and vigorous individual, and I intend to remain so. I’ll take my chances, thank you very much. Good day, Doctor. And please, don’t bother sending me any bills. I fully expect this entire consultation to be considered a…waste of both our time. .
