DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Rowbottom. Welcome. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about my… well, my going to the bathroom. There was blood. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to notice. It’s not right, is it? A man my age shouldn’t be seeing that.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Blood in the stool is definitely something we want to investigate. To get a better picture of what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Investigate? Like I said, it's not right. Honestly, doctors these days. Always needing to “investigate.” It was just… there. Red. Like cherry juice, almost. And it wasn’t every time, you understand. Just… sometimes. Mostly after a good steak, if I recall.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize if I sounded dismissive. You’re right, it’s not normal to see blood in your stool, and we do need to figure out what’s causing it. When you say “mostly after a good steak,” does that mean it happens pretty consistently when you eat red meat?
PATIENT: Consistently? Hmm. No, not exactly consistently. More like… often. When it’s a really good cut. And well-done, of course. Can’t be eating anything rare at my age. Ruins the digestion, you know. It’s just… sometimes after the steak, sometimes not. It’s very confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay, sometimes after a well-done steak. And you said it’s not every time. Has this been happening for a long time, or is this a new thing?
PATIENT: New, mostly. It's been...oh, maybe a month, two at the most? I didn't pay much attention at first, thought it was something I ate. But then it happened again, and again… started to worry it was something serious. Though I doubt it. Probably just getting old. Everything falls apart eventually, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It's good you came in to get it checked out, Mr. Rowbottom. Even if it is something minor, it's always best to be sure. Now, besides the blood, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What does that mean? Look, I go to the bathroom when I need to go to the bathroom. Is that what you're asking? It's not like it's a regular clock, you know. Sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's...difficult. But that's just age again, I presume. Honestly, you doctors and your fancy questions.
DOCTOR: You're right to question me, Mr. Rowbottom. I apologize if I'm using confusing language. By "bowel habits," I just meant have you noticed any changes in how often you go, or the shape or consistency of your stool—aside from the blood, of course. Like, has it been more watery than usual, or harder to pass?
PATIENT: Watery? Heavens no. I’ve always had… solid stools. That’s a good thing, isn’t it? Though sometimes, if I don’t drink enough water, it can be… firm. Very firm. And sometimes, well, it's broken into pieces. But that’s the steak, I figure. The quality isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, solid, sometimes firm, occasionally broken up, especially after steak. Have you noticed any pain or discomfort in your abdomen, or when you're having a bowel movement?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain. A bit of a grumble sometimes. Like an old engine trying to start. And a bit of… pushing. It takes a bit more effort than it used to. But I wouldn’t call it pain. A man my age has aches and pains everywhere. It’s just part of life, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any unintentional weight loss recently, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. I haven't been trying to lose weight. I enjoy a good meal, you know. But… now that you mention it, my trousers have been feeling a bit looser. Could be the heat, though. Everything shrinks in the heat. I haven't bothered to check, honestly. Too much trouble with the scales.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, potentially some weight loss, looser trousers. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Health conditions? Goodness me, what doesn't ache after 88 years? I had a bad knee once, years ago, playing football. And my back isn’t what it used to be. And the doctor told me my blood pressure was a bit high, back in ‘98, I think. But I haven’t been to see a doctor regularly. Waste of time, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. High blood pressure in ‘98. Do you recall if you were ever put on any medication for that?
PATIENT: Medication? Let me see… vaguely. Yes, I think so. A little white pill, I believe. But it made me feel sluggish. So I stopped taking it. My wife, bless her soul, she kept nagging me about it, but I felt perfectly fine without it. Honestly, I never trusted those pills. Too many side effects, I always thought.
DOCTOR: Alright, medication for high blood pressure discontinued due to side effects. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I get a bit of a sniffle sometimes in the spring, but that’s just the pollen. And I once had a rash after eating some shellfish, but that was 60 years ago. I’ve eaten shellfish plenty of times since then without any trouble. I’m a fairly robust man, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known significant allergies. Now, just a couple more questions. Are you currently taking any vitamins, supplements, or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Vitamins? Oh, sometimes I take those… what are they called? The ones with the fish oil. For my brain, you see. Helps with the… remembering. Though it doesn’t seem to be working very well, does it? And I take a little something for my joints. Glucosamine, I think it’s called. Bought it at the drugstore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fish oil and glucosamine. Now, Mr. Rowbottom, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to listen to your abdomen, and check for any tenderness. And I’d like to do a quick rectal exam as well, just to assess the area and look for any obvious sources of bleeding. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A rectal exam?! At my age? Really, Doctor? I came in here because of a little blood, not to have you… poking around. No. Absolutely not. I don’t see the need for that at all. It’s… undignified. I think I’ve answered all your questions.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize if I’ve made you feel uneasy. You are absolutely right to voice your concerns. A rectal exam is often helpful in these situations, but it's entirely your decision. However, without a proper examination, it’s difficult to determine the cause of the bleeding. Given your age and the reported unintentional weight loss, it’s important to rule out more serious possibilities. I can order a stool test to check for blood, which is a less invasive first step. And I strongly recommend a colonoscopy to visualize the colon and identify any potential issues. Would you be willing to consider those options?
PATIENT: A stool test… that I can manage. I suppose. But a colonoscopy? Sounds… unpleasant. And expensive, no doubt. I’m not insured, you know. I don’t like the sound of that at all. What exactly will the stool test tell you? And how long will that take? Honestly, I just want this sorted out.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost and the procedure, Mr. Rowbottom. The stool test, also called a fecal occult blood test, checks for hidden blood in your stool. It won't tell us where the blood is coming from, but it will confirm if there is blood present that we need to investigate further. If the stool test is positive, a colonoscopy would be the next step. It allows us to directly visualize the colon and identify any polyps, inflammation, or other abnormalities. We can often remove polyps during the colonoscopy, which can prevent them from becoming cancerous. I can discuss financial assistance options with you. There may be programs available to help cover the cost of the colonoscopy. Let's start with the stool test. I'll give you a kit to take home. You'll collect a small sample, and then bring it back to the lab. It usually takes a few days to get the results. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. A stool test. Just the stool test, for now. No poking and prodding, understand? And you’d better tell me what this financial assistance is all about. I’m not paying a fortune for this. I lived a frugal life, you know. Don’t need fancy tests just because I’m getting old. Give me the kit, then. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. Just the stool test for now. And I will absolutely discuss the financial assistance options with the billing department and get you some information. Here's the kit. It comes with detailed instructions, but basically you’ll collect a small sample of your stool at home and bring it back to the lab. The lab results usually take 3-5 business days. I’ll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any significant changes in your symptoms – such as increased bleeding, severe abdominal pain, or dizziness – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions about the instructions, or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Instructions... probably complicated. I’ll figure it out. And no, I don’t think so. Just… get it over with. And don’t bother me unless it’s important. I’ve got things to do, you know. Gardening. It’s good exercise. Right then. Goodbye, Doctor. And don’t expect miracles.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. You take care of yourself and enjoy your gardening. We'll be in touch with the results. And please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
