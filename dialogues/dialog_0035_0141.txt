DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this itching. Everywhere, really. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Maybe a month? It’s just… annoying, you know? And it doesn't seem to be going away.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Itching that's been going on for a few weeks. That is annoying. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not… like a rash, exactly. My skin just feels itchy. There's no bumps, or anything red. Just… a constant need to scratch. It’s worse at night, I think. Keeps me up sometimes. And it doesn’t seem to be one specific spot, it’s all over. Arms, legs, back… even my scalp. I’ve tried lotions, you know, just regular moisturizer, but nothing really helps for long.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a generalized itching, no visible rash, worse at night, and not relieved by moisturizers. And it’s been going on for about a month. Let me just pull up your chart here… I see you’re 53, and your height and weight are listed as 188 centimeters and 145 kilograms. Do you have any known allergies, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Dust, mostly. And certain pollens in the spring. Nothing too serious, though. I just get a little sniffly and my eyes water. Oh, and I think I’m allergic to cats – definitely stay away from those! It's just… this itching is different than allergy stuff. It’s not… seasonal, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, dust and seasonal pollens, and cats. And you're right, this itching sounds different from typical allergy symptoms. Are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just some vitamins, Doctor. A daily multivitamin and Vitamin D, because the winters here are long and gloomy. Nothing else. I had blood pressure medication for a while, years ago, but the doctor took me off it when I lost some weight.
DOCTOR: Alright. Multivitamin and Vitamin D, previously on blood pressure medication but no longer. Now, let’s talk about your medical history a bit. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And I broke my arm when I was playing hockey, also when I was younger. Nothing major since then, really. I had pneumonia once, but that was… oh, maybe fifteen years ago? My wife… she passed away a few years ago, if that’s what you mean by medical history. It was… difficult.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. That must have been incredibly difficult. Okay, so appendix removal as a child, broken arm, and pneumonia about fifteen years ago. Do you have any family history of skin conditions – eczema, psoriasis, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My mother had some… arthritis, I think. And my father had heart problems. But no one, as far as I remember, ever had anything with their skin. My wife… she had good skin, always took care of herself. It's hard to think straight sometimes, you know? It’s been a while since I thought about this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. Okay, no family history of skin conditions. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. Always hated the smell. My wife didn’t smoke either. We were pretty healthy, all things considered. We used to walk a lot, before… well, before. I don’t do much walking anymore, though. It’s… hard to motivate myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing regular, maybe two or three times a week. And it's not a big glass, just a small one. Mostly red wine, if that matters. I don’t really drink to drink, if that makes sense. Just enjoy it with my meal.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional red wine, a small glass with dinner. Alright, Mr. Ferneding, thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to take a look at your skin and see if there’s anything obvious going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want this itching to stop, you know? It's driving me crazy. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's start by looking at your skin all over. I’ll be looking for any signs of rash, dryness, or anything unusual. I don’t see any visible rash or lesions, which is good. The skin does feel a little dry, but not excessively so. No rash here either. Any tenderness or pain when I touch your skin?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. It's just… itchy. Really itchy. It doesn’t really hurt to touch, it just… makes me want to scratch even more. It’s hard to explain. It’s like an itch from the inside out, if that makes sense. Not on the surface.
DOCTOR: Okay, an itch from the inside out… I think I understand. And your scalp?
PATIENT: Yes, my scalp too. It feels the same up there. Itchy, dry… and I’m constantly running my fingers through my hair. It's probably driving me bald at this point! My wife used to tell me I was always messing with my hair. It's... a habit, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it doesn’t seem like there’s an obvious cause for the itching. Since there's no visible rash, and it's generalized, we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be dry skin, even though it doesn’t look excessively dry. Sometimes changes in climate or detergents can cause this. It could also be something internal, like a liver or kidney issue, although you don’t have any other symptoms to suggest that. Or, it could be something neurological. To rule out some of the more serious possibilities, I’d like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your liver and kidney function, and a thyroid panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Whatever it takes to figure this out. Blood work is fine. I just want to stop scratching, you know? It’s driving me crazy. When do I need to go get it done? And… is it going to be expensive? I’m on Medicare.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'll send the lab orders electronically to the lab across the street - they take Medicare. The cost should be covered, but there might be a small co-pay depending on your plan. I'll have the nurse print out a slip with the details just in case. You can go anytime tomorrow. Fasting is not required for these tests. And when we have the results back, which usually takes a couple of days, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on a treatment plan. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a hypoallergenic, fragrance-free moisturizer. Something like Cetaphil or Eucerin. Apply it liberally after you shower. And try to avoid scratching as much as possible, even though I know that’s easier said than done. Does that all sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Thank you. Cetaphil, right? I’ll remember that. And I’ll head to the lab tomorrow. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. It's… nice to talk to someone about it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the lab instructions with you. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just… thank you again. I’ll see you when the results come back. .
DOCTOR: Okay, you have a good day, Mr. Ferneding. And please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
