DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Mitchell. It is good to meet you too. I have… a headache. In the back of my head. It has been there for… a few days now, I think. Maybe a week? It’s not a bad headache, not like falling down bad, but it’s… always there.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mitchell. A headache for about a week, primarily in the back of your head, and it’s a constant, rather than a severe, pain. That’s helpful. Could you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it… it’s not… sharp. More like… a pressure? Like someone is squeezing the back of my skull. Not tight, tight, but… firm. And it sometimes goes up my neck a little. Not always, but sometimes. Does that make sense? I’m not good with… explaining things like this.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mitchell. A pressure at the back of the skull, sometimes radiating up into the neck. We'll get to the bottom of this. Has anything in particular seemed to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Well… nothing really makes it better. Not that I've noticed. It’s there when I wake up, it’s there when I go to bed. Sometimes… when I am working, it feels… a little more. I work with the trains, you see. Lots of… noise. And… shaking. Maybe that makes it worse? I don’t know. I’ve been doing that work for a long time though. It usually doesn’t bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so constant headache, pressure-like, radiating into the neck, and potentially worsened by your work with the trains – the noise and vibration. You’ve been doing this work for a long time without this being an issue, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Long time. Forty years, I think. More than that, maybe. Never had a headache like this before. Usually, if I get a headache, it's from the sun. Or… not enough water. This is… different. And it worries me a little. Not a lot, but… I’m old, you see. Things start to… change. You understand?
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand, Mitchell. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned when something new develops, especially with age. Forty years of train work, and this headache is a new symptom. Now, let's go through some other things to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I… haven’t been sleeping very good. Not bad not-sleeping, just… waking up a lot. And… I feel a little tired. More tired than usual. But I am old, Doctor! So maybe that’s just… old. I don’t know. My wife… she used to say I was always tired. She passed away two years ago. Maybe it’s just missing her.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mitchell. Grief can certainly manifest in many ways, and fatigue is a common symptom. We’ll certainly keep that in mind. So, along with the headache, you've been experiencing some difficulty sleeping and increased fatigue. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, any weakness or numbness in your arms or legs, or any problems with your balance?
PATIENT: No, not my vision. It's not… blurry. Maybe a little harder to read small print, but that's been happening for years. No weakness, no numbness. And my balance… I think it’s okay. I still walk to work, you see. It’s a long walk, but I do it. No falling, no dizziness. Just… tired. And the headache. Does that… help? I feel like I am telling you too much. Old man rambling.
DOCTOR: You are not rambling at all, Mitchell, and you’re providing very helpful information. No changes in vision, no weakness or numbness, balance is stable, just fatigue and the headache. That's excellent. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical conditions… Well, the doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high. He gave me some pills. I took them for a while, but… they made me feel funny. So I stopped. I didn’t tell the doctor. He would have been angry. I don’t like taking pills. Everything makes me feel funny. Other than that… no. Never had anything serious. Just… colds, and the flu. Old man stuff. I’ve always been strong. Worked hard my whole life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure for which you were prescribed medication, but discontinued due to side effects. And otherwise generally healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No, never been in the hospital. And no surgeries. I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree, but the doctor just put it in a cast. That was a long time ago. I’ve been lucky, I think. Always been careful. Didn’t take too many risks. Except maybe climbing that tree… My mother was very angry about that tree.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant surgical history or hospitalizations, just a broken arm as a child. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Like I said, I don’t like taking pills. I drink water, and… I try to eat good food. My daughter brings me tortillas sometimes. And coffee. I drink a lot of coffee. Does coffee count as medicine? It makes me feel better. A little.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly – coffee can be very helpful! So no other medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not that I know of. I eat everything. Everything my wife made, anyway. She was a good cook. Never had a problem with anything. No hives, no itching, no trouble breathing. Just… good food. And coffee. Always coffee. I think I am telling you too much about coffee. Sorry. It’s just… it’s a good thing. Makes the day easier.
DOCTOR: You're not telling me too much at all, Mitchell. And I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. It’s helpful. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That's a hard one. My mother… she lived a long life. Ninety-two years old. She died in her sleep. My father… he worked with the trains too. He died when I was young. Something with his heart, I think. My sister… she had high blood pressure, like me. She’s still alive, but she’s not doing very well. She lives in Guatemala, you see. I haven't seen her in many years. That’s… about it. Not a lot of family left. Mostly just me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mitchell. That’s very helpful. So, a family history of longevity with your mother, and a sister with high blood pressure. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your reflexes and coordination. Will that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time. But I figured it was time. Especially with this headache. Go ahead. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mitchell. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be due to anxiety or the coffee. Your lungs sound clear. Now I'll check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 150/90, which is elevated. We'll need to address that. Now, I'm going to check your neurological function. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? I can see it fine. No problem. It's a little hard with my old eyes, but I can see it. My wife used to say I had eyes like a hawk. But she was always… kind. Go ahead, Doctor. Whatever you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, can you squeeze my hands tightly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is that good? I try to be strong. I worked with my hands all my life. Building things, fixing things… they’re strong hands. But not as strong as they used to be. Time takes its toll, you know?
DOCTOR: Very good, Mitchell. Your grip strength is a little diminished, but that's not uncommon with age. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. And again on the other side… Your reflexes are a little slow, but again, that's not necessarily concerning. Finally, let’s just check your balance. Could you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like this? I am a little unsteady, but I can walk. I walk to work every day, you see. It’s a long walk, but I do it. Just… a little careful. Old man careful. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That's good, Mitchell. You are a little unsteady, but you're able to maintain your balance. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, your headache, fatigue, and slightly elevated blood pressure are concerning. The diminished grip strength and slow reflexes are also something to consider, although likely related to age. I want to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’d like to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, thyroid function, and a Vitamin D level. Also, an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. Do you have any objections to that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no objections. Whatever you think is best. If it helps… if it tells you what’s wrong… then do it. I trust you. Blood work… EKG… whatever it takes. I just want to feel better. I miss… feeling good. Is it expensive? I don't have much money. My wife… she took care of all that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mitchell. The cost will depend on the specific tests, but we can discuss options to make it affordable. We can look into financial assistance programs or see if there are lower-cost alternatives. We will not proceed with anything you cannot afford. For now, let's focus on getting the tests ordered. I will also prescribe a low dose blood pressure medication to start, to see if it brings your blood pressure down. We’ll start with something mild. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Medicine… I don’t like taking pills, but… if it helps my blood pressure… then I will try it. And thank you… for helping me. For not laughing at an old man worrying about a headache. And for understanding about the money. You are a good doctor. My wife… she always knew who the good doctors were.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mitchell. It's my job to take care of you, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. We'll get to the bottom of this. I’ll write you a prescription for Lisinopril 10mg once daily, and a lab order for the blood work and EKG. The lab is just down the hall, and they can schedule you for the EKG at the imaging center nearby. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: Lisinopril… 10 milligrams. Okay. And blood work… EKG… Yes. One question, Doctor. What if… what if it’s something bad? Something… serious? I’m old, you see. I’ve had a good life, but… I don’t want to be… a burden.
DOCTOR: That's a very understandable concern, Mitchell. It's important to remember that we don't know what's causing your symptoms yet. The tests are to help us gather information and determine the best course of action. If it is something serious, we'll address it together, and we have options for managing a wide range of conditions. You are not a burden, and we will ensure you receive the care and support you need, whatever the results may be. We'll discuss all of your options and make a plan that is right for you. Right now, let’s focus on getting the tests done. After we have the results, we can talk more specifically about what they mean and what our next steps will be. I'll also give you a copy of the lab orders and the prescription, and a written summary of our discussion today. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… that sounds alright. Tests… results… plan. Thank you. Really. You have been very kind. And patient. I… I appreciate it. I will go do the tests now. Thank you again, Doctor Abady.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mitchell. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll schedule that for next week once we have the results. Take care, and please, don't worry too much. We'll get through this together. Have a good day, Mitchell.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: You have a good day too, Mitchell. Please call if you need anything.
