DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Jahaad. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain precisely. I’ve noticed some swelling, yes. It’s rather… vague, honestly. I don’t recall exactly when it started, or what might have caused it. I apologize for the lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. Vague is alright, we can work through it. Swelling… where exactly are you noticing the swelling?
PATIENT: Primarily… around here, I believe. My face, perhaps? And my neck feels a little… full. It's not painful, not exactly. More… uncomfortable, if that makes sense. It seems to come and go, and it's difficult to pinpoint. I hope that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. So, face and neck swelling, comes and goes, not painful but uncomfortable. Has this been happening frequently, or is this a new thing?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is… not what it once was. I think it’s been happening more recently, perhaps over the last few weeks? But I couldn’t say with any certainty. I’ve just… noticed it more, I suppose. I apologize again for not being more precise. It’s frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Jahaad. It's perfectly alright. Memory can be tricky. So, over the last few weeks, you've noticed increased swelling in your face and neck. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it – certain foods, activities, or anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. I haven't consciously noticed anything specific. I eat a fairly… standard diet, I suppose. Nothing too unusual. I’ve been trying to be more mindful of what I consume, but I haven't identified a clear link yet. As for activities… I mostly work from home, speech therapy, so it’s not physically strenuous. I suppose… stress, perhaps? Work can be demanding at times, but I wouldn't say it's excessive. I truly don’t know, Doctor. It feels rather random.
DOCTOR: Okay. No obvious triggers. Let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I've been feeling a bit… fatigued, yes. Just generally tired, even after a full night's sleep. And… sometimes my throat feels a little scratchy, but I assumed it was just a minor irritation. I haven’t had a fever, or any chills, or anything like that. Just the fatigue, and the occasional scratchy throat. It's all very subtle, honestly. I almost didn't mention it.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and occasional scratchy throat along with the swelling. Have you experienced any difficulty breathing or swallowing?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. Breathing and swallowing are… normal, as far as I can tell. No obstruction, or discomfort, or anything like that. I was becoming concerned about the swelling, but the fact that I can breathe and swallow normally has been… reassuring, I suppose. It’s more of a… cosmetic concern, at this point, if that makes sense. Though, of course, I’d like to understand what's causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That's important to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, so I couldn’t say definitively. I haven’t noticed any significant changes in my clothing size, if that’s helpful. Perhaps a little fluctuation, as one does, but nothing drastic. I wouldn’t say I’ve gained or lost a noticeable amount of weight recently, no.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to cover some basics, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: To my knowledge, no. I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction. I’m generally very careful about what I consume. I don’t have any known allergies to medications either. I’ve taken common over-the-counter remedies, like pain relievers, without any issues. No rashes, no difficulty breathing, nothing like that. I can’t say with absolute certainty, of course, but to the best of my knowledge, I don’t have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And are you currently taking any medications, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I'm not currently taking any medications at all. I prefer to avoid them if possible. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, so I haven't had the need for any prescriptions. I occasionally take a vitamin D supplement during the winter months, as the sun exposure is limited, but that’s it. Nothing regular, and certainly nothing that I’ve recently started or stopped.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your neck to assess the swelling. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I trust your judgement, and I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. I’m just hoping we can get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jahaad. I’m listening to your heart and lungs now… sounds clear, no abnormal sounds. And feeling your neck… there’s some definite swelling, primarily in the anterior neck. It’s soft, non-tender to the touch. I don’t feel any distinct nodules or masses. Your lymph nodes are palpable, but not significantly enlarged. It doesn’t feel acutely concerning, but we’ll want to investigate further. I’m also going to check your thyroid. The thyroid feels… normal in size and consistency. No nodules felt there either.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s… reassuring to hear. It’s good to know it doesn’t feel acutely concerning, as you say. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me so thoroughly. What sort of investigations are you considering, if you don’t mind me asking? I’m not overly anxious, but I’d like to understand the next steps, if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I’d like to order some blood work. A complete blood count will help rule out any infection or underlying systemic issues. I’ll also check your thyroid function – TSH, T4, and T3 – to make sure your thyroid is functioning properly, even though it felt normal on exam. And, to be thorough, I'll include a metabolic panel to assess your overall kidney and liver function. These tests will give us a better picture of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Blood work seems like a sensible next step. I’m happy to proceed with those tests. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do to prepare, or if I need to fast beforehand. I’ll cooperate fully. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It eases my mind to have a plan.
DOCTOR: Great. No fasting is required for these tests. I’ll have the lab technician draw the blood. It should only take a few minutes. Once the results come back – usually within a couple of days – we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. In the meantime, if you notice any changes – difficulty breathing, increased swelling, fever – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything quite thoroughly. Just a quick clarification: if the results are delayed, should I follow up with the clinic, or will someone contact me? And is there anything I should avoid in the next couple of days - any particular foods or activities? Otherwise, thank you again for your time and attention. I appreciate your patience with my… vagueness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jahaad. I understand it can be frustrating when things aren't clear-cut. Someone from the clinic will contact you with the results, usually within 2-3 business days. No need to avoid any specific foods or activities at this point. Just continue to monitor your symptoms. If anything changes significantly, please don’t hesitate to call. Alright. I’ll get the lab orders sent over. Have a good day, and we’ll talk soon.
