DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don’t have time for a lot of small talk. I’m 51, divorced, and I want to have a baby. And I want to make sure it happens easily, if you understand what I mean. I don't want any…complications. Is that so difficult to grasp?
DOCTOR: I understand you're looking into options for pregnancy and want to ensure a smooth process. That's perfectly reasonable. To give you the best advice, I'll need a little more information. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you had any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: Oh, please. Do I look like I’ve had a lot of pregnancies? No. Never. I was…focused on my career. And frankly, the men weren’t worth it. But that's beside the point. No pregnancies, no children. Is that what you needed to know? Can we move on? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, no previous pregnancies. Good to know. Have you been trying to conceive currently, and if so, for how long?
PATIENT: Trying? Doctor, I just decided I want a baby. It’s not like I've been…actively attempting anything. This is all very new. And frankly, I expect it to be simple. I take care of myself, I eat reasonably well, and I’m strong. I repair bicycles all day, you know. It’s physical work. Surely that counts for something. Is there something wrong with wanting a baby at my age?
DOCTOR: No, wanting a baby at your age is not a problem in and of itself. However, conceiving at 51 does present some…considerations. To properly assess your situation, I'd like to go over a few things. First, let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid problems, or anything else you've been treated for regularly?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. I've been remarkably healthy, thank you very much. A few aches and pains, of course, from the bicycles, but nothing a bit of liniment can’t fix. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps…but that was a lifetime ago. And I'm on Medicare now, naturally, but that's just standard for someone my age. I don’t need a full medical workup just to talk about having a baby. It’s common sense, isn't it? I’m a strong, healthy woman.
DOCTOR: While you describe excellent health, a basic assessment is still important, Ms. Shteynberg. Medicare coverage doesn’t negate the need to understand your current physiological status, and age does affect fertility. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think…oh. Yes. Appendicitis when I was a teenager. And…a wisdom tooth removed. That’s it. Nothing major. Certainly nothing that would prevent me from…you know. Look, are you going to ask me about every little thing that’s ever happened to me, or are we actually going to discuss how to make this happen? I’m not here to rehash my entire life story. My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg. I assure you, I'm trying to gather the necessary information efficiently. Just a few more questions, then we can discuss options. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely not. I take whatever is necessary when I get a cold. I'm not…delicate. Honestly, Doctor, you're treating me like I'm some fragile porcelain doll. I fix bicycles for a living. I’m accustomed to scrapes and bruises. Just…skip the questions and tell me what I need to do. Is there a pill? A shot? What's the quickest route to a healthy pregnancy?
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, there isn't a "quickest route," unfortunately. Conceiving at 51 is more complex than it would be at a younger age. We need to evaluate your ovarian reserve, which diminishes with age. This involves blood tests to check hormone levels, specifically FSH and estradiol. We also need to discuss potential risks associated with pregnancy at your age, such as increased chances of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, and chromosomal abnormalities. I’d also like to do a physical exam, including blood pressure and weight check, and a pelvic exam. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Hormone levels? Chromosomal…what now? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming ridiculous. Are you telling me I need a full medical investigation just to think about having a baby? Look, I’m a practical woman. I understand the basics. I'm strong, healthy, and I take care of myself. I don't need you to scare me with complicated terms and potential risks. If it were easy, everyone would be having babies at my age. Just tell me if it’s possible, and if so, what’s the first step. I haven’t got time for all this…fuss. And frankly, I doubt it’ll be a pleasant experience, a pelvic exam. No. Absolutely not. Let’s just skip the exam. Tell me what tests are absolutely necessary, and I’ll consider it. But no poking and prodding, thank you very much. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I understand your concerns, but I must emphasize that proceeding without a thorough evaluation would be irresponsible. While you may feel healthy, internal factors can significantly impact your ability to conceive and carry a pregnancy safely. The blood tests I mentioned are absolutely necessary to assess your ovarian function and overall health. A pelvic exam is also crucial to evaluate your reproductive organs. I understand your discomfort, but it's a vital part of the assessment. Without these tests, I cannot ethically advise you on the feasibility of pregnancy or recommend any course of action. I'm concerned about your safety and well-being, and I cannot compromise on this. Given your reluctance to proceed with a standard evaluation, I recommend you seek a second opinion from another physician. I'm happy to provide you with referrals to specialists in reproductive endocrinology. Perhaps they can address your concerns more effectively.
