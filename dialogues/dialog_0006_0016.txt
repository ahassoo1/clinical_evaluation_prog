DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good to see you, Doctor. Though I can’t say I’m thrilled to be seeing you, if you understand me. It’s this bruising, really. It’s… excessive. I’m on that blood thinner, you know, since… well, you know. And I just seem to bump into things and boom, a purple mess. It’s getting old, frankly. And worrisome.
DOCTOR: Right, the bruising. Yes, I remember… the incident. And the blood thinner, of course. Warfarin, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Warfarin. That’s the one. Though honestly, Doctor, all the names blur together after a while. It's not like I prescribed it, you know. Just… taking it. And it seems to be making me fall apart. I used to be a very… careful man. Now I feel like a piece of fruit ready to drop. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Well, “normal” is a tricky word. Warfarin does increase your risk of bleeding and bruising, that’s true. But excessive bruising… we need to figure out how excessive. Have you had any falls besides the bumps you mentioned?
PATIENT: No, no actual falls. Just… little incidents. Knocking my elbow on the doorframe, that sort of thing. Bumping into furniture. Nothing dramatic. But the bruises… they’re bigger, last longer. And they seem to appear even when I don’t recall hitting anything at all. It's… concerning, Doctor. I’m not a child, you know. I pay attention to these things.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you said they last longer… roughly how long would you say a typical bruise sticks around now, compared to before you started the Warfarin?
PATIENT: Well, before… a little knock, maybe a couple of days, a week at most, and it was fading. Now? Easily a week, sometimes ten days, and they’re still quite… prominent. Dark purple, you know. Not just a little discoloration. And… and sometimes they’re tender, which never used to happen. It's… unsettling. I keep thinking something else is going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see what we’re dealing with. I’ll check your bruising, look at your skin, maybe listen to your heart and lungs just to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Though I assure you, my heart and lungs are perfectly fine. I was a very active man, you know. Still am, when I’m not covered in purple marks. But… yes, go ahead. Just… be gentle. This skin isn’t what it used to be. I’m not made of iron, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Just relax. Let's start with your arms. Could you extend your arms for me, please?
PATIENT: There. Though I’m telling you, this is just age. I used to be able to lift… well, never mind. It’s not important. You see those? On the back of my forearm there. And just a little on my elbow. That one appeared yesterday, I don't even remember how. It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay. Yes, I see them. They are… fairly substantial, and tender to the touch, as you mentioned. Color is a deep purple, consistent with more recent bruising. And just checking your range of motion… any pain with movement?
PATIENT: A little, yes. Not debilitating, mind you. Just… uncomfortable. It’s like a dull ache, deep down. And it seems to get worse if I’ve been moving around a lot. It's not the muscle, I can assure you. I still do my exercises, you know. Keep myself in shape. It's just… this is more than usual. Honestly, Doctor, it feels like something isn’t right. I'm not imagining this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. No swelling in your legs or ankles. And I’m not finding any other areas of significant bruising at this point. Now, I'm going to check your INR. Have you had it checked recently?
PATIENT: The… the what? Honestly, Doctor, you keep throwing these terms at me. I know I'm on the blood thinner, and I know something is wrong, but I'm not a medical professional. The… the INR, you say? No. No, I haven’t. They just tell me to take the pill. I think the pharmacy calls it in. That's all I know. Is that bad? Is that why I'm covered in purple marks?
DOCTOR: Okay. The INR – International Normalized Ratio – it's a blood test that measures how long it takes your blood to clot. It tells us if the Warfarin dose is correct. If it’s too high, you’re at risk of bleeding. If it’s too low, the medication isn’t working properly. It sounds complicated, but it’s a routine test. And yes, a high INR could very well be the cause of the excessive bruising you're experiencing. We need to get that checked immediately. I’ll order a blood draw right away. It’s possible your dose needs adjusting. Don’t worry, we’ll figure this out.
PATIENT: Finally. Someone is actually listening. I knew something was off. So... a blood test. That's all? It's not… something worse? Because honestly, I’ve been reading things online, and… well, it gets a little worrying. But a blood test, you say? That’s good. Please, just get it done. And tell me what the results mean, in plain English. No medical jargon. I’m not a doctor, Doctor. I just want to stop looking like I’ve been in a fight.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. A blood test is the first step. We'll get the results back quickly, and I’ll explain everything in plain English, I promise. No jargon. And yes, let’s focus on getting you feeling better and less… colorful. I’m going to have the nurse draw the blood now. In the meantime, just try to avoid any activities that could cause injury. No heavy lifting, and be careful when you're moving around. We’ll get this sorted out.
PATIENT: Alright. Very well. Just… be quick about it, if you don't mind. I have things to do, you know. And please, tell the nurse to be gentle. My veins aren't what they used to be. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you finally listening.
