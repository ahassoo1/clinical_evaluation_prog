DOCTOR: Hi Kiante, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Georgiou. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. My travel agency said I need a letter from a doctor confirming I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but they need it to release the tickets. It’s for a trip I’m planning.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A fit-to-fly letter. No problem at all, we can certainly get that sorted for you. To do that properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions, just to be thorough. It's standard procedure, and it helps ensure your safety during travel. First, could you tell me a little bit about where you’re planning to travel to?
PATIENT: It’s… to Mongolia. To visit family. It’s been a while, and, well, things have been difficult. I’m flying from here to Beijing, then a connecting flight to Ulaanbaatar. It’s a pretty long trip, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mongolia, to visit family. That’s wonderful! And yes, that is a fairly long trip. Knowing the destination is helpful. Now, I just want to get a good understanding of your current health. Have you been feeling generally well lately?
PATIENT: Yes, generally well. It’s… been okay. I mean, I’m still adjusting after… after my husband passed away last year. It’s been tough, emotionally, but physically, I’m fine. No major problems. A little tired sometimes, but who isn't? I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, honestly.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband’s passing, Kiante. That must be incredibly difficult. It's completely understandable that you’re still adjusting. And it’s okay that you haven’t been to the doctor in a while – we'll just get a good picture of things now. You mentioned feeling tired sometimes. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: It’s just… regular tiredness, I guess. Like, I sleep okay, usually, maybe seven or eight hours. But I wake up feeling… not refreshed. Just… normal tired. It doesn’t stop me from doing things, I can still work and everything, but it's there. And sometimes I feel a little… breathless, if I walk up a lot of stairs. It’s not bad, just noticeable. I haven’t had a cough or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and some breathlessness with exertion. That's helpful to know. Just to clarify, when you say "breathlessness," is it more like you get winded easily, or does it feel like you're struggling to get enough air?
PATIENT: It’s… winded easily, I think. Not struggling, definitely not. Just… needing to pause after going up stairs, or walking a long distance. It's not a panic thing, or anything scary. It just means I take my time. And I don’t do a lot of strenuous exercise anyway, so it’s not like I’m pushing myself. It's just... something I noticed.
DOCTOR: Okay, winded easily with exertion, not accompanied by any struggling for breath. That’s good information. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – anything you’ve been diagnosed with in the past, like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had… mild asthma as a child, but I grew out of it. I haven't used an inhaler since I was maybe ten. Otherwise, nothing. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I eat okay, try to get enough sleep… nothing major. No allergies that I know of either. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild childhood asthma that you’ve outgrown, no other known medical conditions, and no allergies. Just a multivitamin occasionally. That’s very good to know. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and maybe take a quick look at your throat, just to be thorough. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need. I just want to get this letter so I can go, honestly. The sooner we can get this done, the better. I have a lot to arrange.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let's get this done for you. If you wouldn’t mind taking a seat on the examination table, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 128/76, which is within the normal range. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths for me… in and out… Your heart sounds regular, and your lung sounds are clear, although I do notice they’re a little quiet, but that isn’t necessarily cause for concern. Now, open your mouth for me, please. Your throat looks clear. I’m also going to feel your lymph nodes. No swelling detected. Overall, your physical exam is relatively unremarkable. But given your reported fatigue and breathlessness, and just to be safe, I would like to order a quick blood test to check your iron levels and rule out any underlying anemia. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… that sounds sensible. Iron levels, okay. Whatever you think is best. I just… I just want to be sure it’s safe for me to travel. I’m a bit worried about flying, to be honest. It’s a long trip and… I don’t want anything to happen. So, yes, blood test, please. Do I need to come back another day?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Kiante, and it's good you're thinking ahead. It's always best to be cautious. We can actually do the blood test right here in the clinic. It will just be a small sample from your arm. It should only take a few minutes. While we’re waiting for the results – and they usually come back pretty quickly – we can discuss some things you can do to stay comfortable during your flight. Things like staying hydrated, moving around to prevent blood clots, and deep breathing exercises. Why don’t you have a seat, and I’ll get the phlebotomist in to draw the blood. Then, we’ll review the results together and I can write that fit-to-fly letter for you. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. That sounds very good. Hydration, moving around… I can do that. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to do this. And for explaining everything. It makes me feel a bit better.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiante. That's exactly what I'm here for. “Nurse Lee, could you please come in and draw some blood from our patient?
