DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Vodzak. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Let me see… what did my husband say? Something about… going to the bathroom. It’s been a little hard, you know? Not painful, just… slow. And I have to go more often, I think. Or maybe not. It’s all a bit fuzzy, dear.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stoffregen, that’s helpful. So, you’re experiencing some difficulty with urination – it’s slower than usual, and you feel like you might be going more frequently. You said it’s not painful, which is good to know. When you say “a bit fuzzy,” could you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Fuzzy… well, my memory isn’t what it used to be. Things just… don't stick like they did. I know I’ve been telling my husband about it for a bit now, but when he tells me about it, it feels like… a dream almost. Does that make sense? I forget how long it’s been happening, exactly. Maybe a month? Or two? It's hard to say. My husband, he keeps track of things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Stoffregen. It's very common for memory to change as we get older, and it doesn’t sound like that’s anything to worry about in itself. We'll certainly take both your experience and your husband’s observations into account. So, let's focus on the bathroom issues for now. When you go to the bathroom, do you feel like you completely empty your bladder, or do you feel like some urine is left behind?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I… think so? Sometimes I feel like I could go a little more, but I don’t need to. Or maybe I do need to, and I just… don't bother. It’s hard to tell. It's not a strong feeling, if that makes sense. Just… a little bit left. Like after you squeeze the last bit of toothpaste out of the tube. Does that sound right?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good description, Ms. Stoffregen. “Like the last bit of toothpaste” – I think I understand perfectly. Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes? Like… the color? I haven’t really looked, dear. My husband usually notices those things. He always says I don't pay attention. I suppose it looks normal. Yellow, I think. No blood or anything like that. I really don’t pay much attention, I’m sorry. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Not bad at all, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s perfectly alright, and quite common, to not focus on those details. Your husband keeping an eye on things is very helpful. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. That will involve listening to your abdomen, and a gentle examination to check for any tenderness or swelling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… alright. If it helps. I don’t mind a little poking and prodding. My husband always says I’m a tough old bird. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable, dear. I don’t want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. It should be quite straightforward, Ms. Stoffregen, and I’ll explain everything as I go. Please just let me know immediately if you feel any discomfort. Alright, your abdomen sounds normal. No unusual sounds or tenderness there. No masses or swelling that I can feel, and you’re not exhibiting any pain with gentle pressure. I’m going to gently press on your lower abdomen now, around your bladder area. Please let me know if that’s uncomfortable. How did that feel?
PATIENT: That… didn’t hurt. Just a little pressure, like when my husband hugs me too tight. He means well, you know. It didn’t feel wrong, just… noticeable. I guess I’m used to being squeezed! It didn’t feel like anything was particularly tender or anything. It just… felt. Does that make sense? I’m probably not very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re being very helpful, Ms. Stoffregen. It's good to know there’s no tenderness. That’s reassuring. Given your symptoms – the slow stream, the feeling of incomplete emptying, and the increased frequency – and based on the exam, it sounds like we need to consider a few possibilities. The most common would be an overactive bladder, which can happen with age, or a urinary tract infection, though you don’t have any pain or fever which makes that less likely. It could also be a bit of prostate enlargement pressing on the bladder, even in women, it's possible. To rule things out and get a clearer diagnosis, I’d like to order a urine test to check for infection, and a bladder scan to see how much urine is left after you empty your bladder. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests… My husband will be happy I'm getting everything checked. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. A scan sounds… alright. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And a urine test… well, I suppose I can manage that. Is it a lot of poking and prodding? I just don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Stoffregen. The urine test is a simple sample – I’ll give you a cup and instructions, and you’ll just need to collect some urine in the bathroom. As for the bladder scan, it’s completely non-invasive. I’ll use a handheld device, similar to one used in pregnancy, to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder. It doesn't require any needles or internal examination. It's quick and painless. The whole process shouldn't take more than about 15-20 minutes. I’ll have the nurse draw the necessary paperwork and guide you through the process. Do you have any questions about either test?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Just a cup for the urine, and a little machine for the bladder. That doesn’t sound too bad. My husband will be relieved to hear it. He worries about me, you know. He's a good man. Tell me, Doctor… is this something serious? Or just old age catching up with me?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s unlikely to be something serious, and very often, these types of symptoms are simply related to changes that occur with age. The bladder muscles can weaken, and the bladder can become less elastic. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities, which is why I'm recommending the tests. We’ll get the results back quickly, and then we can discuss the best course of action. If it’s simply age-related, we can explore options like bladder training exercises, lifestyle modifications, or medications to help manage the symptoms. Let's get these tests done first, and then we'll have a clearer picture. Would you like me to call the nurse now to get everything started?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Let’s get it over with. My husband will be so happy to know we’re taking care of it. He always says I put things off too long. He’s probably right. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s my pleasure. And your husband sounds like a wonderful support. While we’re waiting, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just this… bathroom trouble. Oh! Actually… my knees have been a little achy lately. Nothing terrible, just a little stiff when I get up in the morning. I just figured it was old age again. Is that something you could take a look at, maybe another time? If you're not too busy, of course. Don't want to take up all your time.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Stoffregen. Knee pain is very common, especially with age. We can certainly take a look at them during a future appointment. We can discuss some exercises and potential treatments to help manage the stiffness and pain. For now, let's focus on the bladder issue and get those tests completed. The nurse should be here any moment. Is there anyone who needs to be contacted regarding the results?
PATIENT: Yes, please call my husband, Thomas Stoffregen. His number is 555-123-4567. He worries about me, you know. He likes to be kept in the loop. He's a good man, Thomas is. Always has been. And… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease, just talking about it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stoffregen. I’ll make sure to have the nurse contact Thomas with the results. And I'm glad I could ease your mind a bit. That’s my job. Here's Sarah, our nurse, she’ll walk you through collecting the urine sample and performing the bladder scan. She’s very efficient and will explain everything clearly. Sarah, this is Ms. Stoffregen, and we’re going to do a urine test and bladder scan. If you need anything at all, please don't hesitate to let me or Sarah know. .
