DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kalinski. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's these hiccups. They just won't stop. It’s been… let me think… over 48 hours now, I think. Really annoying, honestly.
DOCTOR: Over 48 hours, that is quite persistent. Alright. Can you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Hmm... how to describe them? They’re… normal hiccups, I guess. You know, the little jerks, the “hic!” sound. They come and go, not really a pattern, just randomly. They don’t hurt, exactly, but they are… unsettling. And they're making it hard to sleep, and hard to eat properly. Everything feels like it's going to come back up when I try.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, they're not painful, but disruptive to your sleep and eating. You mentioned they're random – would you say anything seems to trigger them, even occasionally?
PATIENT: That's right, disruptive is a good word. And no, not really. I've been trying to think about it, but nothing specific. I drank a glass of water earlier, hoping it would help – sometimes that works, you know? But it didn’t. I was gardening yesterday, and nothing happened then. I had a bit of spicy food last night, but… I eat spicy food all the time, so I don’t think that’s it. Honestly, I’m just baffled.
DOCTOR: Alright. No clear triggers that you've noticed, and you've tried a common remedy without success. Let’s go through some general medical questions, just to rule out anything obvious. Have you had any other symptoms along with the hiccups – anything like heartburn, nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, or a cough?
PATIENT: No cough, no. No vomiting, thankfully. A little bit of heartburn sometimes, but I get that anyway, you know? It's not worse than usual. And no trouble swallowing. It just feels... awkward when I try to eat because I expect to hiccup. Hmm... I have been a little more tired than usual, now that you mention it. But I just thought that was the heat.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little more fatigue, but otherwise no major associated symptoms. And you mentioned occasional heartburn. Do you take anything for that, Ms. Redeye?
PATIENT: Sometimes, when it's really bad, I take something over-the-counter. Tums, or something like that. But I haven't taken anything for it in a few days. I usually try to avoid it if I can, you know? Too much calcium isn't good for you, they say.
DOCTOR: That's sensible. Alright. And just to be thorough, have you had any recent illnesses – even a cold?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I had a bit of a headache last week, but that was it. And it went away quickly. Nothing major, Doctor. I feel generally healthy, except for these blasted hiccups. Honestly, I'm starting to feel ridiculous coming here about hiccups, but they're just... unrelenting.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Redeye. While hiccups are often benign, persistent hiccups can sometimes indicate an underlying issue, and it's right to get them checked out. Now, to get a better understanding of things, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. And I had a bad bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but I recovered fully from that. Other than that… not much. I don't really go to the doctor unless I have to. I try to stay healthy. I eat pretty well, I walk every day, you know? Nothing major wrong with me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago, and pneumonia in the past. No other significant medical issues. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. I've never had a reaction to anything. I'm pretty lucky that way, I suppose. I used to worry about shellfish, but I’ve eaten plenty of it without any problems.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. I used to take a multivitamin, but I stopped a long time ago. I figure I get enough from my food.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, just a couple more questions about your family history and lifestyle, and then we can do a quick physical exam. Is there a history of any significant medical conditions in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mother had high blood pressure, but she lived to be 85, so it didn’t bother her too much. My father had a bit of trouble with his stomach, but nothing specific. No cancer that I know of, and nobody had diabetes. We weren't really a family to talk about our health problems, you know? More about gossip and the grandkids.
DOCTOR: That's quite common. Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never touched them. I don't like the smell of smoke, and alcohol makes me feel sick. I'm a pretty clean liver, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Redeye. Thank you for being so forthcoming. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It will just take a few minutes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead, Doctor. I'm ready when you are. Hopefully you can figure out what's causing these wretched hiccups.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could lie back on the examination table, that would be perfect. Alright, take a nice deep breath for me, please… and exhale. Good. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. It feels… normal. A little bit sensitive, maybe, but that could just be from eating. I had a salad for lunch, so… A little bit on the left side, but nothing major. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… aware.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little awareness on the left side. Your abdomen is soft overall, no significant masses or rigidity. I don’t hear any unusual sounds with the stethoscope. Your heart and lungs sound clear as well. Blood pressure is 130/80, and pulse is 72. Given your history and the physical exam, there's no immediate cause for concern. Persistent hiccups can sometimes be idiopathic – meaning, without a clear cause – but it's important to rule out other possibilities.
PATIENT: Idiopathic? What does that mean, exactly? Is it… serious? I'm a little worried now. I've never had hiccups last this long before.
DOCTOR: "Idiopathic" simply means we haven't identified a specific cause yet. It doesn't necessarily mean it's serious. In most cases, persistent hiccups resolve on their own. However, because yours have lasted over 48 hours, and to rule out any underlying medical conditions, I’d like to order a few basic blood tests. Just a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a thyroid test. These will help us ensure there isn't anything else going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If it will rule things out, then yes, please. I just want these hiccups to stop. Where do I get these tests done? Is it here, at the clinic?
DOCTOR: Yes, you can get these tests done right here at the clinic. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood for you after our consultation. It'll just be a quick blood draw. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay well-hydrated and avoiding carbonated beverages. If the hiccups continue for more than a week, or if you develop any new symptoms – like shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe abdominal pain – please contact us immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. So… just stay hydrated and get the blood tests. And if anything gets worse, call. Right? Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. It's just… been very unsettling.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Redeye. Absolutely. Stay hydrated, and don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes. The nurse will be with you shortly to draw your blood. We'll get the results back as quickly as possible and contact you with any further recommendations. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Thank you again, Doctor Kalinski. Hopefully, it's nothing serious. I'll see what the nurse says about the blood tests.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Redeye. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this. Please let the nurse know if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and we'll be in touch. .
PATIENT: .
