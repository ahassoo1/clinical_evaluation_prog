DOCTOR: Good morning, Gabbrielle. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s…fine to meet you as well. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing, but it’s these patches on my skin. They’ve just…appeared. Not attractive at all, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, skin patches. Not to worry, we can certainly take a look at those. How long have you noticed them appearing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it was shortly after our trip to Italy. Perhaps… six weeks now? Maybe seven. It’s hard to keep track, truthfully. I was hoping they’d just go away, you know? But no such luck. They haven't gotten larger, thankfully, but they certainly aren't fading.
DOCTOR: Italy, six or seven weeks ago… and they haven't changed much in size. Okay. And where on your body are these patches located?
PATIENT: Well, mostly on my arms, actually. And a few on my chest. Not all over, thankfully. Mostly where the sun would have hit, I suppose. We did spend quite a bit of time outdoors, enjoying the sights. My husband isn’t one for staying indoors, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, arms and chest, where the sun exposure would be greatest. I see. And can you describe what these patches look like?
PATIENT: Oh, they're…well, they’re lighter than the rest of my skin. Not white, exactly, more… faded. And a little bit rough, I think? Not smooth like the rest of my skin. It’s quite subtle, really. You probably wouldn't notice them unless you were looking for them. Though I notice, naturally.
DOCTOR: Okay, lighter patches, rough texture... It sounds like we're dealing with some changes in pigmentation. To get a better idea of what's going on, would you mind if I take a closer look?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Please do. Though, honestly, I doubt it’s anything serious. It’s probably just the sun. My husband always says I don't wear enough sunscreen. Men.
DOCTOR: Alright, if you'll just have a seat here. Let's take a look. Now, if you could just roll up your sleeves for me…and perhaps unbutton the top button or two of your blouse, if you're comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. There. Is that alright? It's rather drafty in here, isn’t it? Honestly, you'd think a nice clinic like this would have better temperature control.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Yes, this is helpful. I see what you mean about the lighter pigmentation. They're relatively well-defined, not raised... and the texture is slightly different, as you mentioned. No tenderness or warmth that I can detect. Hmm. Have you noticed any itching, burning, or pain associated with these patches?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Absolutely none. They just…are. That's the frustrating part! I haven’t changed anything in my routine—same soap, same lotion. It’s very peculiar. It’s not as though I haven’t had sun exposure before, you understand.
DOCTOR: No, no itching, burning or pain. That's good. And you haven’t noticed any other skin changes, anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. My face is perfectly normal. My legs are fine. Just these… unsightly patches. Really, Doctor, it’s quite embarrassing to even discuss, frankly. I’m a woman who takes pride in her appearance. And now this.
DOCTOR: Alright, well, it does sound like these patches are localized, which is good. It's difficult to say definitively without further investigation, but based on what you've told me and the appearance of the patches, it could be a few things. One possibility is pityriasis alba, which is a mild form of eczema often triggered by sun exposure. Another could be a type of fungal infection, although that's less likely without any itching or scaling. To rule things out and get a clearer picture, I'd like to do a quick skin scraping—a very gentle procedure—and send it to the lab for analysis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A skin scraping? Oh, goodness. Is it painful? And a lab? Honestly, Doctor, is that truly necessary? It sounds rather…involved for something that is likely just a bit of sun damage. I really don't see the point, if you're being honest. I suspect a good moisturizing cream and avoiding the sun would be sufficient. Perhaps a stronger SPF.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Gabbrielle. It's not a particularly comfortable procedure, but it’s very quick. It involves gently scraping a tiny amount of skin cells from the affected area with a small blade. It shouldn’t be painful, more of a mild scratching sensation. And the lab analysis will help us rule out other possibilities, like fungal infections, which would require different treatment. While sun damage is certainly a possibility, it's best to be sure before recommending a course of action. We want to make sure we're addressing the root cause of the problem, not just the symptoms. If it puts your mind at ease, we can start with a stronger moisturizing cream and increased sun protection, but if the patches don't improve within a few weeks, we should revisit the skin scraping. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. But if it's going to be terribly uncomfortable, I want to know beforehand. And you promise it won’t leave a scar? I have a very important luncheon next month. A strong cream and increased sun protection first, then, if it doesn’t improve… we’ll talk about this scraping again. Though I still think it’s rather excessive. But, very well. Proceed.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll proceed gently, and I'll explain everything step-by-step. I can assure you the risk of scarring is extremely low—it's a very superficial procedure. I’ll start with the cream, then. I recommend a cream with ceramides and hyaluronic acid—those help restore the skin barrier and retain moisture. And a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 50 or higher, applied generously and frequently, especially when outdoors. I’ll also write down some instructions for you regarding sun protection. Try that for four to six weeks, and if you don't see any improvement, we can schedule a time for the skin scraping. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Ceramides and hyaluronic acid... it all sounds rather complicated, truthfully. But I’ll try it. Four to six weeks. And please, Doctor, if it does come to this scraping, make it quick. I haven’t got all day, you know. Thank you for your time. Hopefully, this cream does the trick. I suspect it will. Men always make mountains out of molehills.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Gabbrielle. We'll take it one step at a time. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And I will certainly do my best to make the procedure as quick and comfortable as possible, should it become necessary. Have a good day, and enjoy your luncheon! .
