DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, try to be concise. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, my… it's been a bit, hasn’t it? Well, I… I haven’t been feeling quite right. It’s my stomach, mostly. I get sick to my stomach a lot, and I don’t seem to be able to eat much before I feel full. It's just… not right. I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it's been a while now, I reckon.
DOCTOR: “A while now.” Yes, well, that’s… helpful. And what specifically makes you “sick to your stomach”?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s not a sharp pain, not like. It’s more… a queasy feeling. Like when you’re on a boat, maybe? Except I haven’t been on a boat in… well, a long time. It just comes up on me, you know? And then, like I said, even a little bit of food fills me right up. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Soup, a biscuit… doesn’t seem to make a difference. It's just… unpleasant. Do you understand? I’m not very good at explaining things, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Right. Queasy. And it occurs… randomly?
PATIENT: Well… I think so. It's hard to say, exactly. Sometimes it’s worse in the mornings, maybe? But other times it just… happens. It doesn’t seem to be tied to anything specific, no. I wish it was, then I’d know what to avoid! I used to be able to eat a good meal, you know. I trained animals for years… needed my strength. Now… I mostly just feel tired.
DOCTOR: Tired… And you mentioned training animals. Do you still do that?
PATIENT: Not like I used to. It's… harder now. My hands aren't as steady, and I get winded easily. I have a few birds, mostly. Parakeets and such. Just little ones. They don't need a lot of training, bless their hearts. It keeps me busy, though. A body needs something to do, don’t it? But truthfully, the nausea makes it hard to even clean their cages sometimes.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any… other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I’ve lost a bit of weight, I suppose. My clothes feel a little looser than they used to. And… I get tired easily, like I said. Sometimes I just feel… weak. Is that a symptom? I don't know. I keep forgetting things, too, but I'm an old woman, so… that's probably just my age. I’m sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful. It all feels a bit jumbled in my head.
DOCTOR: Weight loss… And when you say “forgetting things,” is it… significant?
PATIENT: Significant… Oh dear. It's not like I forget who people are, not usually. It’s more… dates, appointments. Things like that. I used to be very organized, kept everything in a little notebook. But I misplace the notebook now, and then I forget what I wrote in it. It's… frustrating. And I keep having to ask my neighbor to remind me of things. She’s a sweet woman, bless her, but… I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a listen… and feel. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Oh… no, not really pain, exactly. It’s more… tender. Sort of a dull ache, sometimes. Especially… right here. It’s not sharp, like a stitch, just… uncomfortable. It's worse after I try to eat something. Though, like I said, even a little bit of something makes me feel full. Oh, that’s a little sensitive, yes.
DOCTOR: And any nausea or vomiting currently?
PATIENT: Well, not right this moment, no. But it comes and goes, you know? It’s been a few hours since I was sick, but I feel it sort of… bubbling up sometimes. Like it could happen any minute. I keep a little bowl nearby, just in case. It’s just… unpleasant, to be honest. And it makes me feel so weak afterwards. Like I've been running a marathon.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to run some tests to determine the cause of your discomfort. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and… an endoscopy. That’s to look at your esophagus and stomach. I'll write the orders now. It’s likely just indigestion, but we need to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: Oh… an endoscopy? What… what does that involve? I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… painful? And what's a metabolic panel? I… I don’t understand all these medical terms. I’m just an old woman, Doctor. I’m not very good with this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: An endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your esophagus and stomach to visualize the lining. It's not typically painful, but you’ll be sedated. As for the metabolic panel, it’s a blood test to check your organ function and electrolyte levels. The lab will explain the preparation instructions. Schedule the endoscopy as soon as possible. I haven’t time to go through every detail. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… sedated? That… that sounds frightening. And I have to schedule it myself? I… I don’t do well with computers, Doctor. And I often forget things, as I mentioned. I’m afraid I’d likely miss the appointment or forget the instructions. Could… could the nurse perhaps help me with that? I just… I feel a bit overwhelmed. Is there… is there something seriously wrong with me? You said “rule out anything serious.” That sounds… concerning.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Ms. Kelder. I’ve explained the tests. The nurse can perhaps assist with scheduling, but I have other patients waiting. It's unlikely anything is seriously wrong, but we must investigate. Here is a referral to a gastroenterologist. They will explain everything in more detail. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. I… I see. Well, thank you, Doctor. Perhaps… perhaps I should just call my neighbor? She's good with these sorts of things. .
