DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. I… cough a lot. Been coughing for a long time now. And… I get tired easily. Also, my nose, it feels blocked, like always got something in there. Happens often.
DOCTOR: "A long time now…" Could you be more specific, Mr. Tati?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific? I don’t really… remember exactly. Maybe… six months? Or more? It comes and goes, but it’s mostly been there. I keep taking some medicine from the shop, the… the red one, but doesn’t really help much anymore. It used to.
DOCTOR: The red one… Do you recall the name of the medication, or perhaps what it's for according to the packaging?
PATIENT: Uh… no, sorry. I just ask the man in the shop. He gives me the red one when I say I cough a lot. I don't really look at the boxes, Doctor. Just want something to stop the coughing. My wife usually gets it, but she's not here today. It's for… cold, I think? Something like that.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that makes things… difficult. And this cough – is it a dry cough, or do you bring anything up when you cough?
PATIENT: Uh… Sometimes dry, sometimes… yeah, I bring something up. Like… mucus. Sorry. It’s usually… yellowish. Not always, though. Sometimes clear. I don’t really pay attention, to be honest. Just trying to get rid of it. Makes me feel… yucky.
DOCTOR: Yellowish mucus… and sometimes clear. And you mentioned fatigue. Can you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Just… tired all the time. Even after sleep. Like… heavy. Hard to do things. Work… it’s harder now. Used to be able to change tires all day, no problem. Now… I need to rest a lot. Wife has to help more. Not good for business.
DOCTOR: I see. And how about any fever, chills, or night sweats associated with this cough and fatigue?
PATIENT: Fever… sometimes. Not high, though. Just… warm. Like when you have a normal cold. And… chills, yes, sometimes I feel cold even when it's hot. Night sweats… I don't know about that, Doctor. I usually sleep very soundly. Wife would know… she's good at noticing things. I don't really remember sweating much at night. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any shortness of breath, or wheezing when you breathe?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… not really. Maybe… when I climb stairs? But I’m not very fit, to be honest. Wheezing… I don't know what that sounds like, Doctor. Is that like a whistling sound? I don't think so. Sometimes my chest feels tight, but that could just be from the coughing. Sorry, I'm not good at explaining.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's move on to some other things. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had any problems with anything. I eat everything, Doctor. And like I said, the man at the shop gives me the red medicine and it used to be okay. Should I be allergic to something?
DOCTOR: It's good that you haven't experienced any allergies so far, Mr. Tati. But it’s important to rule them out. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, even herbal supplements or traditional remedies?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the red one, when I need it. My wife… she sometimes gives me ginger tea when I'm very sick, but that's it. Not much else. We don't have much money for fancy things, you know? Just trying to get by.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past… medical history? Uh… I got sick as a kid, like everyone. Chickenpox, I think? Nothing serious. Never been to the hospital, except when my son was born. And… I broke my arm once, when I was young, playing football. But that was a long time ago. I don't really remember much else, Doctor. Sorry. I'm not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my wife and two sons. My mother… she passed away a few years ago. She had… uh… old age problems, I think. And my father… he's okay, still alive, but very old and weak. Lives in the village. He had some problems with his chest when he was young, but he's okay now. Everyone gets sick sometimes, right? I don’t really know about any other family illnesses. We don't see them often.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, Doctor! Never. My wife wouldn't allow it. And alcohol… only sometimes, on special occasions. Like… New Year. Just a small glass of beer. And drugs… no, never. I'm a working man. I need to be strong! I fix tires, remember?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to need to examine you. Could you please step onto the scale, and then we’ll check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need. Is something very wrong?
DOCTOR: Your weight is 97 kilograms, and your height is 166 centimeters. That puts your BMI at 35.2, which is considered obese. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is slightly elevated. Your heart rate is 88 beats per minute. And when I listen to your lungs… I hear some wheezing, particularly on the right side. And I also notice some diminished breath sounds in those areas.
PATIENT: Wheezing? Diminished… what? Is that bad, Doctor? I just thought it was the coughing. The red medicine used to help. Is something seriously wrong with my lungs? I need to work, Doctor! My family… they depend on me.
DOCTOR: It could indicate a problem, Mr. Tati. That's why we need to investigate further. It's too early to say definitively, but your symptoms, combined with these findings, are concerning enough that I want to order some tests. I'm going to order a chest X-ray, and some blood work to check for infection. These tests will help us determine the cause of your cough, fatigue, and wheezing. Because you’re uninsured, the cost will be your responsibility. However, the clinic does offer a small discount for cash payments. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Tests… and cost? How much will it cost, Doctor? I don't have much money, as I said. The X-ray… the blood work… can’t we just give me something for the cough? Like the red medicine, but stronger? I really can’t afford a lot of tests right now. My wife… she’s already worrying about bills. Is it very serious? Do I need to go to the hospital?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tati, I understand your financial concerns, but it's irresponsible for me to prescribe medication without knowing the underlying cause of your symptoms. The "red medicine" is likely just suppressing your cough temporarily. We need to rule out more serious conditions, such as pneumonia or bronchitis, or even something more chronic. The X-ray will cost approximately 8000 pesos, and the blood work is around 3000 pesos. I strongly advise you to get these tests done. If it is something serious, delaying treatment could have significant consequences. I can write you a prescription for a stronger cough suppressant to manage your symptoms temporarily, but that is not a substitute for proper diagnosis. As for hospitalization, we can't determine that until we have the test results. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: 11,000 pesos… That's… a lot of money. I don't know if we can manage that right now. My wife… she will be very worried. Is there… is there any way to pay in installments? Or maybe… a cheaper test? I really need to work, Doctor. I just want to feel better… and be able to provide for my family. What will happen if I don't get the tests?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tati, I understand your situation, but this clinic does not offer payment plans. As for cheaper tests, unfortunately, the X-ray and blood work are the minimum required to assess your condition adequately. If you do not get the tests, your condition could worsen. Your cough could become more severe, you could develop a secondary infection, or your fatigue could progress. We're talking about your lungs here, Mr. Tati. Ignoring this could have serious, even life-threatening, consequences. I can write you a prescription for a stronger cough suppressant and some antibiotics to manage the symptoms temporarily, but it's a temporary fix. I strongly advise you to reconsider, and find a way to afford the tests. I’ll print out the prescriptions and the lab order. However, I am not going to be held responsible for any complications that may arise from your decision to delay proper diagnosis and treatment. Do you understand?
