DOCTOR: Good morning, Keoni. My name is Dr. Dashevsky, and I'm an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s rather embarrassing, actually. I’ve been having to go to the bathroom very frequently lately. It’s… disruptive, to say the least. I don’t quite recall when it started, but it feels like it’s been getting worse.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's perfectly alright to feel a little embarrassed, and you're not alone – frequent urination is quite common. It's good you brought it up. Let's try to figure out what's going on. When you say "very frequently," could you give me a rough estimate of how often you're needing to go – perhaps over a 24-hour period?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a difficult question. I… I don’t keep track, truthfully. But I would say… more than usual. Before, I might go… four or five times a day? Now… it feels like every couple of hours, sometimes even less. It’s quite unsettling. And occasionally, I’ll feel the urge even when I just went. I apologize for being so vague; my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Keoni. It's helpful to get a general sense, and “more than usual” is a good starting point. It sounds like there's definitely been a change in your typical pattern. And feeling the urge even after going is good information. Now, could you describe what happens when you go?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Well, the stream seems… normal, I suppose. Not weak or… forceful. And I don't experience any pain or burning while urinating. It just… happens more often. Sometimes, it feels like I don't fully empty my bladder, if that makes sense. Like there's a little bit left behind. It’s a peculiar sensation. I hope I’m not being too… descriptive.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Keoni. It’s important to be as accurate as possible so I can understand what’s happening. No need to apologize for being descriptive – that’s my job! Okay, so normal stream, no pain or burning, and sometimes a feeling of incomplete emptying. That's helpful. Now, let's broaden the picture a little. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the frequent urination?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… Let me see. I have been rather thirsty lately, I suppose. More so than usual. And perhaps a little more tired, although I attribute that to… well, life. I haven't noticed anything drastically different, truthfully. No fever, no pain anywhere else… Just the frequent bathroom trips and the increased thirst. It's… frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: Increased thirst and fatigue alongside the frequent urination… Okay. And you said you haven’t had any fever or pain elsewhere?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no fever or pain. Nothing like that. Just… the constant need to go. And sometimes, it wakes me up at night, which is… disruptive to say the least. I don’t recall this ever happening before. It’s just… new. And a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, Keoni. It sounds like this has been quite a bit of a disruption to your life. Frequent urination, increased thirst, waking you up at night… Those symptoms can be caused by a number of things. Before we proceed, let me ask a few quick questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, urinary tract infections, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear… my medical history… That’s… difficult to recall. I was divorced several years ago, and… my ex-husband handled most of the paperwork and doctor’s appointments. I believe I had a bout of bronchitis when I was younger, but that’s all I can readily remember. I’ve never been diagnosed with diabetes, and I don't think I’ve ever had a urinary tract infection. But I honestly couldn’t say with certainty. I apologize; my memory is rather unreliable. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Keoni. It's very common for patients to have difficulty recalling medical details. We can work with what you remember, and if needed, we can try to obtain records if that becomes necessary. Okay, so no known history of diabetes or urinary tract infections. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, a very long time ago. And… I believe I had a minor procedure on my knee after a sports injury in college, but it was quite minor. Nothing major, as far as I recall. I hope that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Keoni. Tonsillectomy and a minor knee procedure. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take any medications regularly. I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s it. And I don't take any vitamins or supplements. I try to eat a healthy diet, but… well, life gets in the way sometimes. I apologize for being so… disorganized.
DOCTOR: No apologies necessary, Keoni. It's good to know you're not currently taking any medications. Now, one last few questions to finish the history. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Let me see. I don’t think I have any major allergies. I occasionally get a mild rash if I eat strawberries, but it’s not severe. And I’m not allergic to any medications, as far as I know. I haven’t had any reactions to any prescriptions in the past. Is that everything?
DOCTOR: Okay, Keoni. That’s a very thorough history. No known major allergies, mild rash with strawberries. Now, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. That's perfectly alright if you’d prefer to stop at any point. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam… Yes, I suppose that’s alright. If it’s necessary. I’m a little anxious about it, truthfully, but I trust your judgment, Doctor. What exactly will it involve?
DOCTOR: Certainly. It's perfectly understandable to feel a little anxious, and I'll explain everything as we go. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Finally, I’ll examine your abdomen to feel for any abnormalities. I will also do a quick neurological exam, checking your reflexes and strength. And, with your permission, I’d like to do a urine test to check for infection, glucose, and other potential issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds alright. As long as it doesn’t involve anything… invasive. I apologize for being so timid. It’s just… I haven’t been to a doctor in quite some time. Checking my blood pressure and listening to my heart and lungs sounds fine. The urine test is also acceptable. Let's get it over with, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Of course. Absolutely no need to apologize. We'll take things at your pace. If you'd like, you can lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 130/80. That's slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Let's move on to listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. That’s good. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses or tenderness. That's also good. Now, for the urine test, I’ll just need a small sample. There’s a private restroom just down the hall with a collection cup. Do you need any assistance locating it?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I believe I can manage to find the restroom on my own. I’ll be right back with the sample.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Keoni. I’ll be right here when you get back.
