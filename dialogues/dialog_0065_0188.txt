DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Secondi. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… my pee. It’s orange. It started a couple days ago, maybe three. It’s not hurting, just… orange. I don’t know why.
DOCTOR: Okay. Orange urine, you say, starting approximately three days ago. And you're experiencing no pain or discomfort associated with it?
PATIENT: No pain. Nothing. Just… different color. It worries my wife. She says I should come see a doctor. I don't usually go to the doctor unless something really hurts.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good that your wife encouraged you to come in. Sometimes changes like this can indicate something that needs attention, even without other symptoms. Let's get some more information. First, have you noticed any changes in the amount you're urinating – more or less than usual?
PATIENT: No, I think it's the same. Not more, not less. Normal amount, just… orange. I drink a lot of water, always have. Maybe that has something to do with it? I work outside, it gets hot.
DOCTOR: Drinking a lot of water is good, certainly. Let's explore other possibilities. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements – color, consistency, anything like that?
PATIENT: Umm… no. Everything is normal there, I think. Regular. Not different. Sorry, it's a bit… private to talk about. But no, nothing changed.
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable, Mr. Secondi. No need to apologize. We have to cover all the bases. Now, have you been taking any new medications, vitamins, or supplements recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… No. Not new. I take a multivitamin, I've been taking that for years. And sometimes I take something for my back, when it hurts. But I haven't taken anything for my back in… maybe a month?
DOCTOR: Alright. And to clarify, this back medication… what is it, specifically?
PATIENT: It's… a little pill. White. My neighbor gave it to me, he gets it from his brother. I don’t know the name, sorry. It helps with the pain, that’s all I know. I only take it when I really need it.
DOCTOR: I see. Taking medication not prescribed to you isn’t ideal, Mr. Secondi. Do you recall the dosage of this pill?
PATIENT: Uh… one? Just one pill when my back is bad. Maybe two, sometimes. I don’t measure it, I just… take one or two. It’s not a lot. It helps, but I try not to take it too much.
DOCTOR: Okay. We will need to address that later. Now, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. I eat everything. My wife makes me try all kinds of things, even spicy stuff. I don’t have any problems with anything. No rash, no trouble breathing, nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, just to get a complete picture, have you experienced any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain along with this change in urine color?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I feel normal, besides the… orange pee. No fever, no chills, no sick stomach. Everything else is okay. Just a little worried, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of – anything you’ve been diagnosed with or treated for in the past?
PATIENT: I had a problem with my back a few years ago. That’s why I take the pill sometimes. The doctor gave me… pictures, and told me to be careful. Something about a disc. But that's it. Nothing else. I don't go to the doctor much, like I said.
DOCTOR: Right, you mentioned a back problem previously. And you had x-rays, I presume?
PATIENT: Yes, x-rays. And… a scan? Something with a machine. I don’t remember all the details. It was a long time ago, and I was just happy it wasn’t worse. I try to lift things carefully now. My wife reminds me all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had any. I’m a healthy guy, mostly. I work hard, that’s all. No cuts, no stitches, nothing.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, kidney problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Umm… My father, he had problems with his heart, I think. But he was old. And my mother, she had… high blood pressure. But that’s it, I think. My family isn’t really sick people. Mostly they just get old.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No smoking. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, when my wife makes a nice meal. And no… other things. Never tried them. I like working, that’s my hobby.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Secondi. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, including checking your vital signs and a brief abdominal exam. Then, I’ll order a urinalysis to get a better understanding of what’s causing the color change in your urine. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Whatever you think is best. I trust you, Doctor. Let's get it checked out. I just want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie down on the examination table. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not concerning at this time. Your pulse is 78, regular rhythm. Lungs are clear. Heart sounds are normal. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. No tenderness to palpation. Soft, non-distended. Tympanic to percussion. Alright. Everything seems normal on the initial exam, but the urinalysis will give us more information. I will send that off to the lab, and we should have results within a few hours.
PATIENT: Okay, good. I feel better knowing it doesn’t feel bad, at least. A few hours, you said? That’s good. Should I wait here? Or can I go home and you call me?
DOCTOR: You can go home, Mr. Secondi. It will be a few hours, as I mentioned. We'll call you as soon as the results are back. In the meantime, please try to drink plenty of water. And, I strongly advise against taking any medication that hasn't been prescribed to you specifically. We need to know exactly what's going on before introducing any other variables. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For taking the time. And for not laughing about the orange pee. My wife was worried, and I was worried. Hopefully it's nothing serious. I'll wait for the call. And I won't take any more of my neighbor’s pills.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Secondi. And you're right to be cautious. It’s always best to err on the side of safety. The orange urine could be something simple – dehydration, a side effect of something you ate, or even a vitamin supplement. But we need to rule out anything more serious. We’ll get to the bottom of it. Here’s my card with the clinic number. Please call if you experience any changes in your condition. Have a good day.
