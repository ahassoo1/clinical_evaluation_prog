DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Rakosky, is it? Yes, yes. Well, it's... something about a check-up. For... work, I think. A performance physical, that's right. Honestly, things are a bit fuzzy these days. They just said I needed to get cleared. Is that... does that make sense? I work at the theater, you see. Ushering and such. Not on stage, though.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Krahn. A performance physical for your work at the theater. We can certainly do that. To start, could you tell me a little bit more about what specifically your employer requires for this check-up?
PATIENT: Oh dear... Honestly, I can't recall the specifics. They just handed me a form and said to bring it here. Let me see... I thought I had it... Ah, here we are. It’s… a pretty standard thing, I assume? They do this every few years. I mostly just want to get it over with, if I'm being truthful. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krahn. Yes, this does appear to be a fairly standard work physical form. It covers a review of your medical history, a physical examination, and some basic vital signs. We'll go through each section methodically. First, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions in the past, such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a lot to remember. Let me think. I had… a bad back for a while, years ago. A slipped disc, I think. But that healed. And… I think I had high blood pressure once? The doctor put me on some pills for it, but I stopped taking them after a while. I don’t remember why, exactly. It was a long time ago. Nothing major, I don’t believe. I've never been in the hospital for anything serious. I really wish my memory was better.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krahn. It’s perfectly normal for memory to become less sharp as we age. We'll take our time. So, a history of back pain that has resolved, and a previous diagnosis of high blood pressure that you were treated for, but are no longer taking medication for. Do you recall when you were diagnosed with the high blood pressure, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, dear... that’s a difficult one. Let me see… it must have been… in the nineties? Maybe early two-thousands? It was before my divorce, definitely. Yes, before 2010, for sure. I was still married then, and… well, everything was a bit of a blur, honestly. I don't remember the exact year, or even which doctor told me. It was just… a routine check-up, I think, and they said my numbers were a little high. Does that help at all? I feel terrible not being more precise.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Krahn. Any approximation is helpful. Before 2010 is a good starting point. We can look into your records if available, to try and clarify that further. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reasons?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any. And… no hospital stays, apart from when my wife… well, that was just for a few days. Not for me, though. For her. She had a… a bad fall. But I was mostly just there with her. Nothing for me, personally. Just the back pain, really. That’s all. No major illnesses or anything. I've been quite lucky, I suppose. Relatively speaking.
DOCTOR: I understand. No surgeries, no hospital stays for yourself, aside from being with your wife during her stay. A history of back pain, and otherwise relatively healthy. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother… she had heart problems, I think. She passed away when I was quite young, actually. And my father… he had diabetes, I believe. Yes, that’s right. He lost a foot to it, eventually. Not a very good history on that side, I'm afraid. My wife’s family… I don’t really know. We didn’t talk about those things much. I’m not much help, am I? I wish I remembered more.
DOCTOR: You’re doing just fine, Mr. Krahn. It’s helpful to know about your mother’s heart problems and your father’s diabetes. Family history is important, and you've provided useful information. Now, I’d like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, no smoking, never. Tried it once when I was young, didn't like it. And… I used to drink, a little. Socially, you see. But I stopped years ago. It didn’t agree with me. And definitely no drugs. Never. Never have, never will. I’m a pretty simple man, Doctor. A quiet life is what I prefer. Is that… is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krahn, that’s very helpful. No smoking, no recreational drugs, and you used to drink socially but have stopped. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that's about it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, though. And… occasionally, if I have a headache, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But that’s it. Truly. Just the multivitamin and the occasional ibuprofen. I try to stay healthy, you see. For an old man, anyway. Is that… are we almost done? I feel a little… tired.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krahn, we are almost done. Just a quick physical exam to complete the check-up. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, travelled a bit… never a problem. I'm pretty lucky, I suppose. I think that’s everything, isn't it? I really appreciate you being patient with me, Doctor. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be. Are you ready to… do the exam now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krahn, you’ve provided me with a lot of helpful information. No known allergies. Now, let's proceed with a brief physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your abdomen. This will just take a few minutes. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m… I’m a bit nervous, if I’m honest. It’s just… all these questions, and trying to remember… it’s tiring. But I’ll cooperate. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Krahn. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. That’s a little elevated. We’ll want to monitor that. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear some slight crackling in your lungs, primarily on the lower lobes. This could be due to a number of things, and we may want to investigate that further with a chest X-ray. Now, let’s briefly examine your abdomen. Please lie back if you're comfortable.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Crackling in my lungs? That doesn't sound good, does it? I haven't been coughing or anything… Just a little… out of breath sometimes, when I walk up the stairs. But I thought that was just… old age. A chest X-ray? Is it serious, Doctor? I just want to get this over with… and get back to my quiet life. This is all a bit… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. There are no masses or areas of significant pain. The crackling I hear in your lungs isn’t necessarily serious, but it’s something we should investigate further to rule out any underlying issues, such as mild pneumonia or early signs of heart failure. A chest X-ray will give us a clearer picture. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart again. I do detect a slight murmur, which could be related to the crackling in your lungs and needs to be assessed. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on your history and the exam findings, I recommend a chest X-ray, an EKG to evaluate your heart, and a blood test to check your kidney function and rule out any infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a chest X-ray, an EKG, and blood tests? That sounds… like a lot, Doctor. Is it… is it something serious? I just wanted a simple check-up to get cleared for work. This is… this is more than I bargained for. I’m not sure I can handle all of this. Maybe… maybe I should just quit my job. It’s not worth all this trouble. What if… what if it's something bad? I don't want to know. I just want to go home and rest. This is all too much.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, I understand your anxiety. It's overwhelming to hear about multiple tests, and it's natural to feel scared. However, these tests aren't meant to scare you, but to gather information so we can understand what’s going on and create a plan to help you feel better. The crackling and murmur I detected could be caused by a number of things, some more serious than others. Without the test results, it’s impossible to say for sure. We need to rule out potential issues, and these tests are the best way to do that. We can start with the blood tests and EKG today, and schedule the chest X-ray for tomorrow. In the meantime, I want you to try and relax. I'll write you a referral order for the blood tests and EKG, and schedule the chest X-ray. I’ll also write a note to your employer explaining that you are undergoing some medical evaluations and may need a temporary clearance extension. Would you like me to go over some of the possible causes of these findings with you, or would you prefer to wait until we have the test results?
