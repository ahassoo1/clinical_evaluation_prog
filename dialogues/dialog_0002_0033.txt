DOCTOR: Hi Burdette, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, frankly, I haven’t the time for this. But my… housekeeper insisted. Something about not being able to see or hear properly. It’s all rather inconvenient, you understand. I’m a very busy woman.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Burdette. It’s good your housekeeper encouraged you to come in – we want to make sure everything is alright, even when things are busy. So, when you say not being able to see or hear properly, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… a blurring, really. And sounds are… muffled. It came on quite suddenly, actually. I don’t recall when precisely. A few days ago, perhaps? Honestly, I have patients to think about, not the state of my own… senses. It’s quite irritating, if you must know. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Burdette. A few days, okay. Sudden changes like that are always good to check out. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. Just to get a clearer picture, is the blurring in both eyes, or just one?
PATIENT: Both, I believe. Or… perhaps it started in one and then moved to the other. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t keep track of these things. It’s all a bit of a haze. I was in the operating room most of yesterday, and the day before… a very demanding case, you understand. Highly sensitive work. It requires focus.
DOCTOR: Okay, both eyes. And you mentioned muffled sounds as well. Is that in both ears, and did that start around the same time as the blurry vision?
PATIENT: Yes, I suppose so. Everything seems… distant. Like someone put cotton in my ears. It all happened rather quickly, as I said. Truly, Doctor, I have a schedule to maintain. I’m not one for dwelling on personal ailments. Are we getting anywhere with this? I have a surgery scheduled for this afternoon. A rather important one, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, so both blurry vision and muffled hearing, starting around the same time a few days ago. It's good you're telling me all this, Burdette. To help me understand what might be going on, have you noticed any dizziness, headache, or ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Headache? Occasionally. A mild one. Everyone gets headaches, Doctor. As for dizziness... well, perhaps a little unsteady on my feet, but I attribute that to long hours. I'm a surgeon, you know. We stand for a very long time. Ringing? I don't recall any ringing. Honestly, these are rather trivial concerns. Are you going to do something, or simply interrogate me about insignificant details?
DOCTOR: I apologize if I'm asking a lot of questions, Burdette, but these details do help me figure out what's going on. Okay, so mild headache and occasionally unsteady. Now, have you had any changes in your taste or smell recently?
PATIENT: Taste or smell? Really, Doctor? What does that have to do with anything? I eat perfectly adequate meals, thank you very much. And my sense of smell is… functional. I can smell the disinfectant in here, can’t I? Honestly, I’m beginning to question the efficacy of this entire exercise. Are you certain you’ve encountered cases like mine before? It feels rather… unusual.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Burdette. I'm just trying to gather as much information as possible to get a better understanding of what might be happening. Changes in taste or smell can sometimes be related to neurological issues, which is why I ask. Okay, let's move on. Have you had any weakness or numbness in your face, arms, or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness? Numbness? Doctor, I perform delicate surgeries daily. My hands are perfectly steady, thank you very much. I hardly think I would be able to operate if I had weakness or numbness. It’s quite insulting, really, that you would even ask. Honestly, I’m losing patience. Perhaps I should consult with another physician? This is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern and apologize if my questions are frustrating you, Burdette. It’s good that you haven’t noticed any weakness or numbness. It sounds like you're quite capable, which is wonderful. Given the sudden onset of blurry vision and muffled hearing, and to rule out anything serious, I would like to do a quick neurological exam. It's nothing invasive, just a few simple tests to check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… test? Doctor, I assure you, my neurological functions are perfectly intact. I’ve spent decades honing my skills, performing complex procedures… I hardly need a “test” from someone who… well, no offense, but I doubt you’ve handled cases of this… calibre. However, if it will expedite this process, fine. But I expect it to be brief. And I expect a clear explanation of what you find – or, more likely, don’t find. I have a surgery scheduled, remember? This is truly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Of course, Burdette. I understand your concerns. It will be quick, just a few moments. I assure you, it’s simply a standard procedure to rule out any potential issues. First, could you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It's perfectly clear, I can see it perfectly well. Can we please move on? I'm losing valuable time.
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you. Now, I'm going to shine a light in each of your eyes. This just checks the pupils and how they react to light. Okay, good. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient? Honestly, I don't understand what any of this is supposed to prove. My grip is perfectly fine. I wield scalpels, you know. Scalpels!
DOCTOR: Yes, thank you, Burdette. Now, I'm going to gently check your reflexes. I'll tap on your knees with this little hammer. Just relax your legs. Okay. Finally, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. Perfectly normal, wouldn't you agree? I fail to see the point of all this, Doctor. I've told you, I'm perfectly fine. My schedule is rather tight, you know. Are we finished yet? I have patients waiting. And a rather important surgery scheduled for this afternoon. This is… frustrating. Frankly, I'm wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Burdette. Please sit back down. Based on the quick neurological exam, I’m noticing some diminished reflexes, slightly sluggish pupil response, and a mild unsteadiness in your gait. The diminished grip strength is also something to note. While I'm not saying there's anything immediately alarming, these findings, combined with your symptoms of blurry vision and muffled hearing, suggest we need to investigate further. It could be a number of things, but one possibility we need to rule out is a neurological condition. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order an MRI of your brain and a comprehensive audiological evaluation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI? Doctor, are you suggesting I have something… wrong with my brain? That's… preposterous. I am a surgeon! I perform delicate procedures on people's brains for a living! I assure you, my brain is perfectly functional. And an audiological evaluation? Honestly. This is… insulting. I am wasting valuable time here. Fine. If it will get me out of here, fine. Order your tests. But I expect a swift turnaround. I have a surgery scheduled, you understand. I cannot afford to be delayed. And I expect a full explanation of the results. I will not tolerate vague pronouncements or unnecessary alarm. This is… unacceptable. Frankly, I'm beginning to regret coming here at all. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a schedule to maintain.
