DOCTOR: Good morning, Mirriam. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Dr. Glazewski. It is nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… oh, goodness, nearly a week now. Just won't stop! It's a bit embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: A week, that is quite a while for hiccups. I understand how frustrating – and embarrassing – that can be. Let's try to figure out what might be causing them. Could you describe them to me?
PATIENT: Well, they just… come. Like someone gave my insides a little jolt. Not painful, mind you, just… surprising! They happen all throughout the day, really. Sometimes after I eat, sometimes when I’m just sitting and relaxing, sometimes even when I’m talking. There doesn't seem to be any pattern to it, which is what’s so odd. I’ve tried holding my breath, you know, like people always say, but that doesn’t seem to do much good.
DOCTOR: Hmm, no particular triggers, and holding your breath isn't helping. That's good to know. And you said they aren't painful, just… disruptive. Okay. To get a better picture, could you tell me a bit about what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, where to begin? I mostly cook for myself these days. I like a good bowl of porridge with fruit for breakfast. Lunch is usually a sandwich – tuna or cheese, nothing fancy. And dinner… well, it varies. Fish is good, I try to have that a couple of times a week. Chicken, sometimes. Lots of vegetables, always. I do enjoy a small glass of wine with dinner, if you must know! Not every night, mind you. Just when I'm feeling a bit… celebratory.
DOCTOR: That all sounds very sensible, a balanced diet. The wine is good to note, thank you. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… No, not really. No heartburn or indigestion, nothing like that. I haven't felt nauseous or anything. Just… the hiccups. Though, now that you mention it, I have been a little more tired than usual lately. But I figured that was just my age catching up with me! Getting old isn’t for the faint of heart, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. It’s good you've noticed the fatigue. We shouldn’t dismiss anything. And you haven’t experienced any difficulty swallowing, or any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, no trouble swallowing at all. And my appetite is just fine, thank you. I enjoy my food, always have. I eat like a bird, maybe, but I eat regularly. Actually… now that I think about it, I have been feeling a bit… shaky sometimes. Just a little tremor in my hands. It comes and goes, nothing major. I just figured it was the coffee! Old lady and her coffee, you know? But perhaps it’s something more.
DOCTOR: Shakiness is definitely something we should investigate further. And it’s good you’re telling me all of this, Mirriam. Now, have you had any recent changes in your medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, let me see… I take a little something for my blood pressure, been on that for years. And a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said my levels were low. But that's it, really. No changes at all recently. I'm very careful about my pills, you know. Don't like mixing things up! I have a very organised pill box. Very organised!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, being organised is very helpful. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, where to begin? I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing too serious. Pneumonia once, when I was a young woman. And I had a hysterectomy many years ago, back in… oh, goodness, the 1970s, I think it was. And my blood pressure has been a bit high for a while, as I mentioned. Otherwise… I’ve been quite healthy, all things considered! I’ve always been a strong Fijian woman, you know. But age does catch up with us all eventually.
DOCTOR: Yes, age certainly does. And you mentioned a hysterectomy and high blood pressure. Any other surgeries or hospitalizations I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! I had my gallbladder removed, goodness, that must have been… oh, maybe twenty years ago now? And I was in the hospital for a few days with a bad bout of the flu a few years back, but that was just a precaution, really. Nothing major. Otherwise, no. I've been lucky, truly. I've always tried to take care of myself, you know. Good food, fresh air, a bit of sunshine. And a lot of love and laughter. That’s important too.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mirriam. It sounds like you've lived a full and healthy life. Now, thinking about your family, is there anyone who has experienced similar symptoms, like persistent hiccups or shakiness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that’s a good question. My mother… she had hiccups sometimes, but nothing persistent like this. She was a very stoic woman, didn’t complain much. And my brother… he had a bit of a tremor in his hands later in life, but we always thought it was just age. He didn’t go to the doctor much, either. Stubborn man, he was! As for other relatives… I don’t really know. We’re a big family, scattered all over the islands. We don’t see each other often, so I wouldn’t know if anyone else has had similar problems. I do remember my aunt… she had some trouble with her balance when she got older, but that’s all I can think of right now.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never smoked a day in my life. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and I listened to her. As for alcohol… I enjoy a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes, as I mentioned. But it’s just one glass, and not every night. I’m not much of a drinker, really. Prefer a nice cup of tea! A proper Fijian tea, with a little bit of ginger. That’s what I like.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely. Now, Mirriam, I think it's time for a quick physical exam. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and have a look at your overall condition. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement completely. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding! Been to the doctor plenty of times in my 86 years!
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Good, good. Heart sounds are regular, but a little bit faint. Lungs are clear, but breathing is a little bit shallow. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. Not dangerously high, but something we need to keep an eye on. Pulse is a little bit irregular, sometimes fast, sometimes slow. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. I also notice a slight tremor in your hands, as you mentioned. It's subtle, but it's there. Eyes and ears look clear, no obvious abnormalities. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Alright, Mirriam. Everything seems generally okay, but there are a few things that warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Further investigation? That doesn’t sound too good, does it? What sort of investigation are we talking about, Doctor? Is it something serious? I’m not afraid of a little poking and prodding, but I do get worried sometimes. Old lady worries, you know.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Mirriam. Let's not jump to conclusions. “Further investigation” simply means we need to do a few tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The slight irregularity in your pulse, the tremor in your hands, and the persistent hiccups… they could be related to a number of things. I’d like to order a blood test to check your thyroid levels, electrolytes, and kidney function. We should also do an EKG to check your heart rhythm more closely. And, just to be safe, I’d like to order a CT scan of your brain to rule out any underlying neurological issues. These are just precautionary measures, okay?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A CT scan? That sounds… serious. Is it going to hurt? And all that radiation… is it safe? I’ve always been a bit wary of too much medical intervention, you know. I prefer a natural approach to things, if possible. But if you think it’s necessary… I suppose I trust your judgement. What exactly are we looking for with all these tests, Doctor? Are you worried about something in particular? I just like to know what’s going on, you see. Old lady needs to know!
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to ask questions, Mirriam. It’s important you understand everything. A CT scan uses X-rays to create detailed images of your brain. The radiation dose is relatively low, and the benefits of ruling out serious issues outweigh the risks in this case. We're looking for any signs of stroke, tumor, or other neurological conditions that could be causing the hiccups and the tremor. The tremor could also be related to your thyroid levels, so the blood test is important. And we need to rule out any underlying heart issues as well. I understand you prefer a natural approach, and I respect that. But in this case, it's important to be thorough. We need to have a clear picture of what's going on before we can determine the best course of action. Would you like me to explain each test in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Stroke, tumor… that’s… frightening. Yes, please, Doctor. Explain everything to me. The blood test I understand, a little prick and a tube of blood. But this CT scan… what does it feel like? Will it be uncomfortable? And how long will it take? I don’t like being stuck in machines for too long, you see. Claustrophobia, you know. Old lady problems! It’s just… I get worried easily, you see. I’ve always been a bit of a worrier. A little anxious, perhaps. But I’m trying to be brave. I really am.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mirriam. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious about these things. Let's talk about the CT scan. You’ll lie on a comfortable table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. It’s open at both ends, so you won’t be completely enclosed. During the scan, the machine will rotate around you, taking images of your brain. It’s completely painless. You won’t feel anything at all. It’s a bit noisy, like a gentle whirring sound, but we’ll give you earplugs to wear. The scan itself usually takes about 10-15 minutes. You’ll need to lie perfectly still during that time, so it's important to be comfortable. A technician will be right there with you the whole time, monitoring the scan and ensuring your safety. We may also inject a small amount of contrast dye into your vein to help improve the clarity of the images. This can cause a warm sensation in your arm, but it’s usually mild and temporary. Do you have any allergies, particularly to iodine or contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Ten to fifteen minutes… I think I can manage that. As long as someone is right there with me, you said? That’s reassuring. And I’ll try to lie still, I really will. I just get fidgety sometimes, you know. Old lady habits! As for allergies… let me think. I don’t think so. No known allergies to medications or anything like that. And I’ve never had any contrast dye before, so I’ve never reacted to that. But my mother… she had a bit of a reaction to penicillin when she was young, a rash, I think it was. But that was many years ago. And I’m not allergic to penicillin, as far as I know. No, I don’t think I have any allergies that would be a problem. But thank you for asking, Doctor. It’s good to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies, that’s good to know. Okay, Mirriam, so we’ll schedule you for a blood test and a CT scan as soon as possible. I’ll write you a referral for both. The lab and the imaging center will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, if your hiccups worsen, or if you experience any new symptoms like fever, headache, or weakness, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and very patient with me. I appreciate that. It’s just… I’m a bit worried, you know. But I trust your judgement, and I’ll get the tests done as soon as possible. And I’ll be sure to contact you if anything changes. One thing… will the results take long to come back? I don’t like waiting around, you know. Old lady gets impatient! I just want to know what’s going on, you see. It’s the uncertainty that worries me the most. But thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mirriam. I understand your anxiety, and I’ll do everything I can to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. The blood test results usually take 24-48 hours. The CT scan results may take a bit longer, usually 2-3 business days, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. My office will contact you as soon as the results are available. And please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I want you to feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. Here are the referrals for the blood test and CT scan. Do you have any difficulty getting transportation to the lab and imaging center?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. 2-3 business days… I can manage that, I think. My daughter lives nearby, she usually helps me with transportation. She’s a good girl, very helpful. She’ll take me to the appointments, and she can help me understand the results, if needed. No, I don’t think I need any help with transportation, thank you. But thank you for asking, Doctor. You’ve been very thoughtful. I think that’s all I need for now. You’ve answered all my questions, and you’ve put my mind at ease a little. Thank you again, Doctor Glazewski. You’re a very kind and patient man. I’ll get these tests done as soon as possible, and I’ll contact you if anything changes. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mirriam. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we’ll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and have a good day as well.
