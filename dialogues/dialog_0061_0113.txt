DOCTOR: Bula! Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kimm. It's lovely to meet you, Arlan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, hello Doctor… Kimm, is it? Well, it’s this… going to the bathroom. Too much. That’s what my wife, bless her heart, told me to come in for. Seems I’m always running off to the little boy’s room. It’s… inconvenient, to say the least. Don't know what’s brought it on, though. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arlan, I understand. Frequent urination can definitely be inconvenient. It’s good your wife encouraged you to come in – it’s always best to get these things checked out, even if it is potentially just part of getting older. To help me figure out what's going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm. More about it… well, like I said, just… more often. Especially at night. Wakes me up, you know? Used to sleep like a log, I did. Now it’s… up, down, up, down. Not painful, exactly. Just… a need. And it’s not like a weak stream or anything. It’s a normal amount, just… frequently. I don't know what you want to know exactly. It’s just… a thing old men deal with, isn't it?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds frustrating to have your sleep disrupted like that. And you’re right, frequent urination can be more common as we get older, but we still want to rule out other causes. When you say “more often,” roughly how many times would you say you're going to the bathroom during the day, and how many times at night?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers… I’m not good with numbers. Let me think. During the day… maybe every couple of hours? Three, four times, maybe? Hard to say. I’m not keeping a tally, you know. And at night… oh, at least twice. Sometimes three times. Could be more. My wife does most of the remembering around here, and she’s not here now. It's probably more than it used to be, that much I know. Used to be able to sleep through the whole night, straight. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, three to four times during the day and two or three times at night, and definitely a change from being able to sleep through the night. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the frequent urination?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmmm. Let me think. No pain, like I said. Not burning or anything like that. Sometimes… sometimes a little bit of dribbling after I finish. Not a lot, just… a few drops. And… now that you mention it, I feel like I don't empty my bladder completely sometimes. Like there's still a little left in there. But maybe that’s just my imagination. I'm not as sharp as I used to be, you know. Everything gets a little… foggy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain or burning, some dribbling after you urinate, and a feeling of incomplete emptying. That’s good information. Do you have any difficulty starting your urination?
PATIENT: Difficulty starting… not really. It starts okay. Not like a struggle or anything. Just… normal. I push, and it goes. No waiting around for it to kick in. It's not that bad, Doctor. I just wish I didn't have to go so often. It’s a nuisance, more than anything. Makes it hard to go places. Don't want to be constantly looking for a bathroom, you know? Especially when I'm out with the grandkids.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like it’s impacting your quality of life, and that’s definitely worth addressing. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Hmm. Well, my blood pressure's been a little high for a while now, the doctor back home told me. I take a little pill for it, every morning. Can't remember the name of it, though. And… I think I had a touch of the flu a couple of years back, but that’s about it. Nothing serious. Mostly just… old age aches and pains. I wouldn’t say I’ve got any conditions, per se. Just… getting old. Is that a condition?
DOCTOR: Getting older is a process, that’s for sure! And high blood pressure is a condition we’ll definitely want to keep track of. Do you know what the name of that medication is, or roughly what it looks like?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s a little white pill, I think. Small. And… it has a line down the middle. That’s about all I remember. My wife handles the pills, you see. She keeps them all organized. I just take what she gives me. Can't be bothered with remembering names and dosages. Makes my head spin. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not much help with this part. Perhaps you should ask my wife. She’d know everything.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Arlan. It’s very common for patients to rely on family for medication management. We can certainly check your medication list in our system, or if needed, we can reach out to your wife for clarification. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… now that you mention it… yes! Years ago. A long time ago. Appendicitis, when I was a young man. Had to have it taken out. That was… unpleasant. And… I think I was in the hospital once for a bad bout of pneumonia, but that was ages ago. Everything’s a bit of a blur, honestly. It was before my wife and I moved to this town. Back in Ukraine, it was… different. The doctors weren’t as… helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so an appendectomy and a hospitalization for pneumonia. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like diabetes, heart disease, or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Prostate problems… hmm. My father… yes, I think he had something like that. Trouble… going to the bathroom, I believe. Had to have some sort of procedure, but I don’t remember the details. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about these things much back then. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. Died when I was still young. And my wife… her father had diabetes. He lost a leg to it. Sad story, that was. Everything seems to run in families, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It often does, Arlan. Okay, so a history of prostate issues in your father, heart problems in your mother, and diabetes in your wife’s father. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife wouldn’t allow it. She’s a very sensible woman, that one. Always looking out for my health. She says it’s important to live a long life, so we can enjoy our grandchildren. And I agree with her, of course. Smoking is a terrible habit. Always makes me cough just seeing someone smoke.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… well, I enjoy a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Red wine. Good for the heart, they say. But nothing excessive. Just a small glass. My wife and I, we used to drink a little more when we were younger, but we’ve cut back. It's better for our health, you know? And keeps my wife happy. She always says, "Everything in moderation, Arlan!" And she's right, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a small glass of red wine with dinner. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never had any trouble with medications. Sometimes I get a little… itchy, but that’s about it. And I’m not allergic to any foods, as far as I know. My wife always makes sure I’m eating healthy, so I don’t have much opportunity to eat anything that might give me an allergy. She's very careful, that one. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a pretty simple man. Don’t have many allergies or conditions. Just… getting old. I think that’s about it. Is that enough questions? My back is starting to ache.
DOCTOR: Yes, Arlan, that’s plenty of information. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a brief neurological exam. Then I’ll need to do a digital rectal exam to check your prostate. I know that can be uncomfortable, but it’s an important part of evaluating your symptoms. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: A… digital… what now? Exam? You want to… check my… there? Oh, dear. That doesn't sound very pleasant. Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? I mean, I've already told you everything I know. And my back is really starting to ache. Perhaps we could skip that part? Honestly, I don’t think poking around there is going to tell you anything useful. My wife always said doctors like to poke around too much. Is there another way?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Arlan. You’re right, it’s not the most pleasant exam, and I wouldn't suggest it if it wasn't important. However, given your symptoms – the frequent urination, the feeling of incomplete emptying, and the family history of prostate issues – it’s important for me to assess the size and condition of your prostate. It helps me determine if there might be an enlargement or other problem contributing to your symptoms. We can discuss alternatives, but without a physical exam, it's difficult to get a complete picture. We could order a urine test to check for infection, and a blood test to check your kidney function. But those tests don’t give me as much information about your prostate. If you're still very uncomfortable, we can focus on the other tests for now. But I would strongly recommend considering the digital rectal exam at some point. We can take things slowly and make sure you’re as comfortable as possible. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. This is all so… complicated. I just wanted someone to tell me why I have to go to the bathroom so much! My wife would want me to get it checked out, I suppose. She’s always right. But it really doesn’t sound very pleasant. Alright, alright. If you insist. But be gentle, Doctor. And go slowly. And tell me if it's going to hurt. I don't want any surprises. Honestly, I don't know why they have to do these things. Just… get it over with quickly, please. And maybe give me a little something to relax first? Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Arlan. We will take things very slowly, and I will explain everything as we go. I'll be as gentle as possible. And no, we don't have anything to relax you specifically for this exam, but I promise to be very careful. Before we begin, I'll explain the procedure again. You'll lie on your side with your knees bent. I'll wear a gloved, lubricated finger and gently insert it into your rectum to feel the size, shape, and texture of your prostate. It shouldn’t be painful, but you might feel some pressure or a slight urge to urinate. Are you ready to proceed?
PATIENT: Alright. Alright, let’s get it over with. Just… hurry, please. And tell me what you’re doing as you go. I don’t like surprises. And… be gentle. Very gentle. My wife is going to hear about this, you know. Just… let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arlan. You can lie on your side with your knees bent up towards your chest. That will help you relax. I’m going to put a little lubricant on this gloved finger. It will make it easier and more comfortable. Okay, here we go. I’m going to gently insert my finger. Just try to relax as much as possible. This will only take a minute. I'm feeling your prostate now. It feels… slightly enlarged. The texture is a bit firm, but not particularly hard. There are no obvious lumps or areas of tenderness. Okay, I’m going to remove my finger now. There we go. That wasn’t too bad, was it?
PATIENT: Oh… that was… not pleasant. Not pleasant at all. It felt… intrusive. And a bit cold. But… I suppose it’s over now. Slightly enlarged, you say? What does that mean? Is it serious? Am I going to need… surgery? My wife is going to be very worried. Tell me straight, Doctor. Is it something to be concerned about?
DOCTOR: It's understandable that you found that uncomfortable, Arlan. It's not a pleasant exam by any means. Slightly enlarged simply means your prostate is a bit bigger than average. This is very common as men age. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it can cause symptoms like frequent urination, difficulty starting your stream, and the feeling of incomplete emptying, which are what you’ve been experiencing. It's often a condition called Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH for short. It’s not cancer, and it's not immediately life-threatening. Whether or not you need surgery depends on the severity of your symptoms and how much they’re impacting your quality of life. We're not at that point yet. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few tests. First, a urine test to rule out any infection. Second, a PSA blood test. PSA stands for prostate-specific antigen, and it can help us detect any signs of inflammation or cancer. And finally, a flow rate test, where you'll urinate into a special container to measure the strength and speed of your stream. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: More tests? Honestly, Doctor, I feel like a science experiment. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary. My wife always said it’s better to be safe than sorry. So, yes. Order the tests. Whatever you think is best. A flow rate test? What does that involve? Do I have to… go now? Because I just went before the… exam. This is all very inconvenient. And a bit embarrassing. But… alright. Do what you need to do. Just… try to be quick about it. And tell me the results as soon as you have them. I don’t want to be kept waiting. My wife is going to want to know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Arlan. It does feel like a lot, and I apologize for that. We'll try to make it as quick and easy as possible. For the flow rate test, you'll simply urinate into a special container, just like you would at home. We'll measure the volume and speed of your stream. It’s a painless test, and we can do it here in the clinic. Since you just went, you might need to drink a glass or two of water to make sure you have enough to test. It’s best to wait about 15-20 minutes after drinking the water before starting the test. I’ll have the nurse come in and explain the details to you. Once we have the results of these tests, we can discuss the best course of action. We’ll go over everything together, and I’ll answer any questions you have. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s enough for now. Just… get the nurse in here. I want to get this over with. And… please, tell her to be gentle. I’m not getting any younger, you know. Just… hurry. This is all very inconvenient. And a bit embarrassing. But… alright. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Arlan. I'll have the nurse come in right away. She's very gentle and will explain everything carefully. We’ll take things at your pace. Nurse Davies! Could you please come in and assist Mr. Segretto with the flow rate test?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, Arlan, I’ll let Nurse Davies explain the process. Please let me know if you have any concerns.
