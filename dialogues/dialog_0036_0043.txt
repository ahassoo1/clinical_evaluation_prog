DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been getting. Right in the back of my head, see? It’s been botherin’ me for…oh, I’d say about a week now. Not constant, comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache for about a week, coming and going, located in the back of your head. Can you describe the headache for me?
PATIENT: Hmm, describe it…well, it’s not a throbbing pain, not like a migraine my daughter used to get. It’s more…a dull ache. Like a weight, kinda. And sometimes it feels…tight, like a band around my head. Not awful, but enough to make me focus on it, you know? It doesn't make me sick or anything, just…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Right, a dull ache, like a weight or a tight band, not throbbing, and no nausea. That's helpful. Does anything seem to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Let me think……Lying down seems to help a little. And when I’m busy, workin’ on somethin’, I forget about it sometimes. But…stress, definitely makes it worse. My grandson’s been havin’ some trouble at school, and worryin’ about that…yeah, that brings it on quick. And bright lights…maybe? I haven’t really paid attention to that, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying down helps, being busy distracts you, stress makes it worse, and possibly bright lights. Do you notice it at a certain time of day?
PATIENT: Now that's a good question. You know, I think…it's usually worse in the evenings. After I’ve been on the computer for a while, workin’ with numbers and such. And like I said, when I’m frettin’ about things, doesn’t matter what time it is, really. But evenings…that’s when I notice it the most, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly evenings, especially after computer work, and when stressed. Now, let's talk a little more broadly. Have you had headaches like this before, or is this new?
PATIENT: No, not quite like this. I used to get tension headaches, back when I was workin' a different job, more physical labor. Those were more in my forehead, around my temples. This feels…different. Deeper, in the back of my head. I haven’t had one like this in…oh, must be twenty years, at least. That old job was stressful too, but this feels…well, it feels older, if that makes sense. Like it's comin' from somethin' different.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. A change in the type of headache after many years is good to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Let me see……I've been a little more tired than usual, I suppose. But I’m 84, Doctor! I’m supposed to be tired. My vision’s been a little blurry sometimes, but I’ve always had trouble with my eyes. I wear glasses, you see. No dizziness, no weakness, no fever…nothing like that. Just the headache and a bit of fatigue.
DOCTOR: Okay, headache and some fatigue, but no other new symptoms like dizziness, weakness, or fever. That’s helpful. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got it under control with medication. Stopped takin’ it a few years ago, blood pressure's been good ever since. Had a touch of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just old age, I figure. Nothing serious, nothin' that needed a lot of treatment. And I’ve never been in the hospital for anything major. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ older, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of controlled high blood pressure and some arthritis, but nothing major. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had surgery. Always been lucky that way, I guess. Broke my arm when I was a little boy, fallin’ out of a tree, but they just put it in a cast. No cuttin’ or nothin’. My wife, now she had a hip replacement, but I haven’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every day. And sometimes, when the headache gets bad, I’ll take a couple of Tylenol. But not regularly, just when I really need it. Maybe once or twice a week, if that. Not a lot. I try not to take too many pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright, a multivitamin and occasional Tylenol for the headache. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife tried it once, back when we were young, but she didn't like it. No, never been a smoker. Always thought it was a silly habit. And I don't drink much alcohol either. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s about it. Mostly just water, to be honest. Gotta stay hydrated, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking and very limited alcohol. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I've been stung by bees a few times, but just got a little swollen. No trouble breathin' or nothin'. No, I don't think I have any allergies, Doctor. My wife had some trouble with pollen, but I always took it easy around flowers. She loved her garden.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam. It’ll just take a few minutes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Sounds fine to me, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m used to doctor visits at my age. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Your blood pressure is a little bit high today, but that could be from being at the clinic, or worryin’ about the headache. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart and lungs sound good. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and your coordination. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Sure thing, Doctor. Like this? Is that good? I sometimes have a little trouble with my vision, so if it's blurry, you just let me know.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Your eye movements are normal. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that too hard? I don’t want to break anything! I used to have pretty strong hands, workin’ with tools and such. They ain’t what they used to be, though.
DOCTOR: That’s good, good. A little weaker than they used to be, but that’s normal for your age. Now, can you tap your finger to your nose with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that alright? It’s a little harder with my eyes closed, you know. Sometimes I get a little unsteady. I think I got it…mostly.
DOCTOR: That's okay, that's okay. A little unsteady, but nothing to be overly concerned about. Now, I'm going to check your cranial nerves. Can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Like that, Doctor? I used to be told I had a pretty good smile. My wife always liked it.
DOCTOR: Good. And can you stick your tongue out?
PATIENT: Like this, Doctor? Is that straight enough? Sometimes it feels a little…crooked.
DOCTOR: Good. Everything seems to be working alright. Okay, Mr. Gibbel, everything looks fairly normal on the exam. Your neurological function is a little slower than you might expect, but that’s not uncommon at your age. The mild dysmetria could be due to several things, and given your age and the nature of your symptoms, it’s not particularly concerning at this point. However, because your headache is new, and you mentioned the fatigue, I would like to order a few tests just to rule out anything serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Sounds sensible to me, Doctor. Better safe than sorry, as they say. What kind of tests are you thinkin’? I don’t mind a little poking and proddin’ if it’ll give us peace of mind. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do to prepare.
DOCTOR: Good. I’d like to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney and electrolyte levels, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level to check your thyroid function. And because of the headache, I’d like to get a CT scan of your head, without contrast, to rule out any structural problems. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Those all sound…reasonable, Doctor. A CT scan, huh? Never had one of those before. Is it somethin’ painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I’ve got a bit of a schedule, you know, helpin’ my daughter with the grandkids and such. I just want to make sure I understand what’s involved.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. The CT scan is not painful at all. You'll lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. It takes just a few minutes, and you won't feel anything. We'll need to make sure you don't have any metal implants before we proceed, but based on your history, that shouldn't be a problem. As for the results, the lab work should be back within a day or two. The CT scan results will take a little longer, probably 2-3 business days. I'll have the nurse schedule you for the tests as soon as possible. In the meantime, you can continue taking Tylenol as needed for the headache, but try not to exceed the recommended dosage. And if the headache gets significantly worse, or you develop any new symptoms, like fever, weakness, or vision changes, please come back to the clinic immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: That all sounds…manageable, Doctor. No metal implants, thankfully. A few days isn’t too bad. And I’ll be careful with the Tylenol. And I will come back if anything changes, you can count on that. Thank you for explainin' everything so clearly. You've put my mind at ease a bit. So, should I just wait for the nurse to call with the schedule? And is there anything I need to do to prepare for the tests? Like, should I fast or anything?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gibbel. I’m glad I could help. Yes, just wait for the nurse to call with the scheduling information. For the blood work, you will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours beforehand, meaning no food or drinks except water. For the CT scan, you can eat and drink normally. The nurse will provide you with detailed instructions when she calls. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything so well. I'll just wait for the nurse to call, then. Thank you again for your help, Doctor Bacy. It was nice meeting you.
DOCTOR: It was nice meeting you too, Mr. Gibbel. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, if anything changes, come back to the clinic right away. Have a good day, and take care.
