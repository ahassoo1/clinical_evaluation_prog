DOCTOR: Right, Evann Buoniconte. 35, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Though... honestly, dates and such don't always stick with me as well as they should. I apologize if I seem…vague. I’m here about… paperwork, I believe? Something to do with making sure my wishes are known, should… something happen. I was told this was the place to get it sorted.
DOCTOR: Paperwork. Honestly. Alright. So, advance directives, living will, that sort of thing?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Or... a POLST form, perhaps? I recall the woman on the phone mentioning both, and I honestly don't know the difference between them. I just want to be prepared, you see. And… ensure things are as straightforward as possible for everyone involved. If that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Look, I've got patients waiting. We don’t have time to go over every nuance of estate planning. A POLST is for very specific situations – if you're seriously ill and can't speak for yourself. A living will is… broader. Do you have a serious condition now?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I am… quite healthy, actually. Perhaps that is why I am finding this so confusing. I don't have any…ongoing illnesses. I simply thought it prudent to have something in place, you know? Prevent any…difficult decisions later. I was told it’s easier to do before something happens, rather than during… a crisis. I apologize for taking up your time, Doctor. Perhaps I misunderstood what was needed.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, if you’re perfectly healthy… this is really a matter for a lawyer, not a physician. We deal with medical situations. Frankly, I'm not sure why you were sent here. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. A lawyer… I hadn’t considered that. That… complicates things. I suppose I was hoping to avoid all that. Allergies? Um… I don’t think so. Nothing significant, anyway. I've never had a…reaction, not that I recall. Dust bothers me a little, sometimes, but that's hardly an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: Dust isn't a medical allergy. Anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing else comes to mind. I… truly don’t have a good memory for such details. Medications? I haven’t taken anything regularly in… years. Perhaps a pain reliever for a headache now and then, but nothing prescribed. I feel rather foolish, coming here like this. I clearly don’t understand the process. Are you able to recommend someone? A lawyer, I mean, who deals with these sorts of things?
DOCTOR: There's a pamphlet in the waiting room with referrals. Honestly, I really must see other patients. Do you have any family history of…anything?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… a difficult question. I wasn't particularly close to my family, and I… don’t recall anyone having any major illnesses. My mother passed away when I was young, and I didn't know my father. I… I’m sorry, I'm not being very helpful, am I? It’s just… memories are a little… fragmented. I apologize for wasting your time, Doctor Osga. Perhaps I should just take that pamphlet.
DOCTOR: Look, you're perfectly healthy, no allergies, minimal medical history. You don't need to be here. Take the pamphlet. And perhaps think carefully about who you are sending you to doctors for things that aren’t…medical problems. Next patient.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I understand. Thank you… I’ll just take the pamphlet. And I apologize again for the inconvenience. .
