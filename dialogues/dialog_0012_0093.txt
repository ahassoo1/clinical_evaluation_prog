DOCTOR: Hi Chanz, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, to be honest, I don't really remember making an appointment. Something about…sleep? And, uh, feeling a bit better, I guess. It's all a bit hazy. My wife…she usually handled all this sort of thing. It’s been a while, you know? I just figured I should probably get checked out, since someone booked me in.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Chanz. It sounds like things have been a bit stressful, and appointments can easily slip your mind. No worries at all that you don't remember specifically. It’s good you’re here. So, “sleep” and “feeling a bit better”...can you tell me more about what's been going on with your sleep?
PATIENT: Ugh, sleep. It’s just…not right. I wake up a lot. Not necessarily tired, just…aware. Like I'm barely sleeping at all, even if I’m in bed for eight hours. And then I'm just…there. Thinking. Mostly about…things. Doesn't feel restful, if that makes sense. I used to fall asleep instantly. Now? Forget it. I toss and turn. It's probably just old age creeping up, honestly. I'm not a spring chicken anymore, you know? Though I do keep myself pretty lean.
DOCTOR: It's good you're keeping yourself lean, that's definitely a positive! But 29 isn't old age by any means – plenty of time for good sleep still. And it is frustrating when sleep changes. So, you’re waking up frequently during the night, feeling alert, and it doesn't feel restorative. About how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. How long…that's a good question. Probably…since…well, since she passed. It’s all sort of blurred together, to be honest. A year? Maybe a little more? It’s hard to keep track. It wasn’t immediately after, mind you. But it’s definitely gotten worse over time. It's not like I'm dragging myself through the day or anything, but I just…don’t feel sharp, you know? Like I'm missing something. I used to be able to fix anything with my eyes closed. Now I have to really concentrate. And even then…sometimes things slip my mind.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve been through a very difficult time, and grief can absolutely disrupt sleep and cognitive function. It’s completely normal for things to be affected, and it sounds like this has been a gradual change. You mentioned feeling less "sharp" and some memory lapses. Would you say these memory issues are more like forgetting where you put things, or trouble recalling events, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not like I'm losing my mind or anything! It's more…details. Like, I’ll be working on a clarinet, and I'll suddenly forget which screw I needed next. Or I'll go into the workshop to get a tool and completely blank on what tool I needed. It's frustrating. I've always prided myself on my attention to detail. And it’s not the big things, thankfully. I remember…important stuff. Mostly. It's just…small things slipping through the cracks. Really annoying small things. And I hate asking people to repeat themselves, you know? It feels…weak.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's more frequent forgetfulness of smaller details, specifically related to tasks and things you’re actively working on. That’s helpful to know. And I completely understand your frustration – it's very common to feel that way when experiencing memory changes. It's good you're aware of it. Now, to get a better picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history? Ugh. Honestly, I don't really have one. I've always been healthy as a horse. Never been a big fan of doctors, if I'm being honest. A few colds here and there, maybe. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I think. But that's about it. No chronic illnesses, no major surgeries. My wife always kept track of all that sort of thing, and…well, she’s gone now. I really don't know. I think I'm on Medicare, just because…well, everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so relatively healthy past medical history, tonsillectomy as a child. That’s good to know. And it’s understandable that things are a bit unclear right now. You mentioned being on Medicare. Do you know if you have any specific conditions listed with Medicare, or if you’ve seen any other specialists recently?
PATIENT: Honestly? No clue. She did all the paperwork. I just…signed where she told me to. I vaguely remember something about a cardiologist appointment a couple years back, but that was her pushing me to get checked out. Said my blood pressure was a little high, but I felt fine. I never followed up. I hate waiting rooms. And doctors telling me what to do. Honestly, I'm probably perfectly fine. It's probably just stress, or…old age. Or lack of sleep. It's all connected, probably. I just wish I could remember things properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially a cardiologist appointment a couple of years ago for slightly elevated blood pressure, but no follow-up. And you're experiencing stress and sleep difficulties. It's good you’re acknowledging these things. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I don’t believe in filling my body with all those chemicals. Vitamins? Maybe a multivitamin, occasionally. She bought them, you know. Said I wasn’t getting enough…something. But I can’t really remember. I stopped taking them when…well, when she stopped buying them. I drink a lot of tea, if that counts. Herbal tea. Chamomile, mostly. Trying to calm my nerves. It doesn't really work, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no regular medications, occasional multivitamin, and chamomile tea. That's helpful to know. Now, to get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Ugh. See, this is where it gets tricky. My family's…complicated. Lots of siblings, scattered all over the place. I haven’t really kept in touch with most of them. I know my father had…something with his heart, I think. But I don’t know the details. And my mother…she had a bit of trouble remembering things when she got older, but I don't know if it was anything serious. Just…old age, probably. Honestly, I don’t think anyone in my family lived to be very old, if that tells you anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some potential heart issues in your father, and possible memory issues in your mother as she aged. It's helpful to have that information, even if it's limited. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol… I’ll have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Nothing heavy. Usually red wine. It helps me relax. Recreational drugs? Don't be ridiculous. I'm a musician, not a…well, you know. I need a clear head to fix these instruments. Can't be messing around with…those things. Honestly, I have a pretty quiet life. Work, tea, maybe a bit of reading. It’s not exactly wild.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And it sounds like you maintain a relatively healthy lifestyle. One last thing for now, before we move onto a physical exam. Can you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Work? Well, I repair musical instruments. Mostly woodwinds – clarinets, oboes, bassoons. I've been doing it since I was a kid. My father taught me. It’s…detailed work. Requires a lot of concentration. Used to be incredibly satisfying, but lately…it’s been harder. Like I said, I’m forgetting things. And I just don’t have the patience I used to. It's a bit frustrating, to be honest. I've been doing this for so long, you know? It's all I know. I have my own workshop, small place downtown. It's…quiet.
DOCTOR: It sounds like a very skilled profession, and one that requires a lot of precision. And it’s understandable that you’re finding it frustrating if you’re experiencing difficulties with concentration and memory. Okay, Chanz, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and see if anything obvious is going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Whatever. I guess it can't hurt. Just…try to be quick, alright? I don't really have a high tolerance for…waiting around.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll do my best to be as efficient as possible. First, I'm going to check your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. I'm just wrapping this cuff around your arm now. Relax your arm, and try to breathe normally. Okay… blood pressure is 142/88. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiration rate is 16 breaths per minute. Blood pressure is a little elevated, which is something we can discuss later. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but there's a slight murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. I’m also going to do a quick neurological exam. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, I can follow your finger. No problem. It's a bit…disorienting, to be honest. This whole thing is a bit… unnecessary. I feel perfectly fine, you know? I just… forget things sometimes. It's not like I'm falling apart or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Happy? I'm squeezing. It's…getting a bit tedious, honestly. Can we just…skip to the part where you tell me what's wrong with me? Or, more likely, tell me there's nothing wrong with me and I'm just being a hypochondriac.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a few more quick tests. I'm going to check your balance now. Can you stand up and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Woah, woah, hold on! See? This is ridiculous. I’m getting dizzy. I told you I was fine. This whole thing is just…making me feel worse. Can we please just stop now?
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, let’s sit back down. That’s enough for now. It’s good we stopped when you started to feel unsteady. I see you're experiencing some imbalance. That, combined with the elevated blood pressure and slight heart murmur, is something we need to investigate further. I'm not saying there's anything serious wrong, but it's important to rule things out. You mentioned some forgetfulness as well. It's good we’re getting a clearer picture. Now, I want to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. I also want to get an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. And, given the imbalance, I'd like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive neurological evaluation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests. Just what I needed. Fine. Whatever. If it’ll get me out of here, I guess. But honestly, I still think this is all a waste of time. I just… forget things. It happens. It doesn’t mean I’m falling apart. Look, just… tell me what I need to do, alright? Where do I go for these tests? And how long is this all going to take? I have… things to do. I need to fix a clarinet, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Chanz. We’ll get this sorted as quickly as possible. I'm going to print out a lab requisition for the blood work. You can go to the lab at [Name of local lab], located at [Address]. They’re open from 8am to 5pm, Monday through Friday. You don’t need an appointment. It will take about 30 minutes. For the EKG, you can schedule an appointment with the cardiology department at [Name of local hospital/clinic] at [Phone number]. And I’m going to give you a referral to Dr. [Neurologist’s name], a neurologist here in town. Her office number is [Phone number]. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. I’m also going to prescribe you a low-dose medication for your blood pressure. It’s just to help bring it down to a healthier level. It's a common medication, and the side effects are usually minimal. I’ll give you a prescription for that as well. I want you to follow up with me in two weeks, once you've had the tests done, so we can discuss the results and create a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Two weeks… Fine. I guess. As long as it doesn’t take much longer. Honestly, this whole thing is incredibly inconvenient. I have a business to run, you know? People rely on me. Look, I’m not a fan of doctors or tests or medications. Just… tell me if there’s something seriously wrong with me, alright? Don’t beat around the bush. And if everything’s normal, then please, just let me get back to my life. I have a clarinet that needs fixing. That's all I care about. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Chanz. I assure you, I’ll be straightforward with you. We’ll work through this together, and if everything turns out to be normal, we’ll get you back to your life as quickly as possible. Here’s my card, with my contact information. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks. Please remember to take the medication as prescribed. .
