DOCTOR: Alright. Dawnetta, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Dawnetta Hatchard. And honestly, I haven’t got all day. I take it you’ll be quick? It’s just… well, it’s the stool. Black. Not normal, is it?
DOCTOR: No, black stool isn’t… ideal. Though people do get worked up over things. Now, let's not jump to conclusions. It could be something simple, like something you ate. But yes, we need to figure out what’s going on. When did you first notice this?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it was… maybe a week ago? Give or take. Honestly, I don't keep a calendar of my… output. And it's not like I'm thrilled to remember it, you know? It was after I had that roast beef… no, wait, it was after the liver and onions. Yes, definitely the liver and onions. Though, it could have been the roast beef before that… Honestly, I eat a lot of meat. And I take my pills. The red ones. For my arthritis. Every day. For years. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Right. So, a week ago, after liver and onions… or possibly roast beef. And you take red pills for arthritis. Years, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, years! Since… oh, goodness, since before my Harold retired. That was… twenty years ago now, wasn’t it? Maybe more. And they’re strong pills. The doctor – old Dr. Abernathy, bless his soul – said they were the best. They keep me going, you know? I wouldn't be able to garden without them. But maybe… maybe they have something to do with this… business. I don't know. Are you going to poke and prod me? Because I really don't have time for that.
DOCTOR: We may need to do a quick examination, yes. Just to get a better picture. It's unlikely to be painful, just…routine. And Dr. Abernathy's prescriptions are…well, let’s just say medical practices evolve. First, let's talk about other symptoms. Have you felt weak?
PATIENT: Weak? Goodness, I'm seventy-three! Of course I’m weak! I get tired carrying the gardening tools, and Harold doesn’t help much anymore. He just sits and watches television. But that’s just… old age, isn’t it? I haven’t fainted or anything. Or bled. It's just… the stool. And it’s black, like… like tar. And frankly, it's unsettling. Are you sure these pills aren't the problem? I don't want to have to stop taking them. My knees would be awful.
DOCTOR: Well, black, tarry stool can indicate bleeding in the upper digestive tract. But it's not always the case. We need to rule things out. Do you have any nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Nausea? No. Not really. I get a bit queasy sometimes if I eat too much cabbage, but that's just… cabbage. And I haven't thrown up in years. Not since that dodgy seafood at the church picnic. Honestly, I'm a very healthy eater, despite what I said about the meat. Everything in moderation, you know? Except maybe the gardening. I do a lot of bending. Is that relevant? Honestly, I don’t understand why you're asking so many questions. Are you going to give me something for this, or not?
DOCTOR: We're trying to get a complete picture, Mrs. Hatchard. It’s important. And no, I can’t “give you something” without knowing what we’re dealing with. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just a listen to your abdomen, check your reflexes... and I'll need to take a stool sample. Have you brought one with you?
PATIENT: A stool sample? Goodness gracious. No, I didn’t bring a… a specimen! Do you expect me to walk around with a… a container? That’s ridiculous! And frankly, rather…indelicate. I’ll have to go home for that? That's going to take all afternoon! And Harold will be wanting his dinner. Honestly, I think I’m getting a headache. This is all very… upsetting. Is there anything else I need to do? Can’t you just… give me something to settle my stomach? Or maybe a stronger pill for my arthritis?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Hatchard, a stool sample is essential to determine the cause of the black stool. It's a standard procedure. We can provide a collection kit here, and you can use the restroom. It's not pleasant, but it's necessary. Until we have that, I can't recommend any treatment. We need to rule out serious causes first. And I can assure you, I will not prescribe anything without a proper diagnosis. Are you able to collect a sample now?
PATIENT: Goodness gracious. Fine. Fine! But I expect a very quick turnaround on this. And I don’t want Harold complaining about his dinner being late. Honestly, this is all a bit much. And if it turns out to be something simple, like the liver and onions, I’m going to be very cross. Where is this… kit? And please, be discreet. I have my reputation to consider. Honestly, the indignity of it all!
DOCTOR: Restroom is down the hall, first door on the left. The kit is on the counter. I'll be waiting. And please, try to relax. .
