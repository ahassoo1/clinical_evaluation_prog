DOCTOR: Hi Claudene, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my water. It’s been… bothering me. Again. It feels… not right. I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it’s been happening on and off for… a while now. A long while. Is that enough information? I want to be quick, if that's alright.
DOCTOR: It is alright, take your time. “Not right” is a good start. When you say “bothering you”, can you describe what that feels like exactly?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Describing… hmm. It’s… like a burning. A burning when I… go to the bathroom. And it feels… urgent. Like I have to go, even when I just went. It's very unpleasant. I don’t like it at all. It happens… down there, of course. Is that… helpful? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at explaining things. It just… hurts.
DOCTOR: No, you're explaining perfectly fine, Claudene. A burning sensation with urgency – that's very helpful. And it’s located ‘down there’, as you said. Has the burning been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Definitely comes and goes. Some days I don’t even think about it. And then… suddenly… it's back. Quite suddenly, sometimes. And then it’s… well, uncomfortable for a bit. I can’t really say how long. Everything feels a bit blurry, you see. Days just… blend together. Is it important how long it lasts? I just want this to be over with, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: I understand wanting to get to the bottom of this quickly. Knowing how long it lasts can be helpful. Roughly, when it's bothering you, would you say it’s a few hours, a full day, several days?
PATIENT: Oh… several days, I think. Yes. Several days it bothers me. Then it goes away for… I don’t know… a week? Maybe more? It's hard to remember. It’s been happening… on and off for… a long time. I’ve had this happen before, you know. Years ago. I just… hoped it wouldn't come back. Is this going to take long, Doctor? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, several days at a time, then a break for potentially a week or more. And this has happened before, years ago. Thank you for letting me know. To get a clearer picture, let's talk about a few other things, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes… in my water? Oh dear. What kind of changes? I… I don’t really look at it, Doctor. Honestly. I just… go. Is it important to look at it? I’ve never been told to do that before. It’s usually… yellow, I suppose. Normal yellow. Unless… oh. Sometimes it’s… darker. A bit reddish, perhaps. But not always. I don’t know if that’s important. Everything feels so… confusing.
DOCTOR: It is okay if you don’t usually look, Claudene. But the fact that you've noticed it being darker or reddish sometimes is important. That suggests there might be a little bit of blood in your urine, and we want to figure out why. Do you have any pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Pain… yes. Sometimes. A dull ache in my back. Lower back. Not all the time, though. Just… sometimes when I’ve been standing for a long time. Or lifting things. I don't lift heavy things, mind you. Just… groceries. Or little things around the house. Is that… bad? I’m getting rather worried now. I just wanted something to make it stop, not… a whole investigation.
DOCTOR: It's good you're telling me everything, Claudene. The lower back pain, especially with standing or lifting, is something else we’ll want to consider. Now, a few questions about your overall health. Have you had any fever or chills recently?
PATIENT: Fever… chills? Hmm. I don't think so. I haven't felt hot, not recently. And no shivering, no. I’ve been feeling… tired, I suppose. But I’m old, Doctor. I’m always a bit tired. Is that… relevant? I’m sorry, I’m not being very helpful, am I? I really just want this to be over with. Can we… get to a solution soon?
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Claudene. Tiredness is common, but it’s good to mention everything. Now, thinking about your medical history – do you have any long-term medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Medical… history. Let me think. High… blood pressure, yes. I think so. The doctor told me a long time ago. I take a pill for it. A little white pill. Every morning. But everything is a bit of a blur, you see. And… no, I don’t think I have anything else. Kidney problems… no. I don’t think so. I had a divorce, if that counts as medical history. It was a very long time ago. I just want to feel better, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with a little white pill, that’s good to know. And thank you for sharing. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh… surgeries. Yes. A long time ago. I had my gallbladder out. And… and I broke my wrist once, when I was young. Fell off a bicycle. That’s all I can remember. Hospitalized… yes, for the wrist. And for the gallbladder. It was… a very long time ago. Everything is just… a jumble. Is this important, Doctor? I’m starting to feel quite faint. Can we… finish soon?
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a broken wrist. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… let me think. No. I don't think so. Nothing I’m aware of. I can eat everything. I love oranges. And… and pollen doesn't bother me. I garden, you see. I’m outside all the time. No, no allergies. I’m quite sure. Is that… all the questions? Can we… get to the medicine now? I really just want this to be over with. I'm feeling quite dizzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Claudene, I understand you're feeling dizzy and want this over with quickly. I apologize for all the questions, but it's important to get a full picture. Based on what you've told me – the burning sensation with urination, the urgency, the reddish tinge to your urine sometimes, the lower back pain, and your history of high blood pressure – it sounds like you could have a urinary tract infection, or UTI. However, we need to confirm that with a urine test. Also, the reddish tinge to your urine and your lower back pain warrants further investigation. I'm going to order a urine analysis and a complete blood count to start. I’d also like to check your blood pressure right now. After that, depending on the results, we may need to do some imaging, like an ultrasound, to rule out other causes for your back pain. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A test… and more tests. And imaging. It sounds… complicated. I just wanted a pill. Is a pill not possible? I don't like tests. I'm very… frail, Doctor. And I get nervous. But… alright. If you think it's necessary. But please, make it quick. And… and can someone sit with me? I’m feeling very faint. And I really, really don’t like needles. Can we start with the blood pressure, then? Just the blood pressure, please? And then… maybe I can go home. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Claudene. We'll start with just the blood pressure. And we can take things one step at a time. I'll have the nurse stay with you during the tests, and we’ll go as slowly as you need. I’ll also make sure you're comfortable. Nurse, could you please come in and assist us with taking Ms. Wease’s blood pressure?
