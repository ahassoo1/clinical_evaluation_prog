DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Auelua. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have all day for this. I'm tired. Really tired. And I… well, it's embarrassing, but I've been eating dirt. Not a lot, but enough to know something's wrong. It just… tastes good sometimes, you know? Don't look at me like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. I understand. It takes courage to share things like that, and I appreciate you being honest with me. You're feeling very tired, and you've been experiencing an urge to eat dirt. That’s certainly something we should look into. Just to clarify, when you say dirt, are we talking about soil from your garden, or something else?
PATIENT: Garden dirt. Plain old garden dirt. Though sometimes… sometimes the red clay kind is better. Look, I haven't been digging up fancy stuff, if that's what you're thinking. Just… what's in the yard. And it’s not like I’m craving it, exactly. It just… feels good to put it in my mouth. Don’t ask me why! It’s probably just old age, making me do silly things. Now, can we hurry this up? I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: Okay, garden dirt, sometimes red clay specifically. And it’s not a strong craving, more of a feeling of…comfort or something when you put it in your mouth. I appreciate you explaining that. It’s good to get a clear picture of what's going on. While it could be related to age, there are a few other possibilities we should explore to make sure we're not missing anything. This behavior is sometimes called pica, and it can be a sign of a nutritional deficiency. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your diet?
PATIENT: Ugh, a deficiency? Honestly, I eat what I can. I'm not one of those fancy cooks. Mostly I have…well, whatever’s easy. Soup, sometimes. Toast. I don’t really have an appetite anymore, which is probably why I’m so tired all the time. And I don’t have much money for a lot of…fresh things. Are we going to need a blood test? Because I really don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a fairly simple diet, mostly soup and toast, and not a lot of appetite. I understand that can make things difficult. And yes, a blood test might be helpful to check for any deficiencies, like iron or zinc, that could be contributing to this. I completely understand your apprehension about needles – many people feel the same way. We can talk about ways to make it as comfortable as possible if it turns out to be necessary. But let's gather some more information first. Have you noticed any other unusual urges or cravings besides the dirt?
PATIENT: No, just the dirt. And honestly, it's not that often. Maybe once a week, sometimes less. It’s not like I'm out there shoveling it into my mouth every day! It’s just… a little handful. And it makes my stomach feel better sometimes, which is weird, I know. I don’t understand why I’m even telling you this. It’s embarrassing! But you’re the doctor, I guess. Now, can we please get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, once a week, roughly, and it actually seems to relieve your stomach discomfort sometimes. That’s important information, thank you for sharing that. It helps us narrow things down. And please, don't feel embarrassed. We're here to help, and it’s important to be thorough. To get a better picture, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Not really. I had the flu once, a long time ago. And my knees ache, but that's just old age, I reckon. I haven't been to a doctor in…oh, goodness, I don't even remember. Probably twenty years? Maybe more. I don't bother with doctors, to be honest. They just tell you to take pills for everything. Now, are you going to poke me with something soon, or what? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major diagnoses that you're aware of, just the knee pain. And it's been quite a while since your last check-up. I understand your reluctance about doctors and pills. We'll only do what's necessary, and we’ll talk through everything first. Before we decide on any tests, let’s quickly go through a few questions about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has had any serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he just died old, really. Nothing exciting. My sister… she had some trouble with her gallbladder, but that was years ago. Honestly, we weren’t a family that talked about illnesses much. It was just… bad luck if something happened. Now, can we please wrap this up? I’m starting to feel faint. Maybe it’s the lack of dirt. Don’t judge me.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother, and generally a family that didn’t discuss medical issues much. I understand. Before we move on, just a quick question about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I told you, I don’t bother with doctors or pills. I don’t even take vitamins. Waste of money, if you ask me. I just eat what I can and try to get on with things. Now, I’m really starting to feel unwell. I think I need to sit down. Are you going to do something soon, or are we just going to keep talking? Honestly, this is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. I hear you. You’re feeling unwell, and you’d like to sit down. Absolutely. Let’s get you comfortable. Now, before we proceed with any tests or anything, I just want to quickly check something in your records… It seems like there’s very little documented information here, which explains why I was asking so many questions. Just one moment. Okay. Since you haven't been feeling well, and you’ve mentioned this urge to eat dirt, and given your limited dietary intake, I’m concerned about the possibility of a nutritional deficiency. And, truthfully, the sudden onset of feeling faint warrants a bit of caution. To rule out anything serious, I would like to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel . This will check your iron levels, electrolytes, kidney function and other important markers. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Ugh, blood tests. I knew it. Look, I really don't like needles. Is there anything else we can do? Can’t you just give me some pills? Or tell me to eat more soup? Honestly, this is going to be awful. And what if it’s something serious? I don't want to know if I’m dying. Just… get it over with, I guess. But hurry. And be gentle. Now, are you going to poke me right away, or is there more questioning to come? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. I understand your anxiety about the blood test, and I promise we’ll take it as slowly and gently as possible. We can use a topical numbing cream to minimize discomfort, and I’ll be as quick as I can. I want to assure you that we are doing this to rule things out and get you feeling better, not to scare you. And, no, there is no more questioning at the moment. We’ll start with a small vial. I'm going to tie this tourniquet around your arm… it’s just to make the veins easier to find. Just breathe deeply, and try to relax your arm. It will be over before you know it. Now, could you tell me which arm you would prefer?
