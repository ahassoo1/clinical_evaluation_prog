DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knoch. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Korrell. Well, to be frank, it's the smoking. I’ve been…indulging for a very long time, and I think it’s finally time I tried to put a stop to it. It's become…difficult, you see. And my daughter, she worries.
DOCTOR: A long history of smoking, you say. And now you’re finding it difficult to quit, and your daughter is concerned. I understand. How many cigarettes, or packs, would you say you typically go through in a day, on average?
PATIENT: Oh, it varies, truly. But if I had to give a number… usually about a pack and a half. Sometimes a bit more if the weather is bad, or if I'm… unsettled. I used to smoke more, much more, when I was working. But even now, in retirement… it's a habit. A very persistent habit.
DOCTOR: A pack and a half… consistently. And you mentioned a history of smoking more when you were working. How long have you been smoking, Mr. Knoch?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It began when I was seventeen, just after the war ended. So, that would be… sixty-two years now. Sixty-two years! It feels like a lifetime ago, and yet… just yesterday, in some ways. I started with my friends, you see, after we returned from helping rebuild. Everyone smoked then, it seemed. It was… commonplace.
DOCTOR: Well, times were different, certainly. Sixty-two years is a considerable length of time. Have you attempted to quit at any point during those sixty-two years?
PATIENT: Yes, a few times, Doctor. Not many, truthfully. I tried those…patches, I believe they were called, some years back. Perhaps fifteen years ago? They made me feel quite unwell, nauseous mostly. And then…I gave up on those rather quickly. And once, my wife – she was very strong-willed – she insisted I try chewing gum. That lasted a week, maybe. It’s difficult to explain… the habit is… deeply ingrained. I haven't had much success, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: The patches, you say, caused nausea. And the gum wasn't effective. It sounds like you’ve tried a few things without lasting success. Besides the nausea, did you experience any other withdrawal symptoms when you attempted to quit?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The…irritability, certainly. I was quite unpleasant to be around, I suspect. And a sort of… restlessness. I couldn't sit still, and I found myself constantly thinking about cigarettes. A sort of…aching, if you will. Not a physical ache, exactly, but a feeling of… emptiness. And the concentration… it was very difficult to focus on anything. My wife bore with it, bless her. But I could see it affected her.
DOCTOR: Irritability, restlessness, difficulty concentrating… standard withdrawal symptoms. Have you noticed any coughing or shortness of breath recently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do cough, especially in the mornings. A sort of… deep, rattling cough. It's gotten worse in the last year, I think. And sometimes, when I walk upstairs, or if I try to hurry, I find myself… winded. Short of breath, as you say. I’ve always dismissed it as… getting older, you see. But perhaps… perhaps it's more than that. It’s not debilitating, but it’s… noticeable. It worries my daughter, naturally.
DOCTOR: A productive cough, worsening over the past year, and shortness of breath with exertion. I see. And do you have any chest pain at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no chest pain. Not at all. Just the coughing and… the difficulty breathing when I overexert myself. Occasionally, a bit of…wheezing, if I'm lying down. But no pain. And no other… ailments, truthfully. I’ve been quite fortunate, overall, for a man of my age. It’s just…this habit. This persistent habit. And the worry it causes.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen saturation. Then we can discuss some options. If you'll just sit up there for me.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. As you wish. I trust it won’t be too unpleasant? I’ve never been particularly fond of examinations, you see. But I understand it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: If you wouldn’t mind putting this gown on, please. It will allow me to listen to your lungs more effectively. And it won't be unpleasant, Mr. Knoch. Just a standard examination. Take a deep breath when I ask you to.
PATIENT: Very well. It’s… a bit chilly, isn’t it? But I suppose it’s necessary. There you are. As you said, just tell me when to breathe deeply. I’m ready when you are, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Knoch, take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… I’m hearing some wheezing in both lung fields, and slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a bit low. Your heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated. I also note some mild edema in your ankles. Given your history and these findings, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test to assess the extent of any lung damage.
PATIENT: An X-ray and… a pulmonary function test? That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it… is it very bad? I confess, I’m not entirely familiar with those procedures. And the edema… I hadn’t noticed that myself, to be truthful. Is that also a consequence of the smoking? I confess, I’m starting to become quite worried.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily very bad, Mr. Knoch, but it’s important to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The X-ray will show us if there’s any structural damage to your lungs. The pulmonary function test measures how well your lungs are working. And yes, the edema – the swelling in your ankles – can certainly be a consequence of long-term smoking, and also indicates some potential heart involvement. These tests are standard procedure for someone with your history, and frankly, given your symptoms, they are necessary. I’ll also want to discuss some options for quitting, but we need to know the extent of the damage first. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood for a basic metabolic panel as well.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. As you say. If these tests are necessary, then I suppose I should proceed. I trust they won’t be too…invasive? I’ve never been particularly fond of needles, you see. And I confess, I’m already feeling rather anxious about the whole situation. But if it will help… if it will give us a clearer picture… then I will cooperate. Please, just tell me what I need to do. And when.
DOCTOR: The blood draw is quite minor, Mr. Knoch. A small prick, that’s all. The X-ray is painless. The pulmonary function test requires you to breathe into a mouthpiece, it will take about fifteen minutes. The nurse will schedule those for you before you leave. We’ll need to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms as well. I'm also going to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm. I'll have the nurse explain everything to you in detail. Is there anyone you’d like me to contact regarding these tests?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no need to contact anyone. My daughter, she lives quite far away. She’d only worry unnecessarily. I’ll manage. I always have. Just… please, be frank with me. I’d rather know the truth, however unpleasant it may be. I’ve lived a long life, you see. And I’d like to… prepare accordingly. Just tell me what I need to do, and what to expect. And… thank you, Doctor. For your time, and your… frankness.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will get you set up with those tests. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a short course of bronchodilators to help with your breathing. They’re just to alleviate your symptoms while we wait for the results. And I strongly suggest you avoid any strenuous activity. And frankly, Mr. Knoch, the most important thing you can do right now is to stop smoking. I can provide you with some resources to help you with that, but ultimately, it’s up to you. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand perfectly. Bronchodilators, stop strenuous activity… and stop smoking. It seems… a daunting task, to be frank. But I will try. I promise you, I will try. Perhaps… perhaps with the help of those resources… And I thank you for offering them. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I believe I’ll sit here for a moment, and… compose myself. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? Or should I simply wait for the nurse? .
