DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you. It’s… concerning, frankly, that I even have to be here. It’s… a personal matter, really. A most unfortunate personal matter. But, if you must know… it’s about a discharge. A rather… unpleasant discharge. From… him.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wartick. It sounds distressing. “From him,” could you clarify who you are referring to?
PATIENT: Honestly! From my… gentleman friend, of course! Who else would it be from? It’s… it’s rather embarrassing to have to spell this out, but it’s him. It started a few days ago, and it’s… well, it's not a pleasant sight, let me tell you. I’ve never encountered anything like it.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the clarification, Ms. Wartick. It's perfectly understandable that this is embarrassing to discuss, and I appreciate you sharing this with me. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Really? What sort of a question is that? It’s… it’s… liquidy. And… discolored. Not a nice color, I assure you. A sort of… yellowish-grey. And there’s… a smell. A rather unpleasant smell. Honestly, I’ve tried to ignore it, but it’s becoming… overwhelming. It’s quite undignified, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you for describing it, Ms. Wartick. Yellowish-grey and with an unpleasant odor… is it associated with any pain, burning, or itching?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not exactly pain. More… discomfort. A slight… stinging, sometimes. And it’s itchy, yes, terribly itchy! It’s… distracting, to say the least. He keeps… fidgeting, poor dear. It’s a most delicate situation, you understand. I wouldn’t want to cause him any further… distress.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Wartick. So, discomfort and itching, primarily. Is this a recent development, or has this been ongoing for some time?
PATIENT: Hmm… recent, I suppose. A few days, as I said. Though, now that you mention it, he has been a bit… restless lately. And he’s been going to the… well, let’s just say he’s been keeping company. I don’t approve, of course. But he’s a grown man. I just assumed it was… that. It never occurred to me it could be… this. Honestly, it’s quite unsettling.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Wartick. It’s helpful to have that context. To be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Good heavens, what do you mean? It’s a discharge, doctor! What more could there be? He hasn’t grown a second head, if that’s what you’re asking! No fever, no… well, he’s always a bit grumpy in the mornings, but that’s just his nature. Honestly, I don’t see what difference any of this makes. It's… it's a problem with him, isn’t it? A most unfortunate problem. Are you going to prescribe something, or are you just going to ask me questions all day?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, Ms. Wartick. I'm simply trying to gather all the necessary information to understand what's going on and provide the best possible care. To clarify, when you say it’s a problem with “him”, are you referring to your gentleman friend experiencing any symptoms himself – such as pain, burning, or difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Oh, him? He won’t admit to anything, of course. Too proud. He just says it’s a “minor irritation.” Men! Honestly, they’d rather suffer in silence than admit to a weakness. He probably doesn't even notice it, the foolish thing. He just… carries on as usual. Which is rather inconsiderate, if you ask me. But no, he won’t tell me anything specific. Just that it's “under control.” Honestly, it’s probably nothing. Just a little… something. But I came here because I am concerned, and frankly, it's quite distressing to have to deal with. Can we please just get to the matter of a prescription? I'd like something to… neutralize the odor, if possible. And perhaps something to soothe the… irritation.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wartick. It sounds like he is reluctant to discuss his symptoms directly. Given his reluctance and your concerns, and without a proper examination of him, it's difficult to determine the cause of the discharge. However, based on your description, it could be indicative of a sexually transmitted infection or a local irritation. To be safe, I would recommend that your gentleman friend be evaluated by a healthcare professional. I can provide you with a referral if you'd like. In the meantime, I can suggest some over-the-counter options to help manage the odor and irritation. A gentle antiseptic wash and loose-fitting cotton underwear might provide some relief. I can also recommend a topical cream for the itching. Would you be interested in discussing those options?
PATIENT: An examination? Absolutely not! He would never allow it. And frankly, I don’t want to hear any more talk of… infections. It’s… unspeakable. Just give me something to make it stop, doctor! The smell, the itching… everything. I don't need a referral, I need a solution. What cream do you recommend? And is it… discreet? I don’t want him to know I’m worried. Just something that will… fix it. Quickly. And preferably something without a strong odor of its own. This is all very upsetting, you know. It's… it’s a delicate situation, and I’d like to resolve it as swiftly and unobtrusively as possible.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Wartick. However, I must strongly advise against self-treating without a proper diagnosis. Using the wrong medication could worsen the condition or mask symptoms, making it more difficult to treat later. That being said, I can recommend a topical cream containing hydrocortisone 1% for the itching and inflammation. It's available over-the-counter and generally well-tolerated. It won't address the underlying cause of the discharge, but it may provide some temporary relief. For the odor, gentle cleansing with mild soap and water is the best approach. However, I cannot stress enough the importance of him being evaluated by a healthcare professional to determine the cause of the discharge and receive appropriate treatment. I can provide you with a list of local clinics that offer discreet and confidential services. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Fine. Hydrocortisone… that sounds… acceptable. And the soap and water, I can manage. But I absolutely refuse to drag him to a clinic. He would be furious! And frankly, I don't think I could bear the embarrassment. Just… give me the list. Perhaps I can… subtly suggest he see a doctor for something else. A cough, perhaps. Or… indigestion. Anything to avoid mentioning… that. And please, no lectures. I've made my position clear. Just the list, doctor. And a discreet wrapping for the cream. This is all very upsetting, you know. Very upsetting indeed.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wartick. Here is the list of local clinics, and the cream is bagged for your privacy. I will also include a pamphlet on basic hygiene. I understand this is a delicate situation, and I respect your wishes. However, I strongly encourage you to emphasize the importance of seeking medical attention, even if it’s for a seemingly minor ailment. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial for preventing complications. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. I believe that is all. Thank you… I suppose. I sincerely hope this resolves itself quickly. It’s… a most unpleasant situation, and I’d like to put it behind me as soon as possible. Good day, doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wartick. I wish you and your gentleman friend all the best. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or if the condition worsens. Have a good day.
