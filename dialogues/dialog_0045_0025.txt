DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh, hello Doctor Billman. Good to meet you too. I want… I want to know where my people come from, long time ago. My daughter, she get one of those… tests. DNA, she call it. She say it tell you lots. I like to get one too, if that okay?
DOCTOR: A DNA test, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. She show me pictures. Lots of colors and… numbers. She say it tell you where your ancestors live, maybe even what they look like long, long time ago. Is good to know, yeah? I never really ask my papa about it. He just… fish and build boats. Good man, but no stories.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, that's… not really a medical issue. I'm a doctor, I treat illnesses, not genealogy. I understand wanting to know your history, it’s…nice. But this clinic doesn't offer those kinds of tests. It's not really within my scope of practice.
PATIENT: Oh. Oh, I see. You no do that here? My daughter, she say any doctor can help. She say you take little bit of spit, send it to lab… Is for my health, I think! Know where you come from… help you understand things, yeah? Is important.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Scobie, while knowing your family history can be relevant to certain medical conditions – predispositions to diseases, that sort of thing – simply where your ancestors lived doesn’t automatically tell you anything about your current health. It’s not a standard medical test, and frankly, sounds like a waste of your money. We have limited resources here, and I need to prioritize patients with actual medical needs.
PATIENT: Waste money? My daughter pay, not me. She want me to know. And… what you mean "actual medical needs"? I feel like knowing is important. I get old, Doctor. I want understand…everything before I… before. Maybe just a little spit, no hurt nobody?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, I’m trying to explain. I treat things like high blood pressure, diabetes, infections. Not… ancestral curiosity. Your daughter is…misinformed. You’re 85 years old, and you’re here, I presume, for a medical reason?
PATIENT: No… no real sickness. Just… feeling old. And curious. My daughter, she say maybe the test show why I get so tired easy. Why my skin… look like this. She say sometimes old stories, they hide in your blood. I just want to know… if that okay? Is that so bad?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, fatigue and skin changes at your age are incredibly common. They are usually caused by things like natural aging, dehydration, or potentially mild vitamin deficiencies. We can run some simple bloodwork to check those things – those are medically relevant. A DNA test to satisfy curiosity isn't going to help, and it won’t explain why you're feeling tired. We need to focus on what I can actually do to help you feel better, not chase after… fantasies. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms besides fatigue?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, I understand. Maybe you right. But… vitamin? What kind vitamin? I drink water. I eat fish. What kind of sickness is vitamin? My daughter, she say blood talk, you just have to listen.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, vitamins aren't a sickness. They're essential nutrients your body needs to function. Sometimes, as you get older, your body doesn’t absorb them as well, and you become deficient. It can cause fatigue, weakness, even skin problems. We can check your vitamin levels with a blood test. It’s a simple procedure. But let’s focus on the basics first. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite… not so good. Fish taste… not so strong anymore. Used to love barracuda, now… just taste like water. And I sleep more. Lots more. Like… like a long, long nap every day. Maybe that's vitamin too? My daughter say maybe I need… iron? She read on the computer.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Scobie. Reduced appetite and increased sleepiness could be related to several things, including vitamin deficiencies, anemia – which is what your daughter might be referring to with “iron” – or just the natural process of aging. It's good she's trying to help, but the internet isn't a substitute for a proper medical evaluation. Let’s get some bloodwork done. We’ll check your vitamin levels, your blood count, and a few other basic things. That will give us a better idea of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sound good. Bloodwork… okay. Maybe you find something. Maybe then I understand… things. Is good to know. Thank you, Doctor Billman.
DOCTOR: Alright. Nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’ll explain the process. And Mr. Scobie…try not to rely on information you find online. It's often misleading. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. Never take much medicine. Just… fish oil sometimes, for my joints. But that's… just oil. Not real medicine. My mama make it, fresh from the barracuda.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any other supplements or herbal remedies, besides the fish oil your mother makes?
PATIENT: Hmm… Old Man Hem, he give me some root, last month. Say it good for…memory. Smell funny. I drink it with water, every night. Small piece. He say it from jungle. Good for… remembering.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, do you know the name of this root?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. He just call it… jungle root. Brown color. Smell like… dirt and something sweet. He get it from the big island. He say it old magic. Maybe… maybe that's why I forget sometimes? Is good magic, I think. Old Man Hem is good man.
DOCTOR: Alright. We need to document everything you're taking, even if it’s “old magic.” Nurse will ask you some more detailed questions about this "jungle root." It's important, Mr. Scobie, because some herbal remedies can interact with medications or have other side effects. We need to be thorough. Now, let's get this bloodwork done, and then we can discuss your fatigue and sleepiness in more detail.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I tell nurse about root. I hope it not bad magic. I just want remember my papa’s stories. That all.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be with you shortly. We'll do our best to figure things out.
PATIENT: .
