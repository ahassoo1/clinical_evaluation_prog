DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Haggar. So, you're here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really tired lately, and I’ve been looking… yellow, my friend told me. It started after I ate some fava beans. I love fava beans, but now… I don’t know. It just feels off.
DOCTOR: Yellow, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, my skin… and even the whites of my eyes. It’s not a bright yellow, but it’s definitely noticeable. My friend, Elina, she's a nurse, and she said it could be… jaundice? I don’t even know what that is, really. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Jaundice… well, it means your body is having trouble processing something. It can be a sign of something serious, but it also could be nothing. We need to figure out what's causing it. You said this started after eating fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I had a big plate of them, actually. I grew up eating them, my grandmother used to make them all the time. It was just… a normal meal. Then a few days later I started feeling weak, and then Elina pointed out the color. I haven't eaten any since, just in case. Do fava beans cause this? I’ve never heard of anything like it.
DOCTOR: Fava beans… yes, there is a rare genetic condition, G6PD deficiency, where certain foods, including fava beans, can trigger a reaction. It's more common in people of Mediterranean or Middle Eastern descent, though it can occur in anyone. It causes the red blood cells to break down. Have you ever been told you have any kind of blood disorder?
PATIENT: Oh… G6PD deficiency? I’ve never heard of that at all. Mediterranean… my grandfather was Romanian, is that close enough? I don't think so... Blood disorder… no, never. I’ve had the usual check-ups, you know, yearly physicals, but no one ever said anything about my blood. I always thought I was healthy enough. Is that what you think this could be? I feel a bit scared now, honestly.
DOCTOR: It's a possibility we need to explore, Ms. Haggar. It's not necessarily something to panic about, but we need to confirm it. Let's go through some of your medical history. Have you ever had any problems with your gallbladder or liver?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Exploring… that sounds… sensible. Gallbladder or liver… hmm. Let me think. No, I don't think so. I had my gallbladder checked maybe ten years ago, just as a precaution, because my aunt had some trouble with hers, but everything was fine. Other than that, I haven’t had any problems that I know of. I’ve always been pretty careful about what I eat, you know? Mostly just fruits and vegetables. Do you think this could be something else then, if my liver is okay?
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things. We'll need to run some blood tests to get a better picture. Have you noticed any pain in your abdomen?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. That’s the strange thing. I just feel… tired, weak, and a bit… off-color, as my friend said. No stomach aches, no cramping, nothing like that. Just… unwell. It’s a very unsettling feeling, honestly. Is it possible this is just a strange reaction to something else I ate? Maybe a virus?
DOCTOR: A virus is possible, though the jaundice makes it less likely. Let's do a quick physical exam, Ms. Haggar. I'll listen to your abdomen, check your reflexes, and take a look at your skin more closely. Then we'll get those blood tests ordered. If you don't mind?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. A physical exam sounds good. It’s… reassuring to be doing something, you know? I just want to figure out what’s going on. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on the table. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Breathe normally. Hmm. Sounds normal so far. Now, let's check your skin tone. Yes, there is some mild yellowing, as you said. And your sclera – the whites of your eyes – also show some discoloration. No visible bruising or rashes. Reflexes seem normal. Alright, that's enough for a quick initial exam. Now, we'll need to get those blood tests done. I'll order a complete blood count, a liver panel, and a G6PD enzyme test.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… thorough. Complete blood count, liver panel, and… G6PD, right? Is that the one with the fava beans? Will those tests tell us what’s wrong? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a friend coming to visit next week, and I’d like to be feeling better by then, if possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, the G6PD test is the one that checks for the enzyme deficiency. It’s a fairly simple blood test. The results usually take about 24 to 48 hours to come back. I'll also order a bilirubin level, to see how high your jaundice is. That should give us a clearer picture. I'm putting in the orders now. The lab technician will come up shortly to draw your blood. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding fava beans and any other foods you suspect might be contributing to this. And let's try to get you some rest. Hopefully, we'll have some answers soon. Don't worry too much, Ms. Haggar. It's likely something manageable.
PATIENT: Okay. 24 to 48 hours… I can do that. No fava beans, definitely. And rest… yes, I suppose I could use some rest. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I’ll just… wait for the lab technician, then. And try not to worry. My friend’s visit is very important to me. I hope I’ll be feeling up to it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Someone will be with you shortly. People and their fava beans…
