DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Stepno, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Noelani Stepno. Though… honestly, I don’t recall filling out much paperwork. Everything feels a bit… hazy lately. Is something the matter?
DOCTOR: Hazy?
PATIENT: Yes. My memory… it isn't what it used to be. Small things, mostly. Dates, names… even why I came here today is a little… unclear. I believe it has something to do with pain, though. A rather… persistent discomfort. I apologize for the confusion. Is it alright if I explain as best as I can, even if I stumble a bit?
DOCTOR: Persistent discomfort. Right. Well, let's try to piece things together. Where exactly are you feeling this discomfort, Mrs. Stepno?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a delicate question. It’s… down there. In the… groin area, I suppose. It’s hard to explain. It’s not sharp, exactly. More of a… dull ache. And sometimes… a heaviness. I truly apologize for my vagueness. Is that… acceptable information? I’m not very good at describing these things.
DOCTOR: Acceptable, yes. Though, a little more detail would be helpful, if you can manage it. Has this discomfort been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I believe. Though… it feels like it’s been more consistent recently. There are days when I barely notice it, and then others where it's… quite bothersome. It seems to worsen with… activity. Walking, standing for long periods… even just sitting sometimes. Is that making any sense? I'm afraid my recollection of the timeline is rather poor. Perhaps if you ask specific questions, I can offer a more focused response.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's try specifics. When did you first notice this discomfort, to the best of your estimation?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that is difficult. Hmm… let me think. It feels like… several weeks ago? Possibly a month or two? It wasn’t sudden, not a specific moment. It sort of… crept up on me. I was doing some work in the garden, I think. Lifting things, bending… it could have started then. Though, honestly, it’s all a bit blurry. I apologize for not being more helpful. My mind isn’t what it once was.
DOCTOR: Right. And has anything – any particular activity, position, or time of day – made it better or worse recently?
PATIENT: Well… lying down does seem to help. When I’m resting, it’s significantly less noticeable. And… taking a warm bath sometimes offers temporary relief. But honestly, nothing seems to make it completely disappear. Standing for long periods is definitely the worst. And… lifting anything heavy. Even grocery bags, really. It's a little embarrassing to admit, but it's the truth. I do a lot of woodworking, you see, and it's becoming… challenging.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh… my. That is… a rather personal question. I… I suppose not, really. Everything seems… normal, in that regard. Perhaps a little… irregular, occasionally, but nothing drastic. I hadn’t considered connecting that to this discomfort. Is that… a common association? I apologize for my ignorance. I truly am not well-versed in these matters.
DOCTOR: It can be. Just covering all bases. Now, any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills, or night sweats. I’ve been feeling… generally well, aside from this… persistent ache. My appetite has been normal, and I haven’t lost any weight that I’m aware of. I do tire easily, but that could simply be due to my age. I apologize for rambling. I’m trying to be as thorough as possible, but my mind keeps… wandering. Perhaps a physical examination would be more… informative?
DOCTOR: Perhaps. Let's proceed with a brief examination then. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll need to palpate your abdomen and… assess the area you’ve been describing.
PATIENT: Very well. If you would please direct me. I’m a little unsteady on my feet today. I apologize for any inconvenience. And… please do not hesitate to stop if I express any discomfort. I appreciate your patience.
DOCTOR: Lie on your back with your knees bent. I’ll start with your abdomen. There’s some tenderness here, on the lower left quadrant. Nothing acute, but it’s consistent with your reported pain. And… Mild discomfort with palpation of the pelvic floor. No palpable masses.
PATIENT: Yes, that… that is where I feel the ache. It’s a bit uncomfortable, but… tolerable. Is that… concerning? I apologize for my nervousness. I’ve never been very comfortable with these examinations. And the… hazy memory isn't helping matters. I feel rather… vulnerable. Is there anything particularly alarming you've found? Perhaps a simple explanation would… alleviate my anxiety.
DOCTOR: It’s too early to say definitively. Based on the examination, it could be muscular strain, referred pain, or… something gynecological. It’s not an emergency, but further investigation is warranted. We'll need to run some basic bloodwork, and I'd like to order a pelvic ultrasound to rule out any structural abnormalities.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… reassuring. Not an emergency. That is good to hear. Bloodwork and an ultrasound… yes, that sounds… sensible. I am happy to comply with whatever you deem necessary. Will the ultrasound be… uncomfortable? And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a small woodworking commission I’m hoping to complete before the end of the month. I apologize for my persistent inquiries, but I do worry about falling behind schedule.
DOCTOR: The ultrasound is non-invasive. A technician will apply gel to your abdomen and move a probe over your skin. It shouldn't be painful, though it may be slightly cool. Results typically take 24-48 hours. While we await those results, I'll prescribe a mild anti-inflammatory to help manage the discomfort. And if the pain worsens significantly, or you develop a fever, you are to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. That is a good question. I… believe I am allergic to penicillin, yes. A rather unpleasant reaction many years ago. And… I sometimes experience mild indigestion with ibuprofen, but it’s not a severe allergy, more of an annoyance. Other than that… I don’t recall any significant sensitivities. Is that… sufficient information? I apologize for my vagueness, again. My memory truly is… unreliable. Perhaps a family member could verify, but they are… unavailable at the moment.
DOCTOR: Alright. Penicillin allergy noted. We'll avoid that. I'll prescribe naproxen instead. And Here is a prescription for 500mg of naproxen, to be taken twice daily with food for one week. If the pain persists after a week, or worsens at any point, we’ll need to discuss further options. And please schedule a follow-up appointment for when the ultrasound results are available. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Naproxen… yes, I have taken that before, I believe. No adverse reactions, as far as I can recall. Thank you, Doctor. That… alleviates my anxiety somewhat. A follow-up appointment… yes, of course. I will have my assistant schedule that immediately. And… is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Resting, avoiding strenuous activity… anything specific? I truly appreciate your patience with my… fragmented recollections. It's rather embarrassing, but I assure you, I’m trying to be as cooperative as possible. One last thing, could you kindly write down the name of the facility where I should go for the ultrasound? My assistant is rather… new, and I worry she might mishear. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Rest, avoid strenuous activity, and ice packs if needed. As for the ultrasound facility: "Rural Imaging Center, 14 Maple Street. Tell them Dr. Dechene sent you." And honestly, Mrs. Stepno, try not to worry so much. It’s likely just muscular strain. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Rural Imaging Center… 14 Maple Street. Very well. Thank you, Doctor Dechene. I apologize for taking up so much of your time. And… thank you for your patience. I will schedule the ultrasound immediately and follow your instructions. Have a good day. .
