DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's this… this situation. It’s been going on for weeks now. Weeks! And nothing seems to help. I’ve tried… things. I don't even want to talk about it, but here I am. It’s just… constant.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to discuss personal matters. Please, take your time. We’ll get to the bottom of it together. When you say “this situation,” could you describe what’s been going on for these past weeks?
PATIENT: Well, it's… diarrhea. Okay? Just… a lot of it. And it won't stop. I've been to the drugstore, bought all sorts of things... you know, the stuff they advertise. Those pink things, the brown liquids… nothing works. It’s embarrassing to even talk about, really. I feel like I live in the bathroom. And I’m losing weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, diarrhea for several weeks now, despite trying over-the-counter medications. And you’ve noticed some weight loss as well. I appreciate you being open about this, Ms. Woodring. It is important to get this addressed. To help me understand what might be going on, can you tell me a little more about the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: What do you mean? It's… watery. It's… unpleasant. Look, I'm not a doctor, okay? I just know it's not normal and it's making my life miserable. I don't need a detailed description of my own bathroom habits. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Ms. Woodring. I didn't mean to be insensitive or ask for unnecessary details. You are absolutely right, you don’t need a description of your own bathroom habits. What I was trying to ascertain – and please correct me if this is too personal – is if there’s any blood or mucus in the stool, or if you’ve noticed any changes in its color. Also, roughly how many times a day are you experiencing this?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake. Fine. No blood, no, I would know about that. Mucus… maybe? I don't really look at it, honestly. And how many times? Ugh… at least six, sometimes more. It's just… constant. And it wakes me up at night. It's awful. Are you going to ask me what I ate yesterday now? Because I swear...
DOCTOR: No, I won't ask about every single thing you ate yesterday, Ms. Woodring. Six or more times a day, and waking you up at night… that's certainly concerning. To get a better picture of what might be causing this, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: My past medical history? Honestly, what does that have to do with my stomach? I had the flu once, a long time ago. And I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that's about it. I’m generally healthy. Except for this, obviously. My husband… well, he had some things, but he’s gone now. Is this going to be a long list? I really don't have all day.
DOCTOR: No, a long list isn’t necessary, Ms. Woodring. Just trying to gather some general information. So, you generally consider yourself to be healthy, with a history of only the flu and a broken arm as a child. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never had a surgery. I don’t do surgeries. I avoid doctors as much as possible, to be honest. This is… a special circumstance. I mean, six times a day… It’s ridiculous! Are you going to order a bunch of tests now? Because I have insurance, but still… It’s a hassle.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about tests, Ms. Woodring. We may need to order some, yes, to get a clear understanding of what's going on. I'll explain everything beforehand, of course. Before we get to that, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements?
PATIENT: Just those pink things I told you about. And sometimes I take something for heartburn, but not regularly. And a multivitamin, because my sister says I should. That’s it. Seriously, that’s the extent of my drug habit. It’s not like I’m popping pills all day, if that’s what you’re thinking. I just want this to stop. Can we please just get to the part where you give me something that will fix it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so just the pink things for diarrhea, something occasionally for heartburn, and a multivitamin. Nothing regular beyond those. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None. I eat everything. I haven’t had an allergic reaction in my life. I’m Tlingit, we eat a lot of fish and berries. Not much allergy stuff in our family, if that matters. Honestly, I feel like I’m being interrogated here. Is this normal? I just want to feel better. Can we just skip to the part where you tell me what’s wrong and what I need to do?
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels like an interrogation, Ms. Woodring. I assure you, I'm just trying to gather all the necessary information to provide you with the best possible care. We're almost through the initial questions. One last thing – and it’s important – can you tell me a little about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Ugh. Now you want to talk about family? Look, my mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he worked on boats, so he probably had back problems. That's about it. Not a lot of fancy illnesses in our family, okay? We're a pretty hardy bunch. Is this really necessary? I’m starting to feel lightheaded. Can we just get on with it? This is taking forever.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure in your mother and back problems in your father, given his work. You mentioned feeling lightheaded now. Are you currently feeling lightheaded, or has that been happening with the diarrhea as well?
PATIENT: Right now. Just… a bit wobbly. And thirsty. I’ve probably lost a lot of fluids with… everything. I don’t understand why you need to know so much detail about my family, it’s not like they have this problem! I just want a pill. Or something. This is ridiculous. Can I at least get a glass of water?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Woodring. Let me get a nurse to bring you a glass of water right away. It's important that we address the lightheadedness. Feeling dehydrated is very concerning given the diarrhea. Now, to proceed, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It will just take a few minutes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don't poke me too hard. And hurry up. I have things to do. Honestly, the less talking, the better. Just… do whatever you need to do. And then give me something that will make this stop.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please lie down on the examination table, if you'd be comfortable. Heart sounds are within normal limits. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is tender to the touch, especially in the lower quadrants. No masses palpable. Bowel sounds are hyperactive, which is consistent with diarrhea. Your blood pressure is a little low, which could explain the lightheadedness. I’m concerned about dehydration. I'm going to order some blood work to check your electrolytes and kidney function, and a stool sample to rule out any infection.
PATIENT: Blood work? Stool sample? Are you serious? This is getting out of hand! I just wanted a simple pill! Is this going to take forever? What if it's something awful? I don't want to know! I just want to feel better. This is a nightmare. Can I at least get that water now? I'm really thirsty. And I want to go home. This is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Please, take your time and drink this slowly, Ms. Woodring. I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we are doing everything we can to figure out what’s going on. The blood work and stool sample are just routine tests to help us narrow down the cause of your diarrhea. Most likely, it's a viral infection, which will resolve on its own with supportive care, such as fluids and rest. However, we need to rule out anything more serious. I'm also concerned about your weight loss, and we need to investigate that further. While we wait for the test results, I’m going to recommend an oral rehydration solution to help replenish your fluids and electrolytes. I'll also prescribe a medication to help slow down the diarrhea. It's not a cure, but it should provide some relief. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Oral rehydration solution… is that like Gatorade? And the medication… will it make me tired? Because I have things to do. And don’t tell me it's just a viral infection. I hate being sick. And what if it is something awful? I don’t want to hear about it. Just… give me the pills and let me go home. This is taking up my whole day. Honestly, I'm starting to feel even worse just talking about it. Just… hurry up. Please.
DOCTOR: The oral rehydration solution is similar to Gatorade, but it has a more precise balance of electrolytes. I'm prescribing an anti-diarrheal medication called loperamide. It can cause some mild drowsiness in some patients, but it shouldn't interfere with your daily activities. Here is the prescription for the loperamide, and this is the lab order for the blood work and stool sample. The lab is just down the hall; they’ll take care of everything. I understand your anxiety, Ms. Woodring. I want to emphasize that most likely, this is a self-limiting illness. We're just being thorough to rule out anything serious. I’ll call you with the test results as soon as they come back, usually within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen, or if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… give me the pills and let me get out of here. Honestly, this has been a complete waste of my time. And if I feel any worse, I'm blaming you. Just… please, let me go home. I have things to do. And I need a nap. A long nap. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. I understand. Here's a pamphlet with more information about managing diarrhea. Please, rest and drink plenty of fluids. I’ll be in touch soon with the test results. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. .
