DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. I’m Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're 23 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, Lilyanna Snerling. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling rather unsteady on my feet lately. Like I might… fall over. It’s been happening for a little while now, I think. Honestly, the details are a little hazy.
DOCTOR: Unsteady on your feet, you say. “A little hazy,” hm?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I apologize. It's not that I want to be unclear, Doctor, it's just… remembering things hasn’t been easy. It’s like trying to grasp smoke. Could you perhaps ask me about specific times it’s happened? Maybe that would help me focus.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s try to be specific, then. When did you first notice this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a difficult question. I... I believe it was after… after my husband passed. Though, how long after exactly, I couldn't say. It feels like a long time now. Perhaps a few months? It wasn’t immediate, I don’t think. It crept up on me, gradually.
DOCTOR: A few months following your husband’s passing… I see. And has this unsteadiness been constant since then, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes, Doctor. Some days I feel… almost normal. Other days, even walking across the room feels like quite the effort. It’s unpredictable. And it’s not always the same, either. Sometimes it’s just a wobble, other times I feel quite dizzy, as though the room is spinning.
DOCTOR: Wobbling and dizziness… Alright. And when you experience this dizziness, can you describe it further?
PATIENT: It’s… well, it’s not like motion sickness, if that makes sense. It’s more like everything is tilting, or swaying, even when I'm standing still. And sometimes, it's not the room that feels off, but me. Like I’m the one spinning, even when I'm perfectly still. It’s very unsettling. I often have to hold onto something to keep from falling.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this… tilting sensation?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Sometimes, when it’s particularly bad, I feel a bit… nauseous. Not enough to actually be sick, usually, just a bit queasy. And… occasionally, I get a headache. A dull ache, mostly at the back of my head. I don't know if that's related, though. It could just be stress. Everything’s been… difficult, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: Nausea and headaches…Alright. Now, Ms. Snerling, have you had any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision? Oh… I hadn’t thought about that. Let me see… I don’t believe so. Nothing obvious, at least. Everything seems… blurry sometimes, but I always assumed that was just from being tired. I work long hours, you see. Oil and gas isn't exactly a relaxing profession. Is that… is that something I should be paying attention to?
DOCTOR: It is something we need to consider. Blurred vision, coupled with the dizziness and unsteadiness… have you experienced any ringing in your ears, or any hearing loss?
PATIENT: Ringing in my ears… No, I don’t think so. I haven’t noticed anything like that. And my hearing seems… normal, as far as I know. I can hear you perfectly well. Though… now that you mention it, sometimes things sound a little… muffled. But again, I just put that down to being tired, or the noise at work. It’s a very loud environment, Doctor. All the drilling… it can be quite overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Snerling, I’m going to need to ask you some questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That… that’s another difficult area, Doctor. My memory… it’s very patchy. I know I had the usual childhood illnesses, but beyond that… I don’t recall any specific diagnoses. After my husband… things were a bit chaotic. I wasn't really focusing on my own health. I have insurance, private insurance, so I did see a doctor occasionally for check-ups, but… I honestly can't remember if anything was ever found.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me think… I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, I believe. And… oh, after a work accident, a few years back, I had a small procedure on my left knee. Just a minor arthroscopy to clean up some cartilage. It wasn’t anything serious, and I recovered quickly. Beyond that… nothing comes to mind. I truly apologize, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. This is quite frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Snerling?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not currently. I haven’t taken any regular medication since… well, not for a very long time. After the knee surgery, I was prescribed some painkillers, but I only took them for a few days. I prefer to avoid medication if possible. I find that rest and… trying to stay positive are usually the best remedies. Though, admittedly, that’s been difficult lately.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Snerling, I’m going to conduct a brief physical examination. This will involve checking your vital signs, neurological function, and balance. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly acceptable. Whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment. I just… I do hope you can find out what's causing this unsteadiness. It’s becoming quite disruptive to my work, and… frankly, it’s rather frightening. Please, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. And if you could tell me about any allergies you have as I prepare.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. <Starts to carefully rise from the chair, moving a little slowly> Allergies… hmm. I don't believe I have any known allergies. Nothing to food, or medications, or… anything, really. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. <Reaches the examination table and carefully sits down, bracing herself slightly as she does so> I suppose I should mention I’ve always had a rather low tolerance for strong smells, though. They tend to make me feel a little nauseous. But that isn't exactly an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Pulse is regular at 78. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your neurological function. Please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head. <Holds a pen in front of Ms. Snerling and moves it slowly in an "H" pattern>
PATIENT: <Carefully tracks the pen with her eyes, keeping her head still, though she finds it slightly difficult to maintain focus> There… there it goes. And now over there… yes, I can see it, Doctor. It’s a little… blurry, but I’m following it. It requires quite a bit of concentration. <Blinks a few times, trying to clear her vision> Is that alright? Am I doing it correctly? It feels a little strange, trying to focus so intently on one small point.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is fine. Now, I'm going to check your balance. Please stand with your feet together, arms at your sides, and close your eyes. <Watches carefully as Ms. Snerling complies, bracing himself slightly to be ready to assist if needed>
PATIENT: <Carefully shifts weight and stands with feet together, arms at her sides, then slowly closes her eyes. She immediately feels slightly unsteady and instinctively tenses her muscles to maintain her balance. She sways slightly. Oh dear… this is… difficult. I don’t feel very stable. <Voice is slightly strained> I can feel myself wobbling. Is this normal, Doctor? I’m trying to stay perfectly still, but… <Begins to sway more noticeably, arms instinctively reaching out for support> It’s getting harder… I think I’m going to fall…
DOCTOR: Easy now, Ms. Snerling. That’s quite alright. You exhibited significant unsteadiness, and some involuntary eye movements during the examination. Your neurological function requires further investigation. I'm concerned about possible vestibular dysfunction or a central neurological issue. <Makes a detailed note on the chart>
PATIENT: <Breathes a sigh of relief, clutching the sides of the examination table for support> Oh… thank you, Doctor. That was… unsettling. Vestibular dysfunction? Central neurological issue? <Frowns, looking worried> What does that mean? Is it… serious? I have to return to work next week… will I be able to? I apologize, I’m rather frightened now. This is far more concerning than I initially thought. <Looks at Dr. Gonzalezperez with a pleading expression> What do you recommend we do next?
DOCTOR: Ms. Snerling, it’s too early to determine the definitive cause. However, your symptoms and examination findings warrant further investigation. I'm recommending an MRI of the brain to rule out any central neurological abnormalities. We will also need to perform a comprehensive vestibular function test to evaluate your inner ear. I will also order a complete blood count and a metabolic panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions contributing to your symptoms. <Begins typing notes into the computer> We need to rule out a multitude of possibilities before arriving at a diagnosis. As for your work, I cannot advise you to return until we have a clearer understanding of the underlying cause. It would be irresponsible of me to do so. <Pauses, then looks directly at Ms. Snerling> This may require a referral to a neurologist, depending on the results of these tests. Do you understand?
PATIENT: <Nods slowly, looking overwhelmed and slightly frightened, clutching her hands tightly in her lap> MRI… vestibular function test… a neurologist… <Takes a deep breath, trying to remain calm> Yes, Doctor, I understand. It sounds… rather extensive. And… concerning. <Looks down at her hands, then back up at Dr. Gonzalezperez with a pleading expression> What if… what if it is something serious? <Voice is barely a whisper> Is there anything… anything at all that I should be doing now? While we wait for the results? I just… I don’t want to lose my job, and I certainly don’t want to be… unwell. <Pauses, then adds softly> My husband… he would want me to take care of myself. <Blinks back tears, trying to maintain composure> Perhaps some rest? Is that advisable? <Looks at Dr. Gonzalezperez, hoping for some reassurance>
DOCTOR: Ms. Snerling, it’s important not to jump to conclusions. We haven’t identified a problem yet, and many possible causes exist. The tests will provide us with the information we need to make an accurate diagnosis. Rest is advisable, yes. Avoid strenuous activity and situations where a fall could occur. Maintain a healthy diet and stay well-hydrated. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, as these can exacerbate your symptoms. <Pauses, then adds in a more reassuring tone> I understand your concern, and I will do everything in my power to determine the cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. I will contact you as soon as the test results are available, and we will discuss them in detail. <Begins typing a referral order into the computer> I am also prescribing you a mild anti-nausea medication, should your symptoms worsen. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms, such as severe headache, vision changes, difficulty speaking, or weakness on one side of your body, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: <Nods slowly, trying to absorb the information and regain some composure> No, Doctor, I don’t think so… not at the moment. You’ve explained everything very clearly. <Takes another deep breath, trying to remain optimistic> Thank you. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for not dismissing my concerns. <Looks at Dr. Gonzalezperez with a grateful expression> I’ll follow your instructions, and I’ll contact you immediately if anything changes. <Rises slowly from the examination table, bracing herself slightly> Perhaps… perhaps I should schedule the tests now? Before I forget. And… thank you again, Doctor. <Pauses, then adds softly> It’s… comforting to know that someone is taking this seriously. <Offers a small, hesitant smile>
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Snerling. My assistant will schedule the tests for you before you leave. And don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. <Clicks the mouse, printing out a referral form and a prescription. You’ll receive a call from the imaging center to schedule the MRI and vestibular function tests. We will follow up with you as soon as the results are available. Good day. <pauses briefly, then returns to reviewing the chart>
