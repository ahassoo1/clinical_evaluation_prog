DOCTOR: Hi Ellan, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about this medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on about it. Says it’s the only thing that helps with her… discomfort. And frankly, I’m at my wit’s end trying to appease her. I just need a piece of paper, I suppose, to make it all official. Though I must say, I still think it’s a rather… decadent solution to a simple problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your daughter is finding relief with medical marijuana and you're looking into getting the necessary paperwork to ensure she can continue accessing it legally. And you have some reservations about it, which is perfectly understandable. Before we proceed with any paperwork, I want to make sure I understand the situation fully and that medical marijuana is a safe and appropriate option for her. To do that, could you tell me a bit more about what kind of "discomfort" she's experiencing?
PATIENT: Discomfort is putting it mildly, Doctor. Honestly, it’s… a bit of a spectacle. She claims it’s this constant pain, all over, but she’s always been… dramatic. Though I suppose I shouldn't complain, she is my only child. It started… oh, goodness, probably six months ago? She says it interferes with her sleep, and then she can't concentrate at work. She’s a… designer, you see. Very creative type. Needs her rest. It’s just… it feels like she’s making a mountain out of a molehill, honestly. And now she wants me to get involved with this… this cannabis certification.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds like this has been going on for about six months, causing widespread pain, impacting her sleep and work, and now she’s asking you to help with the certification process. You mentioned she’s a designer – that can be a stressful job. Has anything specific happened around the time this started – a change in her work situation, any injuries, or maybe a particularly stressful event?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. A stressful event… well, she did get passed over for a promotion at work around that time. A young man, barely out of school, got it instead. She was quite put out, naturally. Said her boss didn’t recognize her talent. Always blaming others, that girl. But I don't know if that would cause this much… fuss. She’s always been sensitive, mind you. A bit of a worrywart. But truly, I can’t recall anything else particularly upsetting happening. She’s generally quite… sheltered, you see. A lovely girl, just… easily flustered.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the promotion situation around six months ago seems like a potential trigger. It's good you’re thinking about possible causes. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. She describes it as… everything, Doctor. Aching, burning, stabbing… Honestly, it sounds like she’s reading from a medical textbook. She says it moves around, so it's never in one specific place. One day it's her back, the next it’s her head, then her knees… It’s quite exhausting, just listening to her. She’s tried some over-the-counter remedies, I believe. Ibuprofen, perhaps? But she says they don’t touch it. Really, she just wants this… this marijuana. Says it’s the only thing that calms it down. Though I suspect a good night’s sleep and a bit of common sense would do wonders.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a widespread, shifting pain that doesn’t respond to over-the-counter medications. That's helpful to know. And you suspect other things might be contributing. Has she seen a doctor about this pain before?
PATIENT: Yes, she did. A young man, down at the clinic on Elm Street. She said he just… shrugged it off. Said it was “stress-related” and prescribed her some… something for anxiety, I think. She didn’t like it. Made her feel… foggy, she said. Stopped taking it after a week. Said it didn’t address the pain. That’s when she started… self-medicating, as she calls it. And now she’s insisting I get involved. Honestly, it’s all a bit much. A perfectly healthy girl, worrying herself sick over nothing. Though, I do worry about her, naturally. Just… I don’t want to encourage this… this habit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so she saw a doctor who diagnosed it as stress-related, prescribed an anxiety medication she didn't tolerate, and then she started using medical marijuana. Before we discuss the certification, I do want to explore this further. Could you tell me about her medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… well, she's always been a bit… delicate, shall we say? She had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, mumps, chickenpox. Nothing serious. No broken bones, no major surgeries. She does have allergies, though. Pollen, mostly. And she gets terrible headaches sometimes, especially when the weather changes. Other than that… she’s always been fairly robust, honestly. A bit of a hypochondriac, if you ask me. Always worried about catching something. But nothing that would explain this. Honestly, I think she just needs to take a vacation. Somewhere sunny, perhaps. A bit of relaxation would do wonders. But she's too busy worrying about her… career. A perfectly good girl, squandering her potential.
DOCTOR: Okay, so childhood illnesses, pollen allergies, and occasional headaches. No major medical issues or surgeries. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. On my side, nothing much. My mother lived to be ninety-two, very healthy woman. My father… well, he had high blood pressure, but that’s about it. Her father… he had arthritis, I believe. In his hands, mostly. And her grandmother… she had some sort of… nervousness, I think. Always fidgeting and worrying. A bit like her, actually. But nothing… serious, you understand? Nothing that would explain this constant pain. Honestly, I think she just inherited her grandmother's… disposition. A bit too sensitive, that girl. And now she's convinced she needs this… marijuana. It's all very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of arthritis and some nervousness. Let's talk about her current lifestyle. Does she smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Absolutely not. She’s a very sensible girl, despite everything. Never touched a drop of alcohol in her life. Doesn't smoke, either. She does drink a lot of tea, though. Herbal tea, mostly. Chamomile, peppermint… something to calm her nerves, I suppose. She's quite health-conscious, actually. Eats a lot of vegetables, goes for walks… tries to stay active. But it doesn’t seem to be helping, does it? Honestly, it’s all very perplexing. A perfectly healthy girl, suffering from… what, exactly? And now she wants me to get involved with this… this cannabis certification. It’s all very… undignified, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking, drinking, or substance use, just herbal tea. Now, to clarify, you mentioned she's been taking medical marijuana for about six months. What kind is she using and where is she getting it from?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a good question. She doesn’t tell me much, you see. I try not to pry. She just says she gets it “from a friend.” I suspect it's one of those… delivery services, honestly. Illegal, probably. She says it helps her sleep, and calms her nerves, but… I don’t know what kind it is. Flowers, I think. Or something. She talks about “strains” and “indica” and “sativa”… it’s all very confusing. Honestly, I’m just grateful she’s not doing anything… worse. I suppose it’s better than… well, never mind. But I do worry about the legality of it all. And I certainly don’t want to encourage her to break the law. Though, she’s very insistent. Says it’s the only thing that helps. A perfectly good girl, getting involved with… this. It’s all very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so she's getting it from an unknown source, likely a delivery service, and you’re unsure of the type or strain. Alright. To best help your daughter and determine if a medical marijuana certification is appropriate, I’d like to do a brief physical exam and ask a few more detailed questions about her pain. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose so. I don't see the harm in a proper examination. Though, honestly, I doubt you’ll find anything. She's always been perfectly healthy. But if it will appease her, and get her to stop… sourcing it illegally, then I suppose it's worth a try. Just don’t expect miracles, Doctor. She’s a bit of a… worrier, you see. And she tends to exaggerate. But yes, go ahead. I’ll try to be as helpful as possible. Though I do warn you, she's rather sensitive. Best not to poke and prod too much.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We’ll just take a look at a few things – check her blood pressure, listen to her heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam. And I’ll ask her some more specific questions about where exactly she’s feeling the pain and what makes it better or worse. If you could help me get her settled on the table, that would be great. We’ll start with her blood pressure.
PATIENT: Very well. She's always been a bit squeamish, you see. Try to be gentle, Doctor. Honestly, I think she's making a mountain out of a molehill. But if it will bring her peace of mind… Just do be careful not to startle her. She doesn't like sudden movements.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be very careful. Ellan, just try to relax your arm for me. I'm just going to take your blood pressure. It'll only take a moment. And could you tell me, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you say your pain is right now?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now, don’t be difficult, dear. Just tell the Doctor. Honestly, you’re making this so much harder than it needs to be. On a scale of zero to ten… Well, I suppose it's about a… six, right now. Not terrible, but… definitely noticeable. It's a dull ache, mostly. And it’s… everywhere. Honestly, I think she exaggerates. A perfectly healthy girl, complaining about a six! But there you have it, Doctor. A six. Though, it does fluctuate, you see. Sometimes it’s higher, sometimes it’s lower. It depends on the weather, mostly. And her stress levels, of course.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And you said it’s a dull ache, all over. Can you point to the areas where you feel it the most right now?
PATIENT: Well, it's mostly here, in my lower back. It's been bothering me for weeks. And then my shoulders, they're always tense. I suppose that's from… all the work. And then my temples, when the weather changes. It's a throbbing ache, mostly. But it comes and goes, you see. Honestly, it's hard to pinpoint exactly where it is. It sort of… moves around. One day it's my back, the next it's my head. It's very… frustrating, you see. A perfectly good girl, suffering from… well, I don't even know what she's suffering from! But there you have it, Doctor. Lower back, shoulders, and temples. Mostly. Though, it does fluctuate.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you mentioned the pain is worse with stress and weather changes. Are there any specific activities that make it better?
PATIENT: Well… … lying down helps, I suppose. And… … the tea. Chamomile tea, mostly. It calms my nerves, you see. And… … well, the other thing, too. That seems to help, you know. It takes the edge off. But I don’t like to talk about it. It's… personal, you see. Honestly, it's all very… unsettling. A perfectly good girl, resorting to… well, never mind. But lying down, chamomile tea, and… that. That seems to help the most. Though, I do wish there was something else. Something… less… questionable.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is there any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Absolutely not. Nothing like that. I'm perfectly mobile, thank you very much. I walk every day, you see. Well, not every day, but… quite frequently. No numbness, no tingling, no weakness. I'm perfectly fine, physically. It's just… this pain, you see. It's very… persistent. And it's very… frustrating. Honestly, I think she exaggerates. A perfectly healthy girl, complaining about a six! But no, no numbness, no tingling, no weakness. I'm perfectly fine. At least, physically. It’s just… everything else.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to clarify, you said this started about six months ago, after being passed over for a promotion at work?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It was… quite upsetting, actually. I’d been working towards that promotion for years. And then… a young man, barely out of school, got it instead. He doesn’t have the experience, you see. But… well, never mind. It’s all water under the bridge now. But it did coincide with the start of this… discomfort. Honestly, I think the stress of it all just… triggered something. A perfectly good girl, suffering from… well, I don’t even know what she’s suffering from! But yes, it started around the time of the promotion. It was… quite a shock, actually. And then… well, everything just went downhill from there.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, to summarize, you’re experiencing widespread pain, primarily in your lower back, shoulders, and temples, that started about six months ago after a stressful work event. It’s a dull ache, fluctuates in intensity, and is worsened by stress and weather changes. You find some relief with lying down, chamomile tea, and medical marijuana. You’ve tried ibuprofen with minimal effect, and previously tried an anxiety medication that didn’t agree with you. Ellan, this sounds like it’s been very disruptive to your life. While I understand you’ve found some relief with medical marijuana, it’s important to explore all options and determine the underlying cause of your pain. It could be a number of things – muscle tension, stress-related pain, or something else entirely. Based on what I’ve gathered so far, I recommend ordering some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also suggest a referral to a physical therapist to help with muscle tension and pain management. And while you've been managing this, I understand your need for relief. I will also discuss with you the laws regarding medical marijuana, and what you need in order to access it legally. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Very sensible, actually. I suppose we should rule out anything serious. And a physical therapist… well, that wouldn’t hurt, I suppose. It’s better to be safe than sorry. And discussing the… legality of it all… yes, that would be good. Very good, actually. I don’t want her getting into trouble with the law, you see. A perfectly good girl, getting arrested… the thought is dreadful! Yes, Doctor. Blood tests, physical therapy, and a discussion about the… laws. That sounds… acceptable. Very acceptable, actually. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome. I’ll order the blood tests now, and the nurse will draw them shortly. I’ll also have the referral to the physical therapist printed out for you. As for the medical marijuana laws, I can provide you with some resources and information, or we can discuss it further after we have the blood test results. In the meantime, if your pain worsens or you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Well… … no, I suppose not. Not at the moment. I think you’ve covered everything, Doctor. No, not at the moment. We’re just… grateful for your help, Doctor. Very grateful, actually. It’s just… nice to know someone is taking us seriously, you see. No, not at the moment. Thank you. Very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I’m glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to draw the blood. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns down the line. Have a good day, and take care of yourselves.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Yes, thank you very much.
