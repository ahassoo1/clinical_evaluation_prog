DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me in? Let me think... My tummy feels big, you see? And I don't want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to. It just... doesn't feel right.
DOCTOR: I see. So, your stomach feels distended, or bigger than usual, and you’ve noticed a decrease in your appetite. That's good information to start with. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: When did it start… Oh dear. That’s a hard one. Seems like… a little while now? Not suddenly, not a quick thing. Maybe a few weeks? Or… longer? It's all a bit fuzzy, you know? I don't keep good track of dates these days.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. McConnon. It’s common for things to be a little unclear with time. A few weeks, or longer – that gives us a starting point. And has anything changed during those few weeks or months?
PATIENT: Changed… Let me see. Well, not much really. I mostly stay here, in my apartment. I read sometimes. Watch a little TV. I haven't been… out and about much. Oh! My neighbor, she brought me some soup last week. Chicken soup. Very nice girl. Does that count as a change? I don’t usually get soup.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. So, generally your routine hasn't changed much, except for the soup from your neighbor. And the change in appetite and feeling of fullness – is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes, I think. Some days I feel more hungry, a little. But mostly, it's just not very good. Like eating feels like… a lot of work. And sometimes, even when I am hungry, my tummy feels so full already. It’s strange. It doesn’t make much sense, does it?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. McConnon. It’s important for us to figure out what’s causing this. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fullness and decreased appetite?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think again. Well, I’ve been a little… tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. And maybe a little… gassy? Yes, that’s it. A little bit of gas. Nothing terrible, just… uncomfortable sometimes. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, both the fatigue and the gas are important to know. Fatigue can be related to many things, and gas could indicate how your digestive system is functioning. Now, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no vomiting. Not at all. And nausea… I don’t think so. I haven’t felt… sick to my tummy, like that. Just not very hungry, and a little tired. It's just a… dull feeling, mostly. Not sharp, not painful. Just… not right.
DOCTOR: I understand. Not sharp, not painful – that's helpful to know. Have you had any changes in your bowel movements recently?
PATIENT: Bowel movements… oh dear. That's… a private question, isn't it? Well, I haven't been… regular, I suppose. Sometimes I go, sometimes I don't. It's a bit… unpredictable. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. McConnon, that’s exactly what I wanted to know. Changes in bowel habits are important to assess. And it's perfectly alright to discuss these things with me; it’s all part of understanding what’s going on. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Hmm. I haven’t been trying to lose weight, that's for sure. I haven't weighed myself in a long time, actually. Maybe… I feel a little thinner, but I don’t know if that’s just… getting older. It's hard to say, really. I mostly wear the same clothes. They still fit, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's alright. Now, Ms. McConnon, do you have any known allergies to medications or foods?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. I don’t take many pills, either. Just a little something for my… for my bones, the doctor gave me. Years ago. I can't remember the name of it, though. It was a white pill, I think. Small one.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. A small white pill for your bones. We can look that up later. And just to be thorough, Ms. McConnon, have you had any major medical illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh my. That’s a long time ago now. Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was young. A long, long time ago. And… I broke my arm once, when I was a little girl. Fell out of a tree. That’s about all I can remember, really. Old age, you know. Everything gets… fuzzy. Nothing else serious, as far as I know. I've been pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: You have been lucky, Ms. McConnon. And finally, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Family… My parents… They both lived to be very old, actually. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. Not very good heart. And my father… he had trouble with his… his memory, towards the end. Like me, a little. Not very helpful, am I? Everything’s so fuzzy.
DOCTOR: You’re very helpful, Ms. McConnon. Knowing a little about your family history, even if it’s fuzzy, is valuable information. Alright, Ms. McConnon, thank you for answering all of those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and gently feel your abdomen. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Do whatever you need to do. I’m just glad to be getting this checked out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart rate is a little slow, but that's not necessarily a cause for concern given your age. I'm not hearing any murmurs or abnormal sounds. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Please tell me if anything feels painful. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly distended. I’m noticing some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen. Not anything alarming, but we'll keep that in mind. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes… a little bit there. Not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It’s not terrible, but I notice it when you press. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Ms. McConnon, but it’s important to understand what’s causing the discomfort. Given your symptoms – the fullness, decreased appetite, fatigue, and this tenderness – I think it would be prudent to order some blood tests and a CT scan of your abdomen. The blood tests will help us assess your overall health and look for any signs of infection or inflammation. The CT scan will give us a more detailed image of your abdominal organs and help us identify any potential problems. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Tests… Oh dear. Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes. Do whatever you think is best. I don’t like tests, but I want to know what’s wrong. A CT scan… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: The CT scan won't hurt, Ms. McConnon. You'll lie on a table that slides into a large donut-shaped machine. It’s a bit noisy, and you’ll need to lie very still for a few minutes, but it’s completely painless. We may need to give you some contrast dye intravenously to get a clearer picture, but that’s also generally well-tolerated. I’ll give you a requisition form for the blood tests, and we’ll schedule the CT scan for as soon as possible. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll be expecting you. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening abdominal pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Blood tests… and a scan. And go to the hospital if things get worse. That's a lot to remember. Will you… will you explain the results to me when they come back? I'm not very good with medical things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. McConnon. I will personally explain the results to you in detail. We'll go through everything together, and I'll answer any questions you have. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are available. Here’s the requisition form for the blood tests. Just take this to the lab down the hall, and they’ll take care of everything. And I’ll have my nurse schedule the CT scan for you before you leave. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that's everything for now. Just… thank you, Doctor. For taking the time, and for explaining things. It’s a bit scary, but I feel better knowing we’re getting it checked out. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. McConnon. I'm glad I could help. Remember, if anything changes or worsens, don't hesitate to seek medical attention. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule your CT scan and answer any further questions you might have. Please take care.
