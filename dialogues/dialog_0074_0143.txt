DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Reisig, you say? Yes, nice to meet you as well. Hmm… what brings me in… well, it’s a bit… fuzzy, to be honest. My daughter, she said I should come. Something about… before things happen? Before a baby comes, maybe? She made the appointment. I don’t really… understand all of it, if I’m honest. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. It sounds like your daughter is very thoughtful and proactive about your health, and it's common to feel a little uncertain when coming in for a general check-up, especially if you haven't been feeling specifically unwell. We can certainly take things at your pace and figure out what's best. So, let’s start with this “before things happen” – does that relate to any particular symptoms you’ve been experiencing, even if they seem minor?
PATIENT: Symptoms… not really. I feel… old, I suppose. But that’s just getting older, isn't it? Nothing wrong, exactly. Just… tired sometimes. And maybe a little forgetful. But who isn't at my age? I don't know if those are symptoms of anything. My daughter was talking about… tests? And making sure everything is good before… well, before she and her husband try for a baby. Is that right? I think that’s what she said. I get confused easily.
DOCTOR: It sounds like your daughter is concerned about your overall health as she and her husband plan their family, and wants to ensure you are in the best possible shape. That's very considerate of her. And you’re right to question whether fatigue and forgetfulness are simply part of aging – they can be, but it's always wise to investigate. Let’s talk a little more about the fatigue. When you say tired, can you describe that a bit?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not like… sick tired. More like… everything takes effort. Getting up in the morning is harder. Doing things around the house… I used to be able to do so much more. Now I need to sit down after a little bit. And it's not just physical. It’s… mental tiredness too. Hard to explain. Like my brain is… slow. It’s been going on for… well, I don’t know. A while, I think. Maybe a few months? It’s hard to remember these things. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: You're not at all causing any trouble, Mr. Verrall. It’s perfectly understandable that it’s hard to pinpoint these things. Describing fatigue as taking more effort, both physically and mentally, is very helpful. A few months is a reasonable timeframe to consider. Now, regarding the forgetfulness – can you give me an example of what you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Well… Just yesterday, I went to the shop to get milk. I know I did. But I came back and couldn't remember what else my wife – well, my late wife – used to ask me to get. Little things, you know? And names… sometimes names escape me. Not all the time, but often enough to be… annoying. It's not like I forget who people are, just… their names. And sometimes I’ll start a sentence and… where was I? Oh dear. It’s embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all, Mr. Verrall. These things can happen to anyone, and it's good that you're noticing and sharing them with me. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty with both short-term and recall memory. To get a better understanding of your overall health and what might be going on, I’d like to ask you a few more questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was young. A long time ago. And… the doctor said I had high blood pressure, years ago. They gave me pills for it, but I don't take them anymore. I stopped a long time ago. I didn't like taking pills. Besides, I felt fine after a while. Nothing else, I think. Maybe a bad back now and then, but that’s just getting old, isn't it? I don’t really go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so appendectomy in your youth and a history of high blood pressure that you’re no longer treating with medication. It’s good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries other than your appendix removal?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think… No, I don’t think so. Maybe… when I broke my arm as a child? But that wasn’t really surgery, was it? Just a cast. No other surgeries, to my knowledge. I remember everything being very simple back then. Not like now, with all the fancy tests and things. It's all a bit overwhelming, really.
DOCTOR: No, a cast wouldn’t be considered a surgery. So, to clarify, just the appendectomy in your youth. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a difficult one. My family… they’re mostly back in Kurdistan. I haven’t seen most of them in… well, a very long time. My mother… she lived to a good age, I think. But I don’t really know much about her medical history. My father… he had heart trouble, I believe. But again, it was a long time ago, and I wasn’t really involved in those things. I don’t have much information, I’m afraid. It’s sad, really. We weren’t very close.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. It’s not always possible to have detailed family medical history, especially if you’ve been separated from your family for a long time. Knowing that your father had heart trouble is helpful, though. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… my late wife… she didn’t like smokers. And I… well, I didn’t want to upset her. It’s a bad habit, anyway. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, though. Not too much. Just one or two glasses. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Mr. Verrall. One or two glasses of wine with dinner is generally considered moderate. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything, ever. I eat most things. Maybe a little bit of trouble with pollen sometimes, but that’s just hay fever, isn't it? Nothing serious. I’m a pretty healthy person, really. Despite… everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Like I said, I don’t like taking pills. I stopped taking the blood pressure medication years ago, and I haven’t taken anything since. I try to stay healthy on my own, with good food and… well, just trying to get enough rest. It's getting harder, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no current medications. Now, before we move on to a brief physical exam, I just want to ask one last thing. Could you describe your typical diet?
PATIENT: Hmm… my diet. Well, my daughter does most of the cooking now. She tries to make healthy meals. Lots of vegetables, some fish… chicken sometimes. I used to eat a lot more meat, but she says it's not good for me. I like bread… and I have a sweet tooth, I’m afraid. Chocolate is my weakness. But overall, I eat pretty well. I think. It’s hard to keep track of everything these days. I just eat what she puts in front of me, mostly. She means well.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a reasonably healthy diet, Mr. Verrall. It's good that your daughter is helping you stay nourished. Okay, now I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. We'll start by checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. I just want to know if everything is… okay. I’m a bit worried, if I’m honest. Especially with my daughter trying for a baby. I want to be healthy for her… and for the little one, if they’re lucky enough to have one. Go ahead. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 148/92. That's a little elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Lungs are clear, but I notice you have a slightly reduced respiratory effort. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the lower quadrants. And I’ll just check your reflexes… Reflexes are a little diminished. Okay, Mr. Verrall. Everything seems generally stable, but I'm noting some findings that warrant further investigation. The elevated blood pressure, the heart murmur, reduced respiratory effort, and diminished reflexes are all things we need to look into.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound very good, does it? A heart murmur… that sounds serious. And what did you say about my breathing? I do get a bit breathless sometimes, especially when I climb the stairs. But I just thought it was… old age. What does this mean, Doctor? Am I very sick? Is it something serious? Will I be able to… you know… be there for my daughter?
DOCTOR: Now, let’s not jump to conclusions, Mr. Verrall. It's good that we're identifying these things now. A heart murmur doesn't automatically mean something is seriously wrong. It simply means there's an abnormal sound when listening to your heart. It could be caused by a number of things, some of which are relatively harmless. The reduced respiratory effort is something we need to investigate further, but it could be related to a number of factors, including your age and overall fitness level. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. These will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity, and a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs. We should also monitor your blood pressure at home for a week. These tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and develop a treatment plan. It's possible that we'll need to refer you to a cardiologist for further evaluation, but let's take it one step at a time. And to answer your question directly, it's certainly possible to remain healthy and be there for your daughter. These tests are simply a precautionary measure to ensure that you're in the best possible condition. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… More tests. It all sounds very complicated. I don't like tests. But I understand… you're just trying to find out what's wrong. I suppose I should do whatever you think is best. Monitoring my blood pressure at home… how does that work? Do I need a special machine? And what about seeing a cardiologist… is that because something is really wrong with my heart? I just want to be okay. I want to be there for my daughter… and if she's lucky enough to have a baby, I want to be there for that baby too. It’s a lot to take in. My wife… she would have known what to do. She always knew what to do.
DOCTOR: It is a lot to take in, Mr. Verrall, and it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. Let's break it down. For the blood pressure monitoring, yes, you'll need a home blood pressure machine. They're readily available at most pharmacies and are relatively inexpensive. I can write you a prescription for one, or I can provide you with a list of recommended models. You'll take your blood pressure twice a day – once in the morning and once in the evening – for a week and record the readings. Bring the record with you on your follow-up appointment. Regarding the cardiologist referral, it doesn't necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. A cardiologist is a specialist in heart health, and it's always best to get a specialist's opinion if there are concerns. They can perform further tests, such as an echocardiogram, to get a more detailed look at your heart. We’re taking these steps to be thorough and ensure you receive the best possible care. I understand that you’re concerned, and I want to assure you that we’ll work through this together. I'm writing prescriptions for the home blood pressure machine and the blood tests now. The lab results should be available in a few days. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results and determine if a cardiology referral is necessary. In the meantime, continue with your regular diet and activity levels, and let me know if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. You’ve explained it very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate that. It’s just… a lot to process. A home blood pressure machine… I’ll need to ask my daughter to help me set that up. And I’ll be sure to let you know if anything changes. Thank you for listening, Doctor. And thank you for taking the time to explain everything. I feel a little bit better, knowing that we’re doing something about it. Even if it means more tests. It's good to know someone is looking out for me. I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verrall. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns between now and your follow-up appointment. It’s my pleasure to help. Here are the prescriptions and the lab request form. The lab is located just down the street at the medical center. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. And thank you again for everything. I'll see you soon. .
