DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knock. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure. Well, to put it plainly, I’d like to stop smoking. It’s… it’s been a long habit, you see, and I’ve decided it’s time. Perhaps a bit late, but one never knows, do they?
DOCTOR: No, it’s never too late, Mr. Knock. That’s a wonderful decision, and I commend you for making it. It's certainly not easy. We can definitely work on this together. To get started, could you tell me a bit about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I began smoking when I was… oh, seventeen, I believe. During the war, you understand. Everyone did, practically. It started with just a few cigarettes a day, mostly with friends. Then… well, it just grew. Now, I smoke… let me think… approximately twenty cigarettes a day. Perhaps a bit more when I’m stressed. I’ve tried to quit a few times, years ago, but… it never lasted. It’s a difficult thing to shake. I mostly smoke… Marlboro Reds, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Twenty a day… Marlboro Reds… okay, that gives me a good starting point. And you’ve tried quitting before, which tells me you have some motivation and an understanding of the challenge. Can you recall how you tried to quit in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, I can recall. The first time, I simply… stopped. Cold turkey, as they say. It was… unpleasant. Very unpleasant. I became quite irritable, and I found it very difficult to concentrate. That lasted about a week, perhaps less. Then… well, I succumbed. The second time, I attempted to use those… patches, I believe they were called. Nicotine patches. They helped a little with the cravings, but I didn’t enjoy them, and I felt… rather unwell. Nauseous, mostly. And the third time… I confess, I can’t recall the exact method. It was a long time ago, and my memory isn’t what it once was, though I do remember it didn't work. All rather unsuccessful attempts, I’m afraid. I suspect I lacked the proper… support, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Okay, so cold turkey was difficult, patches caused nausea… and nothing stuck long-term. That’s helpful information. It sounds like you’ve tried a couple of different approaches. And you’re right, support is incredibly important. Before we discuss potential options, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well, I’m generally… reasonably healthy, I suppose, for a man of my age. I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, which makes walking a little difficult sometimes, but nothing too serious. My blood pressure is… usually a little high, the doctor told me a few years ago, but I haven’t been checked recently. I haven’t had any major illnesses, thankfully. I do get… winded rather easily, but I attribute that to the smoking, mostly. I’ve never been a smoker of anything other than cigarettes. And I try to eat a balanced diet, though I do enjoy a good sausage now and then. I don't have any allergies that I'm aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in the knees, slightly elevated blood pressure… no major illnesses, gets winded easily. You mentioned a balanced diet, that’s good to hear. And no known allergies. When was the last time you had a physical exam, if you recall?
PATIENT: Let me see… that would have been… oh, goodness. Approximately three years ago, I believe. It was at the old clinic, before they moved. Doctor… Doctor Volkov. He was a good man. He said my lungs sounded… a little rough, unsurprisingly, but nothing alarming at the time. He advised me to… well, you can imagine. To quit smoking. He didn't offer any specific assistance, though. Just… encouragement. It wasn’t terribly helpful, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, three years ago with Dr. Volkov, and he noted slightly rough lungs. Alright. Given that it’s been a few years, and given your smoking history, I’d like to do a quick examination today, if you’re agreeable. Just to get a baseline and see where we’re at. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. I have no objections. Whatever you deem necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I suppose it’s best to know the extent of the damage, if any.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It will be fairly straightforward. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. Just a quick listen and look. If you could just sit back and relax, and take some deep breaths when I ask. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I’m quite relaxed, Doctor. Though I confess, I'm always a little nervous around medical instruments. Old war memories, you see. Not pleasant. But I will try to remain calm. Proceed when you are ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a moment. Your blood pressure is… 148 over 85. A little elevated, as you mentioned the doctor had noted before. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a few deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. In… and out… in… and out… I believe I am breathing adequately, Doctor. Though I do get rather breathless after even mild exertion. Is that normal? Perhaps that is just a sign of my age.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds… regular, but a little bit of diminished intensity. Your lungs… I am hearing some wheezing, especially on exertion, and some diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes. It’s not alarming at this moment, but it’s consistent with a history of smoking. It also explains the breathlessness you’re experiencing. It confirms what we suspected. There is some effect from the smoking. It doesn't mean it's too late to make a difference, but we need to address this. Now, let's take a quick look at your throat, just to rule out anything obvious. Could you open your mouth and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Ah… I hope I’m not a bother. I’ve always had a rather dry throat, especially in the mornings. I attribute that to the smoking, naturally. Is it very red? Perhaps I should have had a glass of water before coming in.
DOCTOR: It's a little red, yes, and slightly irritated. No obvious signs of anything concerning. It's consistent with irritation from smoking. Alright, Mr. Knock. Based on what we’ve discussed and the quick examination, it’s clear that your smoking has had some effect on your respiratory system. We’ve confirmed some wheezing and diminished breath sounds, and a little irritation in your throat. But it’s absolutely not too late to do something about it. Now, let’s discuss some options for quitting. Have you considered any nicotine replacement therapies beyond the patches you tried before, such as gum, lozenges, or inhalers?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. I confess, I didn’t know there were so many options. The patches were suggested by a pharmacist, years ago. I simply asked about ways to quit, and that’s what he recommended. I didn’t delve much further into it. Gum, lozenges… inhalers? I’m not sure I’m familiar with those. Are they… complicated to use? I’m not terribly tech-savvy, you see. And I am rather worried about side effects. I didn’t enjoy the nausea from the patches, and I’d prefer to avoid anything similar. Perhaps there are… medications? I’ve heard about pills that can help. Though I’m generally hesitant about taking pills, unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Mr. Knock. There are several options, and it’s good you're considering all the possibilities. Nicotine gum and lozenges deliver a controlled dose of nicotine to help with cravings, but some people find the taste unpleasant or experience jaw soreness. Inhalers mimic the hand-to-mouth action of smoking, which can be helpful psychologically, but they can cause some throat irritation. And you're right, there are medications available. Bupropion and varenicline are two common options. Bupropion is an antidepressant that can help reduce cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Varenicline specifically targets the nicotine receptors in the brain, reducing the pleasurable effects of smoking and lessening cravings. However, both have potential side effects, and they require a prescription and regular monitoring. Given your concerns about side effects and your hesitation about taking pills, I’m leaning towards exploring behavioral support and perhaps starting with a less intensive nicotine replacement therapy like gum or lozenges, if you’re willing to try. We could also discuss referral to a smoking cessation program that offers counseling and support. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Hmm. Behavioral support… that sounds… sensible. Counseling, perhaps? I’ve never been to a counselor before, but I suppose it couldn’t hurt. I’m rather set in my ways, you see, and perhaps a professional could offer some… guidance. I’m hesitant about the gum or lozenges, given the taste and potential jaw soreness. But I suppose I could consider them, if it’s a minimal dose. And I certainly wouldn’t want to start on any powerful medications, unless absolutely necessary. Perhaps the counseling first, then? And we can discuss the gum or lozenges at a later date? If you think that’s the best course of action, Doctor, I’m willing to try. I just want to be rid of this habit, once and for all. It’s been a long time, but I’m finally determined.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Knock. That sounds like a very reasonable plan. I completely understand your hesitation, and we can take things at your own pace. I can provide you with a referral to a local smoking cessation program. They offer individual and group counseling sessions, and they can help you develop coping strategies and manage cravings. I'll also write down a few resources for you, including a helpline and a website with helpful information. In the meantime, I’ll document our discussion and write a prescription for a low-dose nicotine gum, just in case you want to try it. There is no obligation to use it. It’s simply there as an option. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfect, Doctor. A referral to the counseling program, some resources, and the prescription for the gum, just in case. I appreciate you not pushing me into anything. And I'm glad you're being so… understanding. I believe that’s all I need for today. Thank you for your time and guidance. I feel… more hopeful now, than I did before. Perhaps I can finally conquer this habit, after all.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knock. And you absolutely can. It takes courage and determination, and you’ve already taken the first step. Here’s the referral information and a list of resources. The prescription for the nicotine gum will be sent to your pharmacy. Please don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Knock. I wish you all the best on your journey to a smoke-free life.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Renzi. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. I appreciate your kindness and support. I will be in touch, if needed. Goodbye.
