DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, a friend suggested I look into… preventative things. About HIV, you know? She said there’s a pill you can take before anything happens. I don’t really understand it all, but I figured it was worth asking about. I’m Helaina, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Trefren. PrEP, pre-exposure prophylaxis. It is preventative. Though, frankly, I find it’s often people with… less concern for safe practices who request it. Regardless. Before we go further, let's get a little background. Have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… a little rude, if I’m being honest. But okay. Yes, I have. A couple of times, actually. Back… oh, maybe ten years ago? When my nephew was… going through some things. It was just being careful, you know? Everything came back negative then. I don’t really keep track of dates, though. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It matters in the sense that a recent negative test is… necessary. Ten years is quite a while. And, frankly, risk factors change. Do you currently have any… partners?
PATIENT: Partners? No, not really. I haven’t been with anyone… seriously… in a long time. It’s just me. I mostly keep to myself, work, and visit with family. That's why my friend was surprised I was even asking about this. She thought I was… well, never mind. Is this something you need to know a lot of detail about? It feels a little personal.
DOCTOR: Ms. Trefren, it’s a medical assessment. We need to ascertain risk. While I understand your… discomfort, PrEP isn’t simply handed out. It has potential side effects, and we need to determine if it’s even appropriate for you. Have you had any recent… unusual illnesses?
PATIENT: Unusual illnesses? Hmm… not really. I had a bad cold last winter, like everyone else. And my arthritis flares up sometimes, but that’s just getting old. Nothing… sexually transmitted, if that’s what you’re asking. Look, Doctor, I'm just asking about a preventative pill. I don’t want to spend the whole morning detailing my life story. Is there a simple yes or no answer to whether I can try it, or is this going to be a whole interrogation?
DOCTOR: Ms. Trefren, medicine isn’t about “simple yes or no” answers. It’s about responsible care. We need a recent complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an HIV test to confirm your status. Then we can discuss if PrEP is suitable. Frankly, given your age and… lifestyle as you describe it, I’m not entirely convinced it’s necessary. But, fine. Let’s start with the blood work. Do you have any allergies to latex or any trouble with giving blood samples?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none that I know of. And no, I don't have trouble giving blood. I donate when I can, usually around the holidays. Although, I always get a little lightheaded, so they make me lie down afterwards. Is that going to be a problem? Look, if it's a whole ordeal, maybe I should just forget about it. My friend is probably just being overly cautious.
DOCTOR: Lightheadedness is… noted. It could indicate low iron, which is… common. But alright. We’ll proceed. I'll have the nurse draw the blood samples. We’ll also need a urine sample, for a basic kidney function assessment. The nurse will give you instructions. And Ms. Trefren, please understand – this is not a casual request. We need to rule out any underlying conditions before proceeding with any medication. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Fine. Urine sample, blood work… I get it. You need to be thorough. Just… please don’t make me feel like I’m doing something wrong for even asking. I just want to be safe. Tell the nurse I'm not very good with these things, okay? And… how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to keep coming back and forth if it’s going to be weeks.
DOCTOR: The lab usually returns results within three to five business days. The nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Frankly, I doubt we’ll find anything concerning, but it’s best to be certain. Now, if you’ll excuse me… The nurse will be with you shortly. Do you have any other questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s it. Just… get it done, okay? I have things to do. Thank you, Doctor. I think. .
