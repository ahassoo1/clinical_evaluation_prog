DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I'm Dr. Condray. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, let's get this over with. I need a clearance for… a little something I’m having done. A face lift, if you must know. My daughter insisted I get checked out first. Honestly, all this fuss.
DOCTOR: Alright, a pre-operative clearance for a facelift. That’s perfectly reasonable – good on your daughter for encouraging that! We want to make sure you're in the best possible shape for the procedure. To start, can you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Health? What's to tell? I'm eighty-one years old. Things are going to be… off somewhere, aren’t they? I used to be strong, worked with terrazzo all my life. Heavy work. But that was… well, a long time ago. No major illnesses, if that's what you want to know. A bit of arthritis, naturally. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, as you can see.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, no major illnesses diagnosed. Arthritis, which is common, and some vision changes. Just to be thorough, when you say "arthritis," where exactly are you experiencing pain, and how would you rate it on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven’s sake. A scale? Really? It's in my hands, mostly. Makes it hard to… do things. And my knees. Gets worse with the weather, you know? Damp cold. As for a number… oh, alright. Let’s say… a four, on a good day. Maybe a six when it’s raining. Honestly, it’s just… old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, four to six, worse with damp weather, primarily in your hands and knees. That helps me understand a bit better. Have you been taking anything for the arthritis – any over-the-counter pain relievers, creams, or anything prescribed by another doctor?
PATIENT: Just ibuprofen, when it really bothers me. The blue pills, you know? Not regularly, though. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. They mess with your stomach. And I saw a doctor about it years ago, gave me some… cream. Didn't do much good, so I stopped. Waste of money, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen as needed, and a previous trial of a topical cream. Now, thinking about your medical history in general, have you ever been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Let me see… well, when I broke my wrist, years ago, falling off a ladder. Terrazzo work, you know. Dangerous business. And… oh, pneumonia, once. A bad bout of it. That was… a long time ago. Nothing since then, not really. Just the usual sniffles and colds.
DOCTOR: Okay, a wrist fracture and pneumonia in the past. That's good to know. Have you had any surgeries before, aside from potentially setting the wrist?
PATIENT: No. Never. I've always been a strong man, you see? Avoided needing anything like that. Didn't want any… messing around inside me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior surgeries. Now, thinking about your family... are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, families. My father… he had a weak heart. Died young, actually. And my mother… she had something with her memory, later in life. Not sure what it was. Just… forgot things. And my sister… she had cancer, breast cancer, I think it was. Dreadful business.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart disease, memory issues, and breast cancer. I appreciate you sharing that. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father always said it was a waste of good money, and bad for your lungs. And he was right.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: A little beer with dinner sometimes. Mostly on weekends. Nothing heavy. A couple of glasses, maybe. Scandinavian men, you know. It's… traditional.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of beers on weekends. That’s good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I get a bit of a sniffle with pollen in the spring, but that's just… nature. No bad reactions to any pills or anything. I've always been a pretty robust fellow.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. So, no known allergies. Now, before we proceed with the physical exam, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements on a regular basis?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, now and then. My daughter keeps nagging me to take it. Says it's good for my bones. I forget sometimes, to be honest. Not a regular thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, a multivitamin occasionally. That's good to know. Now, let's do a quick physical exam to get a better picture of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Let’s just get this over with. The sooner it's done, the sooner I can get back to my life.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me when I ask.
PATIENT: All this poking and prodding... Hurry it up, will you? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, rate is 72 beats per minute. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops auscultated. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulses are 2+ and regular in all extremities. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Everything seems to be within normal limits for your age, Mr. Orwin. Now, I’d like to discuss some pre-operative blood work to ensure everything is optimal before your facelift. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh, for crying out loud. More poking and prodding? Honestly, I swear doctors just like to draw blood. Fine. Whatever. Just… make it quick. And tell me what it's for. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. The blood work is just a precaution to make sure your body is functioning well enough for surgery and to identify any potential issues we need to address beforehand. We’ll check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, and a few other basic things. It will help us ensure a safe and successful procedure. It shouldn't take long, and we’ll get the results back within a few days. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Where do I go? And how long will this… ordeal… take? Honestly, all this fuss for a little… improvement.
DOCTOR: The phlebotomist is just down the hall, first door on the left. It will only take about 10-15 minutes. They’ll just need a small sample of blood. Once they’re done, you can come back and we’ll discuss the next steps once the results are available. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just… get me out of here. Honestly, doctors these days…
