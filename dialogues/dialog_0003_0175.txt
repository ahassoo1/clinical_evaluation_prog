DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. I am Dr. Yackey. I understand you’re here today for a consultation. To begin, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh, well, it's my back, mostly. It's been, you know, painful. Not all the time, but enough to bother me. It's been going on for a little while now.
DOCTOR: "A little while" is rather vague, Mr. Way. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, sorry, sorry. Let me think... maybe three, four months now? It started kinda slow, just a little ache after I'd been standing for a long time. Now it's... sharper sometimes. It wakes me up at night, too, if I move the wrong way.
DOCTOR: And where specifically is this pain located?
PATIENT: Hmm... it's hard to say exactly. It's mostly across my lower back, you know? Like, right at the small of my back. But sometimes it feels like it shoots down my leg a little bit, on the right side. Not all the way to my foot, thankfully. It's more of a... tingling, you know? Not a sharp pain in the leg, just... uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Tingling, you say. Does anything relieve the pain, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: Well, sitting actually helps a bit, surprisingly. And when my wife rubs it, that feels good for a little while. But it always comes back. Lying down doesn't really do much, and honestly, sometimes it makes it worse. I've tried some of those over-the-counter pain relievers, the ibuprofen stuff, but it doesn’t really seem to touch it.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen, right. And have you noticed anything that specifically causes the pain to flare up?
PATIENT: Oh yeah, definitely. Bending over is bad. Like, picking something up off the floor? Forget about it. And gardening... I love gardening, but even just weeding for a little while will put my back out. Also, long car rides. That's a killer. Sitting for too long, I guess. It's funny, because sitting helps the pain sometimes, but too much sitting is bad.
DOCTOR: Right. So, exacerbated by activity, relieved somewhat by rest, but prolonged sitting is problematic. Have you experienced any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or weakness. Not that I've noticed, anyway. Everything feels... normal, just uncomfortable. Like, I can still walk and everything, and I haven't dropped anything or anything like that. It's just... a persistent ache, mostly. And the tingling, when it flares up. I'm just worried it's gonna get worse, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have a quick look. Please point to the areas of maximal discomfort. And, if you wouldn't mind, I'll need you to bend forward, as far as you comfortably can, and then stand back up. I'm just assessing range of motion and areas of tenderness. There's some muscle guarding here... and tenderness upon palpation of the lumbar spine.
PATIENT: Okay. Right around here mostly, but it kinda radiates out. And... Ooh, that's not so good. Yeah, that definitely brings the pain on. Feels a little stiff now, actually. You're right about the stiffness.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Limited range of motion, tenderness to palpation. Based on this brief examination, it appears you may be experiencing a lumbar strain. However, given the tingling sensation you described, we need to rule out any nerve involvement. Do you have any history of prior back injuries or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, sir. No injuries or surgeries. Nothing like that. I used to be pretty active, played basketball in high school, but that was a long time ago. Just... normal aches and pains over the years, you know? Nothing serious. This feels different, though. More… persistent. And that tingling worries me a bit.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Not really. Just some vitamins, the usual stuff for an old guy, you know? Nothing prescribed by a doctor. I haven't really needed much medication over the years. I try to stay healthy. No allergies, either. Is this something serious, Doctor? I mean, should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely to be anything immediately life-threatening, Mr. Way. However, given your age and the reported tingling, I recommend an X-ray to rule out any structural abnormalities. We also need to assess your reflexes and strength in your lower extremities. I’ll order the imaging and a neurological evaluation. I’ll also recommend a course of physical therapy and some over-the-counter anti-inflammatories. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… X-ray, neurological evaluation… physical therapy. That sounds… like a lot. Um… will the physical therapy be expensive? I don’t really have insurance, you see. And… is the tingling something I should really be worried about? Like, could it be something serious serious? I’m just… a little scared, to be honest. I don’t like going to the doctor.
DOCTOR: Mr. Way, I understand your concerns. The cost of physical therapy varies. I can provide you with a list of facilities that offer sliding scale fees. As for the tingling, it could indicate nerve compression, which is why we're proceeding with the neurological evaluation. It's important to rule out any serious underlying pathology. Here is a referral for the imaging and the neurological consult. I recommend you schedule those appointments as soon as possible. We will discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay... Sliding scale fees... That's good to know. I appreciate that. And the neurological consult... I guess I'll call and schedule that. Um... what if they find something bad? Like, what's the worst-case scenario? I just like to be prepared, you know? And... how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to be waiting forever.
DOCTOR: Mr. Way, I understand your anxiety, but speculating on worst-case scenarios is unproductive. The vast majority of lower back pain resolves with conservative treatment. However, if the imaging does reveal a more significant issue, we will discuss all treatment options thoroughly. As for the results, it typically takes approximately one week to receive them. My office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are available. Are there any other concerns I can address before we conclude?
PATIENT: No, I... I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I’ll call and schedule those appointments. I hope it’s nothing serious. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please let my office know if you have any difficulties scheduling. Have a good day, Mr. Way.
