DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Chellsea. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too. I’m here because… well, I have cancer. It’s… a lot. I don’t really know where to start, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Chellsea. That is a lot to process. I'm so sorry to hear that. We'll take things at your pace. You don't need to feel like you have to tell me everything all at once. First, can you tell me when you were diagnosed, and if you've already started any treatment?
PATIENT: Um… I was diagnosed in March. This year. And… yes, I’ve been doing… chemotherapy. For a few months now. It… makes me very tired. And sick sometimes. Is that… okay to say?
DOCTOR: That’s absolutely okay to say, Chellsea. It’s very common to experience fatigue and nausea with chemotherapy. In fact, it would be unusual not to. Can you tell me a little more about the chemotherapy regimen you’re on?
PATIENT: Um… a regimen? I… don’t know what that means. The doctor at the other hospital… he just told me what drugs they were giving me. Something about… “F-something” and… “C-something”? I’m sorry, I don’t remember the names. It’s all… a little blurry. I get them every other week.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all, Chellsea. That’s perfectly understandable. A lot of information can be overwhelming. A regimen just means the specific plan of chemotherapy drugs and how often you receive them. Okay, so they give you chemotherapy every other week. Do you remember where you were receiving treatment, so I can potentially look up the specifics?
PATIENT: It was… at St. Joseph's Hospital. About an hour away. It’s… a big hospital. They… they were very busy. I think… Dr. Ramirez was my oncologist there. If that helps.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. Let me pull up Dr. Ramirez's notes – hopefully we can find the specifics of your chemotherapy regimen there. While I’m doing that, can you tell me a little bit about the type of cancer you were diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Um… it’s… breast cancer. Invasive ductal carcinoma, the doctor said. It was… in my right breast. And… it had spread to some of the lymph nodes. I… don’t really understand all of it. It’s… scary. Is that okay to say?
DOCTOR: It is absolutely okay to say, Chellsea. It’s completely normal to be scared, and it’s good that you’re acknowledging those feelings. Invasive ductal carcinoma is a serious diagnosis, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. Okay, so invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast with lymph node involvement. Dr. Ramirez’s notes confirm you’ve been receiving a combination of Fluorouracil and Cyclophosphamide. Have you had any imaging done recently – like a CT scan or a bone scan – to check if the cancer has spread anywhere else?
PATIENT: Imaging… yes. I had a scan… in June. A CT scan, I think. And… a bone scan too. The doctor said… it hadn’t spread anywhere else, thankfully. But… there’s a spot on my liver. He said it could be the cancer, or… something else. They want to do more tests. Is… that bad? I'm sorry, I'm probably asking silly questions.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking silly questions at all, Chellsea. It's good you’re asking them. A spot on the liver is something we need to investigate further, but it doesn't necessarily mean the cancer has spread. It could be a number of things. Do you know what type of tests Dr. Ramirez wants to do to investigate the spot further?
PATIENT: He… said a biopsy. And maybe… an MRI? He wanted to see what it was. He said it could be… a false alarm. But… he wanted to be sure. It just… makes me nervous. I've had so many tests already. It feels like… they’re always looking for something wrong. I’m sorry. I'm getting upset.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable that you're feeling upset, Chellsea. You’ve been through a lot, and it’s exhausting to constantly be under medical evaluation. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed and nervous. A biopsy is a good way to get a definitive answer about what’s going on with the spot on your liver. It’s a standard procedure. Before we get too far ahead, I'd like to do a more thorough review of your medical history, just to get a complete picture. Have you had any other significant medical issues in the past?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I had pneumonia when I was little. And… I broke my arm once. But… nothing major. I’m… pretty healthy, usually. I used to… hike a lot. Before all of this. My husband… he liked to hike too. But… he passed away last year. That’s… why I’m widowed. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to… get sad.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Chellsea. Losing someone you love is incredibly difficult. It’s okay to share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. And no, you didn't mean to get sad at all. It’s important to acknowledge these things. Let's move on to your family history, if you’re comfortable. Is there any history of cancer in your family, particularly breast cancer or other related cancers?
PATIENT: Um… my grandmother… on my mom’s side. She had breast cancer. A long time ago. But… she was okay. She… lived a long life. My mom… she doesn't have cancer. And… I don't think anyone else on my dad’s side had it. It's… a little blurry. I'm not very good at remembering family stuff. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Chellsea. It's not important to have all the details. So, your maternal grandmother had breast cancer. That's helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. I don't smoke. And I don’t drink alcohol. Never have. And… definitely not drugs. I… I used to work a lot. As an occupational therapist. But I had to… stop when I got sick. It was too hard. I… miss it. It gave me purpose. I’m sorry. I’m probably talking too much.
DOCTOR: You are not talking too much at all, Chellsea. It's important for me to understand your life and what’s going on with you. I’m glad you shared that you were an occupational therapist – that’s wonderful. And it's understandable that you had to stop working – your health comes first. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. I don't have any allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I… I’m pretty lucky, usually. Except for… this. This isn’t lucky at all. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to… get emotional. It's just… hard.
DOCTOR: You don’t need to apologize at all, Chellsea. It's okay to feel emotional. What you're going through is incredibly difficult, and it's perfectly natural to be upset. It's good to allow yourself to feel those emotions. Okay, so no allergies. Now, let’s do a brief physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll palpate your abdomen. This will give me a better sense of your overall condition. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s… okay. I guess. It’s just… I’m always a little nervous when people touch me. It… reminds me of the tests. But… I trust you. I think. Is there… anything I should expect? I'm sorry, I’m probably asking silly questions.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright to feel that way, Chellsea. It's very common to feel anxious about medical exams, especially given everything you’ve been through. I will explain everything as I go, and please let me know if you feel uncomfortable at any point. I will start by listening to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. It doesn’t hurt, it just might feel a little cool on your skin. Then, I will gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. I will start on the upper right side and work my way down. If anything feels painful, please tell me immediately. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles noted. Abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant. No masses palpated. Can you tell me, does that tenderness come and go, or is it constant?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes. Sometimes it hurts really bad. Especially after I eat. Or if I… lie on my right side. It’s… hard to explain. It’s just… uncomfortable. Like… a dull ache. And sometimes it feels… sharp. Is that… normal? I'm sorry, I’m probably asking silly questions.
DOCTOR: You're not asking silly questions at all, Chellsea. It's important for you to describe everything as accurately as possible. That’s very helpful information. The tenderness in your right upper quadrant, especially with eating and lying on your right side, and the description of a dull ache that sometimes sharpens, could be related to several things. Given your history of breast cancer and the recent imaging finding, it’s important to investigate further. At this point, I recommend we proceed with ordering a repeat CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis with contrast, if you haven’t had one recently. This will help us to better visualize the spot on your liver and determine if it has changed in size or character. I also want to order a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your liver function. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes. That… sounds okay. I just… I just want to know what’s going on. I don’t want to keep wondering. The not knowing is… the worst part. If a scan will help… then yes. Please.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Chellsea. The uncertainty is often the most difficult part. We’ll get those orders sent over to the radiology department right away. They’ll schedule you for the scan as soon as possible. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a medication to help manage your nausea and vomiting, given your chemotherapy treatments. It's called Ondansetron. It can be taken as needed. I’ll also give you some written instructions on managing your side effects. I’d also like to schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results of the scan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That… sounds good. A scan and… some medicine. And a follow-up. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. I feel… a little bit better, just knowing we’re doing something. Even if I’m still scared.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. It’s perfectly okay to still be scared, and it’s good that you’re acknowledging those feelings. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I’ll be here to support you throughout the process. Here are the instructions for managing your side effects and the prescription for Ondansetron. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can do for you today, or any other concerns you’d like to discuss?
PATIENT: No. I think… that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Bacy. Really. You… you were very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Chellsea. I was happy to help. Remember, I’m here for you. Please take care on your way home, and don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. It was nice meeting you. .
