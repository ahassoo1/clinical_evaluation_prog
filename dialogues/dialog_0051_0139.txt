DOCTOR: Good morning, Yamir. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… want to get this done quick, if okay. It’s for… referee thing. Fitness check. Need paper say I’m good.
DOCTOR: Alright, a fitness check for refereeing. I understand. We’ll do our best to be efficient. Just to be clear, is this for a specific organization or league?
PATIENT: Uh… yes. Local basketball league. Small thing. They just… want to be sure. Old man run it. He worry too much. Don't know why he need paper from doctor though. Just run, jump, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. Even for a local league, it’s good they’re taking precautions. It's always best to have a baseline assessment, just to make sure everything’s in good working order. It helps to identify anything that might need attention before it becomes a problem. Let's start with a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries… small things. Ankle, playing basketball when young. Nothing broken. And… wife, she… passed last year. Not injury, but… big thing. Other than that, no. Pretty healthy. I think. Don't really go to doctor much.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Yamir. That must have been incredibly difficult. It's understandable if you haven’t prioritized medical check-ups recently. Okay, and have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgery. Never. Just… the ankle, I see a… what you call… physical therapist. For a few weeks. That's all. No cut, no… big doctor thing. Just rub and stretch.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. Good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… my mom, she got… high blood pressure, I think. And my grandpa, he got… sugar problem. Diabetes? Yes, that’s it. Diabetes. Other than that… not really. Lots of farmers, mostly. Strong people. Not much sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of hypertension and diabetes. That’s helpful to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Eat everything. Never had problem. Sometimes… dust make me sneeze, but that’s it. Not… serious allergy. Just… normal.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t like… pills. Just… water. And sometimes… tea. That’s all. No doctor stuff. Never needed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Yamir. That’s very good to know. Just to be thorough, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I… work. Repair ovens. Heavy work. And… basketball. Referee two nights a week. Sometimes three. That’s it. Mostly work, mostly tired. Not much else. Want to finish this quick, if okay.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. Just a few more quick questions, then we'll move on to the physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. No smoking. No drugs. Sometimes, small beer with friends. Very small. Once a month, maybe. Not much. Bad for health. I know. Wife didn't like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, very occasional small beer. That’s good to know. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a basic neurological assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Just… quick, yes? I got work tomorrow. And… want to get this done. Heart, lungs… okay. But quick.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll be as quick as possible. Please sit comfortably and take a few deep breaths. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130/80. That's slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning. Let's just do a quick neurological check… I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then I'll check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay. Finger… reflexes… whatever you need. Just… hurry. Getting cold in here.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything appears to be normal so far. Now, just a quick assessment of your range of motion... Can you please stand up and touch your toes for me?
PATIENT: Ouch. Old back. Not so good anymore. Used to be strong, but… ovens. Heavy. That it? Can I sit now?
DOCTOR: Yes, please sit down. That’s alright, Yamir. It’s common to have some stiffness with physical work. Okay, Yamir. Based on my brief examination and your medical history, everything appears to be generally within normal limits. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and you did mention some back discomfort. To be thorough, I would recommend a few things. First, I’d like to order a basic blood panel to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. Also, an EKG to assess your heart health would be prudent, given your slightly elevated blood pressure. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: More tests? Really? I just want paper say I’m good for basketball. Paper. Not… whole doctor thing. Blood… and… heart thing. Cost money. And… time. Can’t I just… run on treadmill? You see I’m okay, then give paper?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Yamir. I truly do. And I appreciate you wanting to keep things simple. Running on a treadmill would give me some information, but it won’t give us the full picture. The blood panel and EKG are relatively quick and provide valuable insights into your overall health, especially considering your slightly elevated blood pressure. It's not about questioning your fitness for basketball, but about ensuring your long-term well-being. It’s better to identify potential issues early, before they become more serious. If you're concerned about the cost, we can discuss options for making it more affordable. And I promise, we’ll keep the process as efficient as possible. Would you be willing to consider just the blood panel for now?
PATIENT: Blood panel… only. No heart thing. Just… blood. But… quick, yes? And… cheap. Promise? I got bills to pay. And… work. Just… blood. That it. No more. Then… give paper. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Yamir. Just the blood panel. I promise we’ll make it as quick and affordable as possible. I’ll write the order now, and the lab is just down the hall. They should be able to get the results back to us within a couple of days. Once we have those results, we’ll review them together, and if everything looks good, I’ll happily provide you with a note stating you are medically cleared to referee basketball. Here you go. Please take this to the lab, and they’ll take care of the rest. Do you have any questions about the process?
PATIENT: No questions. Just… blood. Down hall? Okay. Thank you, Doctor. Hope it’s quick. And… cheap.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Yamir. We’ll do our best. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns.
