DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Brando. Uh… well, it’s about… a check-up, I think? Something about needing it for… work. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. A performance thing, I believe. They said I needed clearance. Is that right? I don't really keep track of these things anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando, a work clearance check-up. That’s perfectly alright. We can definitely get that sorted out for you. It sounds like your employer has some specific requirements. To start, can you tell me a little bit about the type of work you do?
PATIENT: Work… yes. I… I mostly work at theaters. Ushering, taking tickets… sometimes helping people find their seats in the lobby. That sort of thing. It's… not very strenuous. Mostly standing, I suppose. Been doing it a long time now. A very long time. Honestly, it all blends together after a while.
DOCTOR: That sounds… pleasant, actually. Standing for long periods can be deceptively tiring, though. We’ll want to make sure everything is alright. Now, aside from the work requirement, have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Generally well… hmm. Yes, I think so. No big complaints. A little achy sometimes, you know, getting older. But nothing I haven't gotten used to. My memory isn't what it used to be, but… that’s probably just age. And worry. I worry a lot. Is that something you check for?
DOCTOR: We don't specifically check for worry, Brando, but we can certainly talk about it if it's bothering you. It's good you're aware of it. The aches and pains are common, of course. Let’s try to pinpoint those a little more. Where are you feeling the most discomfort?
PATIENT: Mostly in my knees, I think. And my lower back. It’s not constant, you understand. It comes and goes. Standing for too long usually makes it worse. And… sometimes after I bend over to pick something up. It’s just a little twinge, nothing dramatic. I've gotten used to it, really. I just… try not to bend over too much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees and lower back, aggravated by standing and bending. That gives us a good starting point. Have you had any injuries to your knees or back in the past?
PATIENT: Injuries… hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think… I think I twisted my knee once, a long time ago, when I was much younger. Playing basketball, I think. But it wasn’t serious. I just… iced it for a while, and it got better. I don’t remember any injuries to my back, though. Not that I recall. It’s all… a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright, a possible knee twist in the past, but nothing significant. And no recollection of back injuries. Now, let's move on to some general health questions. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a lot to remember. Let me see… I think the doctor mentioned my cholesterol was a little high a few years back. Something about watching my diet. But I don’t take any medication for it. And… I don’t think I have anything else. No, definitely not. I try to stay healthy. Mostly. I eat… reasonably well, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, elevated cholesterol. We can check a recent lipid panel to see where things stand. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes I take an aspirin, if I have a headache. But that’s it. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing like that. I never really got into all that. I prefer just… trying to get enough sleep. That’s what I need, mostly. Sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright, just occasional aspirin for headaches. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That’s another good question. I don’t think so. No, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. Though… I’m not a big fan of shellfish. But that’s just a preference, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to hear. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, I just want to ask about your family history. Are there any major medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… that’s… complicated. My parents are both gone now. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had something with his heart, I believe. But it was a long time ago. I don’t really know the details. We weren’t very close, to be honest. It's all a bit fuzzy. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Brando. It’s common for details to be unclear. We'll work with what you remember. Now, just a couple more questions before we move on to the physical exam. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she used to smoke, but she quit a long time ago. It’s a terrible habit, you know. I always told her that. I’m glad she quit.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… hmm. I used to drink a little, with dinner sometimes. A glass of wine, maybe. But I haven’t had anything in… oh, goodness, probably a year now. It just… doesn’t appeal to me anymore. And I want to stay sharp, you know? For work.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional past alcohol use. That’s good to know. Now, finally, do you have any concerns about your memory or any other cognitive issues?
PATIENT: Well… that’s why I’m here, isn’t it? It's not what it used to be. I forget things. Names, dates… even what I had for breakfast. It’s… frustrating. I worry about it. It makes it hard to… focus. I don't know if it’s just age, or something more. That's what I'm hoping you can tell me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brando. I understand your concern about your memory. That’s a very valid reason to come in for a check-up. We can definitely assess that today. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a few simple neurological tests. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just… want to get to the bottom of it. The memory, you know? It's unsettling. Please, go ahead. I'll try to… cooperate. Though, forgive me if I’m a little slow.
DOCTOR: Of course. No need to apologize at all. Let’s just start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit here for a moment?
PATIENT: Alright… here I am. A little wobbly, perhaps. But I’m here. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 142 over 88. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please breathe normally. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Your reflexes are normal. Now, I'm going to do a very quick cognitive test. I'm going to ask you to remember three words. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, ready. Three words… alright. Go ahead. Though, don’t be surprised if I forget them immediately. It happens.
DOCTOR: No problem at all. The words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Try to remember those. Now, I'm going to ask you a few other questions, then I'll come back to those three words. Do you know what year it is?
PATIENT: Hmm… the year… let me see… is it… 2024? No, that doesn’t feel right. Is it… 2025? Yes… I think it's 2025. August, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is August 2nd, 2025. Good. And can you tell me your current location?
PATIENT: My location… Oh, dear. This is… a doctor’s office, isn’t it? In… the suburbs, I believe. A nice office. I don't recognize the name of the place, though. I just came here for the check-up.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you repeat the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Three words… Hmm. Let me see… Apple… something with a table… and… a color? No, not a color. A coin? Oh, dear. It’s gone. It’s all gone. I’m sorry. I completely forgot.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Brando. It happens. This quick assessment does indicate some cognitive impairment. We need to investigate this further. I’m going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 level. I'm also going to order an MRI of your brain. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your memory loss. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… an MRI… Oh, dear. It sounds… serious. But… yes. Yes, that’s alright. If it will help me figure out what’s going on… then yes. Please, do whatever you think is necessary. I just… want to know. I want to understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brando. I understand. I'm going to write you a requisition for the blood work. You can get that done at any local lab. The MRI will need to be scheduled, and my office will help you with that. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend that you avoid driving or operating heavy machinery. It's also important to get plenty of rest and stay hydrated. We also need to talk about a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A neurologist… yes, that sounds… wise. If you think it's necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… I feel lost, you know? And worried. But yes, a neurologist. Please, arrange that for me. And thank you. For… everything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brando. It’s my job to help. I'll have my assistant schedule an appointment with a neurologist for you. They will be able to perform a more in-depth cognitive assessment and discuss potential treatment options. We will also review your blood work and MRI results together when they are available. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… not at the moment. I think… I think my head is a little full. Just… please let me know when the results are in. And thank you again. For being so patient. And understanding. I appreciate it more than you know. I guess… I’ll go now?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Take your time. My assistant will be right with you to go over the paperwork and schedule your appointments. And please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help you through this, Brando. We’ll get to the bottom of this together.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Asami. You’ve been… a comfort. I truly appreciate it. I’ll… see you soon, then.
DOCTOR: You take care, Brando. We'll be in touch. .
