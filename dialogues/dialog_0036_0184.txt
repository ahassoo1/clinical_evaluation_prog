DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too. Look, I ain’t got all day. It's about... well, it's about how I look. Always been a strong man, you see. Pile driver operator. Real work. But things... shift. And I want it fixed. Quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re concerned about some changes you’ve noticed in your physical appearance, and you’d like to address them quickly. Can you tell me more about what’s been shifting?
PATIENT: Shifting... well, everything's going down. Not where it should be, you understand? And... loose. Used to be firm. Now? Like old canvas. And the stomach... always been flat, hard. Now it’s… well, it’s not. I want it back to how it was. Before. Is that so hard to understand? I don't need a lecture, just a fix.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not hard to understand at all, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you’ve noticed a loss of muscle mass and some changes in your abdominal area. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, could you tell me how long you’ve been noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, maybe... a year or so? Hard to say exactly. Time flies when you're working. But definitely getting worse the last six months. Used to be able to lift anything, no problem. Now, a little strain and… oof. Not good. And the clothes don't fit the same. That’s a good sign, right? Something's wrong if the clothes don't fit. I always been a size 34 waist. Now… well, let’s just say it’s creeping up. I want the 34 back. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Okay, a year or so, with worsening over the last six months. And changes in your clothing size. That's helpful. And you've noticed difficulty with lifting?
PATIENT: Difficulty? Yes. Not like before. Used to just… lift. Now, I gotta brace myself. Gotta think about it. Which is… ridiculous. A man shouldn't think about lifting a beam! Should just do it. And the back… sometimes a little twinge. Not bad, but it's there. It wasn't there before. Look, are you gonna ask me a million questions or are we gonna get to fixing this? I got things to do. Real work. Not sitting around talking.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. I want to help you get back to feeling your best as quickly as possible. To do that, I need a little more information, but I’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Before we talk about potential solutions, let’s just cover some basics. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. Maybe a few pounds. Don't weigh myself regularly, you know? Too busy. But the clothes… yes, definitely looser. Not like I’m trying to lose weight. Never been one for that nonsense. Always been solid. Strong. So, if the clothes are looser and I’m noticing things… then yeah, I guess I lost a little weight. Is that important? Seems like it should be the muscle that matters, not the weight.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Trendler. Both can tell us different things. Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? No. Eat the same as always. Big breakfast, good lunch, hearty dinner. Always been a big eater. Never skipped a meal. Still enjoy a good plate of jerk chicken, you know? Though sometimes… a little harder to get through it. Not that I can't eat it, just… less of an appetite, maybe? But I force myself. Gotta keep the strength up. Still working, you know. It’s not like I can just sit around. So, no, appetite's mostly the same. Is this getting us anywhere? Or are we just talking about my eating habits?
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere, Mr. Trendler. It helps me understand what’s going on. You've mentioned changes in muscle mass, unintentional weight loss, and a slight decrease in appetite. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any fatigue or weakness?
PATIENT: Fatigue… hmm. More tired than I used to be, yes. But that could be the work, you know? Pile driving. It’s hard work. Always been tired at the end of the day. But lately… a little more. And sometimes… just don't have the energy. Not like before. Used to just keep going, all day. Now, gotta take a little rest. A little longer nap. But I don’t like naps. A man shouldn’t need naps! Look, are we gonna get to a solution or what? I’m wasting daylight.
DOCTOR: Okay. You mentioned feeling more fatigued and needing more rest. I'm looking at your recent bloodwork now. It looks like your testosterone level is quite low for your age. That could explain a lot of what you’re describing – the loss of muscle mass, fatigue, decreased energy, and even the weight loss. It can also affect your appetite and overall mood. Does that sound like something we should investigate further?
PATIENT: Testo… what? Low what? Look, I don't understand all this medical talk. You're saying something's missing? Something a man needs? And that's why I'm losing muscle and getting tired? Is that what you're saying? And can you fix it? Can you put it back? Because if you can, let's do it. Quickly. I ain't got time for… for low what-you-call-it. Just fix it. Is that possible? And what does it cost? I ain't paying for fancy talk, I'm paying for results.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Trendler, that’s exactly what I’m saying. Your testosterone level is lower than it should be, and that can cause those symptoms. It’s a common condition as men age. The good news is, it’s often treatable. We have a few options. Testosterone replacement therapy is one possibility, but we'd need to discuss the risks and benefits thoroughly. There are also lifestyle changes – diet and exercise – that can sometimes help. Before we decide on a plan, I'd like to do a physical exam to rule out any other underlying causes. It’ll just take a few minutes. And we can discuss the costs and insurance coverage afterwards. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Exam… alright. If it gets me back to how I was, fine. But no poking and prodding for hours, you hear? I got things to do. And talk to me in plain English. No fancy medical terms. And I want a price. Before you do anything. I got private insurance, but I still wanna know. Quickly. And no lectures about lifestyle changes. I've been working hard my whole life. Just fix what's broken. Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Trendler. No poking and prodding for hours, I promise. Just a quick exam to get a better understanding of your overall health. I will explain everything in plain English, and we will discuss the costs before proceeding with any treatment. Let’s start with your weight and blood pressure. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick check of your muscles. “Your weight is 122 pounds, which is a decrease from your last visit. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is within a normal range. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, let's just check your muscle strength and reflexes…” "Your muscle strength is a bit lower than expected, and your reflexes are slightly diminished. This is consistent with what we've been discussing."
PATIENT: So? What does it mean? Is it the missing… thing? And can you fix it? I ain't got all day. Get on with it. And tell me about the price. Before anything else. I need to know if this is worth my time and money. I'm a practical man. Waste no time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Trendler. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, along with your low testosterone level, it’s very likely that low testosterone is contributing to your issues. Testosterone replacement therapy is a potential option. It can be administered through injections, gels, or patches. The cost varies depending on the method and dosage, but generally runs about \$150-\$300 per month. Your insurance should cover a portion of this, but the exact amount will depend on your plan. We'll need to get a pre-authorization before starting treatment. There are also potential risks and side effects, such as increased risk of prostate problems, sleep apnea, and acne. We’d need to discuss these in detail to make sure it’s the right option for you. Before we proceed with therapy, I recommend a PSA test to check your prostate health, and a repeat testosterone level to confirm the initial results. Would you like to schedule those tests?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests? Look, I ain't got time for a million tests. But if it’s gonna get me back to normal… alright. Do the tests. Quickly. But if they're gonna take weeks to get back, forget it. And what about this… this gel thing? Is it better than the needles? I don't like needles. And what about the sleep thing? I sleep fine. Always have. So, tell me about the gel. And the price. Before I agree to anything. Just give me the facts. No fancy talk. And no wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler, let’s talk about the gels. Testosterone gels are applied to the skin once daily. They’re a good option for men who don’t like needles, as they avoid injections. They deliver a steady dose of testosterone throughout the day. The gels typically cost around \$250-\$300 per month, and your insurance should cover a portion of that, after your deductible is met. As for the sleep apnea risk, it's a potential side effect of testosterone therapy. However, it’s not common, and we can monitor you for any symptoms, such as loud snoring or daytime sleepiness. If you develop any symptoms, we can refer you to a sleep specialist for further evaluation. The PSA test is a simple blood test that checks your prostate health. It takes about five minutes, and the results typically come back within a few days. The repeat testosterone level will confirm your initial results and ensure that we have an accurate baseline. Would you like to schedule those tests today?
PATIENT: Gel sounds… better. No needles. Alright. Do the tests. Both of them. Get it done quickly. And tell the lab to send the results to you, not to me. I don't need to see numbers. Just tell me what they mean. And how much it's gonna cost. Before you do anything. I'm a practical man. Waste no time. And no pushing any unnecessary tests or treatments. Just fix what's broken. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Trendler, that’s perfectly understood. We will schedule the PSA and repeat testosterone tests today. The results will be sent directly to me, and I will explain them to you clearly and concisely. I will also provide you with a detailed cost estimate before proceeding with any treatment. I won’t push any unnecessary tests or treatments. Our goal is to get you back to feeling your best, and we will only proceed with options that are appropriate for your needs and preferences. Let me get the lab orders ready for you. The lab is located just down the street, and they accept your insurance. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just get it done. Quickly. And no wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Trendler. We’ll get everything taken care of. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day.
