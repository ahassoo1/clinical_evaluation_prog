DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. I’m Dr. Batara. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. It’s… difficult to explain. I suppose a general feeling of… sadness, for lack of a better word. It’s been weighing on me. I’m hoping you can help me sort through it. I really don’t have a lot of time today, if you don’t mind a quick visit.
DOCTOR: "Sadness," you say. Well, we all feel down sometimes. But it’s good you came in. “Not yourself” is… vague. Can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. It’s not just a bad day, you understand. It's… a lack of enjoyment. Things I used to find pleasure in… don’t anymore. My work, seeing my grandchildren… even a good cup of tea doesn’t lift my spirits. And I’m… tired. Constantly tired, even when I’ve had a full night’s sleep. Does that make sense? I’m a bit… scattered today, I apologize.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities and persistent fatigue. And this has been going on for… how long precisely?
PATIENT: Precisely… that’s a good question. It’s difficult to pinpoint. I’d say… at least six months, perhaps longer. It started gradually, a slow fading… I didn’t really notice it at first. It’s only recently gotten… worse. I’ve just been trying to push through it, honestly. I’m not one to complain.
DOCTOR: Six months or longer… Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My appetite… it comes and goes. Some days I barely eat anything, and others I… well, I find myself eating more comfort foods than usual. And I suspect I've gained a little weight. Not much, but enough to notice in my clothes. It’s not like I’m overeating constantly, but… it’s there. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Everything is important, Ms. Derasmo. Changes in appetite and weight are often linked to… well, a number of things. Have you experienced any difficulty sleeping – beyond just feeling tired?
PATIENT: Difficulty sleeping… yes, actually. I have trouble staying asleep, mostly. I fall asleep alright, but I wake up several times during the night. And then I lie there… tossing and turning, unable to get back to sleep. It’s quite frustrating, and it adds to the fatigue, of course. It’s been happening for… oh, I’d say about three months now. Is this getting somewhere, Doctor? I do have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Loss of interest, fatigue, appetite changes, weight fluctuation, sleep disturbance… and for how long have you been experiencing this general feeling of… sadness?
PATIENT: As I said before, about six months, perhaps longer. But it's worsened recently. It’s like a… a heavy blanket, Doctor. Just constantly weighing me down. I'm not crying all the time, or anything dramatic like that. It's more of a… quiet emptiness. A lack of motivation. I find myself withdrawing from things, and just… existing. Is this what you need to know? Because frankly, I’m not very good at explaining these things. And that appointment is soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Derasmo. Before we get too far, let me ask a few quick questions to rule things out. Have you noticed any physical pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Physical pain? Not particularly. My joints ache a little sometimes, from the work, you know, the lifeguarding and ski patrol. That's just age, I think. But nothing… constant or debilitating. No headaches, no stomach problems, nothing like that. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older. I'm quite sturdy, you see. Always have been. Is that sufficient? I really must keep an eye on the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any recent stressful life events?
PATIENT: Stressful… well. My divorce was final about a year ago. That was… difficult. It wasn’t acrimonious, exactly, but it was still a lot to adjust to. And my daughter is going through a rough patch with her marriage, which worries me greatly. But I wouldn’t call it… recent. It’s been a while. Is that relevant? I’m trying to be helpful, Doctor, but I feel like we’re going in circles.
DOCTOR: Ms. Derasmo, with all due respect, I need a clear picture. Recent stressful events are relevant. Divorce within the last year, daughter experiencing marital issues… these things can certainly contribute to how you’re feeling. Now, do you have any family history of depression or anxiety?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Family history… My mother… she was always a bit… melancholy. She didn’t talk about it, but she was often quiet and withdrawn. And my aunt, on my father’s side, spent some time in a hospital years ago. I believe it was for… nerves, they said. But beyond that, not that I’m aware of. Honestly, we didn't discuss these things much in my family. It wasn’t considered polite, perhaps. Are we getting closer to a diagnosis, Doctor? I truly don't have much time left.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Derasmo, based on what you’ve told me—loss of interest, fatigue, appetite changes, sleep disturbance, recent stressful events, and a family history suggestive of mood disorders—it’s possible you're experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it's too early to make a definitive diagnosis. It could also be a result of adjustment to life changes. I recommend a trial of Sertraline. Start with 50mg daily. Let's see if that improves your symptoms. Follow up with me in a month.
PATIENT: Sertraline? A medication? Doctor, I came to talk about my feelings, not to be put on drugs! I thought you would try to… I don’t know, offer advice, or suggest coping mechanisms. Not… medication. I’m a very strong woman, Doctor. I can handle this myself. I don’t think I want to do this. Perhaps I should get a second opinion. I really must go. My appointment is waiting. Thank you for your time.
