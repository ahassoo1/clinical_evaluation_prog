DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, hello. I am here for… the check-up. Before the insurance starts, you said. A physical, yes? It is… necessary, I understand. Though I do not see why they require so much fuss before allowing a man to simply have insurance.
DOCTOR: Yes, the pre-insurance physical. It’s… standard procedure, I assure you. Lots of paperwork and verifying things are as they should be. Though I won’t pretend I understand the complexities of insurance myself. Well, regardless, let's get this done. Have you had a physical recently, or is this a completely new evaluation for us?
PATIENT: No, not recently. I… have not been to the doctor for many years. Back home, things were… different. We did not bother with such things unless something was broken, you understand? This feels… excessive. But, if it is required for the insurance, then I suppose. I have no complaints, presently.
DOCTOR: Right, so a new evaluation then. Perfectly alright. It’s good you’re taking care of it now. It’s better to get a baseline established, even if you feel fine. You’d be surprised what we can sometimes catch early on. Now, let’s start with the basics. Can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? I… work. I lift things. Heavy things, sometimes. I eat. I sleep. What more is there to say? I do not drink… much. And I do not smoke. I am a simple man with simple needs. I have no… fancy illnesses, if that is what you are asking. I am strong. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Yes, alright. That’s… good to hear. But "strong" isn’t a medical diagnosis, Mr. Barban. We need a bit more detail. Have you had any recent issues with, say, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness?
PATIENT: No! No chest pain. No… breath problems. No dizziness. I told you, I am strong. Maybe… sometimes my back aches. From the lifting. It is normal. Everyone gets a sore back when they lift heavy things. It goes away after I rest. It is not a… a problem. It is just… life. Do you need me to… demonstrate my strength?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Barban, demonstrations aren't necessary. I appreciate your… enthusiasm, but we're trying to determine if this back pain is something we need to investigate further. It's good that it goes away with rest, but we should still rule out anything serious. How long have you been experiencing these back aches?
PATIENT: Hmm. How long… It is difficult to say exactly. Perhaps… a year? Maybe a little more. They come and go. When I have a very heavy load at work, then it hurts. When the work is lighter, it is fine. It is… predictable. Not a constant pain, you see? Just when I use my back. It makes sense, does it not? A strong man's back will ache when he works hard.
DOCTOR: Predictable doesn't mean harmless, Mr. Barban. It could be a muscle strain, or something more significant. We’ll need to do a brief physical exam to assess it. If you’ll just follow me, we’ll take a look. Please remove your shirt and shoes.
PATIENT: Remove my shirt? In here? Is that… necessary? I am a modest man. And my shoes… it is August. It is hot. I do not wish to walk barefoot. I have worked very hard today, and my feet are… not presentable. Perhaps we could examine my back through my shirt? It seems… reasonable.
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, it is standard procedure to properly examine your back for any abnormalities. I understand your concerns about modesty, but I assure you this is a professional environment. It allows me to check for muscle spasms, tenderness, and any structural issues. I am not suggesting you parade around naked, simply remove your shirt so I can conduct a proper examination. As for your feet, I have clean paper coverings available if you prefer. Please, let’s not make this more difficult than it needs to be. It will only take a few moments.
PATIENT: Very well. But I insist on wearing socks. My socks are clean. And I expect a full explanation of whatever you are looking for. I do not like to be… surprised. And if you find something… concerning, you will explain it to me in simple terms. No medical… jargon. Understood?
DOCTOR: Perfectly understood, Mr. Barban. Socks are fine. I will explain everything clearly and avoid any unnecessary jargon. If you could lie down on your stomach, please. I'll start by palpating your spine and surrounding muscles to check for any tenderness or spasms. Just relax as much as possible. Okay, does this hurt?
PATIENT: No. Not yet. But be gentle. I am a strong man, but even strong men have sensitivities. It feels… cold. This table is very cold. Ow! Yes, there! That one hurts a little. But it is… normal. I told you I lift things. It is probably just a strained muscle. A strong man’s strain, you understand. Not a weak man’s complaint.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how about here?
PATIENT: Yes! That one as well! It is… uncomfortable. More than uncomfortable. It is… a sharp pain. Not a dull ache, but a sudden, sharp pain. See? I told you. Lifting. Heavy things. It is always the back. Everyone knows that. You do not need to press so hard. You are making it worse. Is this… serious? You are looking very concerned. It is just a strained muscle, yes? A strong man’s strain?
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, while it could be a simple muscle strain, the location and intensity of the pain, combined with your description, warrants further investigation. There’s tenderness along your spinal processes, and the pain seems to radiate somewhat. I want to order some imaging – an X-ray, to rule out any structural issues like a fracture or vertebral compression. I also recommend a blood test to check for any inflammation. It's better to be thorough. We need to rule out anything more serious than a simple strain. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Imaging? Blood tests? You think I have a fracture? A compression? This is ridiculous! I lift things for a living! My back is strong! I do not need to be poked and prodded and… imaged! I… I do not like this. I came here for a simple check-up before the insurance starts, and now you are talking about fractures and… blood? This is… excessive. Absolutely excessive. No. I do not agree. I do not need any imaging. I do not need any blood tests. I just want to go home. I am a strong man, and I do not need your fancy tests. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I understand your reluctance, but as your physician, I have a responsibility to ensure your health and safety. Declining necessary testing could have serious consequences. I am not suggesting you are not strong. However, pain is a symptom, and it needs to be investigated. I strongly recommend we proceed with the X-ray and blood tests. If the results are normal, then we can attribute it to a muscle strain and discuss a treatment plan. However, if we don't investigate, and it is something more serious, it could lead to long-term complications. I cannot, in good conscience, discharge you without addressing this further.
