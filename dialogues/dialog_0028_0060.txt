DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Theriot, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Look, I don't usually bother with doctors unless something’s really wrong. But my aunt… well, she just got diagnosed with something nasty. Runs in the family, apparently. I’d just like to know I’m not… doomed, you know?
DOCTOR: "Doomed" is a rather… dramatic term, Mr. Theriot. Family history is a factor, certainly. But it doesn’t guarantee anything. Now, let’s try to be specific. What exactly did your aunt get diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Honestly? I didn’t really pay that close attention. Cancer, I think. One of the… stomach ones? She was going on about chemo and… scans. Look, I’m an engineer, not a medical professional. I deal in facts and figures, not… feelings and diagnoses. It all just sounded bad, and my mom was very insistent I get checked out "just in case."
DOCTOR: "Just in case." Very well. So, you’re here because of a family history of… a gastrointestinal cancer, potentially. And you’d like a general assessment. Let's start with you. Any current symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not really. I mean, I get indigestion sometimes, but who doesn’t? And I'm… particular about what I eat. Always have been. My wife… ex-wife, used to call me a fussy eater. It’s probably just that. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. It’s the idea of it, you know? The worry. It’s just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Indigestion, occasional. And anxiety related to family history. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Now we’re getting personal? Look, I’m a rational person. What does that even have to do with anything? I mean, sometimes things are… different. Everyone’s system fluctuates, doesn’t it? I don’t keep a detailed log, if that’s what you’re asking. It’s not exactly something I discuss.
DOCTOR: It’s relevant, Mr. Theriot. Changes in bowel habits can be indicative of certain conditions. It’s a standard part of the assessment. Think carefully. Any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Absolutely not. Look, I told you, I feel fine. This is ridiculous. Are you implying I have something wrong with me just because my aunt got sick? I’m a perfectly healthy, functioning adult. I eat reasonably well, I exercise occasionally, and I don’t go around looking for problems. Frankly, I’m starting to regret coming here. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No blood in the stool. Let’s move on then. Any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. If anything, I’ve been having trouble keeping weight on. My ex-wife used to complain I was getting… “sturdy.” It's probably just stress. This divorce has been a nightmare. Honestly, I think I'm eating more now, comfort eating. It’s not a healthy habit, I admit, but it's not… concerning. Is this going somewhere, or are we just listing random bodily functions?
DOCTOR: Just establishing a baseline, Mr. Theriot. Past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history? Nothing significant. Usual childhood illnesses. I broke my arm once when I was ten, fell out of a tree. Appendicitis when I was fifteen. They took it out. Other than that? Nada. I rarely get sick. Strong immune system, I guess. I’m not one for… doctors and hospitals. Always preferred fixing things myself.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy at fifteen. No other surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing else. I'm pretty low-maintenance, medically speaking. Look, is there a point to all this, or are we just going through the motions? I have things to do, you know? I can't spend all day discussing my… digestive habits. I just wanted a quick reassurance, maybe a blood test or something, and then I can get on with my life. This is… unnecessarily intrusive.
DOCTOR: Alright. No past surgical history besides the appendectomy. Any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not really. I get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but it’s not severe. I can tolerate them, I just don’t particularly like them. Food allergies? None that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Spicy food, shellfish, dairy… I’ve never had a reaction. I’m fairly robust, as I said. Honestly, I’m starting to think this whole visit was a mistake. My mom is going to be disappointed, but… this isn't helping my anxiety. It's increasing it.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don't take anything regularly. Maybe ibuprofen occasionally for a headache, but that's it. I prefer to deal with things myself, as I’ve said. I believe in preventative measures, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, not relying on pills and doctors. Honestly, I think I'm perfectly capable of assessing my own health. This is… patronizing.
DOCTOR: Very well. No regular medications. Now, given your family history, and despite your insistence on being perfectly healthy… I think we should proceed with some basic bloodwork. It will give us a baseline, and hopefully, reassure you. I’ll order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a fecal occult blood test. Just to be safe. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I still think it's unnecessary, but I'm tired of arguing. Just… don't expect a parade if everything comes back normal. It’s what I expected all along. And please, no more questions about my… bowel movements. It’s incredibly demeaning. Just the bloodwork, and then I’d like the results as quickly as possible. I have a life to get back to.
DOCTOR: The lab is down the hall, second door on the left. They'll take care of it. We’ll get the results back within a few days. And frankly, Mr. Theriot, I strongly advise you to discuss this level of anxiety with a therapist. Now, if there's nothing else… I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Fine. Good day.
