DOCTOR: Good morning, Jahaad. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… it’s about some swelling, yes. It’s…difficult to pinpoint exactly when it started, to be honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s mostly in my face, I think?
DOCTOR: Okay, swelling in your face. That’s a good starting point. And you said it's been difficult to pinpoint when it started… roughly, would you say it’s been a few days, a week, longer?
PATIENT: Hmm… longer, I believe. Perhaps a couple of weeks? It wasn’t sudden, not that I recall. It just… appeared gradually. It's not terribly painful, thankfully, just… noticeable. And a little uncomfortable sometimes, when I eat.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset of facial swelling over the past couple of weeks, not particularly painful but noticeable and causing some discomfort with eating. Can you tell me where specifically on your face you're noticing the swelling?
PATIENT: It seems to be mostly here, on my cheeks…and a bit along my jaw. It's hard to say for certain, it feels… fairly widespread, honestly. It’s not like one particular spot is significantly worse than another. Does that make sense? It’s difficult to describe.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Widespread swelling is certainly more challenging to pinpoint. Is the swelling the same on both sides of your face, or is one side more affected than the other?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think it’s slightly worse on this side. Just a little, though. It’s not a dramatic difference. I wouldn't have even noticed if you hadn't asked, to be frank. It’s… subtle. It feels warm sometimes, too, but I’m not sure if that’s just me noticing things now.
DOCTOR: Okay, slightly worse swelling on the left side of your face, and occasional warmth. Do you have any other symptoms along with the swelling?
PATIENT: Let me see… other symptoms… Not that I’ve noticed, no. No pain, as I said. No fever, no headache. My eating is a little uncomfortable, as I mentioned before, but that's mostly because of the swelling itself. Oh! Actually… sometimes my nose feels a little… blocked? But I often have allergies, so I assumed it was just that. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: That's good information, Jahaad, thank you. The nasal congestion could definitely be relevant. It’s important to consider all possibilities. Do you know what you’re allergic to, and have you been exposed to any allergens recently?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. My allergies, yes. I think… dust, mostly. And pollen, in the spring. I try to avoid those when I can. Recently… not that I’m aware of, no. I haven’t been gardening or anything. I live in a fairly rural area, so there's always something in the air, I suppose, but nothing out of the ordinary, as far as I know. It’s been rather dry lately, actually.
DOCTOR: Okay. Allergies to dust and pollen, living in a rural area with dry conditions. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses… hmm. Nothing major, I don’t believe so. I had chickenpox as a child, of course. And a few colds, like everyone else. Surgeries… no, I haven’t had any surgeries. I did have a rather bad infection in my jaw a few years ago, but it was treated with antibiotics. It healed completely, as far as I know. Is that relevant? I was quite young then, so my memory is… patchy, to say the least.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Jahaad, thank you. An infection in the jaw, treated with antibiotics. Do you recall when that infection occurred, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… quite a while ago. Perhaps five, maybe six years? It was before I moved here, definitely. I was living in… Marrakech, I believe. It was a painful experience, and I remember needing quite a bit of care. It wasn't a simple infection, I think. The dentist mentioned something about it being quite deep. But that was a long time ago, and I’m afraid the details are… hazy. I’m truly sorry I can’t be more specific.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Jahaad. We’ll work with what you can remember. An infection in the jaw, five to six years ago while living in Marrakech. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know of any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s a difficult one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, suffered from diabetes. Other than that… I’m not really sure. My family isn’t very forthcoming about medical matters, to be honest. It’s a bit of a taboo subject. I don’t think there’s much else I can tell you, unfortunately. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. High blood pressure in your mother, diabetes in your grandfather. That gives us something to work with. And finally, let's talk about your current medications and any allergies you may have. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I'm not currently taking any medications. Not even over-the-counter things, generally. I try to avoid them when possible. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s about it. As for allergies... I already mentioned my seasonal allergies, dust and pollen. And I am allergic to penicillin. I had a rather bad reaction to it as a child. That’s all I can think of, Doctor. Is there anything else I should be mentioning?
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications, occasional multivitamin, allergies to penicillin, dust and pollen. Thank you, Jahaad. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a closer look at the swelling on your face. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. I hope it won’t be too uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's start with your heart and lungs… Everything sounds clear here. Now, regarding the swelling… I notice tenderness on the left side of your face, as you mentioned, and the swelling does seem more pronounced there. The skin feels warm to the touch. I don’t feel any enlarged lymph nodes in your neck, which is good. Overall, the swelling is diffuse, but localized tenderness on the left side is significant. I’d like to get some lab work done to rule out any underlying infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Lab work seems like a good idea. I'm happy to cooperate in any way that will help determine the cause of this. Is there anything specific you're looking for with the lab work? I'm just… trying to understand what might be going on. I trust your professional opinion, of course, but knowing a little more would put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The lab work will include a complete blood count, which can tell us if there’s an infection present. We’ll also check your inflammatory markers, to see if there's any underlying inflammation. And just to be safe, we’ll run a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. It's standard procedure, and will help us rule out various possibilities. We’ll also consider a possible CT scan if the swelling doesn’t improve or worsens. Based on what you’ve told me – the gradual onset of swelling, tenderness on the left side, and the history of a jaw infection – we need to consider things like a sinus infection, cellulitis, or even a possible dental issue. But we won't know for sure until we get the lab results back. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense, Doctor. Sinus infection, cellulitis, dental issue… those all sound plausible, given my symptoms. A CT scan if it worsens… that sounds a little concerning, but I understand the need for caution. So, lab work first, then we see what the results say. And if things don't improve, a CT scan. I think I can manage that. When should I expect the results to be back?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Lab work first, then we’ll assess the results. The results should be back within 24 to 48 hours. The lab will contact you directly with the results, and then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, severe pain, difficulty breathing, or vision changes, please go to the emergency room immediately. I'm going to write a prescription for a mild pain reliever, just to help manage any discomfort while you wait for the results. And I also recommend a warm compress on your face a few times a day. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very thoroughly. Warm compress and pain reliever… that sounds manageable. And I will certainly go to the emergency room if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor Reisig. I appreciate your time and your care. You've put my mind at ease, at least for now. I’ll wait for the lab results and schedule a follow-up appointment.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jahaad. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’re here to help. The nurse will be with you shortly to review the instructions and send you with the prescription. Have a good day, and please take care.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You too.
