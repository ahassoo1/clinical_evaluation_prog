DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kovtun, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Just the results, please. I’m really swamped with work right now, so if we can just get straight to it, that’d be great.
DOCTOR: Look, I understand you're busy, but I need some information before I can just…give you results. I haven’t even seen the results yet, and even then, I need to know what we're even looking for. Are you here for a specific test?
PATIENT: Right, sorry. It's just... everything's a bit hectic. I had some blood work done last week, standard stuff. My employer requires it. I think it was checking cholesterol and, um, blood sugar? Honestly, the nurse just told me when and where to go. I’m here for those results. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Standard panel... employer-mandated. Right. Let me pull up your file… Kovtun… there. August 1st. Cholesterol, glucose, basic metabolic panel… Hmm. Well, the glucose is slightly elevated… 115. Cholesterol is… not terrible, 210, but the HDL is a little low, 35. LDL is 140. Look, these aren’t crisis numbers, but they're not ideal. Have you been told anything about pre-diabetes or high cholesterol before?
PATIENT: No, never. This is the first time anyone's mentioned anything like that to me. 115 and 140… those numbers don't really mean anything to me. Is that bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Look, numbers do matter, but context matters more. 115 for glucose puts you in the pre-diabetes range. Not diabetic yet, but heading that direction. 140 for LDL is… elevated. You want that under 100, preferably. The HDL is low, which isn't good, either. It's a pattern, see?
PATIENT: Okay... a pattern. So, what does that mean for me? Like, what happens if it keeps going like this? And what do I need to do about it? I've got a really demanding job, I don't really have time for a lot of… interventions.
DOCTOR: Alright, look. Pre-diabetes, if left unmanaged, can lead to type 2 diabetes. That's…not good. Increased risk of heart disease, nerve damage, vision problems… the whole nine yards. Elevated LDL contributes to plaque buildup in your arteries, again, heart problems. Now, you said you’re busy. We’re not talking a complete overhaul here. We’re talking… adjustments. First, diet. Cut back on sugary drinks, processed foods. More fruits, vegetables, lean protein. Exercise… 30 minutes of moderate activity most days. We can discuss medication if lifestyle changes aren’t enough, but let’s start there. I’m going to write you a referral to a nutritionist. They can give you a more tailored plan.
PATIENT: Okay. A nutritionist… alright. I can probably manage that. Thirty minutes of exercise… I guess I can squeeze that in somehow. Is there anything else? Because honestly, I’m already feeling overwhelmed just thinking about changing my diet. And what about the cholesterol specifically? Is that something I should really be worried about right now?
DOCTOR: Look, your cholesterol isn’t immediately life-threatening, okay?
PATIENT: Okay... good. Because honestly, I’m not sure I can deal with another thing right now. So, just the nutritionist and try to eat better and…move around a bit? Is that all? Can I just get a copy of the results and the referral, and I’ll get going?
DOCTOR: Here. The results and the referral. The nutritionist will contact you to schedule an appointment. If you don’t hear from them within a week, call the number on the paper. Honestly, the biggest thing is… be proactive. Don't ignore it. If you start feeling chest pain or shortness of breath, go to the emergency room, immediately. Is there anything else I can help you with today, or are we done?
PATIENT: No, that’s it. Thank you. I appreciate it. I really need to get back to work, so… thanks again. .
