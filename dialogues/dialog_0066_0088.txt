DOCTOR: Hi Jaylyne, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. Um, it's my ears, they've been ringing. It's been happening for a little while now, and it's pretty annoying, to be honest. Just wanted to get it checked out, if that makes sense. I’ve got things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, and I'm happy to take a look. Ringing in the ears can be bothersome, for sure. "A little while now" – can you give me a bit more detail on that?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… probably about two months now? Maybe a bit longer. It comes and goes, it's not constant. Sometimes it's just a high-pitched whine, other times it’s more like a buzzing. It's hard to explain, really. It’s not painful, thankfully, just… distracting. And lately, it’s been happening more often.
DOCTOR: Okay, two months, coming and going… high-pitched whine or buzzing, and increasing in frequency lately. That helps. Is it in one ear, both ears, or does it feel like it's inside your head?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my right ear, I think. Sometimes I feel it a little bit in the left, but not as much. It doesn’t really feel inside my head, more… like it’s in the ear itself, if that makes sense? Like something's vibrating. It's hard to tell, honestly.
DOCTOR: It does sound tricky to pinpoint. Okay, right ear primarily, sometimes the left, and feels like it's within the ear itself. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger it – loud noises, stress, certain activities, anything like that?
PATIENT: Good question. Um… I used to work at a pretty loud nightclub, a few years back. Maybe that has something to do with it? I don’t work there anymore, thankfully. Besides that… I guess when I'm really tired, or stressed, it seems worse. I got divorced a little while ago, so, yeah… things have been a bit hectic. Sorry, I don’t know if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Jaylyne, thank you for sharing that. A history of noise exposure, and recent stress… those are both definitely things we need to consider. Okay, let’s do a quick exam of your ears, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try to be quick, if you don't mind? I have a few errands to run this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, I’m going to take a look in your ears. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Hmm, the ear canal looks clear. No obvious signs of infection or wax buildup. The eardrum looks… a little bit dull, but no tears or perforations. Left ear looks similar – clear canal, eardrum looks a little bit dull as well. No major concerns visible. I'm going to do a quick tuning fork test now, just to check your hearing a bit more objectively. Can you tell me if you hear this tone when it's near your ear?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Dull? Is that bad? I don’t know anything about ears, really. And, yeah, sure, do the test. I'll try my best to tell you if I hear it.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, “dull” can just mean there's a slight difference in how sound is traveling through the ear. We'll investigate further if needed. Okay, do you hear the tone with this one?
PATIENT: Yeah, I can hear it. It's… a ringing sound, obviously. But it's pretty faint, to be honest. I have to really concentrate to pick it up. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, faint, requires concentration. And how about this side?
PATIENT: Same. Faint, and I have to really focus. It's… not a strong sound at all. To be honest, Doctor, I’m not very good at these tests. Maybe I just don’t have good hearing?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, these tests aren't always easy. It sounds like there might be some mild hearing loss, but we'll need to confirm that with a proper hearing test. Considering your history of noise exposure, recent stress, and what I'm hearing – or not hearing, in this case – my initial thought is Tinnitus. It’s the perception of sound when no external sound is present. Does that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Tinnitus… yeah, I think I've heard of that. Isn't that like… ringing in the ears? That’s what I’ve been saying, right? So, it's not something serious? I mean, like, I'm not going deaf, or something? Sorry, I'm probably asking silly questions. I just get anxious easily.
DOCTOR: You're not asking silly questions at all, and it's good you're asking! You're absolutely right, tinnitus is the perception of ringing, buzzing, or other sounds in the ears. And thankfully, in most cases, it's not a sign of something immediately serious. It can be frustrating, but it's often manageable. Now, it doesn't necessarily mean you're going deaf, but it can be associated with hearing loss, which is why I want to get a proper audiogram – a hearing test – done to assess the extent of any loss. We’ll also want to rule out other potential causes. For now, we can try some strategies to manage the tinnitus. Are you currently experiencing a lot of stress in your life?
PATIENT: Yeah, like I said, the divorce. It's been… rough. And work is stressful, even though it's not as bad as the nightclub. Just… a lot going on, you know? I try to relax, but it’s hard. I like listening to music, does that help? I don’t know, I’m just trying to get through it.
DOCTOR: I understand. Divorce is a significant life change, and it's completely normal to feel stressed. Listening to music can be helpful for some people, but it’s important to avoid prolonged exposure to loud noises, even if it’s music you enjoy. Here's what I’m thinking: I’m going to refer you to an audiologist for a comprehensive hearing test. They’ll be able to pinpoint any hearing loss and recommend appropriate strategies. In the meantime, we can focus on stress management. Have you considered things like mindfulness exercises, yoga, or therapy?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. An audiologist… alright. I guess I can do that. Stress management… I've thought about therapy, but I don't know. It feels… weird, talking to someone about it. But I guess if it helps… Yeah, I'll think about it. Can you give me the information for the audiologist, please? And how long does the test usually take? I’ve got stuff to do, you know?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here's the referral form, and a list of audiologists in the area. The test usually takes about 30-60 minutes, depending on the complexity. They'll assess your hearing at different frequencies, and determine if there's any loss. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend avoiding loud noises as much as possible, and try to prioritize relaxation techniques. Even something as simple as taking a few deep breaths throughout the day can help. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… the audiologist, right? And try to relax. Okay. Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate your help. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jaylyne. And you're right, it's likely nothing serious, but it's good to get it checked out. If you have any concerns at all before your appointment, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Take care, and I hope you find some relief soon. .
