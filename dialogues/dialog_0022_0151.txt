DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. It’s… well, it’s this tingling. In my hands, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s just… bothersome, you know? I just want to know what it is. I don't like feeling this way.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. That sounds concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. “A little while” can mean different things to different people, so could you tell me roughly how long you’ve been experiencing this tingling?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. Probably… about six weeks, maybe? It started small, just a little pins and needles feeling after I carried a heavy bag of mail. But it hasn't really gone away, even when I'm resting. It’s more often now than it used to be. I deliver mail, you see. Lots of walking.
DOCTOR: Okay, six weeks. And it started after carrying a heavy bag of mail, and now it’s happening more frequently, even with rest. That's helpful to know. Is the tingling just in your hands, or does it extend anywhere else – your arms, fingers, maybe up towards your elbows or shoulders?
PATIENT: Mostly just my hands, yes. But… sometimes, when it’s really bad, I feel it a little bit in my forearms. Not all the way up to my elbows, just… that bit right below. And… now that I think about it, my fingers sometimes feel a little numb, too. Not completely, just… not as sensitive as they used to be. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's important to know, Ms. Uzarski. The fact that it's radiating into your forearms and now you're noticing some numbness in your fingers is definitely relevant. To get a better picture of what might be going on, could you describe the tingling itself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How to describe it… It's not painful, exactly. More like… little electric shocks, but very weak. And it feels like my hands are falling asleep, but not completely asleep. Just… buzzy. And sometimes cold, even when they aren’t. Does that make any sense? I'm not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, actually. "Buzzy" and like "little electric shocks" is a good way to describe it. And the cold sensation is helpful to know, too. Now, aside from delivering mail, are there any other activities you do regularly that might be putting stress on your hands or arms?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... I do a lot of gardening in the summer, mostly weeding and planting. It’s not heavy work, but I’m on my hands a lot, you know? And I like to knit, but I haven’t done much of that lately because of my hands. It just… hurts to hold the needles sometimes. It’s been a while since I knitted a full sweater. Maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, gardening and knitting, both involving repetitive hand movements. And you've noticed it's become difficult to knit recently. To get a fuller picture, I'd like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, arthritis, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. No, not that I know of. The doctor back home – I moved here last year, you see – never told me anything like that. I've had the usual things, a cold here and there, the flu a couple of times, but nothing serious. My husband… well, my late husband, he had some heart trouble, but I didn't. Just the normal aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I'm not on any medications, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions and no current medications. And you said you moved here last year. Where did you move from?
PATIENT: I moved from a small village near Kyiv, in Ukraine. It’s… well, it was a different life. A lot of farming, you know? Very quiet. I came to be closer to my daughter and her family. They live just outside of town here. It's a good life, but… it's different. And I miss my garden sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's a big change, and I'm glad you're close to your family. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, to get back to your symptoms, have you experienced any weakness in your hands or arms?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. That’s a good question. Not exactly weakness, but… sometimes it feels harder to grip things. Like, opening a jar can be a bit of a struggle, and I dropped a bag of potatoes the other day. Not because I was weak, exactly, but because my hands just… slipped. It doesn’t happen all the time, but it’s happened a few times recently. And I noticed my handwriting is a little shaky now too. Is that the same thing?
DOCTOR: Okay, some difficulty with gripping, dropping things, and shaky handwriting. That's all helpful information. Have you noticed any pain in your neck, shoulders, or upper back?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… yes. A little bit. My shoulders get stiff sometimes, especially after a long day of delivering mail. And I get a dull ache in my upper back. I just thought it was from carrying the bag, you know? Old age, maybe. I usually just rub some cream on it and it gets better. But it's been a little worse lately. I didn’t think it was related to my hands, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some neck and shoulder stiffness, and upper back pain. It's good you're mentioning these things, as they could be related. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam of your hands, arms, neck, and shoulders, if that’s alright with you. It will involve me checking your reflexes, strength, and sensation. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds fine. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? I’m a little worried, I won’t lie. But if you think it’s a good idea, then go ahead. I just hope it’s nothing serious. I need my hands for everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Uzarski. We'll take it one step at a time. Please extend your arm, palm up. I’m going to check your reflexes now. This might feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Okay. And now your other arm, please. Good. Those reflexes seem a little diminished, but not significantly. Now, can you squeeze my fingers, as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, I can squeeze. Is that enough? It feels a little difficult, to be honest. My hand feels… clumsy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful to know. Your grip strength is a little weaker than I’d expect. Now, I’m going to check your sensation. Close your eyes, please. I’m going to touch your hand with this cotton ball, and tell me when you feel it. Do you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I feel it. There… and there. But… it feels… a little muffled. Not as sharp as it usually does. Is that bad? It feels like… I’m feeling it through a blanket, maybe? It’s hard to explain. It's not that I can't feel it, just… diminished.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm noticing some decreased sensation in your fingertips, particularly on the outside of your hand. Now, let's move on to your neck and shoulders. Could you try to turn your head to the left, and then to the right, slowly and gently?
PATIENT: It's… a little stiff. It doesn't hurt, exactly, but it feels tight. And… it clicks a little when I turn it to the left. I've always had a bit of trouble with my neck, but it’s been worse lately. I probably should have mentioned that earlier. I’m sorry. I forget things sometimes.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Ms. Uzarski. That’s what I’m here for, to gather all the information. I'm feeling some tightness in your neck muscles. Now, I'd like to check your range of motion in your shoulders. Can you raise your arms above your head?
PATIENT: It’s… a little difficult. Not painful, but… I can’t get them all the way up. And it feels… tight, like something is pulling. I used to be able to do this easily. I did a lot of gardening, you know? Reaching for branches, pulling weeds… all sorts of things. But it feels different now.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on the exam, Ms. Uzarski, it seems like you're exhibiting signs of carpal tunnel syndrome, potentially with some contributing factors from neck and shoulder issues. The diminished sensation in your fingertips, the weakness in your grip, and the clicking and stiffness in your neck are all consistent with this. However, to confirm this diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order some tests. Specifically, I'd like to do a nerve conduction study and electromyography, or EMG. This will measure the electrical activity of your nerves and muscles and help us pinpoint the cause of your symptoms. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh… carpal tunnel syndrome? I’ve heard of that. My daughter’s friend had it, I think. Tests… yes, yes, I suppose so. If it will help me find out what’s going on, then yes. But… will they hurt? And… how long will it take? I have a lot of mail to deliver, you know. I don't want to be off work for too long.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. The nerve conduction study and EMG involve small needles and some mild electrical stimulation. Most people describe it as a little uncomfortable, like a brief tingling sensation, but it shouldn't be painful. The procedure usually takes about 30-60 minutes. I’ll also want to get some X-rays of your neck and shoulders to rule out any underlying arthritis or bone spurs that could be contributing to your symptoms. I’ll need to send a referral to a neurologist for the nerve conduction study and EMG, and to radiology for the X-rays. It may take a few days to get the appointments scheduled. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding repetitive hand movements as much as possible, and using over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen to help manage any discomfort. Would you like me to write you a prescription for something stronger, just in case?
PATIENT: Oh… no, no strong painkillers, thank you. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Just the ibuprofen will be fine. And… avoiding repetitive movements… that will be hard. Mail delivery is repetitive movements, you know? But I’ll try my best. So… tests, then? And then we’ll see what happens? I just want to feel normal again. This tingling is very unsettling. Will the tests tell us if I need surgery? I don’t want surgery.
DOCTOR: Yes, tests first. And I understand your concern about surgery. It's good you're thinking ahead. The tests will help us determine the severity of the carpal tunnel syndrome and whether conservative treatment options, like splinting, physical therapy, or injections, might be enough. Surgery is usually only considered if those options don't provide relief. We’ll discuss all of your options once we have the test results. I’ll have my assistant schedule the appointments for you and give you instructions on how to prepare for them. She’ll also provide you with a referral form for the neurologist and radiology. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly—if you experience severe pain, weakness, or numbness that interferes with your daily activities—please don’t hesitate to call the office. We want to make sure you’re comfortable and getting the care you need. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Ms. Uzarski?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I just hope… I hope it’s not too serious. I suppose I should go now? And wait for a call about the tests? Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Uzarski. I’m glad I could help. And you’re right, just wait for a call from my assistant to schedule the tests. We’ll take it one step at a time. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Get some rest, and try not to worry too much. Have a good day, Ms. Uzarski.
