DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh? Good morning to you too, Doctor. Bigger is the name. They sent me here... something about the mine. Not feeling sick, you know. Just told to come. Old man things, I suppose. They want me checked 'cause of the dust and… stuff. Don’t know what they expect, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bigger. It sounds like this is a check-up recommended due to your work in the mine. That's perfectly alright, it's good to be proactive. We just want to make sure everything is okay, especially with potential exposure to dust and other things down there. To start, could you tell me a little more about what kind of work you do in the mine?
PATIENT: Work? I operate the big machines. The loaders, mostly. Been doing it a long time. Since… well, a long time. Moving rocks, coal, whatever they tell me to. Underground. Dark, dusty place, always is. Not easy work, you know. But a man's gotta eat. They pay me, I work. Simple as that. You need to know what kind of rocks? I just move them. Don't ask me fancy names.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bigger. You operate the loaders, moving rocks and coal underground. No need to worry about fancy names, just knowing what you do is helpful. And you've been doing this for a long time – would you say decades?
PATIENT: Decades? Hmph. More than decades. Started when I was a young man, strong as an ox. Now… well, now I'm just an old man with a pension. Nearly fifty years, I reckon. Fifty years breathing in that… that mine air. Don't know what good it's done me, that’s for sure. Everything aches these days. But that ain’t why I’m here, is it? They said check-up. Not a complaint session.
DOCTOR: Right, a check-up. Fifty years is a long time to be working in that environment. And you're right, we'll focus on that. You mentioned everything aches. Could you tell me a bit more specifically about where you're experiencing pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Everywhere, Doctor! Like a bad dream. But mostly in my chest sometimes, a tight feeling. And my knees, always my knees. Bad when it rains, you know? And my back... don't even start me on my back. But like I said, old man things. I ain’t expecting you to fix me. Just doing what they tell me. Is this going to take long? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bigger. Chest tightness, knee pain, and back pain are what bother you the most. We'll definitely look into those. The chest tightness is the most concerning, and we need to rule out anything serious. To clarify about the chest tightness, does anything specifically cause it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Cause it? Hmph. Nothing specific. Sometimes when I walk uphill, maybe. Or when it's cold. And sometimes… just happens. A squeezing feeling, like a big weight on my chest. It goes away after a bit, usually. Been happening for years, mind you. Not new. I just ignore it. A man’s gotta be strong, right? You think a little ache is going to stop me? But they sent me here… so I'm answering your questions. Don't expect me to know all the fancy details, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the chest tightness comes on with exertion, like walking uphill, or in cold weather, and it's been happening for years. It comes and goes on its own. Now, besides the aches and tightness, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? I eat, I sleep, I… well, I get old. What do you want me to say? I cough a bit in the mornings, always have. And I get tired easier these days, but that’s to be expected, isn’t it? My wife… she passed a few years ago, so things ain’t the same. But that ain’t a health change, is it? You’re asking too many questions, Doctor. Is this going to involve poking and prodding? I don't like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bigger. It sounds like you've just been experiencing a bit more fatigue and a cough that you've had for a while. And I apologize if I'm asking too many questions, I just want to get a complete picture of your health. And yes, there will be some examination involved – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your joints, things like that. It won’t be too uncomfortable, I promise. Before we start, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any health conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… they told me years ago, maybe. Doctor told me to watch my salt. I mostly ignored him. Salt tastes good. Diabetes? No. Heart problems? Not that I know of. They did some tests, I think, a long time ago, but I don’t remember the results. My wife used to handle all that paperwork. She was very organized. Now… now everything’s a blur. I take a little pill for my water, something the doctor gave me. And that’s about it. Don’t ask me what it’s called, I just take it. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a simple man. Not much to tell you.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you were told you had high blood pressure years ago but didn't make many changes. You take a pill for your water, but don't recall the name. And you don't have any other known medical conditions. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… Hmph. My appendix, when I was young. A long time ago. And… I think I had something on my eye once, a little growth. They cut it off. That’s about it. Nothing major. Mostly just bumps and bruises from working in that mine. And the occasional cut from the machinery. But that ain't a surgery, is it? Just… life. Honestly, Doctor, you're asking a lot of an old man. My memory ain't what it used to be. Is this going to be over soon? I got a pot roast in the oven.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you had your appendix removed when you were young and something removed from your eye. No other surgeries. And I apologize for pressing you, Mr. Bigger, I understand it’s not easy to remember everything. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, let's talk about your family history. Are there any health problems that run in your family, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmph. My father… he worked in the fields. Strong man. Died of old age, I think. My mother… she had a weak heart, they said. Died when I was young. My sister… she had something bad with her stomach, cancer, maybe? A long time ago. But everyone dies of something, doesn’t it? I don’t pay much attention to family history. It’s all in the past. You want to know about my health, not theirs. Honestly, Doctor, I'm getting tired of these questions. Can we just get on with it? I got a pot roast waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had a weak heart, and your sister died of something involving her stomach, possibly cancer. Alright, Mr. Bigger, I understand your frustration. Let's move on to a quick physical exam then. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Then we’ll take a look at your knees and back. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. Just… be gentle. My skin is old, you know. And don’t take too long. That pot roast won’t cook itself. And don’t ask me any more questions! Just listen and poke and be done with it. Honestly… the things I do for a pension.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bigger. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. Your heart sounds… a bit muffled, and I can hear some crackling in your lungs when you take a deep breath. I’m going to listen again. Now, could you take a deep breath for me, please?
PATIENT: Hmph. Like I said, old man things. Always had a bit of a cough. Crackling lungs… that don’t surprise me. Dust and dirt for fifty years, you think it’s going to be nice and clean in there? Is that bad? Don’t tell me it’s bad. I don’t want to hear it. Just get on with the poking, Doctor. I'm starting to feel uncomfortable. And hurry up! The pot roast…
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. Your knees have some crepitus, which is common with age and wear and tear. They’re also a bit tender to the touch. Now, let’s check your back. Could you lean forward for me, please?
PATIENT: Oof! Careful, Doctor, careful! My back ain't what it used to be. Years of lifting… heavy things. Feels like something’s always pinched in there. And that ain’t helping. Is it bad? Is there something broken? I told them I shouldn’t be doing this anymore! Just tell me what you find, Doctor. Don't sugarcoat it. I'm an old man, I can handle the truth. But please… be gentle. Honestly, this is worse than I thought it would be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. There’s some muscle spasm and tenderness in your lower back. I don’t feel any obvious signs of a fracture, but there is definitely some inflammation. Based on what I’m hearing and feeling, and given your history, it seems like you have some chronic issues going on - some mild heart failure contributing to the crackling in your lungs, osteoarthritis in your knees, and muscle strain in your back. It's not uncommon for someone with your work history and age. I'd like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture. A chest X-ray to look at your lungs, blood work to check your kidney function and rule out any infection, and possibly an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dye?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. Never had any allergies. Always been a strong man. Never needed medicine. But… my wife, she was allergic to something with penicillin, I think. But I don’t have any allergies. And what's an EKG? Sounds complicated. And why do I need blood work? You poked enough already! Honestly, Doctor, this is getting ridiculous. Can’t you just tell me what’s wrong and give me something for my back? I got a pot roast…
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. An EKG is a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. It’s painless and non-invasive. We just want to rule out any potential heart problems contributing to your symptoms. And the blood work will help us assess your overall health, including your kidney function, which is important as we get older, and rule out any underlying infection. Given your wife's penicillin allergy, we'll be sure to document that in your chart. I understand you’re eager to get home to your pot roast, and I want to be as efficient as possible. I'll write the orders for the tests now, and the nurse will come in to draw your blood. In the meantime, I can prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a mild pain reliever to help with your back pain. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Muscle relaxant… pain reliever… whatever. Just get it over with. But no penicillin! You hear me? No penicillin. My wife… it wasn't good. And make it quick. I got things to do. And tell the nurse to be gentle. I’m an old man, I bruise easily. Honestly, Doctor, this whole thing has been a waste of time. But… thank you. I suppose. Just… get it over with. Now. And don't forget the pot roast. It's getting cold.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. I've ordered the tests and prescribed you a muscle relaxant called cyclobenzaprine and acetaminophen for pain. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I’ve also documented your wife’s penicillin allergy. I’ll have the nurse print out detailed instructions for you regarding the medications, including potential side effects and how often to take them. I understand your frustration, and I appreciate your patience. I know this isn’t how you wanted to spend your afternoon. Once the tests are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a long-term plan to manage your health. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get it over with. And tell the nurse to hurry up. And… thank you again. But honestly, Doctor, I just want to go home. To my pot roast. .
