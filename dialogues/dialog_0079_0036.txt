DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. I am here for… a check-up before the insurance starts. Medicare said I need to do this. It is… required.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here that a preventative exam is required for Medicare enrollment. Quite sensible, really. Very proactive of them. Alright, Mr. Barban, a comprehensive check-up it is. To begin, let’s discuss your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No. Never. I am… a healthy man. I work hard. I eat… food. What kind of illnesses are you asking about? The common cold does not count, yes?
DOCTOR: Of course not, Mr. Barban. I simply need to establish a baseline. Serious illnesses, chronic conditions… anything that required significant medical attention. Have you been diagnosed with diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: High… blood pressure? I do not think so. My father… he had some problems with his heart, a long time ago. But I am not my father. I feel fine. I have no… diagnoses. I just want to make sure this insurance… works when I need it.
DOCTOR: Very well. A family history of heart disease is pertinent, thank you for mentioning that. And you say you haven’t been formally diagnosed with anything yourself?
PATIENT: Formally? No. I go to work. I eat. I sleep. Sometimes I have a… a little headache. But everyone gets headaches, yes? It is not… formal. I do not go to doctors unless it is… very bad.
DOCTOR: Understandable. So, this headache… how often do you experience it?
PATIENT: Maybe… once a month? Sometimes not for two months. It is… in my head. It goes away. I take… a pill. A pain killer. From the store. Not a… doctor’s pill. Is that important? It’s just a headache.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what sort of painkiller do you take, Mr. Barban?
PATIENT: Um… the red one. It is… Ibuprofen, I think? It says on the box. It helps, usually. I do not take many, only when it is… a bad headache. I am not one to complain.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen. Good. And besides headaches, are you experiencing any other symptoms currently?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… being sick? No. I am… tired sometimes. But I work long hours. That is… normal, yes? I lift heavy things. It makes a man tired. It is not a symptom. Is there something else you are asking about? This is… taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Yes, fatigue can be a symptom of various things, but it sounds as though yours is likely related to your work. Let's move on to social history then. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational… drugs? No! Absolutely not. I do not… I drink tea sometimes. And maybe… a little coffee in the morning. To wake up. Smoking… no. My grandfather smoked. It was… bad for him. I do not need those things. I have work. That is enough.
DOCTOR: Tea and coffee, alright. That's… reasonable. Now, have you had any recent changes in your weight, appetite, or bowel habits?
PATIENT: Weight? No change. I eat the same amount of food. Maybe a little more when it is cold. Bowel… habits? I… go to the bathroom. Like everyone else. Is this… necessary to know? This feels… personal. I just need the insurance to be approved.
DOCTOR: These are standard questions, Mr. Barban, necessary to establish a baseline for your health. It simply helps me to understand any potential underlying issues. Now, let’s proceed with a brief physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood pressure… yes. Fine. Just… hurry, please. I have work later. And… make sure it is accurate. I do not want any mistakes. I do not trust machines very much.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a seat. Blood pressure is 142 over 90. Elevated, but not dramatically so. We'll need to monitor that. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is audible. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpable. Alright, Mr. Barban. Everything appears… within acceptable parameters, but your blood pressure is a little high, and I did detect a murmur. We should investigate that further.
PATIENT: Investigate? What does that mean? More tests? I do not like tests. This is… complicated. I just wanted a simple check-up for the insurance. What is wrong with me? Is it serious? You said “murmur”. That sounds… bad.
DOCTOR: A murmur isn't necessarily serious, Mr. Barban. It simply means there's an unusual sound during your heartbeat. It could indicate a valve issue, but it requires further evaluation. We will need to do an EKG and a basic blood panel to rule out anything significant. It's a standard procedure. I will order those tests for you now. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. In the meantime, I recommend reducing your caffeine intake and monitoring your blood pressure at home if possible. It's best to be proactive, Mr. Barban. Early detection is key.
PATIENT: Proactive… tests… I do not like this. Monitoring… at home? I do not have… those machines. This is too much. Look, can you just… write on the paper that I am healthy? Enough for the insurance? I am a hard worker, I do not have time for all of this. I need to go back to work. Is there a way to… skip the tests? Just tell them I am fine.
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I understand your concerns, but I cannot ethically falsify medical information. It is against my professional code and could have serious consequences for both of us. Furthermore, it would be detrimental to your health. We have identified a potential issue with your blood pressure and a heart murmur, and it is my responsibility to investigate those findings. I am obligated to provide accurate and honest assessments. Ignoring these findings would be irresponsible. I will schedule the EKG and blood panel. It will take approximately thirty minutes. You can return to work afterwards. It is a small price to pay for your peace of mind. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Thirty minutes… very well. But if you find nothing wrong, I expect you to tell the insurance company I am perfectly healthy. And do not keep me waiting. I have things to do. Schedule the tests, quickly. Doctors… always making things complicated.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ve scheduled you for an EKG and blood panel. The technician is expecting you in ten minutes, just down the hall. I will review the results as soon as they are available and schedule a follow-up appointment. Here is the requisition form for the tests. Please, do not hesitate to inform the technician if you have any concerns. And Mr. Barban, while I cannot guarantee what the insurance company will require, I assure you I will provide them with an accurate and comprehensive assessment of your health. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to attend to. .
PATIENT: Fine. Thirty minutes of my life wasted… .
