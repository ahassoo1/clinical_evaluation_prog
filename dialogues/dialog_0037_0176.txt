DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. AX. It's August 2nd. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's these hiccups, really. They just won't stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they're still going. More than 48 hours now, I think. It's… quite annoying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, hiccups that have been going on for over 48 hours. That is persistent. Can you describe them for me?
PATIENT: Well… they’re just normal hiccups, I guess. You know, that little jerk of the chest, and then you hic! It’s not painful, not exactly. Just… startling. And tiring, after a while. I’ve tried holding my breath, drinking water upside down… all the usual things, but nothing seems to work. They come and go, but they keep coming back.
DOCTOR: Alright, so they're not associated with any pain, and you've already tried some common remedies without success. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, or make them worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t think so, not really. I was having lunch with a friend on Saturday, that’s when they started, but we had a pretty normal meal. Just a sandwich and a salad. I was laughing quite a bit, actually - she was telling me a funny story about her cat. Maybe that started it? I don't know. But since then, they just… happen. Doesn't seem to matter what I'm doing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so they started with a period of laughter, and now they’re happening spontaneously. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the hiccups. No heartburn, no trouble breathing, no stomach pain… nothing else. I feel alright, otherwise. A little… frustrated, maybe! But physically, I'm okay. I've been sleeping alright, too, though they do wake me up sometimes. It’s just… disruptive, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Disruptive is a good way to put it. Let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not that I can think of, no. Nothing major. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, that’s about it. And I had a bad flu a couple of years ago, but everyone gets those, right? Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy. I don’t take any regular medications, and I don’t have any allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a teenager, and a flu a couple of years ago. No regular medications or known allergies. And just to confirm, have you had any surgeries other than your appendix?
PATIENT: No, just the appendix. Never had anything else operated on. And no, I haven’t been hospitalized for anything else, either. I’m usually pretty good about avoiding doctors, to be honest! Which is probably why I left these hiccups for so long before coming in. I figured they’d just go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgeries or hospitalizations. Fair enough about trying to ride it out first. Now, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm... family history. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father had some problems with his heart when he got older. Nothing too serious, as far as I know. My sister is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. And my children are both doing well, too. No history of… anything like persistent hiccups, if that’s what you’re asking. It feels a little strange to talk about, to be honest. You don’t usually think about hiccups being hereditary!
DOCTOR: You’re right, it is a little unusual to think about hiccups being hereditary. But it’s good to know. And thank you for sharing. Now, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work managing events – mostly small parties and corporate gatherings. It keeps me busy, on my feet a lot. I don’t smoke, and I only drink a little wine with dinner sometimes. I try to eat healthy, but it’s hard when you’re always running around. I don’t do a lot of exercise, I should probably be doing more. I live alone now, my husband and I divorced a few years ago. Overall… pretty normal, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, event management, occasional wine, and a generally normal lifestyle. That gives me a good picture. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll also take a look at your throat and stomach just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. Go ahead. I appreciate you checking everything. It's just… unsettling when something keeps happening and you don't know why. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness. Your throat looks a little red, but nothing significant. No masses or obvious inflammation. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72. I'm also checking your neurological reflexes. Everything seems normal. I don't feel anything concerning on initial examination.
PATIENT: That's… good to hear, I suppose. So, no obvious cause? It's just… hiccups? It's frustrating. Is there anything you can do about them? Will they just eventually stop on their own? I have a party to manage next week, and I really don’t want to be hiccuping through the whole thing!
DOCTOR: It’s good that we didn’t find anything concerning physically. Persistent hiccups can be tricky. Often, they resolve on their own, but since yours have been going on for over 48 hours, we should consider some options. Given your history and the exam, it’s unlikely to be anything serious. However, prolonged hiccups can sometimes be a symptom of an underlying issue – though, again, that’s less likely in your case. To be on the safe side, I'd like to order a basic blood panel to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and rule out any metabolic imbalances. It's a simple test. In the meantime, we can try a medication called baclofen. It's a muscle relaxant sometimes used to help control hiccups. We'll start with a low dose, and see if it helps. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A blood panel and the medication both seem like good ideas. I’d rather rule things out, and honestly, anything to get rid of these hiccups is worth a try. What are the side effects of the baclofen? And how long will it take to work, if it does work at all? I really appreciate you taking this seriously, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s just been exhausting.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Redeye. I understand your frustration. Exhausting is a good way to describe it. Baclofen can cause some side effects, but they're usually mild. The most common ones are drowsiness, dizziness, and weakness. It can also cause nausea or constipation in some people. It's important not to drive or operate machinery if you feel drowsy. Rarely, it can cause confusion or changes in mood, but that's uncommon. It typically takes a few days to a week to see if baclofen is effective. We'll start with a low dose – 5 milligrams three times a day – and if that's not enough, we can gradually increase it. I’ll write you a prescription for the baclofen and an order for the blood work. The blood work can be done at the lab across the street. Once you have the results, please call the clinic, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly good. 5 milligrams three times a day, and I’ll get the blood work done across the street. I'll call when the results are in. Thank you, Doctor. I feel a lot better just having a plan. Hopefully, this will finally get rid of these hiccups! Is there anything else I should be aware of, or any particular warning signs I should watch out for?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I’m glad you feel more at ease with a plan. As for warning signs, if you experience any of the following, please seek immediate medical attention: difficulty breathing, chest pain, severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or if the hiccups are accompanied by neurological symptoms like weakness, numbness, or vision changes. Those are unlikely, but it's always best to be cautious. Otherwise, just monitor for side effects from the medication, and keep me updated on your progress. If the hiccups don't improve after a week, or if they get worse, please call the clinic, and we’ll re-evaluate. Here’s your prescription and the lab order. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for your time and patience, Doctor AX. I really appreciate it. I’ll go get the blood work done and start the medication. I’ll be in touch next week if things don’t improve. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Redeye. I wish you the best of luck, and I hope you find relief soon. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day as well.
