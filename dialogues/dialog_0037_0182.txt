DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. AX. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, don't bother with the "nice to meet you" part. I’m here for this…clearance. For the surgery. My daughter insisted I come. Says I need a check-up before I get it done. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Orwin. I understand. A pre-operative clearance exam, as requested by your daughter. That's very responsible of her – and of you to come in. Even feeling “perfectly fine,” it's important to make sure everything is as it should be before undergoing any procedure. To start, can you tell me a little bit about the surgery you're scheduled for?
PATIENT: It's…cosmetic. That's all you need to know. Some…adjustments. My face has, shall we say, settled. It’s not a big deal. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about, but she’s been on about it for months. A little tightening here, a little lift there. Don’t need to know the specifics. It’s my face.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. You're not obligated to share details you're not comfortable with. Knowing it's a cosmetic procedure is sufficient for me to perform the clearance. To get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me about any medical conditions you currently have?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Goodness. At my age? Where do I begin? Let me think… I had a touch of the flu, oh, maybe ten years ago. And my arthritis flares up sometimes, mostly in the winter. But I don’t take anything for it. Don't believe in loading up on pills. Other than that…nothing. Perfectly healthy, as I said. I used to be very strong, you know. Terrazzo work is hard physical labor.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of the flu about ten years ago and some arthritis that flares up, particularly in the winter, without regular medication. I appreciate you sharing that. And just to clarify, when you say your arthritis “flares up,” where specifically do you feel the discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, it's in my hands, mostly. Makes it difficult to…well, to do things. Used to be able to work a whole day without a second thought. Now, a little bit of polishing and I'm aching for hours. And my knees, sometimes. But I don't want any of this coddling, thank you very much. I’ve lived a long life, and I’m not about to start complaining now. It’s just old age, that’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. It sounds like you've had a very active life, and it's understandable that some wear and tear would develop over time. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… no. Not a one. I’ve broken a few bones, working, of course. A wrist once, and a rib another time. But they just set them and wrapped them. No fancy surgery needed. I’m a practical man, you see. Surgery is for…well, for people who haven’t looked after themselves.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no previous surgeries, but a couple of broken bones that healed with conservative management. That’s good to know. Thinking about your family, do you have a history of any significant medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family… my wife, God rest her soul, she had…well, she was always a bit frail. Some heart trouble, I think. And her mother…something with her stomach, years ago. But that’s all I really remember. We weren’t a family for discussing ailments, you see. Just got on with things. My brother was strong as an ox, never a sick day in his life. So, mostly healthy folk, all around.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of some heart trouble in your wife and stomach issues in her mother, otherwise a generally healthy family. That’s helpful. Now, regarding your current lifestyle, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness no! What do you take me for? I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. A glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. But that's it. And as for…recreational drugs… don't be ridiculous. I’m a Norwegian, not some… Bohemian. I like a good, strong coffee, that’s my vice. And I try to eat sensible, though my daughter keeps bringing home these…healthy things. Can't stand them.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. A glass of wine with dinner and a preference for coffee – that sounds quite reasonable. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, nothing. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me, and I’ve never had a reaction. Dust bothers me a little, but that’s hardly an allergy. I’m a sturdy stock, you see. Never been one for sensitivities. Honestly, all this questioning is a bit much. Are we nearly done? I have a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. We are getting close, Mr. Orwin. Just a quick physical exam and then we can discuss next steps. It will be fairly standard - listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, take a look at your throat and ears, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Get it over with. Just…be quick about it. I haven’t got all day, you know. And don’t go poking around too much. I’m an old man, not a…a science project. Just get it done and tell me I’m fit enough for this…foolishness.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Orwin. I will be as efficient and gentle as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Relax? Easy for you to say. All this fuss over nothing. Just get on with it. Hurry up. My tomatoes are waiting.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so for your age. Your heart sounds regular, with a normal rate and rhythm. I do hear a slight murmur, which is common in individuals your age and doesn't seem to be concerning at this time. Your lungs are clear, with good air movement on both sides. Your throat looks clear, and your ears are unremarkable. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness or masses. Alright, Mr. Orwin, that completes the physical exam. Everything seems generally stable, but that elevated blood pressure is something we should monitor. Do you know what your typical blood pressure readings are?
PATIENT: Monitor? I haven’t got a clue. I don’t go around measuring my blood pressure. Never seen the point. As long as I can still get out in the garden and tend to my vegetables, I’m not worried about numbers. My wife used to fuss about things like that, but she worried about everything. Honestly, it's probably just the stress of dealing with all this…cosmetic nonsense. All this poking and prodding! I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Orwin. However, even feeling "perfectly fine," it's important to address potential issues. That elevated blood pressure could increase your risk during surgery, even a cosmetic procedure. Would you be open to checking your blood pressure at home a couple of times a day for a week, just to get a baseline?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Now you want me to become a…a medical technician? I haven’t got time for all this. My daughter will want to see the numbers, and then she'll be telling me what to eat and what to do... No. Absolutely not. I'm not doing it. I'm perfectly capable of making my own decisions. Just tell me if I'm fit enough to have this surgery or not, and let me get on with my life. Honestly, the thought of spending even more time worrying about my health makes my head spin.
DOCTOR: I respect your autonomy, Mr. Orwin. However, given your elevated blood pressure, and without a recent baseline to compare it to, I’m not entirely comfortable clearing you for surgery at this time. It’s not about me telling you what to do; it’s about minimizing potential risks. I can offer a couple of options. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a week or so, and you can bring in any blood pressure readings you do manage to take. Or, I can refer you to your primary care physician for a more comprehensive evaluation and clearance. Ultimately, the decision is yours, but I strongly recommend addressing this blood pressure issue before proceeding with the surgery. Would you prefer the follow-up appointment or a referral to your primary care physician?
PATIENT: A referral… fine. Just get it over with. I haven't seen that doctor in years, but… anything to get this over with. Just give me the name and number, and I'll deal with it. And tell your daughter to stop fussing over me! Honestly, a man should be allowed to get a little…tidying up done without all this medical interference. Just get me the referral information. Now.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Mr. Orwin. This is a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, her office is located at 123 Main Street, and her phone number is 555-123-4567. She's a very competent physician and will be able to assess your overall health and determine if you're a suitable candidate for surgery. I’ve included some information about your elevated blood pressure in the referral notes. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just…thank you. Though I'm not sure how thankful I truly am. Honestly, the whole thing has been a waste of my time. Right. Well, I suppose I should be going. My tomatoes won’t weed themselves. And tell your daughter… never mind. Just… tell her I said hello.
