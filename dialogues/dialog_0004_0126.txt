DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I’ve been awfully thirsty lately. And hungry, too. It's… unusual for me, to put it mildly. I feel like I’m constantly reaching for a glass of water or a snack, and it’s not satisfying the feeling, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: Thirsty and hungry… and it's not satisfying the feeling. Okay. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s been… probably a good month now, maybe a bit longer. It started gradually, just feeling a little more peckish than usual, and needing a drink with my meals. But it’s definitely gotten worse over the past couple of weeks. I don’t really recall a specific event that started it, just… a slow increase.
DOCTOR: A slow increase over a month… Alright. Have you noticed any other changes alongside the increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Other changes… that's a good question. Not that I’ve consciously noticed, no. I suppose I've been a bit more tired than usual, but I put that down to work, to be honest. Shipping and receiving is… demanding. No weight loss or anything like that. I wouldn't say I've felt unwell, just… persistently uncomfortable. I hope that clarifies things.
DOCTOR: Uncomfortable… Alright. Let's get a bit more detail. When you say tired, is it a general fatigue, or more difficulty concentrating?
PATIENT: It's… both, actually. I find myself needing a bit of a lie-down after work, which I haven’t done in years. And at work, I'm having trouble focusing on the inventory lists. Little things, you know? Mistakes are becoming more frequent, which isn't ideal. It's not debilitating, but it's… noticeable. I apologise for rambling, Doctor. I'm not usually this verbose.
DOCTOR: No, it's fine, Mr. Erxleben. Details are helpful. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of, no. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I broke my wrist once, playing rugby, but that healed properly. I haven’t been hospitalised for anything major. I see a dentist regularly, and had my eyes checked last year. I haven't been on any medication for a long time, if that's what you're asking. I'm fairly healthy, all things considered. I’d like to keep it that way.
DOCTOR: No significant medical history… Alright. Any family history of diabetes, kidney problems, or anything like that?
PATIENT: That's… a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe, and my grandfather on my father's side… he had some sort of problem with his waterworks, if I recall correctly. But nothing specific about diabetes, no. And I honestly don’t know about kidney problems. My family isn’t really one for discussing medical details, if you understand me. It’s… a bit awkward.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright. And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, as I said, I work in shipping and receiving. It's physical, a lot of lifting and moving. I don't really have time for much else, to be honest. I don’t smoke, and I only drink occasionally, a pint with the lads after work on a Friday. I try to eat reasonably well, but it’s difficult with the hours. I don’t really exercise, beyond what the job requires. It’s fairly… mundane, all in all. I’m sorry if that’s not very helpful.
DOCTOR: It's adequate. Now, let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat most things, and I've never had trouble with insect bites or anything like that. I’m fairly… resilient, I suppose. Honestly, I’m hoping this isn’t something serious. I’ve got bills to pay and a job to do. Time is… precious.
DOCTOR: No known allergies… Alright. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Can you step onto the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Though I will warn you, I’ve been eating a bit more lately. There you go. Hopefully it isn’t too… alarming.
DOCTOR: 93 kilograms… and your height is 170 centimeters, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's correct, Doctor. 170 centimetres. I haven't really paid attention to my weight, to be honest. I just know I've put on a bit since the divorce. Is that a… problem?
DOCTOR: It's something we need to consider. Your BMI is 32.3, which puts you in the obese category. Now, let’s take your blood pressure. Please remain still. 148 over 92. A little elevated. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. As you wish. Though, I assure you, I’m generally quite healthy. I just wish to understand what’s causing this thirst and hunger. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but a bit brisk. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, but slightly distended. No masses palpated. Alright. I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Now, I'd like to order some blood work. A complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a Hemoglobin A1C. We need to rule out diabetes and assess your kidney function. And I'm going to order a urinalysis as well.
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. I appreciate that. Diabetes… that’s… concerning. Though I suppose it’s better to know. Very well. What do I need to do? And how long will the results take? I really hope this isn't anything serious. I have a lot on my plate, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: The lab work will take approximately 24 to 48 hours. The nurse will give you a requisition form and instructions for the blood draw and urine sample collection. You’ll need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood draw, so schedule it for first thing in the morning. In the meantime, I want you to make some lifestyle modifications. Cut back on sugary drinks and processed foods. Increase your water intake, but not excessively. And try to incorporate some moderate exercise into your routine. Even a 30-minute walk each day would be beneficial. It's crucial we address your weight and blood pressure. I'm also going to prescribe you a low-sodium diet. Avoid adding salt to your meals, and read food labels carefully. We'll discuss the results in detail when they come back, but it's important to start making these changes now. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. Cut back on sugar, processed foods, more water, exercise, low sodium… It sounds… a lot. Honestly, it’s going to be difficult with my work schedule and everything. But I will try. I suppose I have to. When shall I book the blood work? And what if the results… aren't good? What then?
DOCTOR: The lab is located across the street. The nurse will give you the address and phone number. As for the results… if they indicate diabetes or kidney problems, we’ll discuss treatment options. It may involve medication, lifestyle changes, and specialist referrals. It’s crucial you understand that ignoring these symptoms could lead to serious complications. I understand your work schedule is demanding, but your health is paramount. We'll address this one step at a time. Don't delay the blood work. Do you have any further questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. Just… the nurse, then? I'll get the requisition form and book the blood work. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. .
DOCTOR: The nurse is just outside. She’ll guide you. .
