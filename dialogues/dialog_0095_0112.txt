DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been going to the bathroom… a lot. Much more often than usual, and it’s been going on for a little while now. I’m not quite sure how long, exactly. It feels like weeks, maybe months? It’s just… frequent.
DOCTOR: Okay. Frequent urination. I understand it can be uncomfortable to discuss. Let’s try to narrow things down a bit. When you say "a lot," roughly how many times a day would you estimate you’re going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a good question. I… truly don’t know. I haven't been keeping track, I'm afraid. It feels like every hour or so during the day, and then… a couple of times overnight, which is new. I used to sleep right through. It’s definitely more than it used to be. I wish I had a better answer for you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, no need to apologize. It’s helpful just to have a general sense. So, several times an hour during the day and waking up a couple of times at night to urinate. Are you experiencing any pain or burning while you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain… no, not exactly pain. There’s a little discomfort, sometimes, a sort of pressure, but not pain. And no burning, thankfully. It’s just… the urge is very strong, and it comes on quickly. It’s quite disruptive, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, strong, quick urges, no pain or burning. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. I don't think so. It looks normal, as far as I can tell. The colour seems the same, and I haven’t noticed any… well, anything unusual. It's difficult to say, really. I don't spend a great deal of time examining it, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. No changes in colour or appearance. Do you feel like you’re completely emptying your bladder each time you go?
PATIENT: That’s… a tricky question. I think so, yes. But sometimes, shortly after I go, I feel the urge again. Not as strong, but… present. It’s a bit frustrating, to be honest. I don’t know if that makes sense. Perhaps I’m not emptying it completely? It’s hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, a feeling of incomplete emptying sometimes. And this has been going on for weeks to months?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Weeks, definitely. Perhaps months. It’s… a bit of a blur, truthfully. It sort of crept up on me, and I kept hoping it would resolve itself, but it hasn't. It’s just… become a constant thing. I suppose that's why I finally decided to come in. It’s starting to affect my daily life.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. And just to get a broader picture, have you had any fever, chills, or back pain associated with this?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And thankfully, no back pain either. It’s really just the frequent urination and that little bit of… lingering feeling afterwards. It's not debilitating, Doctor, but it’s certainly unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. And are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… no, not currently. I am divorced, as you can see on the form. It’s been… some time since I was. No, not sexually active at all. I hope that’s alright to share.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Thank you for sharing. And finally, are you experiencing any constipation or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Constipation… hmm. I wouldn't say I'm constipated, exactly. My bowel habits are… regular, I suppose. Nothing particularly different from usual. A little slow sometimes, perhaps, but nothing that would concern me. No, not really any changes there. I apologize for not being more precise, Doctor. I'm not very good at remembering details.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, thank you for that information. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out any obvious issues. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgement. I just want to get to the bottom of this, if you’ll pardon the expression.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just lie down on the table for me, and I’ll start with an abdominal exam. I’ll also need to do a quick neurological exam. Afterwards, I'd like to get a urine sample. It's pretty standard.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do, or anything I should expect. I’m a little nervous, if you don’t mind my saying so. But I appreciate you taking the time to listen.
DOCTOR: No problem at all. It's perfectly normal to be nervous. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Please lie flat on your back, and I’ll lift up your gown a little to get a better listen. I’m just listening for any unusual sounds.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please, proceed at your own pace. And don't hesitate to tell me if there's anything I need to do, or if anything feels uncomfortable. I'm quite… sensitive, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay… sounds are normal. No bowel sounds that are concerning. I’m going to palpate your abdomen now – just gently pressing to feel for any tenderness or masses. Let me know immediately if anything feels painful. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, that’s… not painful. A little pressure, perhaps, but no actual pain. It’s just… a bit uncomfortable, I suppose. A bit sensitive, as I mentioned. But no sharp pain, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. No masses, no significant tenderness. I’m going to check your neurological reflexes now. This involves tapping a small hammer on your knees and ankles. Just relax your legs. This won't hurt, just a quick tap. Let me know if it feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just let me know when you’re about to tap, if you would. I always get a little startled by sudden movements. I apologize. Proceed at your own pace, please.
DOCTOR: Okay… good reflex on the right side. And good reflex on the left side as well. Ankle reflexes are also normal. Everything seems neurologically intact. Now, if you could just provide a urine sample for me?
PATIENT: Oh, good. That’s… reassuring to hear. Certainly, Doctor. A urine sample. Should I… just go to the restroom? And… is there anything special I need to do? I apologize for being so… clueless.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Just a standard clean-catch sample. That means try to clean the area before you collect it, and collect the midstream portion of the urine. There are instructions in the restroom. Don’t worry, it’s pretty straightforward. Take your time. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: Alright. A clean-catch sample. I’ll… do my best. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be back in a moment.
