DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Al Corta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's... adequate to meet you as well. I'm here about my vision, you see. It's been... deteriorating. Not rapidly, mind you, but noticeably. It's rather inconvenient, to be frank. I’m Delano Al Corta, by the way, though you likely already have that information. One doesn't simply forget one's name.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do have your information here, Mr. Al Corta. And it’s good you brought it up. Deteriorating vision can be concerning, and it’s good you’re addressing it. “Inconvenient” is a good way to put it, I suppose. To help me understand what’s going on, can you describe the deterioration a bit more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically? Hmm. Well, things aren't blurry, not exactly. It's more... faded. Colors lack their vibrancy, I suppose. And at the periphery of my vision, it's as if there's a... a dimming. Like looking through old velvet curtains. It’s difficult to explain, and honestly, I doubt you’ve encountered anything quite like it. I do have rather discerning taste, you see. It’s not as simple as needing glasses, I assure you.
DOCTOR: "Faded" and a "dimming at the periphery"... that’s helpful, Mr. Al Corta. And you’re right to say it’s not a simple case of needing glasses; that description sounds different. You mentioned discerning taste – has this change in vision affected any specific activities you enjoy?
PATIENT: Specific activities? Yes, quite a few, actually. I’m an avid collector of antique maps, you see, and the subtleties of the cartography are becoming… difficult to appreciate. The shading, the fine lines… they simply don’t pop as they once did. And I enjoy birdwatching, though I confess, identifying the species is becoming increasingly challenging. One requires a certain level of visual acuity for that, naturally. It’s rather frustrating. I do strive for excellence in all my endeavors, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very frustrating, especially when it impacts things you're passionate about. Antique maps and birdwatching both require very precise vision. Okay, Mr. Al Corta. Let’s go through a bit more of your history to see if we can pinpoint what might be going on. Have you noticed any changes in your overall health recently?
PATIENT: Recent changes... hmm. Well, my appetite hasn’t been what it once was. Not a significant change, mind you, just... less enthusiasm for meals. And I've been feeling rather fatigued lately, though I attribute that to the general state of the world, frankly. It’s rather draining, all the… unpleasantness. My doctor back home – a rather young man, not terribly experienced, I suspect – said my blood pressure was a little elevated a few months back, but nothing alarming. Though I doubt he truly understood the nuances of my condition.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite, fatigue, and slightly elevated blood pressure… I'm noting all of that. Do you take any medications currently, Mr. Al Corta?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I prefer natural remedies, whenever possible. I believe in maintaining a holistic approach to wellness. And frankly, I’ve always been rather skeptical of pharmaceuticals. Too many side effects, too much interference with the body’s natural processes. I find a good cup of chamomile tea does wonders for most ailments. Although, admittedly, it hasn't done much for this particular issue.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for natural remedies, Mr. Al Corta. Let's move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none that I’m aware of. I’ve always considered myself quite robust, actually. A hardy specimen, one might say. I’ve traveled extensively, you see, and encountered all sorts of… exotic flora and fauna, and never had a reaction. Though I suppose one can develop sensitivities at any age. It wouldn’t surprise me, given the… questionable quality of modern food. But as of now, no, I’m not allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Hmm. A rather unremarkable one, if I’m honest. My mother lived to a respectable age – early nineties, though she wasn’t particularly vibrant in her later years. My father… he passed away rather young, a heart condition, I believe. As for other relatives, mostly farmers and… tradespeople. Nothing particularly notable in terms of medical conditions, as far as I know. Though my grandmother on my mother’s side did have… cataracts, I think. But that’s a common ailment, isn’t it? Hardly a significant factor. She wasn’t a woman of refined sensibilities, either, so I doubt it was a hereditary issue.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother lived to her nineties, father passed from a heart condition, grandmother had cataracts. That's helpful. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What exactly do you mean by that, Doctor? I maintain a rather... discreet lifestyle. I'm divorced, if that's what you're after. A regrettable situation, but best left in the past. I don't partake in… excessive socializing, if that's what you're implying. I prefer intellectual pursuits, quiet contemplation. I wouldn't describe myself as a particularly… outgoing individual. Is that the sort of information you require? It feels rather intrusive, frankly.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that felt intrusive, Mr. Al Corta. I simply need a bit of information about your lifestyle to get a complete picture. I'm not interested in personal details, just things that might be relevant to your health. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Good heavens, no. Absolutely not. I find such behaviors rather… uncouth. I do occasionally enjoy a glass of fine wine with dinner – a Cabernet Sauvignon, preferably – but only in moderation. And I haven’t smoked a cigarette in… decades. A youthful indiscretion, best forgotten. I maintain a certain level of self-discipline, you see. It’s essential for a well-ordered life. Frankly, I find the question rather offensive. Are you suggesting I’m some sort of… degenerate?
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Mr. Al Corta. I apologize if my question caused offense. It’s standard procedure to ask about those things, purely from a medical standpoint. Just to clarify, you drink wine occasionally, in moderation, and haven't smoked for decades. Now, let's move on to a brief physical exam, if you're willing. I'd like to check your vision, your pupils, and your blood pressure to start. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Very well. I suppose I have little choice. Though I must confess, I’m rather particular about who examines me. I trust you’ve thoroughly washed your hands? And please, be gentle. I have sensitive eyes. I’ve always been a discerning individual, and that extends to my comfort as well. Proceed, but with care. And do explain what you’re doing as you go along. I find a lack of transparency rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Al Corta. I always wash my hands thoroughly between patients, and I'm wearing gloves now. I will explain everything as I go along. First, I'm going to check your visual acuity – basically, how well you can see at different distances. I’m going to have you read letters on this chart. Please cover your left eye with this card and read the smallest line you can see clearly. Okay, your vision in your right eye is 20/30. Now let's do your left eye. Your vision in your left eye is 20/25. Now I'm going to check your pupils. I’m going to shine a light in your eyes and look at how they react. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Your blood pressure is 145/90. That's a little elevated. Alright, Mr. Al Corta. Based on your history and these initial findings, your vision is slightly diminished in both eyes, and your blood pressure is a bit high. Given your description of faded colors and dimming peripheral vision, and the fact that you're not experiencing any pain or other concerning symptoms, I'm concerned about possible early signs of glaucoma or macular degeneration. It's too early to say for sure, though. To get a better understanding, I’d like to order some additional tests. Specifically, I recommend a visual field test, which will assess your peripheral vision, and a dilated eye exam, which will allow me to examine the back of your eyes in detail. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Glaucoma? Macular degeneration? Those sound… unpleasant. And I haven't experienced any pain, Doctor, merely a deterioration of my visual experience. A rather significant distinction, I assure you. A “visual field test” and a “dilated eye exam"... Very well. If you deem it necessary. Though I must warn you, I have a rather important appointment this afternoon. Antique map appraisal, you see. A rather rare find. I trust these tests won't take too long? And will the dilation affect my ability to… appreciate the nuances of cartography? I expect a full explanation of the procedure, including any potential side effects. I do not appreciate surprises, Doctor. This is all rather inconvenient, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Al Corta. And you're right to ask about the potential impact on your appointment. The visual field test is non-invasive and takes about 10-15 minutes per eye. You’ll be looking into a machine and focusing on lights as they appear. The dilated eye exam involves using eye drops to widen your pupils, which allows me to see a much clearer picture of the back of your eye. The dilation can take up to an hour to fully wear off and will cause temporary blurry vision and sensitivity to light. It will affect your ability to focus on fine details, so it’s best to avoid activities requiring sharp vision during that time. We can provide you with sunglasses to minimize the sensitivity to light. Given your appointment this afternoon, it might be best to schedule these tests for tomorrow morning. That would allow the dilation to wear off before your appraisal. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning, then. It’s hardly ideal, but I suppose it’s the least disruptive option. I trust your staff is competent and can accommodate my schedule? I expect prompt service and minimal waiting. I do not have time to waste. And please, ensure the examination room is adequately lit. I have sensitive eyes, remember? And I would appreciate a comfortable chair. One doesn’t simply endure discomfort for the sake of… tests. Inform me of the precise time of the appointment, and any preparatory measures I should take. I expect a full briefing, Doctor. This is all rather… taxing.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Al Corta. I understand. We can schedule you for 9:00 AM tomorrow morning. The examination room will be adequately lit, and we have comfortable chairs available. There are no specific preparatory measures you need to take, other than arriving a few minutes early to fill out some paperwork. We’ll also have you sign a consent form for the dilation. We’ll dim the lights slightly during the eye exam itself, but we'll keep the overall room lighting comfortable for you. I’m also going to have my staff provide you with a pair of sunglasses to wear after the dilation to help with the light sensitivity. And just to reiterate, we’ll be performing a visual field test and a dilated eye exam to assess your vision and rule out any potential underlying causes for your symptoms. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. That will suffice for the moment. I trust your staff is aware of my… particular requirements? And please, remind them to be punctual. I do not appreciate delays. Very well, then. I shall see you tomorrow morning. I expect a thorough examination and a concise explanation of the results. Good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Al Corta. I’ve made a note of your requirements, and I’ll ensure my staff is aware. We look forward to seeing you tomorrow morning. Have a good day. .
