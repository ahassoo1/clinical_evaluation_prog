DOCTOR: Hi Adyn, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor. It’s… well, my speech. It hasn't been quite right lately. It's a bit hard to explain, truthfully. I just… stumble over my words sometimes. It's been going on for a little while now, I think. I don’t recall exactly when it started, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, stumbling over your words… that's a good place to start. Can you tell me a little more about when you notice it happening?
PATIENT: Hmm… when, you say? It doesn't seem to be a particular time of day, or after any specific activity. Sometimes it's when I’m just talking normally, other times… well, when I'm a bit tired, perhaps? Or if I’m trying to explain something complicated at work, with all the building plans and such. But honestly, it’s hard to pinpoint. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Adyn. It’s helpful to know it's not consistently linked to tiredness or complex tasks, but those seem to be triggers. And it's good you're aware of the memory thing, we can explore that too. Let’s try to get a better picture. When you stumble, what does that feel like?
PATIENT: Well… it's like my tongue gets a bit heavy, perhaps? And the words… they just don’t come out as clearly as they should. It's not a pain, not exactly. More like… a disconnect, if that makes sense. Like my brain knows what I want to say, but getting it out is… difficult. It's frustrating, truthfully. I don’t usually have trouble expressing myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, "heavy tongue" and a disconnect between thinking and speaking. That’s good information. And frustrating is understandable. Have you noticed this affecting anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I suppose my husband has mentioned a few times that I seem a bit… slower to respond to questions lately. Not a huge delay, but he says I take a moment longer to formulate my thoughts. He worries, you see. And at work… well, I'm a Construction Manager, so clear communication is rather important. I haven't made any major mistakes, but I do find myself double-checking things more often, just to be safe. It’s… a little concerning, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a slight delay in responses, and increased self-checking at work. We’re building a good picture here. Now, let’s go a bit broader. Have you had any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see. I have been feeling a bit more tired than usual, yes. Just a general fatigue, nothing too debilitating. And… I think my vision has been a little blurry sometimes, but I thought that was just from staring at computer screens all day. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good at noticing these things. I tend to just… push through. Is there anything specific I should be looking out for?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and blurry vision are good things to note. And it’s good you're acknowledging them. We'll definitely explore those. Now, thinking about your past medical history… have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a difficult question. I have Medicare, so I’ve definitely seen doctors over the years. I had the usual childhood illnesses, I suppose. Nothing major, thankfully. And… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but it was managed with medication for a while. I stopped taking it, though, with my doctor’s approval. I can’t recall the specifics, truthfully. It was some time ago. My husband is usually the one who keeps track of these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of managed high blood pressure. That's helpful. Any surgeries or hospitalizations that you recall?
PATIENT: No, nothing of that sort. No surgeries, no hospital stays. I've been quite fortunate in that regard, thankfully. I've always been a fairly healthy person, up until recently, at least. I do have a bit of arthritis in my hands, but that’s just a minor inconvenience. It flares up sometimes, but it’s nothing serious. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to wonder if I’m just getting old! I turned nineteen this year, but it feels like my body is much older.
DOCTOR: Okay, nineteen years old… and I see some notes here about that blood pressure management a few years back. Now, what about family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s another tricky one. My mother… she had some health problems, I think. Something with her heart, but I don't recall the specifics. She passed away a few years ago, so I don't have much information. My father… he’s still alive, thankfully, and he’s quite healthy for his age. He has a bit of arthritis, like me, but otherwise, he’s doing well. I don’t recall any major illnesses in either of their families, truthfully. We weren’t very close, so we didn’t discuss these things much. Is this important, Doctor? I apologise for my lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Adyn, it's completely understandable. We just try to get a full picture. Now, what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history…? Oh. Right. Well, I’m married, as I mentioned earlier. My husband, Desmond, is a carpenter. We live in a fairly quiet suburban area. I work full-time, of course, managing construction projects. I don't really have any hobbies, if I'm honest. I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven't had much time for that lately. And… I don’t drink or smoke. I try to eat a healthy diet, but it’s hard with my busy schedule. Is there anything specific you’d like to know, Doctor? I hope I’m not being too vague.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. This is all helpful. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, thankfully. And no allergies to food or anything else, either. I'm quite fortunate in that regard. I do get mosquito bites easily, but that’s just a minor annoyance. I suppose that’s all, Doctor. I hope I haven’t forgotten anything important. I apologise again for my lack of clarity. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, Adyn. Thank you for all of that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just… please be gentle, if you would. My nerves aren't quite what they used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. Blood pressure is… 135 over 80. Pulse is 72, regular. Lungs sound clear. Heart sounds… regular, but a little bit of a murmur. It’s a soft murmur, nothing alarming right now, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Let me check your neurological function… can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can. It’s a little… difficult to focus, perhaps? My vision has been a bit blurry lately, you see. But I’m following it. I think. Is it moving too fast? I apologize, I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: No, you're not a bother at all. And it's helpful to know about the blurry vision. Now, let’s check your reflexes… I’m going to tap your knee with this little hammer. This might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t hurt.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just… be quick, if you would. I don’t particularly enjoy surprises, you see. And… I apologise in advance if I jump. My nerves, as I mentioned…
DOCTOR: Okay. Reflexes are a little diminished on both sides, but not dramatically. Let me check your strength… can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: I’m trying, Doctor. I don’t think I’m as strong as I used to be. My hands ache sometimes, you see, with the arthritis. Is that enough? I apologize, I don’t want to disappoint you.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's alright. Strength is a little bit reduced, but not significantly. And walking looks normal. Now, let's just check your balance… can you stand with your feet together and close your eyes for a moment?
PATIENT: Oh dear… I feel a little… unsteady, Doctor. I don't think I have very good balance. I'm afraid I might fall. Perhaps we shouldn't…
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. Let's sit down. You're not alone in feeling unsteady, and it’s good you told me. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings—the soft heart murmur, diminished reflexes, reduced strength, and unsteady balance—I’m concerned about a few possibilities. It could be related to some mild nerve compression, perhaps aggravated by your arthritis, or it could be something else entirely. Because of the combination of symptoms, I'd like to order some blood tests and an MRI of your brain. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An MRI…? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Blood tests are fine, I suppose. But an MRI… What exactly are you looking for, Doctor? And is it… painful? I apologize, I’m probably being silly, but I get very anxious about these things. It’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be, you see, and I worry about… well, everything.
DOCTOR: It's not silly at all to be anxious, Adyn. It’s completely understandable. An MRI—Magnetic Resonance Imaging—uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed pictures of the inside of your brain. It's painless—you just lie still inside a large machine. It helps us rule out any structural problems that might be causing your symptoms. The blood tests will help us check for vitamin deficiencies and other underlying medical conditions. We’ll also want to monitor your blood pressure regularly. I'm not trying to scare you, but it’s important to get a clear picture of what’s going on. I'm also going to refer you to a neurologist, a specialist in brain and nerve disorders. They can provide a more specialized evaluation. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A neurologist… alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then I trust your judgement. I just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. My husband will be very worried, you see. He worries enough as it is. And… could you perhaps explain everything to him as well? He’s usually the one who keeps track of these things. I apologize for being such a bother, but my memory isn’t what it used to be, you see, and I’m afraid I’ll forget everything you’ve told me. Could you perhaps write it down for me as well?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be happy to explain everything to your husband, and I'll definitely write everything down for you. We'll start with the blood tests—I'll give you a requisition form. We’ll get those done as soon as possible. And I’ll schedule you an appointment with the neurologist—Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s excellent. I’ll also give you a copy of these notes, as well as a referral letter for the neurologist. We’ll review the results of the blood tests together, and then we'll discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen—if you experience any sudden weakness, vision changes, or difficulty speaking—please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. And I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. And thank you for offering to speak to my husband. He will be very relieved. I apologize for being such a bother, but my memory isn’t what it used to be, you see, and I’m afraid I’ll forget everything you’ve told me. Could you perhaps remind me of Dr. Sharma’s name again? Just in case.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Dr. Anya Sharma. S-H-A-R-M-A. And don't worry about being a bother, Adyn. It’s my job to make sure you understand everything, and to help you get the care you need. Here’s my card. Feel free to call if you have any questions or concerns. And don't hesitate to reach out if your symptoms worsen. Take care, Adyn. And I'll talk to your husband soon. .
