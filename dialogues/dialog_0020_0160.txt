DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't have a lot of time for this. I just... I'm tired. Really tired. And I've been… eating dirt. Yes, dirt. Don't look at me like that, it's not as strange as it sounds. It helps, okay? But it’s getting worse, the tiredness and the… craving.
DOCTOR: Okay, Candis. I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing significant fatigue and… an unusual craving. We’ll try to figure this out. When did this tiredness start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... It wasn't sudden, you know? It’s been creeping up on me for… maybe six months now? It started as just needing a little extra nap, and now… now I can barely get through the day without collapsing. And the dirt… that started maybe three months ago. I found some near the community garden and... well, it just called to me. Don’t ask me why. It's embarrassing enough admitting it.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, about six months of increasing fatigue, and three months of craving and consuming dirt. Has anything changed in your life around the time this started?
PATIENT: Changed? Goodness, what hasn't changed? The world keeps spinning, doesn't it? But specifically… hmmm. Let me see. Old Man Hemlock passed away, which was sad, but it didn't upset me particularly. I did start a new batch of hibiscus tea, but I’ve been drinking that for years… Oh! And the bakery down the street started using a different flour. Could that be it? It smells awfully… artificial. Everything is so… processed these days. Honestly, you can't trust anything anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a loss of a neighbor, and a change in the flour used at the bakery. You mentioned the new flour smells artificial…Do you notice any difference in how you feel after eating things made with this new flour?
PATIENT: Yes! Absolutely. It gives me… a hollow feeling. Like something’s missing. And then I need the dirt. It’s the only thing that settles it, you see? It's awful, I know. I’m not a… a savage. But it feels… grounding. Does that make sense? Grounding. And don’t tell anyone I told you this. People will think I’ve lost my mind.
DOCTOR: Yes, Candis, that makes sense. It sounds like the dirt provides a specific sensation for you. We need to rule out any physical causes for this craving, but also understand why you’re feeling this need. Do you have any other cravings besides the dirt?
PATIENT: Other cravings? Heavens, no. Just the earth, really. Though, sometimes I feel like I need to chew on ice, but that's just because my mouth feels… dry. And I’ve been terribly thirsty lately. Like I can’t get enough water, but it doesn't even help. Is that… normal? Please tell me that's normal. I'm starting to feel quite silly talking about all this.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Candis. You're describing some important symptoms, and we're going to figure this out together. The thirst and ice chewing are definitely something we need to look into. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your mouth. Then, I’d like to order some blood work to check your iron levels and electrolytes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. I haven’t got all day, you know. Though, honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if everything’s perfectly normal. Doctors always say everything’s normal. It's probably just… old age. Yes, that's it. It's just old age catching up with me. Now, get on with it, please. And be gentle. My bones are rather fragile.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit up and relax your arm?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just… don’t squeeze it too tight. My circulation isn’t what it used to be. And hurry up, will you? This chair is dreadfully uncomfortable. Honestly, you'd think a doctor's office would have better furniture. It's all… form over function, you know? Like everything these days. Sigh. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not critically high. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… again… Good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear, though a bit diminished. Now, could I take a quick look in your mouth?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just be quick about it. I don't like having things poked and prodded. And don’t be surprised if my gums bleed a little. They’re rather sensitive, you know. I have to be careful when I brush. Honestly, everything just… falls apart as you get older. It’s terribly frustrating. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Your gums are a bit inflamed and bleed easily, as you mentioned. This could be a sign of gingivitis. It's not uncommon, especially with age. We can talk about improving your oral hygiene later. Now, one last thing. Could you open wide and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Do you have to? It's dreadfully embarrassing. Opens mouth and says "Ah" in a small, hesitant voice There. Happy now? Honestly, you doctors and your poking and prodding. It's all so… unnecessary. Just get the blood work ordered, will you? I have a gardening club meeting later and I don’t want to be late. Honestly, the hydrangeas are starting to wilt. It's a disaster.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Candis. Your throat looks a little dry, but otherwise okay. Alright, I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a ferritin level. This will help us check for any deficiencies or underlying issues that could be causing your fatigue and cravings. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll need a small blood sample. I’ll also write a note for the nurse to check your weight, which I see is 107 pounds. Would you be comfortable stepping on the scale for me?
PATIENT: Ugh, must you? Honestly, I know I'm a bit… slender. It's just my build, okay? Always have been. My mother was the same way. Fine, fine. Just get it over with. But don’t make a fuss about it. I haven’t eaten much lately. All this tiredness, you see? It takes away my appetite. Honestly, it's a vicious cycle. Now, hurry up. I have hydrangeas to rescue.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candis. Your weight is 107 pounds. I’m also going to write a note for the nurse to measure your height again just to confirm, and get a quick blood pressure check before you leave. I'll have the lab results back in a few days, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as increased fatigue, dizziness, or shortness of breath, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… the blood work. And hurry up with it. Honestly, I'm wasting a perfectly good afternoon worrying about dirt and blood tests. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have hydrangeas to save. Don’t bother sending me a bill, either. I don’t have insurance, you know. It’s a whole other disaster. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Candis. We will get that blood work ordered right away and will be in touch when the results are back. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good afternoon and good luck with your hydrangeas. .
