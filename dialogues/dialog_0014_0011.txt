DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Doctor… Osterholm, is it? Yes. Look, I don’t have all day. I need a paper signed. Something about… getting some work done. Cosmetic, they called it. My nephew said I needed clearance 'fore I do it. He handles all my business, you understand. I just need the doctor to say it's… alright. Simple.
DOCTOR: A clearance for cosmetic work… Right. And what sort of work are we talking about, specifically?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t rightly know specifically. Some lifting, maybe? My face… it’s just… gone. Droopy. The young man said it could be fixed. He found a good place, very modern. Look, I’m 64 years old! I ain’t lookin' to become a movie star, just… less saggy. Is that too much to ask? I just need the paper.
DOCTOR: "Less saggy"... Okay. Well, Mr. Honcoop, even for cosmetic procedures, I need to understand a little more about your overall health before I can sign off on anything. It's not just about signing a paper; it’s about making sure you're a safe candidate. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Conditions? Goodness gracious. Let me think… I get a little tired sometimes. Old age, mostly. And my knees ache when it rains. Other than that… no. Never been a sickly man. I worked on towers, you know. Radio, cellular… hard work! Builds a man up. I wouldn't have lasted if I was weak. So no, no conditions. Just… old. Is that what you want to hear?
DOCTOR: "Just old" isn't really a medical diagnosis, Mr. Honcoop. Have you been diagnosed with high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems… anything at all?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I told you. Towers! Climbing up and down those things, rain or shine. If I had heart problems, I wouldn't be here, would I? And diabetes? I don't eat much sugar. A little bit of sweet tea sometimes, but that’s it. I don’t need a list of illnesses read to me. My nephew said all I needed was a general okay. He's a smart boy. I’m perfectly healthy enough for a little… face fixin’. Can we just get this done? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, I’m not comfortable signing off on a medical clearance without a proper assessment. Your history of working on towers is relevant – it suggests potential for musculoskeletal issues, and strenuous work can certainly impact cardiovascular health. Even a “little face fixin’” can carry risks. Let’s just do a basic exam, check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs. It'll take ten minutes, tops. It’s for your safety.
PATIENT: Ten minutes? Honestly. Fine. But don't tell me I've got some terrible disease. My nephew will be furious. He warned me about doctors… always finding something wrong. Just get it over with. Blood pressure, you say? Hmph. It’s probably just fine. I've always been strong. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just have a seat here, I’ll get started. First, I’m going to take your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please remove your shirt and shoes. I’m going to need to listen to your breathing as well. And, if you don't mind, I'll take a quick look at your overall physique. It just helps me get a better understanding of your health.
PATIENT: Physique? What do you need to see my physique for? It's just old man skin and bones! This is ridiculous. My nephew is never going to believe this. Just hurry up and get it over with. And be gentle. I don’t want any bruising. Honestly, the nerve of some people… This whole thing is a waste of time. Just… get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop, just relax. Blood pressure is 150 over 90. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and another one… good. Hmm. Breathing sounds a bit… wheezy. Any history of asthma or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Wheezy? I told you, towers! Dust, wind, climbing… of course it's a little wheezy. Never had asthma. Never needed an inhaler. Just… old lungs. This is what happens when you work hard your whole life. It doesn’t mean I'm sick! And stop poking and prodding! You’re making me nervous, which is probably raising my blood pressure even higher. Just… tell me if I can get my shirt back on yet. I'm cold.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. I'm listening to your lungs again. I do hear some congestion, and some mild wheezing on both sides. It's not severe, but it's something we should address. Now, let’s just quickly check your reflexes. Extend your arm… good. And your leg… yes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Diminished? What does that even mean? It means I'm old, doesn't it? I told you, I climb towers! My body is used to being pushed. Stop trying to find things wrong with me. And no, I don’t have pain! Just aches. Old man aches! This is ridiculous. Honestly, I’m wasting my whole day here. Can we please just get to the paper? Is that too much to ask? I need to go. This is a complete waste of time and… and I'm starting to feel faint. It's this poking and prodding!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop, you're right. We need to take a step back. You are clearly agitated, and I’m hearing some concerning things. I'm not trying to find things wrong with you, I'm trying to ensure your safety before I approve any procedure. Given your elevated blood pressure, mild wheezing, and diminished reflexes, I'm not comfortable signing off on a clearance for cosmetic surgery at this time. I recommend a full check-up with a primary care physician, including an EKG and chest X-ray. We need to rule out any underlying cardiac or pulmonary issues. I can give you a referral…
PATIENT: Referral?! Cardiac?! You’re telling me I have heart problems now?! This is outrageous! I’m perfectly fine! I climbed towers for forty years! You haven’t even looked at me properly! This is a complete waste of my time. And my nephew was right! Doctors… always finding something wrong! No. Absolutely not. I don’t need a check-up. I don’t need a referral. I just need a paper signed! This is… this is unbelievable. I’m going to tell my nephew. He’ll… he’ll be furious. You’ve wasted my whole day! .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you're frustrated, but I am ethically obligated to prioritize your safety. I cannot, in good conscience, sign off on a procedure without a proper assessment. I'm documenting my concerns in your chart, and I strongly recommend you reconsider my offer of a referral. I am not trying to upset you, but it's my professional responsibility to ensure you are a safe candidate for any medical procedure. I will provide you with a list of primary care physicians in the area. Please, consider it. .
