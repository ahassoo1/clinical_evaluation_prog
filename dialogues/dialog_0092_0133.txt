DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, I just need some papers signed, really. Some health forms that need verifying for… something. Honestly, I didn’t really read the whole thing, just got told to bring ‘em here. I hope that’s alright. I just want to get this done quickly if we can.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Melvenia. We can absolutely take care of those forms for you. I do want to briefly go over them with you, just to ensure everything is accurate and that I have a complete understanding of your health history. It’s important, even if it’s just for verification purposes. Before we get started on the forms, can you tell me a little bit about what these forms are for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. See, I told you I didn’t read it! They said something about… a volunteer thing? I’m trying out to help at the community center, doing… well, I'm not sure exactly what yet. They needed these forms, and my daughter said to come here to get them signed by a doctor. That’s all I know, truly. I just want to help, but all this paperwork… It’s a lot for an old lady.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Melvenia. It's perfectly alright if you didn't read the whole thing. Many volunteer organizations require these forms to ensure the safety of both the volunteer and the people they are assisting. No worries at all. Let’s start with a few basic questions, just to get a general overview of your health. Then we can go through the forms together. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better, Doctor. Basic questions are fine. I can handle basic. Just… please don't ask me to spell anything. My eyes aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, no spelling required. We can take things at your pace, and I'll do all the writing. First, could you tell me a little bit about any medical conditions you currently have?
PATIENT: Well… let’s see. I’ve got a little bit of arthritis in my hands, that’s why they’re always a bit stiff. And my blood pressure runs a little high sometimes, but I don’t take anything for it right now. The doctor said to watch my salt intake. Oh, and I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that hasn't bothered me in ages. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Melvenia. Arthritis in your hands, high blood pressure that you’re managing with diet, and a gallbladder removal in the past. Do you recall approximately when you had your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It must have been… oh, at least twenty years ago. Maybe more. It was when my daughter, Maria, was still in high school. She’s thirty-five now, so… yeah, definitely over twenty years ago. It was a pretty routine thing, they said. I don't remember much else about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, over twenty years ago for the gallbladder removal. And have you been diagnosed with any other conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. No diabetes, no heart problems… I get a little breathless sometimes when I climb stairs, but the doctor said that's just my age. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I’ve always tried to eat healthy, though I do have a sweet tooth. Does that count against me?
DOCTOR: A sweet tooth doesn’t count against you, Melvenia! Many people enjoy a little something sweet. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, sir. Like I said, just trying to watch the salt. I take a little bit of ibuprofen sometimes for my hands when they’re really aching, but that's it. And maybe a multivitamin now and then, but I forget most of the time. My daughter keeps reminding me, but… well, you know how it is. Things slip your mind.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Melvenia. Ibuprofen as needed for your hands, and an occasional multivitamin. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things. My daughter always tells me I should be more careful, but I've never had a problem. I do get a little itchy sometimes after I cut grass, but I just think it's the pollen. Not a serious allergy, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication allergies, and some mild sensitivity to pollen. That’s good to know. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Do you know if any of your close family members – parents, siblings, or children – have any significant medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, family history… That's a tough one. My mother, she had high blood pressure, like me. And she had arthritis, too. My father… he was a strong man, never really sick. He smoked a lot, though. And my brother, he had… I think it was some kind of heart trouble, years ago. He’s gone now, sadly. Maria, my daughter, is healthy as a horse, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your mother had high blood pressure and arthritis, your father smoked, and your brother had heart trouble. It’s good to hear your daughter is healthy. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never smoked a day in my life. My mother always said it was a terrible habit. And I don’t drink, either. A little sip of wine with Christmas dinner sometimes, but that’s about it. And definitely no drugs! I’m a respectable woman, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I certainly wouldn’t think otherwise, Melvenia. That’s wonderful. Now, before we proceed with the forms, I'd like to quickly check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature – just to get a baseline. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead. I suppose it's good to check. Just… don’t take too long, alright? I have a few things I need to get done this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Melvenia. It won’t take long at all. Nurse, could you please take Melvenia’s vital signs?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Alright, Melvenia. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90, but not significantly concerning. Your pulse is 78, which is normal, and your temperature is 98.6, also normal. We’ll want to keep an eye on your blood pressure, but for now, let’s focus on completing these forms. Do you have your glasses with you?
