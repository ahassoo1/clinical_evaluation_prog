DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s this…full feeling. I just don’t eat much before I feel stuffed, you know? It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so. Not a comfortable thing, really.
DOCTOR: A “full feeling,” alright. And you said this has been going on for about a month?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly a month. It’s not like pain, exactly. More…like my stomach just decides it's had enough really quick. Even with small plates. My wife, Elsie, she keeps offering me more, bless her heart, but I truly can’t.
DOCTOR: Elsie is concerned, good. It's always helpful to have someone notice these things. And it's not pain, you said, just a rapid sense of fullness. Does this happen with everything you eat, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Pretty much everything, yeah. Doesn't matter if it's soup, a sandwich, even just a little bit of fish and rice. It's frustrating, 'cause I enjoy my food, you know? I used to have a good appetite. Now…not so much. It's just…early fullness. That's the best way I can put it.
DOCTOR: And has anything changed recently, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Not really, no. Elsie and I haven't changed our diet, nothing major going on with stress…well, nothing more than usual for an old man, ha! I've been going to the community centre, same as always, walking with old friends. No new medications or anything like that. I’m really at a loss here, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your bowel movements, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, they’re…regular enough. Not stopped up, not…loose, if you know what I mean. Just…normal. Though, maybe a little less than usual, now that I’m not eating as much. Does that make sense? I don't want to get into too much detail here, if you don't mind. It’s…personal.
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable. Less frequent bowel movements along with decreased appetite…Alright. Have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, or any unintentional weight loss, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: No vomiting, thankfully. And nausea…not really. Maybe a little queasy sometimes, but that could be anything, really. Weight loss… Elsie says I’ve lost a little, but I haven't been weighing myself, to be honest. I’m always a skinny fella. I’ve never been big.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to listen to your abdomen, check for any tenderness, and feel your belly. It's standard procedure, Mr. Obarr, and will help me get a better idea of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just let me know if anything feels…weird, okay? I’m not a fan of poking and prodding, but if it helps, it helps.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie back on the examination table for me. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds, Mr. Obarr, but they are a bit…hypoactive, meaning they're a little quieter than I'd expect. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Let me know immediately if you feel any pain. There’s a little bit of tenderness when I press here, in the upper part of your abdomen. Not severe, but noticeable. Is that where you feel uncomfortable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s…that’s about right. A little bit of a dull ache there when someone pushes on it. Not sharp, just…uncomfortable. It’s been like that for a bit, I guess I just figured it was old age catching up. It comes and goes, though. Not constant.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms – the early fullness, the decreased appetite, the mild epigastric discomfort, and the hypoactive bowel sounds – there are a few possibilities we need to consider, Mr. Obarr. It could be something relatively minor, like gastritis – inflammation of the stomach lining – or it could be something else. To get a clearer picture, I'm going to order some blood work. It will help us check for things like anemia, infection, and pancreatic function. I also want to order a stool test to rule out any bleeding or infection in your digestive system. Finally, I’d like to schedule an upper endoscopy. An endoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the lining and take a biopsy if needed. It’s the most accurate way to diagnose the cause of your symptoms. It does require some preparation, and we can discuss it in detail, but it’s generally a very safe procedure. Does that sound acceptable to you, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a minute. Endoscopy? That sounds…serious. A camera inside my stomach? I don't know, Doctor. That’s a lot. I was hoping it would be something simple. What are we even looking for exactly? And what if…what if something is wrong? I'm getting a little anxious just thinking about it. I don’t even know what a biopsy is.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Obarr. It sounds daunting, I agree. Let me explain more clearly. A biopsy is simply taking a very small tissue sample to examine under a microscope. It helps us identify the cause of the inflammation, if there is any. We are looking for things like ulcers, inflammation, or, in rare cases, something more serious like a tumor. However, it's important to remember that most of the time, these symptoms are caused by something much less serious. The blood work and stool test are just to rule out other possibilities, like anemia or infection. The endoscopy is the most accurate way to get a definitive diagnosis. We would only proceed with it if the other tests don't give us a clear answer. And, of course, we would discuss the risks and benefits thoroughly before proceeding. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: It’s just…a lot to take in. And the idea of a camera… I guess I’m mostly worried about what we might find. What are the chances it's something…bad, Doctor? And what does “preparation” mean? Elsie drives me to all my appointments, you know. I don’t want to cause her any worry. I really just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand your worries, Mr. Obarr. It’s perfectly natural to be anxious about the unknown. Let's talk about the probabilities. Given your age and symptoms, the chances of it being something serious like a tumor are relatively low. The most common causes of your symptoms are gastritis, ulcers, or a slow-digesting stomach. As for the preparation, it involves a liquid diet for 24 hours before the procedure and taking a bowel preparation to clear your colon. It’s not pleasant, I won’t lie, but it’s necessary to get a clear view during the endoscopy. And, of course, Elsie can accompany you, and we will explain everything to her as well. We would ensure you are as comfortable as possible throughout the process. Before we proceed with anything, I want to emphasize that you are in control. We can start with the blood work and stool test, and we can discuss the endoscopy further after we have the results. If you are not comfortable with the endoscopy, we can explore other options, but they may not be as accurate. Do you want me to explain the blood work and stool tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work and stool tests…that sounds manageable, I guess. Just…no camera right now. Not yet. Tell me about the blood work. What are you looking for in there, exactly? And how long will it take to get the results? Elsie and I are going to the community centre next week. I'd like to know before then if possible. It's hard to enjoy myself worrying about…all this.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. That's a perfectly reasonable decision. We'll start with the blood work and stool tests. The blood work will give us a broader picture of your overall health. We'll be looking for signs of anemia, which could explain your fatigue and decreased appetite. We’ll also check your liver and kidney function, as well as your pancreatic enzymes, to rule out any problems with those organs. We’ll also check for inflammation markers. The stool test will check for hidden blood, which could indicate bleeding in your digestive tract. It will also check for any infections. The results typically take 3-5 business days. I will have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they are available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. If you haven’t heard anything after 5 business days, please call the office to check on the status. Here is the requisition for the blood work. You can go to any lab that accepts our insurance, and you don't need an appointment. The nurse will give you instructions for the stool test sample collection. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s pretty clear. Elsie can handle the paperwork. Thank you, Doctor. It's good to know we're starting small. And thank you for explaining everything so patiently. I really appreciate it. I think that's all for now, isn’t it? I’ll let Elsie know about the tests. I suppose we’ll just wait and see. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Obarr. It was my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll take things one step at a time. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you for your follow-up appointment.
