DOCTOR: Right. Maribeth Vanderwiele. 71. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Memmolo, is it? Yes. It's my breathing. It gets… difficult when I lie down. It’s been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so. Not all the time, but enough to bother me. I prefer to sleep propped up with pillows, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Difficult breathing… when lying down. A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Maybe a little longer. It’s… unsettling. I don’t love being uncomfortable, you see. And it wasn't sudden, it just… gradually got worse. I don’t recall anything specific that started it, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Gradual onset. Alright. And besides lying down, are there any other times you notice it's worse?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, walking upstairs sometimes gets me a little winded, but that’s just being my age, I figure. It’s mostly when I’m trying to get comfortable in bed. And it's not a cough, or a wheeze. Just… shortness of breath. I feel like I can’t get enough air. It’s… peculiar.
DOCTOR: Peculiar, yes. Well, many things can cause shortness of breath. Do you have any… chest pain with this?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Not at all. Just… the feeling of being squeezed, I suppose. But not painful. And it doesn’t radiate anywhere. Just… in my chest. Is that… helpful? I'm trying to be precise. I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Now that you mention it… yes. A little. I thought it was just the heat. We've had a particularly warm summer, you know. But yes, my ankles do feel a bit puffy sometimes, especially at the end of the day. Not terribly, but noticeable. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Puffy ankles… yes, potentially. Do you have any history of heart problems?
PATIENT: Heart problems? No, not that I’m aware of. My mother had high blood pressure, but she lived to be 89, so I suppose it wasn’t too bad. I’ve had the usual check-ups, but no one ever mentioned anything about my heart. I've always been fairly healthy, all things considered. I'm a librarian, you see, so it's not a strenuous occupation.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a little pill for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Been taking it for… oh, goodness, maybe ten years now? And a multivitamin, but that's hardly a medication, is it? Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I'm quite… straightforward, in that regard. No sensitivities, no rashes, nothing like that. I appreciate a simple life, you see. And that includes a simple medical history. Is this taking much longer? I do have a book club meeting this evening.
DOCTOR: We'll get through it. Okay. Let's do a quick examination. I need to listen to your lungs and heart, and I'll check your ankles. Just a routine check. Sit back, please.
PATIENT: Very well. The quicker the better, if you don't mind. I’m not particularly fond of being prodded and poked, but I understand it's necessary. Please, do be gentle. And try not to take too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lungs are clear, though slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Heart sounds… regular, but a bit distant. Ankles do exhibit mild pitting edema. Blood pressure is 142/88. Okay. Given your symptoms – shortness of breath when lying down, swelling in your ankles, and a slightly elevated blood pressure – it could be congestive heart failure. But we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a chest X-ray and an EKG. And a blood test to check your BNP level. That will give us a better idea of what's going on.
PATIENT: Congestive heart failure? Oh, goodness. That sounds… serious. Is that common? And what does all that mean? X-rays and blood tests… it all sounds rather alarming. Is it something to be very worried about? And how long will it take to get these results? I really would prefer not to add too much stress to my schedule.
DOCTOR: It's potentially serious, yes. But we aren’t diagnosing anything yet. Many things can cause these symptoms. The tests will help us narrow it down. An X-ray is just a picture of your chest, to see if there’s any fluid buildup. The EKG checks the electrical activity of your heart. And the BNP level is a blood test that can indicate heart strain. As for timing, the lab results should be back within a couple of days. The X-ray… usually pretty quick. I’ll have the nurse schedule those for you. Don’t worry excessively. We’re being thorough, that’s all. And frankly, at your age, it's better to be cautious. Now, do you have any other questions, or shall we proceed with getting these tests ordered?
PATIENT: Cautious is sensible, I suppose. Very well. Just… can someone explain the results to me in plain English? I don't understand all the medical jargon. And is there anything I should be doing now? Resting? Reducing salt? Anything? I do dislike feeling helpless. Please, just tell me what I can do to assist the process. And… who will be calling me with the results? I prefer a direct line, if possible.
DOCTOR: The nurse will explain the results. And yes, reducing your salt intake and resting are sensible precautions. Avoid strenuous activity. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for when the results are available, and she’ll give you the direct line to reach us. She'll explain everything in terms you understand. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, I believe that is all for now. Just… thank you for your time, Doctor. And please, do ensure the nurse is prepared to explain things clearly. I appreciate a straightforward approach. I do hope it’s nothing too serious. Good day. .
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will contact you. Good day.
