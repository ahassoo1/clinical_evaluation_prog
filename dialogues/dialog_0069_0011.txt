DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. To start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Look, I ain’t got a whole lotta time, so let’s just get right to it. I need somethin’ signed, somethin’ about… a face thing. A cosmetic procedure, that’s it. My niece said I need clearance from a doctor 'fore I go ahead with it. Don’t rightly remember all the details, to be honest. It’s a… lift, I think? Yes, a face lift. Now, can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, a face lift. I understand you need a medical clearance form signed. Of course. Just to be thorough, even though you’re pressed for time, I do need to ask a few questions to ensure it’s safe for you to proceed. It's standard procedure, and it's important for your wellbeing. First, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Health? Well, I mostly keep to myself. Work keeps me busy. Radio towers, you know? Climbin’ 'em and fixin' things. It's strenuous work, but I ain’t never had any major problems. A little achin’ here and there, what you expect at my age? Never been to the hospital, 'cept maybe when I was a boy with a broken arm. Don’t remember that too well either. I mostly just… get on with it. What kinda questions are these? This is takin’ a while.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop. It is taking a little time, and I apologize for that. These questions help me understand if there are any underlying conditions that might affect the procedure or recovery. So, just to clarify, you haven't been formally diagnosed with any medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: High… what now? Doctor, I don’t keep up with all that fancy medical talk. Look, I eat okay, sleep okay. I get tired, but climbin’ those towers'll do that to ya. Never had a doctor tell me nothin' was wrong with me, if that’s what you're askin’. They poke and prod, say I’m fine, send me on my way. Never needed insurance, never had nothin' to insure. So, no, no fancy diagnoses. Just an old man tryin’ to get a face lift signed. Are we gettin’ anywhere?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No known diagnoses. And you haven’t been taking any medications regularly – even over-the-counter things like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Vitamins? Doctor, really? I work with wires and metal, not oranges! Maybe some aspirin now and again for a headache, but that’s it. Just the plain kind, nothin' fancy. And not even regularly, you understand. When it hurts, I take one. That’s it. Honestly, I don't see how this is relevant to a face lift. It's on my face, not in my stomach! Is this somethin’ you can just do, or are we gonna sit here all day?
DOCTOR: I understand your impatience, Mr. Honcoop. You’re right, it might seem unrelated, but I need to ensure your overall health is stable before I can sign off on a cosmetic procedure. It’s a responsible step, and I apologize for the delay. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to be on the safe side. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your general condition. It won’t take long, and it will give me a better picture of your health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, I really don't have time for a whole exam. I got jobs waitin’ on me! Can’t you just sign the paper? My niece said most doctors just do this stuff. I don’t wanna be layin’ around in a hospital bed. I gotta climb those towers, you know. Climbin' is what I do. I just need this signed so I can get on with my life. Really, is there no way around this? I'm a busy man, Doctor. A very busy man.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you’re busy, and I respect that. However, I can’t ethically sign a form without having some understanding of your current health status. Signing off on a procedure without any assessment would be irresponsible and potentially harmful. I’m not trying to cause you trouble, but even a brief exam is crucial. I can keep it very focused – just blood pressure, heart rate, and a quick listen to your lungs. It will take less than five minutes. And if everything looks good, I’ll happily sign the form right away. Would you be willing to allow me to do that?
PATIENT: Five minutes, you say? Five minutes? Fine. But make it quick. Very quick. I got a tower callin' my name. But don't go pokin' around too much. Just the basics, like you said. Five minutes, Doctor. And no funny business.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Honcoop. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Please, have a seat here, and I'll be right with you. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Can you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Hurry up now. Time is money, you know. And I ain’t got much of either to spare. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Honcoop, blood pressure is a bit elevated at 158 over 92. Heart rate is a little fast, but regular. Lungs sound clear, although breath sounds are a bit quiet. Your blood pressure is higher than it should be, and your heart rate is a bit elevated. These findings warrant further investigation before proceeding with a cosmetic procedure. It’s possible it’s just anxiety from being here, but we need to rule out underlying causes like hypertension or cardiac issues.
PATIENT: Hypertension? What now? Look, I already told you, I climb towers all day! Of course my heart beats fast and my pressure’s up! That's what happens when you're dangling hundreds of feet in the air! I ain’t about to run a bunch of tests because I’m a little stressed. This is ridiculous. I just want this paper signed. My niece found a good doctor, she said, but you are makin' this a whole ordeal. I'm not sick, Doctor. I'm a worker. And I need to get back to work. Are you gonna sign it, or are we just gonna keep talkin' in circles?
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, and I appreciate you explaining your lifestyle. However, my responsibility as a physician is to ensure your safety, and I can't ethically sign off on a procedure without addressing these concerns. While your activity level certainly plays a role, a blood pressure of 158/92 is significantly elevated and requires further evaluation. I’m not saying you’re sick, but proceeding with a face lift without knowing the cause of these findings could be risky. I can offer you a referral to a cardiologist for a quick check-up. They can perform a simple EKG and assess your heart health. If everything looks good, you can return here with their clearance, and I'll happily sign the form. Alternatively, I can recommend a primary care physician who can manage your blood pressure and overall health. I can’t sign off on this today without further investigation. It’s not about not trusting you; it’s about providing responsible medical care. What do you think?
PATIENT: Look, this is a waste of my time. A cardiologist? A primary care physician? You want me to spend weeks runnin’ around to doctors when all I need is a signature? I don’t have time for all this! I’ve wasted enough time here already. Forget it. I'll find another doctor. One who understands that I'm a busy man and doesn't need a whole medical workup just to get a little work done. You know, I really thought your niece knew what she was talkin' about. But clearly, she was wrong.
