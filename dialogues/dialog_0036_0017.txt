DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I'm Dr. Bacy. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Bartok is the name. I… uh… think I gotta get a check-up. For… sports. Yeah, sports. Some kinda tryout. Not sure who with, honestly. It was advertised, you see. A fella told me about it. It’s… important, I guess. For my health.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. A check-up for a tryout – that’s smart to get everything checked out beforehand. It is important for your health, absolutely. To get a better understanding of what we need to focus on, could you tell me a little more about the sport?
PATIENT: Sport? Hmm. That’s… a good question. It was… throwing things. And running. Not a lot of running, I don’t think. More throwing. Like… baseball, maybe? Or… bowling? I forget the specifics. It was down by the… the water. Near the park. A lot of young fellas were there. Do you… need to know exactly what it is? It wasn't anything fancy.
DOCTOR: It's alright if you don't remember the exact sport, Mr. Bartok. Knowing it involves throwing and some running is helpful. It gives me a general idea of the types of physical stresses we might want to evaluate. I see here you're 51 years old, and your height is listed as 5’10” and weight as 124 pounds. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Five-ten… yeah, that sounds about right. I haven’t been measured in a while, so I couldn’t tell you for sure. And 124… That’s… probably close enough. I don’t eat a lot, you see. Always been that way. Keeps me nimble. Is that a problem? Being… not very heavy?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Bartok, being your size isn't necessarily a problem, but we want to make sure you're healthy enough for this tryout and that your weight is appropriate for your height and activity level. To get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh, jeez. Now that’s a tough one. The doctors… they always talk so fast, you know? And there’s so many words. I had something… with my blood pressure, maybe? A long time ago. And… my knee. It bothers me sometimes, when it's damp. But that’s just old age, I figure. Nothing to really write home about. I don't really go to the doctor much. They never tell me anything useful, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. High blood pressure in the past and some knee pain. It’s helpful to know that, even if you don’t remember all the details. We can certainly take a look at your knee today. Do you currently take any medications for anything, even over-the-counter medications like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Medications… Uh… I used to take something for my stomach. But that was ages ago. And… maybe some vitamins, a long time back. My ex-wife, she always bought me those. But I don’t take anything regularly now. Not a thing. I prefer to just… deal with it, you see? Builds character. Besides, what good are pills anyway? They just mask the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. That’s good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm… let me see. There was something with my… appendix, I think. A long, long time ago. When I was a kid, maybe? I don’t remember much of it, honestly. And… I broke my arm once, playing baseball. But that was… a long time ago. That’s all I can think of. Small things, really. Nothing serious. I'm a tough fella. Don't break easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a broken arm in the past. Good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… Oh, boy. Now you're asking the tough questions. My… my mother, she had… something with her heart. I think. And my father, he had… diabetes, maybe? Or was it high blood pressure? They never really talked about it much. Lots of aches and pains, that’s what I remember. Everyone on both sides had aches and pains. Old age, mostly. They didn’t take care of themselves, you see. Bad habits. Like me, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart problems and possibly diabetes or high blood pressure. That’s helpful information, Mr. Bartok. To finish up the history, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Let me think… I think I got a rash once, from… poison ivy, maybe? As a kid. But I don't remember being allergic to anything I eat or… pills. No, I don't think so. I eat pretty much anything. I'm not a picky eater, you see. Unless it’s really, really bad. Like… spoiled fish. But that's just common sense, right? Not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medication or food allergies, just a reaction to poison ivy in the past. That's good to know. Alright, Mr. Bartok, that gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, I'd like to do a physical exam to get a better sense of your current health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam… Well… I guess so. Is it gonna be… uncomfortable? I’m not a big fan of… poking and prodding. But if you gotta do it, I suppose. Just… try to be gentle, alright? I’m an old man, you see. And try not to take too long, if you could. I got things to do. Things.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bartok. I’ll be as gentle as possible. It won’t be anything too strenuous, I promise. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your knee. It should only take a few minutes. If you’ll just hop up on the table here, we can get started. I'll start by checking your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood pressure first… Alright. Let’s get this over with. Careful now… I'm not as young as I used to be, you see. Just… try not to squeeze too tight, alright? I don’t want to pass out on you.
DOCTOR: I won’t squeeze too tight, Mr. Bartok. I’ll be very careful. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated at 148/92. That’s slightly above the normal range. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Just take some deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: 148… what was that? Elevated? What does that mean? Is that bad? I don't understand… Is something wrong? I knew I shouldn't have come here. They always find something wrong… Deep breaths… alright. Deep breaths. But what does ‘elevated’ mean?
DOCTOR: It just means your blood pressure is a little higher than what we'd like it to be, Mr. Bartok. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but it's something we need to monitor. High blood pressure, if left untreated over a long time, can increase your risk for things like heart disease and stroke. However, it's manageable with lifestyle changes and, if needed, medication. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Do you ever experience any shortness of breath or chest pain?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… chest pain… No. Not really. I get a little… winded sometimes, if I climb the stairs too fast. But that’s just old age, I figure. And… sometimes my chest feels a little… tight. But that’s just… indigestion, probably. I eat things I shouldn't. I wouldn't worry about it. I'm a tough fella, remember? It comes and goes. Besides, what good would worrying do?
DOCTOR: Okay. That's good to know. Now, you mentioned some knee pain earlier. Could you show me which part of your knee is bothering you, and describe the kind of pain you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Right here. It kinda… aches. Especially when it's cold, or damp. And… sometimes it feels a little… stiff. Like it’s gonna lock up. Not all the time, mind you. Just… when the weather's bad. And… if I walk too much. It's not a sharp pain, you understand. More of a… dull ache. Like a bad memory. It’s just… old age, probably. I used to be very active, you see. Played a lot of… sports. When I was younger. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: There’s some mild tenderness on the inner side of your knee, Mr. Bartok, and a slight limitation in your range of motion. It sounds like you might have some mild osteoarthritis, which is common with age and previous activity. Does bending your knee like this cause any pain?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's not comfortable. It's not a sharp pain, like a broken bone, mind you. It's more of a… grating sensation. Like… rubbing two pieces of sandpaper together. And… it feels a little stiff. Like it's gonna lock up. See? Just like I said. Is that bad? Are you gonna have to… operate on it? I don't like the sound of that.
DOCTOR: There doesn't appear to be any significant ligament instability, which is good. The grating sensation you’re describing sounds like crepitus, which is common with osteoarthritis. It’s the cartilage wearing down. We don't necessarily need to operate, Mr. Bartok. Often, we can manage osteoarthritis with physical therapy, weight management, and pain relievers as needed. We could also consider an injection to help lubricate the joint. So, to summarize, your blood pressure is a little elevated, and you have some mild osteoarthritis in your right knee. You mentioned some knee pain, but otherwise you are feeling okay. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Elevated blood pressure… osteoarthritis… It all sounds very complicated. And… serious. I just wanted to get a check-up for the tryouts, you see. Not… a list of problems. So… what does that mean? Am I gonna be able to… do the tryouts? Can I still… throw things? Or am I too old? Too… broken? I just want to… feel useful. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, it doesn't mean you can't do the tryouts. It just means we need to be mindful of your health and take appropriate precautions. Elevated blood pressure can be managed, and mild osteoarthritis shouldn't prevent you from being active, as long as you listen to your body. I wouldn’t recommend pushing yourself too hard during the tryouts. Start slowly and gradually increase your activity level. If you experience any pain, stop and rest. And it’s important to monitor your blood pressure regularly. I think with some sensible precautions, you should be able to participate. We can also discuss some exercises to strengthen your knee and help manage the pain. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Exercises… sensible precautions… that sounds… doable. As long as I don't have to… get operated on. And as long as I can still… throw things. That’s the important part. I just want to… feel something. Feel useful. So… what kind of exercises? Something simple, I hope. I’m not a very athletic man anymore, you see. Just something to… keep me going. And… how often do I need to check my blood pressure? Is it expensive?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Bartok. We'll start with simple exercises to strengthen the muscles around your knee and improve your range of motion. Things like straight leg raises, hamstring curls, and gentle quad sets. I can give you a handout with instructions and pictures. We can also discuss some low-impact activities like walking or swimming. As for your blood pressure, I recommend checking it at least once a week at home. You can purchase a home blood pressure monitor for around $30-$50. I can write you a prescription for one if you'd like. Keeping a log of your readings will help us monitor your progress. If your readings are consistently elevated, we can discuss medication options, but we'll start with lifestyle changes and regular monitoring. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Exercises… a handout… a $50 machine… That sounds… manageable. As long as I don't have to see a fancy specialist. And as long as I can still… throw things. You keep saying that, but it’s important, you see. It’s about… proving something. To myself. So… write me the prescription for the machine. And give me the exercises. Simple ones, please. I don’t want to… pull a muscle. And… how often should I check it? Once a week, you said? And… if I start feeling dizzy, or something, I should just stop, right?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Mr. Bartok. Once a week is a good starting point, but if your readings are consistently high, we can increase that to twice a week. And yes, if you start feeling dizzy, lightheaded, or experience any chest pain, stop immediately and contact me. Here's the prescription for the monitor and the handout with the exercises. Take it slow, listen to your body, and don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I’m also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in four weeks to check your blood pressure and see how the exercises are going. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Four weeks… That sounds… alright. As long as it doesn’t interfere with the tryouts. I don’t want to… miss my chance. And… I don’t want to be a bother. I know doctors are busy people. So… I just check my blood pressure once a week, do the exercises, and come back in four weeks? And… if I feel dizzy, or something, I call? That’s it? I think… I think I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. I guess… I’ll see you in four weeks.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bartok. And don't worry about being a bother. I'm here to help. Just listen to your body, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Good luck with the tryouts, Mr. Bartok. I'm confident you can do it. Take care, and I’ll see you in four weeks.
