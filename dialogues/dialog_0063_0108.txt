DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let's not waste time, shall we?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, Doc, I ain't got all day. Something's clearly wrong, and I'd rather just get it sorted. This bleeding... it wasn't pretty.
DOCTOR: "Not insured," yes, I see that. Right. Bleeding. And where, precisely, is this bleeding originating from, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: Well, obviously from down there. Where else would it be coming from? Look, I'm not a doctor, alright? It was in the toilet. A lot of it. Black stuff. Not normal, I can tell you that much. Makes a fella feel weak, too.
DOCTOR: “Obviously,” you say. Well, some patients are more…articulate than others. Black stool is…concerning. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting accompanying this, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain, yeah, a bit. Dull ache, mostly. Not like a stabbing thing. And I felt kinda queasy yesterday, but I chalked it up to... well, everything. It's been a rough few months, if you must know. Losing my wife... changes a man. But no, didn’t actually throw up. Just felt like I might. Is this going to be expensive?
DOCTOR: We'll determine the cost after the examination, Mr. Gentz. Grief certainly complicates matters, but let’s focus on the physical symptoms. When did you first notice this bleeding?
PATIENT: About three days ago, I reckon. Started small, just a bit of discoloration. Thought it was something I ate, honestly. Then yesterday… well, yesterday it was a whole different story. Enough to scare a man, I tell ya. And it hasn’t exactly stopped since. More like slowed down a bit, but still… there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits aside from the color?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? Look, I go when I need to go. Sometimes it’s… firmer, sometimes it’s looser. Like anyone else. It wasn't different different, if that makes sense. Just… the color. That’s what’s bothering me. And frankly, the feeling of weakness. I haven't been able to keep much down today, either. Mostly just sips of water.
DOCTOR: Very well. I suppose we should perform a quick examination. Please, lie down on the examination table. I will need to listen to your abdomen and perform a brief rectal exam. I trust you understand the necessity of this, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Really? Look, Doc, with all due respect, I'm not thrilled about that. Is there absolutely no other way? I mean, I just told you what it looks like. Can't you just… prescribe something based on that? I'd rather not have someone poking around down there if it can be avoided. It feels… invasive.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, with all due respect, this is a medical examination, not a tea party. I am attempting to ascertain the source of your gastrointestinal bleeding. A rectal exam is standard procedure. Unless you wish to remain in a state of anxiety and uncertainty, I suggest you cooperate. I assure you, I am a professional. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And be quick, alright? This is undignified. You know, my wife always said I had a delicate constitution. She'd be horrified to see me like this. Just… try not to poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Please lie on your side with your knees drawn up. I will be as efficient as possible. Hmm. There is some dark, tarry stool present. Palpation reveals… no obvious masses, but there is some tenderness. Alright. Based on this preliminary examination, I suspect you may be experiencing a lower gastrointestinal bleed. However, this requires further investigation. I need to order a complete blood count and a stool sample for analysis.
PATIENT: A stool sample? More tests? Honestly, Doc, it's like you're deliberately trying to make this worse. Look, can’t you just give me something for the bleeding? Something to stop it? I don't have the energy for all this. And frankly, the thought of collecting a stool sample… it's just unpleasant. Is this going to be covered by… well, never mind. I don't even have insurance. How much is this going to cost me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your frustration, but I am attempting to diagnose the cause of your bleeding, not simply mask the symptom. A stool sample is necessary to rule out infection or other underlying conditions. As for the cost, the blood work will be approximately $150, and the stool analysis $80. I can provide you with a payment plan, though it will require an upfront deposit. Frankly, if this continues unchecked, you could become significantly anemic and require a transfusion, which, as you might imagine, is considerably more expensive. I’m going to write you a referral to a gastroenterologist. You need a colonoscopy to determine the source of the bleeding. It is the definitive diagnostic test.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Are you serious? Look, I’m not putting a camera up my backside. No way. Absolutely not. That sounds… barbaric. I’d rather just deal with the bleeding, honestly. I’ve lived a long life, alright? It’s not like I need to climb Mount Everest. What’s the worst that could happen? A bit of weakness? I’ll just… take it easy. No, I'm not having a colonoscopy. You can forget about that referral. And frankly, $230 for a few tests? That’s… that’s highway robbery. I think I’ll just go home and see if it gets better on its own. Thanks for nothing, Doc. Really. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, you are making a profoundly unwise decision. I cannot, in good conscience, simply allow you to leave without pursuing appropriate diagnostic testing. You are exhibiting signs of a potentially serious gastrointestinal bleed, and delaying treatment could have severe consequences. However, I respect your autonomy, to a degree. I will document your refusal of the colonoscopy and the referral to gastroenterology. I strongly advise you to reconsider. Here is a summary of our findings. Please monitor your symptoms closely and seek immediate medical care if you experience dizziness, lightheadedness, or worsening abdominal pain. Good day. And please, consider the well-being of your health. .
