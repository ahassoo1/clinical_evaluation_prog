DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Carlotta is fine. Um… my wife and I… we want a baby. She is… older now. I think we need to… make sure everything is okay? It’s been a long time since… before. I don't remember much about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s…ambitious, considering. Okay, Mr. Carlotta. Let's clarify a few things. You’re 70, and your wife is…older, as you said. When you say “make sure everything is okay,” are you concerned about your fertility specifically?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is right. Seventy. Time goes fast, eh? And my wife… she is… sixty-five, I think. Maybe sixty-six? I forget. Fertility… yes. Is that… possible? For me, I mean. It feels… a long time ago. I mostly just do little models now, metal and plastic. Not… baby making.
DOCTOR: Right. Sixty-five, sixty-six… Okay. Mr. Carlotta, let’s be frank. Male fertility does decline with age, significantly so. It's less about possible and more about… what the chances are. I’m going to need to ask some questions to get a better idea. Have you ever had any children previously?
PATIENT: No, no children. Never. Not with me, not with… anyone. My wife… she hasn’t either. We… we always waited for the right time, and then… time just kept going. But I am strong! I still work with my hands every day. Is that… good for things?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, manual dexterity is… generally positive, yes. But it doesn't directly correlate with sperm production, I’m afraid. Let’s move on. Have you experienced any changes in your libido recently?
PATIENT: Libido…? You mean… feeling? Like… wanting? Hmm. Not really. It’s… steady. Always steady. We… we still hold hands, you know? And we talk. But not… much more than that. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Carlotta. Changes in libido can be indicative of hormonal imbalances, which can affect fertility. Let’s try another question. Have you noticed any pain or swelling in your testicles?
PATIENT: Pain…? No, no pain. And no swelling. Everything… feels normal, I think. Old, but normal. My wife checks sometimes. She is very careful. She always asks if I feel okay.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that's…good to hear. Okay, Mr. Carlotta, to get a clearer picture, we're going to need to do a physical exam, and some lab work. Specifically, a semen analysis. That will tell us about your sperm count, motility, and morphology. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Semen… analysis? You mean… a sample? Oh. Um… yes, I think so. But… where? And… how? It’s been a very long time since… any of that. I hope it’s not too difficult.
DOCTOR: Yes, a sample. We have a private room here at the clinic for that purpose. The instructions are quite simple, and the staff will guide you. It's important to abstain from sexual activity for 2-5 days beforehand to ensure an accurate result. It is a crucial step, Mr. Carlotta. I'll have a nurse come in and explain the process in detail. In the meantime, I’m going to document your history and order the necessary labs. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. Not to cats or dogs. Sometimes my eyes get itchy in the spring, but that’s just… the pollen, I think. Nothing serious. And I am… careful with what I eat. My wife cooks very healthy food. No… peanuts, I don’t think. I mostly eat fish and vegetables. Oh! And sometimes I have a little bit of dark chocolate. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Dark chocolate is… fine, Mr. Carlotta. We’re looking for serious allergies, like reactions that would interfere with a potential procedure, should one be necessary. Okay. I’ll document “seasonal allergies, no known drug or food allergies.” One last thing for now. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications…? Let me think. Oh! Yes. Sometimes I take a little pill for my… water. My wife says I need it for my… prostate. It is small and blue. I think. She gives it to me every morning. I don’t remember the name, sorry. But it is just a little pill. Nothing big.
DOCTOR: Right. A small blue pill for your prostate… We’ll need to find out the exact name and dosage of that medication, Mr. Carlotta. It could be relevant. I’ll have the nurse bring you the paperwork for medication reconciliation. In the meantime, she’ll explain the semen analysis procedure, and we’ll get that scheduled. Honestly, given your age, and the fact you’ve never had children, I’m going to be upfront – the chances are… slim. But we need to gather all the information before we can discuss all your options. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Slim…? Oh. I see. My wife… she is very hopeful. She always is. Yes, I understand. Gather information… that is good. We just… we want to try. If there is even a little chance… We want to try. Please, just… help us understand. What does the nurse need to know? About the little blue pill? And… the sample?
DOCTOR: Right. The nurse will need the exact name of the medication – check the bottle, if possible. And she’ll provide detailed instructions for the semen analysis, including how to collect the sample, and where to drop it off. I'll send her in now. Please be as accurate as possible with the information you provide. And, frankly, be prepared for the possibility that assisted reproductive technologies, like IVF, might be the only option… if any option at all. .
PATIENT: Okay… I will try. My wife… she will check the bottle. She is very organized. Thank you, Doctor. .
