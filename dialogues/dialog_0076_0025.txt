DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie, good to meet you. Though, frankly, at your age, a lot of faces blur together. So, let’s get right to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. I want to… how you say… find out more about where my family come from. Long, long time ago. I hear you can do tests now, with… DNA? My daughter, she told me. She say it tell you what islands, what people. I want to know.
DOCTOR: DNA tests, right. Yes, I’ve heard… a lot about those. Look, Mr. Scobie, I’m an internal medicine doctor. I deal with your current health, not… ancestral tourism. It's a bit outside my purview, frankly. Are you experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, no symptoms. I feel okay. Old, but okay. I just… curious. My daughter, she always want to know everything. And she say this test, it can show you. Like a map, but for people. You don't do it here?
DOCTOR: Look, I understand your daughter is… enthusiastic. But this clinic focuses on treating illness. We don’t offer genealogical testing. It’s not a medical necessity. Perhaps a historian would be more helpful?
PATIENT: Historian? What… what kind of doctor is that? I thought you doctors, you know everything about people. About bodies, about… where we come from. So you really can’t do the test? Not even a little bit? My daughter said it's just a cheek swab. Easy.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, “knowing everything about people” is a rather… grandiose claim. I treat presenting complaints. A cheek swab doesn’t address a medical issue. It tells you where your ancestors may have been, which, again, is not within my area of expertise. Are you experiencing any pain, fatigue, changes in appetite, anything that’s bothering you?
PATIENT: No pain, no. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I’m old! I always tired. No change in appetite. I eat fish. Lots of fish. I just… I want to know. My islands… they small. Lots of people move away. I want to know where my family really from. Is there… someone else here who does this test? Maybe a nurse?
DOCTOR: Look, I've already explained this. We don't offer genealogical testing. It's not a service we provide. Frankly, it sounds like you’re wasting my time and the time of my staff. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh. I… I didn't mean to waste your time, Doctor. I just thought… maybe. I take… just one. For my water. The water makes my legs swell. Little white pill. My daughter gets it for me. I don't know the name. She keeps it in the… the orange bottle.
DOCTOR: A diuretic, likely. For edema. Fine. And are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Allergic? Hmm… I don’t think so. Maybe… maybe some kinds of fish make my tummy hurt. But not all fish! Just some. My daughter, she always tell me what fish I can eat. She worry about everything. I think I am okay, though. No bad allergies.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, since you're not presenting with any actual medical concerns, and we've established we don't offer the test you’re looking for… I suppose we can do a quick blood pressure check just to be thorough. But after that, I'm afraid I can't assist you further. Please sit up straight.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Blood pressure, yes. That’s good. I like when you check my blood pressure. It makes me feel… safer. Straight? Like this?
DOCTOR: Yes, like that. Relax, if you can. Though at your age, I suppose everything is a bit… rigid. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not alarming. Do you walk regularly?
PATIENT: Elevated? Is that bad, Doctor? I walk… to the store sometimes. Not far. My daughter, she says I should walk more. But it's hot. And the store… it takes a long time to walk back with the fish.
DOCTOR: It's not ideal. But at 85, perfect blood pressure isn't exactly the priority. We'll keep an eye on it. Look, Mr. Scobie, is there anything else at all bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, my knees. They ache when it rains. And sometimes I forget things. Like… what I was going to say. It’s not too bad, though. My daughter, she reminds me. She's very good at remembering things. No, I think… I think that’s all. Just the knees and the forgetting. Oh! And I still want to know about the test.
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, we’ve discussed this. I am not going to perform a DNA test for genealogical purposes. My time is valuable, and I have other patients who require actual medical attention. I recommend you consult a historian, or perhaps a genetic counselor specializing in family history. Now, if you'll excuse me... .
PATIENT: Oh… Oh, I see. You don't want to help me. My daughter will be sad. She really thought you could do it. Could you… could you write down the name of that doctor? The historian? Just in case.
