DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s lovely to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s about this… weakness. And this thing I’ve been doing. It’s embarrassing, really. I just feel… drained. Like a battery that’s been used all day. And I… well, I eat dirt. Yes, dirt. Don’t look at me like that. It helps, alright? It’s not like I want to, but… it makes me feel better, temporarily. I just want to know why I’m so tired all the time and why I crave… that.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Candis. It takes courage to talk about things that are difficult or feel embarrassing. I’m not going to judge you at all. We’re here to figure out what’s going on and get you feeling better. So, let’s break this down. You're experiencing significant fatigue – feeling drained like a battery – and you've also noticed a craving to eat dirt. Could you tell me a little more about when this fatigue started?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… Let me think. It wasn’t sudden, you know? It’s been… creeping up on me, I guess. Maybe… six months ago? No, longer. A year, maybe? It’s hard to say, really. I just remember getting tired easier. Used to be, I could go all day, cleaning, gardening… now, I need a nap just to get through the afternoon. And the… dirt thing started around the same time, I think. Maybe a little after the tiredness really set in. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I don’t pay attention to dates much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been a gradual onset of fatigue for about a year, with the dirt craving starting around the same time, perhaps slightly after. And it sounds like this fatigue is significantly impacting your daily activities – you’ve noticed you need naps and are finding it harder to do things you used to enjoy. Could you describe what this fatigue feels like, specifically?
PATIENT: Ugh, it's not just sleepy, you know? It's…heavy. Like there’s weights on my limbs. Even getting out of a chair takes effort. And it’s not just physical, it’s… mental too. I have trouble focusing, remembering things… little things. I used to be very sharp, but now… it’s like my brain is wading through mud. And it’s always there. Some days are worse than others, but it’s always there, dragging me down. It makes me irritable, too. Don't tell anyone I said that, though. I don't like being… difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand, Candis. It sounds incredibly debilitating – both physically and mentally. “Heavy limbs” and difficulty focusing are very helpful descriptions. And it’s perfectly alright to tell me anything you’re experiencing. It doesn’t make you difficult at all; it helps me understand what's going on. Now, let's talk about this craving for dirt. Where are you getting the dirt from?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… embarrassing. From the garden, mostly. I have a small vegetable patch. Just… little bits. I wash it, of course. I’m not completely foolish. But… sometimes, if I’m out walking, and there’s a patch of good-looking soil… well. It's mostly red clay, if that matters. It just… soothes something. I know it's awful. People eat chocolate, I eat dirt. Don't judge me.
DOCTOR: Candis, I absolutely am not judging you. As I mentioned before, it takes a lot of courage to share these things, and I appreciate your honesty. Knowing where you’re getting the dirt from – your garden and sometimes red clay while walking – is helpful information. This craving for non-food substances is called pica. It can sometimes be a sign of a nutritional deficiency. Now, I’d like to ask you a bit more about your overall diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Ugh, my diet. It’s… simple. I mostly cook for myself, you know? I eat a lot of vegetables from my garden when they’re in season, but… I don’t eat much meat. It doesn’t sit well. Fish, sometimes. And bread. I like bread. And tea. Lots and lots of tea. I don't really pay attention to… vitamins or anything like that. I always thought as long as you eat enough, you’re fine. Is that silly? I don't bother with fancy things.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not silly at all. It used to be thought that way! A lot of people believe that as long as you're eating, you should be getting enough. However, modern diets and soil conditions can lead to deficiencies even with adequate caloric intake. So, you primarily eat vegetables, some fish, bread, and tea. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Nothing major, really. I had my gallbladder taken out years ago… maybe twenty years? And arthritis in my hands. It doesn’t bother me too much, just a little stiffness in the mornings. I haven’t seen a doctor in… well, it’s been a while. Honestly, I avoid them if I can. They always want to give you pills for everything. I prefer to just deal with things myself. And I've never been good with remembering names or dates, so I probably missed something.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – about twenty years ago, and arthritis in your hands. And you haven’t seen a doctor regularly in a while. That’s good information to have. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Like I said, I don't like taking pills. I’ve tried a few things for the arthritis over the years, but nothing really helped, so I just stopped. I don't bother with vitamins, either. Waste of money, I think. I just drink my tea. Lots of tea. I have some ointment for my hands, but that’s it. Honestly, I’m very careful with what I put in my body. Except for… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, vitamins, or supplements, just the ointment for your hands. Now, have any family members been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my brother… he had something with his heart, years ago. He wasn’t very good about taking care of himself. That’s all I can really remember, honestly. We weren't a very close family, and nobody talked about… health things much. It was just… not done.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure in your mother and a heart condition in your brother. That's helpful information. Now, I’m going to ask about your social history. Do you currently smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. My mother smoked, and it was awful. Stank up the whole house. I can’t stand the smell of it. And I very rarely drink alcohol. A glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. I'm a very… simple person, you know? I don’t need those things. I get enough excitement gardening.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. So, no smoking and very limited alcohol consumption. Do you live alone, or do you have someone who lives with you?
PATIENT: I live alone. Always have, really. Never married, never had children. It's just me. I have a few neighbors I'm friendly with, and my niece calls sometimes, but… it's mostly just me. I manage perfectly well on my own, though. I'm very independent.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live alone and are very independent. Now, I’m going to ask you about any allergies you have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors, like pollen or animals?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, really. I mean, I get a little sniffly in the spring with all the pollen, but that’s just normal, isn’t it? I’ve never had any serious allergic reactions. I eat most things. I don't like shellfish, but that’s a preference, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, Candis, we’ve covered a lot of information, and I appreciate your honesty. Before I do a physical exam, I’d like to revisit the craving for dirt. To clarify, you're experiencing this urge consistently, and it provides you with some temporary relief, but it doesn’t last, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. It's not like I want to eat dirt, but… when I have it, it just… settles something. It’s hard to explain. Like a little weight has been lifted. But it doesn’t last long. An hour, maybe? Then the craving comes back, and the tiredness gets worse. And I know it’s silly, and probably unhealthy, but… it’s the only thing that helps, even if it’s just for a little while. Honestly, I’m embarrassed to even talk about it. People will think I'm crazy.
DOCTOR: Candis, you are not crazy. It’s understandable to feel embarrassed, but this is a very real symptom, and we’re going to try and figure out what’s causing it. You’ve described this craving and the temporary relief it provides very well. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam. I’ll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your abdomen. I’ll also take a look at your hands, given your arthritis. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try not to take too long, alright? I have some gardening I need to get back to. And please, don't mention the dirt to anyone. It’s… humiliating.
DOCTOR: Of course, Candis. Your privacy is very important to me. I will not discuss this with anyone without your explicit permission. And I’ll be as efficient as possible. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Just get it over with. I don't like doctors poking and prodding. It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm for me, Candis. Deep breath in… and out. Okay, that’s good. Your blood pressure is 148/92. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s check your pulse. Your pulse is 78 beats per minute, regular. And your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, also within normal limits. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll need you to take some deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackling. Everything sounds good so far. Now, could you please lie back on the examination table so I can examine your abdomen?
PATIENT: I don't know why you need to listen to my tummy. I just eat vegetables. And bread. It's not like I've been eating anything strange.
DOCTOR: I'm just checking for any tenderness or abnormalities, Candis. It's a routine part of the exam. Now, does this feel tender at all?
PATIENT: Ouch! A little. There… right there. It's not always sore, but it is now. I thought it was just gas, maybe. I have a sensitive stomach, you know? I blame the bread. But it’s not that bad, alright? Don’t make a fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Just a little tenderness in the lower abdomen. Now, I'm going to examine your hands. I noticed you mentioned arthritis. Can you open and close your hands for me, and show me the range of motion?
PATIENT: There. See? It’s stiff. Especially in the mornings. Makes it hard to garden sometimes. I've had it for years. Nothing anyone can do about it, really. Just a bit of aches and pains. I try not to complain.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some swelling and limited range of motion in the knuckles, consistent with arthritis. I also note some tenderness when I palpate these joints. Alright, Candis, that completes the physical exam. We’ve noted some elevated blood pressure, tenderness in your lower abdomen, and arthritis in your hands. Now, given your symptoms of fatigue, the craving for dirt – which is called pica – and the physical exam findings, I’d like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us check for any nutritional deficiencies, anemia, and other potential underlying causes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… Honestly? I hate needles. But… if you think it will help, alright. Just get it over with quickly, alright? And tell me what it all means, in plain English. None of that doctor talk. And if it's something serious… well, I don't even want to know.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Candis. I will do my best to make it as quick and comfortable as possible, and I absolutely promise to explain the results in plain English. No doctor talk, I assure you. And we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Okay, I'm ordering a complete blood count – that checks for anemia and other blood disorders – an iron panel – to check your iron levels – a vitamin D level – and a comprehensive metabolic panel – which gives us a broad overview of your kidney and liver function, and your electrolytes. It will also include a test for lead levels, given the pica. We'll need to draw a small sample of blood. The lab is just down the hall. Do you have any questions before we go?
PATIENT: Lead levels? From the dirt? Oh, goodness. That sounds awful. Is that… common? I feel terrible now. I shouldn’t have told you about any of this. You’re going to think I’m a complete fool.
DOCTOR: Candis, please don’t feel terrible. You’re not a fool, and I am absolutely not judging you. It's very common to be concerned about lead levels when there’s a history of pica, especially involving soil. The tests are just a precaution to rule out any potential exposure. Soil can sometimes contain trace amounts of lead, depending on the location and past environmental factors. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve been exposed, but it’s important to check. It’s good that you told me, as it helps me provide the best possible care. Now, let’s go get these tests done, and then we can discuss the results and come up with a plan. The phlebotomist, the person who draws the blood, is very experienced and gentle. Would you like me to accompany you to the lab?
PATIENT: Yes… please. I don’t like going to these things alone. It makes me nervous. And… if there is something wrong… I don’t want to hear it from just anyone.
DOCTOR: Of course, Candis. I'm happy to go with you. Let’s head down to the lab now. It will only take a few minutes. They'll have you fill out some basic paperwork first, and then the phlebotomist will take it from there. Try to relax, and remember to take some deep breaths. We’ll get through this together.
PATIENT: I just hope it doesn’t hurt too much. I’ve always been faint, you know? And the thought of someone poking around in my veins… it makes me dizzy.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Candis. It's perfectly normal to feel nervous about getting blood drawn. The phlebotomist is very skilled at minimizing discomfort. They use a small needle and are very gentle. If you feel faint at any time, just tell them immediately, and they will have you lie down. They also have comfortable chairs and offer juice or water to help keep your blood sugar up. We can sit down for a few minutes beforehand if you’d like, and take some deep breaths to relax. Just let me know what makes you feel more comfortable, and we’ll do it. And remember, I'm right here with you, every step of the way.
PATIENT: Alright. Sitting down sounds… good. And the juice. Maybe that will help. I just don’t like needles, alright? Never have. They give me the shivers.
DOCTOR: Of course. That’s perfectly alright. There’s no shame in being afraid of needles. Many people feel the same way. I'll go get you some juice while we wait. What flavor would you like?
PATIENT: Orange, I guess. It’s alright. As long as it’s not too cold. And… thank you. For being patient with me. I’m probably being a nuisance.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely not a nuisance, Candis. It's my job to make you feel comfortable and safe, and I'm happy to do whatever it takes. Here you go. Not too cold, I promise. Sip it slowly, and take some deep breaths. Now, do you have any questions about the blood tests themselves?
PATIENT: Just… how long will it take? And will it hurt a lot? And… what if they find something bad? I don’t want to know, really. It’s probably just nothing. Old age, you know? Things just start to fall apart.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Candis. The blood draw itself usually only takes a few minutes. You might feel a brief pinch when the needle goes in, but it shouldn't hurt much. Afterward, there might be a little bit of soreness, but that usually goes away quickly. As for what the tests might show, it's important to remember that we don't know anything yet. It's possible that everything will be perfectly normal. And if something is off, it doesn't necessarily mean it's serious. Many things can cause minor abnormalities, and we can address them if needed. We'll take it one step at a time. First, we'll get the blood tests done. Then, we'll review the results together, and I'll explain them to you in plain English. And if anything needs to be addressed, we'll come up with a plan together. I won’t push you to know anything you're not comfortable with. It looks like the phlebotomist is ready for us. Are you feeling a little bit calmer?
PATIENT: I think so. A little. It’s just… it’s all so unsettling. Old ladies aren’t supposed to eat dirt, alright? And they certainly aren’t supposed to have their blood poked and prodded. Alright. Let’s get it over with. But… you’ll stay with me, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Candis. I'll be right here with you, every step of the way. Here we are. This is Sarah, the phlebotomist. She's very skilled and gentle. Sarah, this is Candis. She’s a little nervous about getting her blood drawn. Sarah will explain everything to you, Candis. Just let me know if you need anything at all. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: Alright… Just… be quick, alright? And… don't poke too hard.
DOCTOR: Of course, dear. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I'm going to tie a small tourniquet around your arm to make your veins easier to find, and then I'll clean the area with an alcohol swab. You might feel a brief pinch when the needle goes in, but it shouldn't hurt much. Just relax your arm for me, and take a few deep breaths. I'll let you know when I'm finished. You're doing great, Candis. Just take a few deep breaths. Everything is going to be alright.
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. Please. I hate needles… I really do.
DOCTOR: Okay, dear. I'm going to insert the needle now. It's just a little pinch. Deep breaths... you're doing wonderfully. You’re doing great, Candis. Just focus on your breathing. In and out… nice and slow. It’s almost over. You’re very brave.
PATIENT: …hurry… please…
DOCTOR: Almost done, dear. Just a few more seconds. You’re doing wonderfully. Just a few more seconds, Candis. You’re very brave. Take another deep breath. In… and out… almost there… All done, dear. You did wonderfully! Just apply a little pressure to the bandage for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. You did it, Candis! You were very brave. Are you feeling alright?
PATIENT: …It’s… over? …Finally… I think… I need to sit down. And maybe some water. My head is spinning.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s over. You did wonderfully, Candis. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little shaky and lightheaded after getting blood drawn. Here, drink this slowly. It will help you feel better. Just take a few deep breaths and relax. I'm right here with you. Now, the lab will send the results to me in a few days. I’ll review them carefully and call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… not right now. I just… want to go home. And forget all about this. It was… awful. I’m probably going to have a headache all day. And I'll probably dream about needles. Thank you… for staying with me. I don’t know what I would have done without you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Candis. I was happy to be here with you. And you absolutely don’t have to worry about needles again for a long time. I'll help you get home, and you can rest. Just take it easy and try not to overthink things. If you do start to feel unwell, don't hesitate to call me. Let’s get you home now. I’ll make sure you’re comfortable and safe. And remember, you were very brave today.
PATIENT: Thank you… you’re a very kind doctor. I haven't been treated so kindly in… a long time. Alright. Let’s go home. And maybe I’ll have a cup of tea. And forget all about dirt and needles.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Candis. It was my pleasure. And a cup of tea sounds like a wonderful idea. Just remember to take it easy, and if you need anything at all, don’t hesitate to call. Goodbye, Candis. Take care.
