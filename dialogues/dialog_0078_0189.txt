DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it's about my… well, my business. It's not something a man likes to talk about, naturally. But I noticed some…red in the bowl, if you catch my drift. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to be concerning. I haven't had anything like that in…oh, decades, probably. And at my age, things are supposed to be settling, not…this.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Rowbottom. It's perfectly natural to feel uncomfortable discussing these things, and you've done the right thing by coming in to get it checked. We’re here to help, and I assure you, this is a common concern, especially as we get older. So, just to clarify, you've noticed some blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Blood. Not like a gushing wound, you understand. More like…streaks. And it's happened…oh, twice now. A couple of mornings in a row. I eat pretty regular, mostly. Steak, potatoes…good solid food. Not like this newfangled stuff they’re selling these days. Makes a man weak, that stuff. But I digress. The point is, I'm not one to bother doctors for nothing. Something's gotta be wrong if I'm noticing it.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s good you’re paying attention to changes in your body. Seeing blood in the stool, even streaks, is something we need to investigate. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you describe the color of the blood?
PATIENT: Color? Honestly, I don't spend a lot of time analyzing my…leavings. It was red. Like, you know, red. Not pale, not black. Just…red. Brightish, maybe? Is there a specific shade I'm supposed to be looking for? This is ridiculous. A man shouldn't have to be a paint expert to describe his own…well, you know. And it wasn't a huge amount, I keep telling you. A few streaks here and there. Is it serious? Because I have a fishing trip planned next month. A very important fishing trip.
DOCTOR: You're right to feel that way, Mr. Rowbottom. It's not necessary to be a paint expert! I just ask because the color can give us clues. Bright red usually indicates bleeding closer to the end of the digestive tract, while darker shades can mean it's coming from higher up. It's good to know it was bright red. And yes, I understand your concern about your fishing trip – we’ll certainly keep that in mind. Now, besides the blood, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Habits? Well, I've always been regular. Morning, after coffee. That hasn't changed. As for…other changes. Hmm. Let me think. It feels…normal, mostly. Not strained or anything. Not…loose. Solid. Like it should be. Maybe a little…thinner, perhaps? But that could be the heat. It's been awfully warm lately. And I haven’t been drinking as much water as I should. Old habits, you know. Now, are you going to ask me about what I eat again? Because I told you, I eat good solid food.
DOCTOR: No, I won’t ask about your diet again, Mr. Rowbottom. It sounds like you have a pretty consistent routine, which is good. You mentioned it might be a little thinner than usual. Has that been happening at the same time as the blood, or is that a separate issue?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it…yes, I suppose it has. The thinner stools and the…red streaks, both started around the same time. A few days ago, like I said. It's all a bit unsettling, honestly. A man likes his routines, you know? Everything in its place. And this…this is throwing things off. Do you think it's serious? Because I really don’t want to miss that fishing trip. Old Man Hemlock has the best spot, and I’ve been waiting for this for months.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Rowbottom, and I want to assure you we'll get to the bottom of this. It’s good you’ve noticed these changes happening together - that is helpful information. Given your age and the presence of blood, it's important we investigate this further. While it could be something minor, it's also important to rule out anything more serious. To do that, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, including listening to your abdomen and a rectal exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A…a rectal exam? Now hold on just a minute. I'm eighty-eight years old, Doctor. I’ve had plenty of doctors poke and prod over the years. And frankly, I don't see the need for that. I told you what's going on. Red streaks, thinner stools…it's probably just something I ate. Or the heat. You don't need to…examine me down there. It's undignified. Really, Doctor. I’d prefer you just give me something for my stomach and let me be on my way. I have a fishing trip to plan, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Rowbottom, and I absolutely respect your wishes. I certainly wouldn’t want to do anything you’re not comfortable with. However, a rectal exam is a very important part of evaluating the cause of bleeding in the stool, especially at your age. It allows me to check for any abnormalities and rule out more serious conditions like polyps or tumors. It’s a quick exam, and I will explain everything as I go. I want to assure you, my priority is your health and wellbeing. But if you are truly against it, we can discuss alternative testing options, such as a stool test to check for blood, but that would likely require further investigation if it comes back positive. Would you like to consider that?
PATIENT: A stool test… hmm. Well, that sounds…less intrusive, I suppose. Better than having someone poke around down there. But will it really tell you anything? I mean, I’m not a medical man. I just want to know if I can go on my fishing trip. And if it comes back positive…what then? More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, this is all a bit of a bother. But…alright. Fine. Let’s do the stool test. But if it leads to anything unpleasant, I’m holding you responsible. And I expect a full explanation of everything, in plain English. None of that doctor talk. Do you have the…the container? And how long will it take to get the results? My trip is in a month, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Rowbottom, and I promise to explain everything in plain English. A stool test is a good first step, and it can often give us valuable information. It’s a non-invasive way to check for hidden blood in your stool. Yes, I have the container right here. I’ll explain the instructions briefly. You’ll need to collect a small sample of your stool – I’ll show you how to do it properly. The lab usually takes about 5-7 business days to get the results back. We can certainly expedite the process if needed, given your trip. If the test comes back positive, we will discuss the next steps, which might include further testing, like a colonoscopy, to get a better look at your colon. Do you have any questions about the collection process, or anything else?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Now you’re just trying to scare me. Alright, alright. I get it. This is serious. But I still think it’s probably just something I ate. As for the collection process…yes, actually. How much do I need? And…is there anything special I need to do beforehand? I mean, do I need to avoid certain foods? Or…anything? I really don't want to mess this up. And what if I can’t…produce anything? It’s an embarrassing question, I know. But I’m eighty-eight years old, things don’t always work the way they used to.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask questions, Mr. Rowbottom, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about this. I’m not trying to scare you, just preparing you for all possibilities. You only need a small amount – about the size of a walnut is sufficient. And yes, there are a few things you should avoid beforehand. For the three days leading up to the test, please avoid red meat, pork, poultry, and any foods dyed red. Also, please avoid certain medications like iron supplements and aspirin, unless specifically directed by your doctor. A full list of instructions is included with the container. As for not being able to…produce anything, that’s a valid concern. If you're having trouble, try increasing your fluid intake and eating foods high in fiber. If you're still having difficulty, please let me know, and we can discuss other options. We can also schedule the test for a day when you are more likely to have a bowel movement. Don’t worry, it's not uncommon. I'm going to print out a detailed list of instructions for you, along with a form to fill out regarding your medical history and medications. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just…plain English, remember? None of that medical jargon. And try not to scare me too much. I still want to go on my fishing trip. Old Man Hemlock’s spot is the best, you know. Alright. Let's get this over with. And thank you, Doctor. For not laughing at me, at least. It's been a long morning. And I'm an old man. A very old man.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Rowbottom. I assure you, I have absolutely no intention of laughing at you. You've been very brave coming in to get this checked, and I commend you for that. And I promise to keep the explanations in plain English – no jargon at all. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible, and we’ll discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I truly hope you get to enjoy your fishing trip. Old Man Hemlock’s spot sounds wonderful. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ll just step out for a moment to prepare the paperwork for the lab. We’ll be in touch soon.
PATIENT: .
