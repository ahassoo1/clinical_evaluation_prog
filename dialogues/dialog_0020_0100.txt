DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Beinborn, is it? Yes… right. Well, it’s about a test, I think. Something to do with… checking things. My insurance, Medicare, they wanted me to get it done. Something about… making sure everything’s okay. Honestly, it’s all a bit fuzzy. I get things mixed up these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright, Ms. Hughston. It’s very common to feel overwhelmed with medical things. We can take our time and figure it out. Do you recall what kind of test it was they asked you to get?
PATIENT: Hmm… a test… Was it a blood test? Or… maybe something to do with… well, I drive a lot for work, you see. Big machines, paving and all that. So maybe it’s… checking for that? I honestly can't quite remember what the lady on the phone said. It was a few days ago now. It’s all a bit of a blur, really. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it might be a DOT physical, required for commercial drivers. Those do involve a few different tests. It’s good that Medicare is on top of it, making sure everything is safe. To clarify, are you a commercial driver?
PATIENT: A commercial driver… yes, that sounds right! I operate the paving equipment, the rollers and… the tampers. Big things, like I said. It's been… a while now, honestly. Since my husband… well, never mind. But yes, I drive them. Do I need to bring something with me? Like a license or something? I didn't think about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that helps a lot. Yes, for a DOT physical, we do need to see your medical examiner’s certificate and your current medical card if you have one. And your driver's license, of course. Let me just quickly check the system to see if anything was pre-authorized or if there are any notes from Medicare regarding this visit. Just one moment. …Okay, it looks like Medicare did send a referral for a DOT physical. Do you have those documents with you today, Ms. Hughston?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Documents… I… I don’t think so. I just came as they told me. I didn’t really think about bringing anything. Honestly, I get so flustered easily these days. Everything just… slips my mind. I suppose I could call someone to bring them? My niece, maybe? Would that be alright?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Hughston. Don’t worry about it. We can certainly work with that. Your niece bringing them in later would be fine. It might slightly delay things, but it’s not a problem. In the meantime, let's go ahead and start with a basic review of your medical history. It helps me get a better picture of your overall health. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… medical conditions… Let me think. My husband used to say I worried too much, which probably wasn’t good for my blood pressure, come to think of it. The doctor mentioned it once, years ago. High blood pressure… yes, that sounds familiar. Nothing else, though. I’ve always been fairly… robust. Just a little forgetful now, I suppose. And a bit achy in the mornings, but who isn’t, at my age?
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past is good to know. And it’s common to feel a little achy as we get older. Do you take any medications currently, Ms. Hughston?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just a little pill, white one, for the blood pressure. It’s… Lisinopril, I think? Or something similar. I’ve been taking it for… well, quite a while now. My husband always made sure I had it, and now I just… keep getting it refilled. And sometimes, if my knees are really bothering me, I take some ibuprofen. Over-the-counter, you know? Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Oh, goodness. Let me think… I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little itchy sometimes if I eat shellfish, but it's not a full-blown allergy, just a bit of… discomfort. Nothing serious enough to bother a doctor with, I thought.
DOCTOR: Alright, a mild reaction to shellfish, noted. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Oh! Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a little girl. A long, long time ago. And… and I was in the hospital for a few days after I broke my wrist. Fell off a horse, you see. A very silly accident. But that was years and years ago. Nothing else, I don't think. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child and a broken wrist. Good to know. Now, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That’s a tough one. My mother… she had heart trouble, I think. And my father… he had… something with his lungs, maybe? They both smoked, you see. Terrible habit. And my sister… she had diabetes. Yes, definitely diabetes. But other than that, I don't really… remember much about their health. It was a long time ago, and we didn't really talk about such things much.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble in your mother, lung issues in your father, and diabetes in your sister. That's helpful information. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Oh. Well, as you can see, I work. Driving the paving equipment, like I said. It keeps me busy. I'm… widowed. My husband passed away a few years back. We didn’t have any children. And… I don’t really… go out much anymore. It’s mostly just work, and then home. A quiet life, I suppose. I don’t drink or smoke, never have.
DOCTOR: Okay, widowed, commercial driver, no children, non-smoker, and no alcohol use. Alright, Ms. Hughston, that gives me a good starting point. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and just do a general assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. It’s all a bit… overwhelming, but I suppose it has to be done. I'll just sit here, won’t I? And try to remember to breathe.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear, I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are normal, range of motion is slightly limited in both knees. Okay, Ms. Hughston, everything seems generally okay, but your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your knees are a bit stiff. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Now, do you have any specific concerns or anything else you’d like to discuss before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh. Elevated blood pressure… that doesn't surprise me. I worry a lot, you see. And my knees… well, they’ve been bothering me for years. Just a bit achy, especially in the mornings. It’s probably just old age, really. Nothing to worry about. I suppose… I have been feeling a bit tired lately. More tired than usual. And a little… forgetful, if you haven’t noticed! But I just thought it was… part of getting older. Is that what happens? Do you think it’s anything serious?
DOCTOR: It's good you're bringing these things up, Ms. Hughston. Fatigue and increased forgetfulness can be part of getting older, but it's important to rule out other potential causes. The slightly elevated blood pressure and the fatigue combined do warrant further investigation. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work. This will help us check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and overall health. We can also do a urine test to check your kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… urine test… Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, alright. I trust your judgment. Just… will it hurt? And how long will it take? I have work, you see. I can’t be away for too long. I have to operate the paving machine. It’s a big responsibility.
DOCTOR: No, it won't hurt at all, Ms. Hughston. The blood work is just a small sample taken from your arm. It’s a quick prick, and then it’s done. The urine test is just collecting a sample in a cup. Very simple. The lab is right down the hall. It shouldn’t take more than 30-45 minutes total, including the wait time. We can get you in and out quickly. Let me print out the lab order for you. And then the nurse will come in and draw the blood and collect the urine sample. While you’re waiting, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Thirty minutes… alright. That’s manageable. The nurse will come in… Yes, alright. Just… what are you looking for, exactly? In the blood work and the urine? What kind of things could be wrong? I don’t want to worry needlessly, you see. I just want to know if everything is… okay.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Ms. Hughston. We're looking for a number of things. The blood work will help us rule out things like anemia, thyroid problems, vitamin deficiencies, and any signs of inflammation or infection. It'll also give us a baseline to compare future results to. The urine test checks your kidney function and can detect any signs of infection or other problems. We're not necessarily looking for something wrong – often, these tests are just preventative measures. But it’s important to have a complete picture of your health, especially given your fatigue and recent forgetfulness. Here’s the order. The nurse will be in shortly. Please let her know if you have any questions. And feel free to ask me anything when I return. In the meantime, try to relax. We'll get this sorted out.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. I understand. Preventative measures… That’s good. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. Thank you, Doctor Beinborn. I appreciate your patience. And your… explanations. It helps to know what's going on. I'll… I'll go find the nurse.
