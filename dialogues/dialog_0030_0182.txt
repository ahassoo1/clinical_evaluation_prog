DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, I suppose it is nice to meet you. Though I don’t have all day, you understand. My… well, the paperwork said “clearance” for something. A face lift, if I recall correctly. Doctor recommended it, said I was a good candidate. Frankly, I just want to get it over with. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Orwin. Yes, we do have a pre-operative clearance request here for an elective facelift. I understand you're hoping to proceed quickly, and I'll do my best to be efficient. However, to ensure your safety and a successful procedure, I need to gather some information first. It’s standard procedure. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? Hmph. Well, I’m 81 years old, for starters. What do you expect? I get a little… stiff in the mornings, and my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, as you can plainly see. I used to be strong as an ox, working with terrazzo, but that was decades ago. I don’t get sick much, haven't had the flu in… well, I don’t remember. Is that good enough? Do I need to list every ache and pain? Because I assure you, there are plenty.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Orwin. Knowing your general activity level and any chronic discomfort is important. You mentioned stiffness and vision changes, and that’s good to know. We’ll document those. Just to be thorough, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… the doctor mentioned something about that years ago. Said I needed to watch my salt intake. I mostly ignore him. Diabetes? No. Heart problems… well, my heart feels fine. Look, I’ve lived a long life, I’ve been to doctors plenty of times. They always want to know about something. I’ve never been seriously ill. Nothing that kept me from working, anyway. Is this going to take much longer? I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Mr. Orwin. We'll try to be as brief as possible. Knowing about the potential history of high blood pressure is important, even if you don't actively manage it. It can affect how we approach anesthesia and the procedure itself. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… Years ago, I had my appendix out. That was when I was a young man, before your time, I imagine. And… oh, I had a hernia fixed. Something about lifting heavy stone, naturally. That was quite a while ago, too. Nothing recent. And definitely nothing on my face! Is that all? Really, this feels like a lot of unnecessary questioning.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Orwin. That's helpful. Knowing about previous surgeries helps us anticipate any potential complications. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications… Well, let’s see. I take a little something for my arthritis in the mornings, helps with the stiffness. A small white pill. And… oh, yes, a blood thinner. Doctor put me on that a few years back, after a… well, after a little stumble. Can't remember the names of either one, to be honest. I just take them. My daughter sorts it all out for me, mostly. She’s a very organized woman, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. It’s good that you have support with your medications. Knowing what you're taking, even if we can’t get the exact names right now, is very important. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. No, not that I know of. I eat everything put in front of me. Always have. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife used to try all sorts of exotic foods. I’d eat it all, just to be polite. Never a problem. Honestly, I think people make a fuss about allergies these days. It's all…newfangled. Are we almost finished? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. That's good to know. Just a few more questions, and then we'll do a brief physical exam. Could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. Well, my father lived to be 92, strong as an ox, like I said. Mother… she didn’t live as long. Something about her heart, I think. Both sides of the family, mostly healthy. Lots of farmers and builders. Strong stock, you could say. No one particularly prone to… well, to anything serious. Is this important? It feels like you're fishing for something.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Mr. Orwin. Knowing about family history can sometimes give us clues. And finally, do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational drugs? Good heavens, no! I am 81 years old, not some… hooligan. I used to enjoy a glass of schnapps with dinner, back in the old days, but I haven't touched a drop in years. Not since my wife passed. And I never smoked a day in my life. Absolutely not. It’s terrible for you, you know. A waste of good money. Can we please get this over with? My luncheon…
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. Thank you for your patience. Just a quick physical exam now, to check your heart and lungs, and ensure you’re otherwise in good health for the procedure. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and just take your blood pressure. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is 140/85. That's slightly elevated, but not critically high. I will document that. Do you feel any pain anywhere at the moment?
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? See, I knew it. They always find something. No, no pain, not exactly. Just the usual aches and creaks. My knees bother me when the weather is bad. And sometimes my shoulder feels a bit stiff. Nothing worth mentioning, really. I’ve lived a long life, I told you. A few aches and pains come with the territory. Are we finished now? I really must be going. My luncheon reservation…
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Orwin, we are finished with the initial assessment. Based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, you appear to be a reasonable candidate for the facelift, but your slightly elevated blood pressure will need to be monitored. I recommend you continue with your current medications, and I'll write a note to your primary care physician regarding your blood pressure. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude?
PATIENT: Questions? No, not really. You've taken down everything I've said, probably more than I remember myself. Honestly, I just want to get this over with. I’m trusting you to do a good job. And please, don’t keep me waiting too long. I have a life, you know. Luncheon, as I’ve mentioned. Can I just get a form signed, or whatever needs to be done? Let’s get this moving.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. I completely understand. I'll have the pre-operative consent form ready for you to sign, and the scheduling department will contact you to arrange a date for the procedure. Here is the form. Please read it over carefully, and let me know if you have any questions. Thank you for your patience, and we look forward to seeing you soon. Have a pleasant luncheon.
