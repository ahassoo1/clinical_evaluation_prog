DOCTOR: Talofa, Jaylyne. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Vinaka, Dr. Octavis. Uh, it's this ringing in my ears. It's been happening for a little while now, and it's… annoying, to say the least. I just want to figure out what’s going on, if that’s okay? I’d like to get it sorted if possible, I have work and everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, ringing in the ears. That’s also called tinnitus. It’s good you’re getting it checked out. “Annoying” is a perfectly valid way to describe it – it can be very disruptive. And yes, we'll definitely try to figure out what’s going on and how to help. To start, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s… hard to explain. It's not constant, you know? Sometimes it's really loud, like a high-pitched whine, other times it’s just a faint buzzing. It seems to get worse when it’s quiet, like at night when I’m trying to sleep. Does that make sense? And it’s in both ears, I think. Or maybe just feels like it. It’s hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Intermittent tinnitus, varying in intensity, worse with quiet… and bilateral, or at least perceived that way. It's common for people to describe it that way, especially when it's fluctuating. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… maybe about three months ago? It started after a really loud wedding party, my cousin's. There was a lot of music and people yelling, it was pretty hectic. I didn't think much of it at the time, just figured my ears were a bit sore, but then the ringing just… stayed. I kinda hoped it would go away on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months ago, onset after a loud event – a wedding party. That's important information. It’s not uncommon for loud noises to trigger tinnitus. And it's good you're bringing it up now, even though it hasn't resolved on its own. Besides the noise exposure at the wedding, have you been exposed to any other loud noises recently, or consistently?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I work as a waiter, so there's some background noise at the restaurant, but nothing crazy loud. Just the usual chatter and clinking glasses. Nothing like a wedding with a full band, definitely. And I don’t really do anything else that would put my ears at risk, if that makes sense. I don’t go to concerts or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant noise exposure outside of your work as a waiter. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about other symptoms. Have you noticed any hearing loss, dizziness, or a feeling of fullness in your ears?
PATIENT: Umm… I haven’t really noticed any hearing loss, no. I can still hear everything fine, as far as I can tell. Sometimes my ears feel a bit… blocked, I guess, but it's not constant. And no dizziness, thankfully. Just the ringing. It’s mostly just annoying, but it does make it hard to concentrate sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no hearing loss, intermittent feeling of fullness, no dizziness. Primarily tinnitus, impacting concentration. Alright. And just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about any medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Okay, um… let me think. I had the flu last year, but that’s it, really. Nothing major. I do have high blood pressure, but it’s managed with medication. And… I was divorced a couple of years ago, if that matters? I don’t really have any other health problems that I know of. I have private insurance, if you need to check anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. No, the divorce doesn’t directly matter, but I appreciate you being open. High blood pressure, managed with medication, is important information. Can you tell me what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s… Lisinopril, I think? That’s what the bottle says. 20mg, once a day. I’ve been taking it for about three years now, and it seems to be keeping everything under control. My doctor checks it regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily, well-controlled. Good. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope, just the Lisinopril. Nothing else. I don't really believe in taking a lot of pills if I don’t need them, to be honest. Just try to eat healthy and get enough sleep, that's my approach. Though the ringing isn't helping with the sleep part, obviously.
DOCTOR: That’s a sensible approach. Okay, no other medications, vitamins or supplements. Now, let’s quickly go over any allergies you have. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medication before. My family all have allergies, but I seem to have missed out on that particular gene.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies. Okay, Jaylyne, thanks for answering all those questions. That gives me a really good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, including an examination of your ears, to get a better look. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what’s causing this ringing. Hopefully, it's nothing serious. The sooner we can find out, the better. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll start with your ears. I’m going to look inside to check for any blockage, inflammation, or other abnormalities. It might be a little uncomfortable for a second, but it shouldn’t hurt. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs quickly, just to get a baseline. Okay, I’m looking at your left ear now… Everything looks clear. No sign of blockage or inflammation. Now, let’s look at your right ear… Also clear. Your ear canals look healthy. Heart sounds are regular, and lungs are clear. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is well controlled. Based on the examination, there’s no obvious physical cause for the tinnitus. This suggests it might be related to the noise exposure at the wedding, or potentially other factors. Do you have any family history of hearing issues?
PATIENT: Vinaka. Okay, good to hear everything looks clear. I guess that’s… something. Family history… Hmm. My grandmother on my mother's side was a bit hard of hearing in her later years, but I don’t think it was anything major. She just used to turn the TV up really loud. And my uncle, he works on construction sites, so he probably has some hearing loss, but he never really talked about it. Nothing obvious, though, if that makes sense. No one with constant ringing like me.
DOCTOR: Okay, some family history of hearing loss, but no specific history of tinnitus. That’s helpful to know. Given your history and the physical exam findings, the most likely cause of your tinnitus is noise-induced hearing loss, even though you haven’t noticed any significant hearing loss yet. Sometimes tinnitus can be an early symptom, before any measurable hearing loss is detected. It can also be caused by other factors, such as stress, medications, or underlying medical conditions, but these are less likely in your case. To be sure, I’d like to order a hearing test, also known as an audiogram. This will measure your hearing sensitivity at different frequencies and help us determine if there’s any underlying hearing loss. It's a painless test, and it will give us more information to guide our treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A hearing test sounds good. If it helps figure out what’s going on, then yes, definitely. I just want to get it sorted. I’m getting pretty tired of the buzzing, to be honest. How long does it take, and where do we do it? Hopefully, it doesn’t take too long. I have work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. The hearing test usually takes about 30-45 minutes. We can do it right here in the clinic, in the soundproof booth. It’s a relatively quick process. We can schedule it for tomorrow morning, before your work shift, if that works for you. I will also write you a note for work, explaining that you had a medical appointment. While we’re waiting for the results of the hearing test, there are some things you can do to manage your tinnitus. Avoiding loud noises is important, of course. I would also recommend trying relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation, to reduce stress. Sometimes, tinnitus can be worsened by stress and anxiety. Would you like me to provide you with some resources on relaxation techniques?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Anything that might help. And a note for work would be great, thank you. I don’t want them thinking I’m just making it up. I do try to avoid loud noises when I can, but it's hard sometimes at the restaurant. Relaxation techniques… I’ve tried a bit of deep breathing before, but I never really stuck with it. Maybe I should give it another go. Anything you recommend specifically? I’m pretty stressed out with everything, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Stress can definitely worsen tinnitus. I’ll write you a note for work explaining your appointment. I'll print out some information on progressive muscle relaxation and guided meditation. Both of these techniques can be very effective in reducing stress and anxiety. There are also some helpful apps available, such as Headspace and Calm, that can guide you through meditation exercises. I can email you links to those as well. In the meantime, it’s important to remember that tinnitus is very common, and there are many effective ways to manage it. Even if we can’t completely eliminate it, we can certainly reduce its impact on your life. Do you have any other questions for me at this point, before we schedule your hearing test?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. The hearing test sounds good, and the relaxation techniques are a good idea. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Dr. Octavis. It makes me feel a bit better knowing there are things we can try. Let's get the test scheduled, and hopefully, we can figure out what’s going on. I’d like to get this sorted as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaylyne. I’m glad I could help. Let me just check my schedule… Okay, how does 10:00 AM tomorrow sound?
PATIENT: 10:00 AM is perfect. Thank you so much, Dr. Octavis. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. 10:00 AM it is. I’ll have the receptionist schedule that for you. I'll also print out the resources on relaxation techniques now. Here you go. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And remember, we’ll work through this together. Thank you for coming in today. I look forward to seeing you tomorrow. Have a good evening, and try to get some rest.
