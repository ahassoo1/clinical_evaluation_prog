DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. And the pleasure is all mine. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been getting. Right at the back of my head, you know? Been botherin’ me for a little while now. Not terrible, but enough to make a fella notice.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head. And you said it’s been bothering you for a little while… could you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It started… oh, maybe a month ago? Started kinda slow, just a little ache now and then. Didn't pay it much mind at first, thought it was just from bendin’ over too much at work, you know, doin’ nails all day. But it's been more consistent lately. Happens almost every day now, if I remember correctly. It’s not a throbbing pain, more like a… a dull pressure, really.
DOCTOR: A dull pressure, happening almost daily for about a month. That's helpful. And you mentioned doing nails all day for work – does anything specifically seem to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Well now, that’s a good question. Bendin' over does seem to make it a bit worse, like I said. But even when I'm sittin' still, it can come on. Sometimes it feels a little bit stiff in my neck too, when it's bad. I've been tryin' to stretch, but it don't seem to be helpin' much. It's hard to say exactly what sets it off, though. Sometimes it just… is there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's aggravated by bending, but can occur even when resting, and is sometimes accompanied by neck stiffness. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Let me see… no dizziness, no blurry vision, nothin' like that. No nausea either, thankfully. I haven't felt any fever or anything. Sometimes, if I’m really concentratin’ at work, my eyes get a little tired, but that’s nothin’ new. I work with tiny things all day, you know? It's mostly just the headache and the neck stiffness. Oh! And sometimes my hands feel a little numb, but that’s from all the filin’ and polishin’, I reckon. Not related to the head, I don't think.
DOCTOR: No dizziness, blurry vision, nausea, or fever. Eye fatigue with concentration, and hand numbness from work, which you don't think are related. That’s good to know. Now, thinking a little broader, have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Hmm, appetite's been normal, I think. My wife, Delores, does most of the cookin', so I don't always pay attention. She hasn’t said anything about me eatin’ less or more. As for weight... well, I’ve always been a skinny fella. Haven't noticed any changes there either. I reckon I'm about the same as always. 54 kilos, if you must know. I try to stay active, even if it's just walkin' to the shop.
DOCTOR: Okay, appetite and weight stable. That’s good. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. Never been much of a sickly man, thankfully. I had the usual childhood things, measles and such, but nothin' serious. Delores takes me to the doctor for check-ups every couple of years, just to make sure everything's alright, but they always say I'm as healthy as a horse. I don't take any regular medications, either. Just the occasional pain reliever for a sore muscle, but that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions, no regular medications. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never had any surgeries. Not a fan of bein’ cut open, if you don't mind. Always figured I’d avoid ‘em if I could. Thankfully, I haven’t needed any. Everything’s always worked… mostly. Until this headache, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, cancer, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… my mother, she had arthritis, bad in her hands. That’s why she couldn’t do much with ‘em later in life. My father, he had a weak heart, I think. Passed away when I was still young, from somethin' heart-related. My sister, she’s healthy as a horse, though, always has been. As for cancer... I don't recall anyone havin' that, thankfully. It's hard to remember everything, you know, gettin' on in years. But those are the things that spring to mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother, heart issues in your father, and your sister is healthy. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I already mentioned I try to stay active. Walk to the shop most days, do a bit of gardenin' when the weather's nice. I used to play dominoes with the boys down at the community center, but they closed that down last year. Don't smoke, never have. I enjoy a little rum on special occasions, a small glass with dinner, but nothin' excessive. I eat pretty healthy, mostly fish and vegetables, Delores makes sure of that. And I try to get a good night's sleep, though sometimes the little aches and pains keep me tossin' and turnin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, active lifestyle, no smoking, occasional rum, healthy diet, and sometimes trouble sleeping. That gives me a good picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your neck and shoulders. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’ve got nothin’ to hide! I always trust a good examination. Helps put my mind at ease, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, at 140 over 90. I’m hearing some mild crackles in your lungs, which could be a sign of some fluid buildup, but it's hard to say without further investigation. Your neck and shoulders are a bit tight and tender, which likely contributes to the headache. I also noted you’re a bit thin, which we can discuss further. Do you have any trouble breathing, or experience any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Oh, my blood pressure’s high, is it? Never knew that. No, I don't have any trouble breathin', not usually. Maybe a little bit when I'm climbin’ stairs, but I just chalked that up to gettin' on in years, you know? I’ve never felt short of breath, not like I can’t catch my air. And I'm always thin, always have been. Delores worries about it, but I eat plenty, I tell her. So, what do you think it is, Doctor? Is it serious? Is it this tightness in my neck?
DOCTOR: Okay, no shortness of breath, just some mild exertion with stairs. The tightness in your neck is definitely contributing to the headache, but the elevated blood pressure and mild crackles in your lungs are also concerning. Given your age and medical history, it could be a number of things. It’s possible the headache is a tension headache related to muscle tension, but we need to rule out other possibilities. The crackles in your lungs could be a sign of early heart failure, or a lung issue. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. I want to do a chest X-ray to look at your lungs, an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and some blood work to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and rule out any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tests, eh? Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then go right ahead. I trust your judgement. I'd rather know what's goin' on than worry about it. Chest X-ray, EKG, blood work… sounds like a lot, but I'll do whatever you recommend. Will they be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I've got a dominoes tournament next month I'm hopin' to win.
DOCTOR: No, none of them should be painful, Mr. Popova. The blood work will just be a small sample taken from your arm. The EKG involves placing some stickers on your chest, it doesn’t hurt at all. And the chest X-ray is just a quick image of your lungs. As for the results, it usually takes a few days to get everything back from the lab. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend you try to manage your stress, get plenty of rest, and continue with the stretching exercises for your neck. And I'm going to prescribe you a mild muscle relaxant to help with the tension. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Manage the stress… that's easier said than done sometimes, but I’ll try. Rest, stretchin', and a muscle relaxant… alright. A muscle relaxant, you say? Will that make me sleepy? I don’t want to be sleepin’ through the dominoes tournament! But yes, a good plan. Let’s get those tests done and find out what’s goin' on. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you takin' the time to listen to an old man like me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Popova. It’s my job. And yes, the muscle relaxant can cause some drowsiness, so it’s best to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery while you’re taking it. We’ll start you on a low dose and see how you tolerate it. I’ll write you a prescription and give you some instructions on how to take it. I’m also going to order a referral to a cardiologist for a full heart evaluation, given your father’s history and the crackles in your lungs. It’s better to be safe than sorry. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A cardiologist, eh? That’s… a bit much, isn’t it? My heart feels alright, mostly. But… … if you think it’s best, Doctor, then alright. I trust your judgement. Safer to be sure, you say. Yes. Write up the referral, then. It’s all a bit overwhelmin’, but I suppose it’s better to know. And thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a little, even with all the tests and referrals. What do I do next? Do I go to the lab now?
DOCTOR: That's right, it is a lot, and I apologize for that. But it’s important to be thorough, especially given your age and family history. Yes, you can head to the lab now to get the blood work done and schedule your chest X-ray. I'll print out the order forms for you. The front desk staff can help you schedule the X-ray. Once you’ve had those done, you can contact the cardiologist’s office to schedule an appointment. Here are the order forms, and the contact information for the cardiologist. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Order forms, schedule the X-ray, contact the cardiologist… I’ll remember. Just a lot to take in, that's all. Thank you for your time, Doctor Andraca. I appreciate everything you’ve done. And hopefully, it’s just this tension headache, and I can get back to winnin’ those dominoes tournaments. I’ll see you in a few days, then, with the results. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Popova. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And I wish you all the best with the dominoes tournament! Goodbye, and I’ll see you in a few days.
