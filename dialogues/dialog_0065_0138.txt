DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit hard to explain. My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about… weakness? And headaches. It's been going on with family members, you see. My brother, he used to get terrible headaches, and then… well, I don’t quite recall everything. It’s all a bit foggy, dear.
DOCTOR: Foggy, you say. Right. We'll try to clarify things. Let’s start with the weakness. Can you tell me where you’re feeling weak?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where… It comes and goes, you know? But mostly… on this side. My arm feels heavy sometimes, and my leg… it just doesn’t feel like mine, if that makes sense. Not all the time, mind you. Just… episodes. Short ones, usually. Though sometimes they linger. It’s hard to explain, I’m sorry. Is this… normal?
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a rather broad term, Ms. Tofani. We need specifics. When you say “episodes,” how long do these periods of weakness last?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me think… It varies, really. Sometimes just a few minutes, maybe. Other times… an hour? Or a little longer? It’s hard to tell time when you’re… distracted, you know? My daughter says I get quiet when it happens. She worries a lot. I mostly just try to sit down and wait it out. Does that help? Is that… long? I don't want to be a bother, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful, though a precise duration would be beneficial. And no, you're not a bother. Now, you mentioned headaches. Can you describe the headaches?
PATIENT: Oh, the headaches… They’re not always the same, you see. Sometimes they’re just a dull ache, all over my head. Like a tight band. But other times… other times they’re sharp, really sharp, on one side. Mostly this side, I think. And sometimes, with the sharp ones, I feel a little… nauseous. Not sick, exactly, but queasy. It’s been a long time since I had a really bad one, thankfully. But they worry my family. My brother, he used to get them so bad he couldn’t get out of bed.
DOCTOR: So, fluctuating weakness on the left side, headaches that vary in intensity, sometimes accompanied by nausea. And this weakness and headaches are… intermittent, coming and going?
PATIENT: Yes, intermittent, that’s a good word for it. Coming and going. Like waves, almost. Some days I feel perfectly fine, not a thing wrong. And other days… well, other days this happens. It’s just… unsettling, you know? It makes me nervous. And my daughter, she keeps talking about… something my brother had. Something serious. I can’t quite remember the name of it. It starts with a “S”, I think. Does that ring a bell?
DOCTOR: A "S" condition… there are many possibilities. It would be helpful if you could recall anything further. However, based on what you’ve described – fluctuating weakness, headaches, family history – we need to rule out several things. Let’s start with a neurological examination. I'll need to check your reflexes, strength, coordination, and sensation. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, a neurological… Examination? Well… if it’s necessary. I always trust your judgement, Doctor. I just… I don’t like being poked and prodded, if you don’t mind. But if it will help find out what’s going on, then yes. Please. Just… be gentle? And tell me what you’re doing, alright? I get a little… anxious.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will explain each step. It will involve me testing your reflexes with this little hammer, checking your strength by asking you to resist my pull, and assessing your coordination. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Now, if you could just sit back and relax… Relax your leg for me, please. One.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Relax… Is that right? Trying to relax… It’s hard when I’m worried, you see. Oh! That tickles a bit. Is that normal? It feels… strange. Not painful, just… unexpected. I hope I’m not making this difficult for you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's normal to feel a slight tap. Your reflex response is… diminished on the left side compared to the right. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, squeeze… Is that alright? I haven’t been doing much with my hands lately. Just… little things. Knitting, mostly. I used to be quite strong, you know. I helped my husband with the garden for years. But he’s gone now… It’s just me these days. Is that enough? I don't want to strain myself.
DOCTOR: Your grip strength is also reduced on the left side. Now, I'd like to assess your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Oh, coordination… Oh dear! I’m all thumbs today, aren’t I? It’s harder than it looks, you know. I used to be very good at this sort of thing. I don’t know what’s happening. I feel… clumsy. Is this… a bad sign, Doctor? I’m starting to get a little frightened now.
DOCTOR: Based on this preliminary neurological examination – diminished reflexes, reduced grip strength, and impaired coordination on the left side – there is a clear asymmetry. We need to investigate this further to determine the cause. I’m ordering an MRI of the brain and a CT scan to rule out any structural abnormalities. We’ll also need some blood work to check for any underlying medical conditions. I'm also referring you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. It is important to follow through with these tests as soon as possible. I’m not going to speculate on the cause at this point, but we need to be thorough. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh my… an MRI and a CT scan… and a neurologist? That sounds… serious, doesn’t it? Is it… is it something bad, Doctor? I mean, you said you didn’t want to speculate, but… my brother, he had something similar, I think. Something with… weakness? And headaches? Was it a stroke? I just want to know… what are we looking for? And… will it hurt? And… what about my daughter? Should I tell her right away? She worries so much…
DOCTOR: Let’s address your concerns one at a time. The imaging and neurology referral are standard procedure when we observe neurological asymmetry like this. It does not automatically mean it’s something serious, but it’s crucial to rule out potential causes. As for what we're looking for, the MRI will give us a detailed view of your brain to identify any signs of stroke, tumor, or other structural abnormalities. The CT scan helps assess for more immediate issues, like bleeding. Regarding your brother… without knowing the specifics of his condition, it's impossible to draw any direct comparisons. Yes, weakness and headaches can be symptoms of stroke, but they can also be caused by numerous other conditions. The MRI itself is painless, but you will need to lie still inside a machine for about 30-60 minutes. It can be somewhat claustrophobic, so we can discuss options if you have concerns about that. As for your daughter, I recommend you inform her. She is clearly involved in your care, and it’s important she is aware of what’s happening. However, you don’t need to relay every detail right now. Simply tell her you’re undergoing further testing to determine the cause of your symptoms. Do you have any other questions at this moment?
PATIENT: Oh… I see. So, it’s not necessarily a stroke. That’s… a relief, I suppose. But a tumor? That sounds even worse. The claustrophobia… yes, I think that might be a problem. I don’t like small spaces. I always felt a bit… trapped in elevators. Can they… give me something to help with that? A pill, perhaps? And… about the neurologist… will they… do more poking and prodding? I just… I’m getting so tired of all this. I just want to know what’s going on, and then… then I can just get back to my knitting. Is that too much to ask, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be anxious, Ms. Tofani. We’re simply gathering information at this stage. A tumor is one possibility, but it’s far from a definitive diagnosis. Many benign conditions can also cause similar symptoms. Regarding the claustrophobia, yes, we can prescribe a mild anti-anxiety medication to help you relax during the MRI. We can also discuss having an open MRI, though the image quality may not be as detailed. The neurologist will perform a more in-depth neurological examination, including assessing your reflexes, strength, coordination, sensation, and cognitive function. It will involve some poking and prodding, I won’t lie. But it’s necessary to get a comprehensive understanding of your condition. Here is your referral to Dr. Ramirez, a highly-regarded neurologist. And this is a prescription for Lorazepam, a mild anti-anxiety medication. Take one pill an hour before your MRI appointment. I understand you simply want answers, Ms. Tofani. We’re working towards that. The key is to remain calm and follow through with the recommended testing. I will review the results with you as soon as they are available. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… Dr. Ramirez, alright. And the Lorazepam… I’ll take that, thank you. I think… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. I just… I need to sit down and process all this. It’s a lot to take in. Thank you… for explaining everything. And for being patient with me. I suppose I should call my daughter and tell her. She’ll want to know. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. And do let us know if the Lorazepam doesn't alleviate your anxiety before the MRI. Have a good day, Ms. Tofani.
