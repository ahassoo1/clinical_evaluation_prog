DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Eh. Morning to you, Doctor. Bigger is the name. They sent me. Said I gotta come get checked 'cause of... the work. I been diggin' a long time. No problems now, mind you. Just... they want me to come. Waste of time, if you ask me. But here I am.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds like this visit is at the recommendation of your employer, perhaps as part of routine monitoring related to your work. That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bigger. Routine check-ups are always a good idea. Could you tell me a little more about the “work” you do?
PATIENT: Routine? Hmph. They only care 'cause of rules. Rules, rules, rules. Diggin' is what I do. Underground. Been doin' it... long time. Moving rocks, mostly. Big machine helps. Lots of dust. Always dust. Not like it ever hurt me, though. You understand? I feel fine. Perfectly fine. It's just... a job. A hard job.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. So, you're a machine operator involved in excavation, and dust exposure is a regular part of the job. And you feel perfectly well currently, with no complaints?
PATIENT: That's right. No complaints. Never been sick a day in my life, practically. Strong man, always been. They worry too much, these young people. Back in my day… we just worked. Didn't need doctors checkin' on every little thing. But fine, I'm here. You gonna poke me with needles now?
DOCTOR: No needles right away, Mr. Bigger. I’d like to start by getting a bit more information about your overall health, and then we’ll do a brief physical exam. It’s just a standard check-up, as you said. Let's start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High... what was that first one? Blood...pressure? Never heard of it. No, nothing. Always been healthy. Strong. Ate good food, worked hard. That's all. My wife... she had some troubles later in life, but that was...old age. I didn't catch nothin' from her, if that's what you're thinkin'.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Bigger. That's helpful to know. And your wife’s health issues were later in life, so not something you likely inherited. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never needed one. Cut myself a few times, working, of course. But my wife, she patched me up. Good woman. Used herbs and bandages. Didn’t need no fancy doctors back then. Why are you asking all these questions? It feels like you’re lookin’ for somethin’ wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Bigger. I’m just gathering a complete picture of your health history, as I would for any new patient. It helps me understand your overall well-being and identify any potential risks. It’s standard procedure. Now, regarding your family history – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history... Hmm. My father, he was strong too. Worked the land. Lived a long life. Mother, same. Both gone now, of course. Lots of children, lots of grandchildren. Everyone healthy, as far as I know. Nobody sick, nobody weak. We don’t talk about sickness much in my family. Bad luck to dwell on it. You askin' about trouble, Doctor? Feels like you expect me to be fallin' apart.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Bigger. It sounds like you come from a resilient family. No history of significant illness is good to know. Now, let’s talk about your daily habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: Substances? What kind of question is that? I drink a little beer sometimes. With my friends. A little. And smoke... a cigarette, now and then. When I'm relaxin'. Nothing fancy. Don't go crazy, you understand? Not like these young people nowadays. It's a man's life, Doctor. A little somethin' to help you unwind after hard work. Don't judge me.
DOCTOR: I'm not judging, Mr. Bigger. I simply need a complete understanding of your lifestyle. Could you tell me approximately how much beer you drink in a typical week, and how many cigarettes you smoke per day?
PATIENT: Hmph. A couple of beers, maybe three, on a Saturday night. Sometimes less. Depends. And cigarettes... two, three a day. When I remember. I'm tryin' to cut back, you know? Not good for you, they say. But after all these years... it's a habit. A small habit. Are we done yet, Doctor? This feels like an interrogation.
DOCTOR: We're almost finished with the questions, Mr. Bigger. Just a few more. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never needed any. My wife, she used to take somethin' for her... joints, I think. But me? No. Herbs, maybe. Sometimes I take ginger for my stomach. But that’s it. Natural stuff. Don’t trust them pills they give you nowadays. Full of chemicals. Are you gonna check my lungs now? Is that it?
DOCTOR: Yes, I would like to do a brief physical exam now, Mr. Bigger. It will include listening to your lungs, checking your blood pressure and heart rate, and a general examination. It won’t take long. Would you mind if I started by checking your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Go ahead. But don’t tell me it's high, I don’t want to hear it. Just get it over with. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger, just relax your arm for me. Take a few deep breaths. Your blood pressure is 158/92. Your pulse is 78. It’s a little elevated, Mr. Bigger. We’ll discuss that in more detail shortly. Now, if you could just breathe deeply in and out as I listen to your lungs.
PATIENT: Elevated? See! I knew it! You and your machines, always findin' somethin' wrong. I feel fine! Perfectly fine! Hurry up, Doctor. Get it over with. I don’t like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bigger. Your lungs sound a little tight, with some mild wheezing. This could be related to your smoking history, or potentially something else. We’ll need to investigate further. Now, could you please open your mouth?
PATIENT: Investigate further?! What are you talkin' about? What's wrong with my lungs?! I told you, I feel fine! This is ridiculous! Just look, get it over with! Don't poke around too much. You and your machines... always lookin' for trouble.
DOCTOR: Your throat looks a little irritated, but nothing too concerning. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart. Your heart sounds regular, but there is a slight murmur. Murmurs are common, and often harmless, but we should monitor it. Given your elevated blood pressure, slight wheezing, and the murmur, I recommend a few further tests, Mr. Bigger. These include a chest X-ray, an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and some blood work to assess your overall health. Would you be willing to proceed with those?
PATIENT: Tests?! X-rays?! Blood work?! Are you tryin' to kill me?! This is what I was afraid of! I came here for a check-up, not to be poked and prodded and scanned like some… some broken machine! Look, Doctor, I told you, I feel fine! My wife always said I was a strong man. I don’t need your tests! You’re just tryin' to make money off me! I'm leavin'. This is a waste of time and a waste of my money! .
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, please, sit down. I understand your frustration, and I assure you I am not trying to make money off you. My goal is to ensure your health and well-being. These tests are simply a precaution to rule out any potential issues. I recognize you feel fine, but sometimes problems don't present obvious symptoms. Elevated blood pressure, for example, often has no noticeable effects until it causes a serious event. However, I respect your wishes. If you are unwilling to proceed with the tests, I won't force you. But I strongly recommend reconsidering. Given your concerns and your unwillingness to undergo further testing at this time, I can offer a referral to a trusted colleague for a second opinion. Would you like that?
