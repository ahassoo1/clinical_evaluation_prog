DOCTOR: Good morning, Tasmia. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so just… the blood pressure thing. My husband made me come. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your husband is concerned about your blood pressure. I understand you're short on time, so we'll try to be efficient. Just to clarify, has a blood pressure reading actually been taken recently that was high, or is this more of a general worry from your husband?
PATIENT: He got one of those machines for home. It beeped a lot. Said something about 140 over… something. Honestly, I didn’t really pay attention. Numbers aren't my thing. He just kept saying it was high and I needed to see a doctor. He reads too much on the internet.
DOCTOR: Okay, 140 over something is definitely something we should check out. Even one reading isn’t a cause for panic, but it’s good to get a baseline. Do you have any symptoms you've been experiencing – headaches, vision changes, dizziness, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No. I feel fine. Perfectly fine. I work outside all day, so I’m usually just… tired. That’s it. It’s hot, you know? Arizona heat. Not everyone can handle it.
DOCTOR: Right, Arizona heat is no joke. Okay, so no other symptoms. Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before, or had any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I've always been healthy. I eat okay, I guess. My grandma always said strong women don't get sick. She lived to be ninety-something.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful about your grandmother! Genetics definitely play a role. Okay, and just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin sometimes. The gummy kind. Husband buys them. Says I don't get enough fruits and vegetables. Honestly, I don't see the point. A good steak has everything you need.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications. Any allergies to anything – medications, foods, environmental things like pollen?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I’m pretty tough. Grew up on the reservation, you learn to deal with things. Dust, weeds…doesn’t bother me. I don’t really have time for allergies, either. Too much work to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And do you mind if I ask a few questions about your family history?
PATIENT: Ugh. Family history. Fine. But I don’t know much about my mom’s side. She… wasn’t around much. My dad’s side, they mostly lived long lives, I think. Lots of farming. Physical labor. But honestly, details are fuzzy. It was a long time ago. And people didn’t really talk about health stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's very common. Any specific illnesses you do recall – heart problems, diabetes, kidney issues – on either side of the family?
PATIENT: My uncle, on my dad’s side, had something with his heart. Needed a surgery, I think. But that was years ago. And he… didn’t take care of himself. Smoked too much, drank too much. It was his own fault, honestly. Not a good example. Other than that...not really. Everyone just… got old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some heart issues with your uncle. That's good to know. Last few questions, and then we can get a quick check of your blood pressure. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe on the weekends. Nothing crazy. I need something to relax after a long day. Construction work is stressful, you know? It’s not all sunshine and roses.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. Disgusting habit. My husband tried it once, years ago, when he was in the army. I made him stop. Quick. It smells awful and it’s just… unhealthy. I have standards.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking. Great. And finally, just to get a complete picture, are you currently pregnant or breastfeeding?
PATIENT: Seriously? Do I look pregnant? I’m married, yes, but that’s beside the point. That's a rude question. Let’s just get the blood pressure reading over with, alright? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to be offended. That was inappropriate of me, and I apologize sincerely. I ask those questions as part of a standard assessment, but that doesn’t excuse my lack of sensitivity. Let's get that blood pressure checked. I have the machine right here. If you could just sit and relax for a few moments...
PATIENT: Fine. Just hurry up. I really don't have all day. And don’t ask me any more silly questions.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. That is a bit elevated. I'm also noting a pulse of 78, which is normal. Your weight is 104 pounds and height is 184 centimeters, giving you a BMI of 32.1. Now, this one reading doesn't mean you have high blood pressure, but it's enough of a concern to warrant further investigation. We need to rule out any underlying causes.
PATIENT: See? I told you it was nothing. It's probably just the heat. Everything is higher in Arizona. And I'm a little on the thin side, so maybe that throws everything off. Just tell my husband it's fine, alright? He worries too much. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Please, sit down for just another moment. I understand you're busy, but dismissing this entirely isn't the best course of action. While heat and body composition can play a role, an elevated reading like this requires some follow-up. I want to order a basic metabolic panel – that’s just a blood test to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. And an EKG to check your heart rhythm. It's a simple precaution. We can do those tests right here in the clinic. It will take about an hour. If everything comes back normal, then we can attribute it to the heat and lifestyle factors. But it's better to be safe. Do you agree to that?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. But you’re wasting my time. And if it's nothing, I expect an apology. And my husband is paying for this, so don’t try to upsell me on anything fancy. Just the basic stuff. And hurry up, alright?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Just the basic metabolic panel and EKG. I understand your time is valuable, and we’ll expedite the process as much as possible. I'll get the lab tech in to draw your blood. And I assure you, we will discuss the results thoroughly, and I will explain everything in a way that makes sense. "Could we get a phlebotomist to room three, please?
PATIENT: Just get it over with. And tell them to be gentle. I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: I will. I'll let the phlebotomist know you're not a fan of needles, and they'll be as gentle as possible. It should only take a few minutes. While we wait, is there anything you would like to ask me?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. You've already wasted enough of my time. Just tell me when it's over. .
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll let you know as soon as the results are available. Just try to relax. The phlebotomist should be here any moment. .
