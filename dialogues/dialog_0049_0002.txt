DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… what did bring me in? My… my water. It’s hard to… to get it all out, you know? Like it’s stuck. It's been a bit tricky lately. Not awful, just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Right. Difficulty with… urination. How long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… how long? That’s a good question. Not too long, I don’t think. Maybe… a few weeks? Or was it months? Everything feels the same these days, to be honest. I just know it didn’t used to be this way. It's just… harder now. Is that okay? I'm not very good with dates. My husband usually keeps track of things.
DOCTOR: A few weeks to months… alright. And would you say it’s a complete emptying, or do you feel like you’re retaining some urine afterwards?
PATIENT: Oh… retaining? You mean… does some stay in there? Hmm… I think so, yes. It doesn't feel like all of it comes out. Like a little bit is left… but not much. It’s hard to explain. I just feel like I have to go back again not too long after, you know? Does that make sense? I get a bit confused with these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. And have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes…? Oh, goodness. Let me think… It looks… normal, I think? Yellow, like it always is. Maybe a little darker sometimes? But I drink a lot of water, so it should be alright. I haven’t noticed any… blood or anything scary like that, thankfully. My son always told me to watch out for that. He worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any pain or burning with urination?
PATIENT: Pain… no, not really pain. A little bit of… discomfort, maybe? It's not a sharp pain, more like a… pressure, you know? Especially when I start. And sometimes… after. Just a little ache. But it's not too bad. I’ve had aches and pains for years, so I just thought it was my old bones. Is that something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oh, no fever, no chills. And my tummy… no, no pain there. Just… regular old tummy stuff, if you know what I mean. Nothing unusual. I do get a little gassy sometimes, but that's just how I am, I guess! Is all this helpful? I'm trying my best to remember everything, but it's hard.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, have you had any recent urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Oh… urinary tract infections? Hmm… I don’t think so. Or maybe I did, a long time ago? My husband usually takes me to the doctor when I’m sick. I can't rightly remember. He would know! He keeps track of everything. Was it a really bad one? I don’t recall feeling really sick with anything like that recently.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a better sense of things. We’ll check your abdomen and do a quick neurological check. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Oh… an exam? Alright, dear. If you think it’s best. My old bones might be a bit creaky, so be gentle, okay? And I don't have much strength anymore, so if I wobble, just help me steady. Just let me know what you need me to do. I'm a bit nervous, but I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back for me. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with this. Okay. And now I'll gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels tender. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a little cold. And… hmm. It’s alright, dear, not too bad. It’s a bit sensitive here, on my left side. Not a sharp pain, but… a little achy when you press. Like a dull ache. It feels… different than my usual aches and pains. Is that what you’re looking for? It’s hard to tell what’s normal anymore. Everything hurts a little these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now I’m just going to gently tap on your abdomen. And now I'm going to check your neurological function, just a quick reflex test. Please bend your knees and keep your ankles relaxed.
PATIENT: Oh… tapping? That tickles a little! And… knees? Alright, dear. I hope I can still do that! My joints aren't what they used to be. Oh… that’s a little hard. Did I do it right? I'm a bit wobbly, you know. It's hard to relax when you're nervous. Everything feels so… strange. Is something wrong, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is not entirely unexpected given your age. And there is some tenderness in your left lower quadrant. We'll need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. I'm going to order a urinalysis and a complete blood count. We may also need to consider a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis, but we'll see what the initial tests show.
PATIENT: Oh… tests? A CT scan? That sounds… serious. What are we looking for, Doctor? Is it something bad? My husband will be worried sick if I have a CT scan. He always thinks the worst. Will it hurt? How long will it take? I just want to know what’s going on. I don't like feeling like this, all confused and worried.
DOCTOR: It's too early to say what's going on, Ms. Stoffregen. These tests will help us rule out potential causes. The urinalysis will check for infection, and the blood count will give us information about your overall health. A CT scan provides detailed images of your abdomen and pelvis and can help identify any abnormalities. It's a standard procedure. The CT scan itself is painless, but you will need to lie still for a short period. We'll get the results back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. I'm going to have the nurse draw your blood now, and then we'll schedule the CT scan. It's best to get these things done promptly.
PATIENT: Oh… alright, dear. If you think it’s best. Fluid, no caffeine… I can try. My husband always makes me chamomile tea. That’s alright, isn’t it? Chamomile tea? And… promptly? What if I’m tired? What if I get confused? I don’t want to be a bother. Will the nurse be gentle? I bruise easily, you know. And… will you explain the results to me, Doctor? I don't want to be left in the dark. I just want to feel better again.
DOCTOR: Chamomile tea is fine. And the nurse is very experienced, she will be gentle. I will review the results with you when they are available. However, I have other patients to see, so I won’t be able to spend an extended amount of time discussing them at length. If you have any specific concerns, you can always schedule a follow-up appointment. Now, let's get the blood drawn and schedule the CT scan. We'll take it one step at a time.
PATIENT: Oh… one step at a time. Alright, dear. If you say so. But… please don't forget about me. And… thank you. For… trying. I'm just… scared. I'm an old woman, and everything feels so… uncertain. Tell the nurse I bruise easily, please. And… chamomile tea is my favorite. .
