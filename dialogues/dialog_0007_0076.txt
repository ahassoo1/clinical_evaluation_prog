DOCTOR: Hi Clarke, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Valerie Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doc, nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs. They’re on my shins, and they really hurt. Been botherin’ me for a few weeks now. Red and kinda hard, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Clarke, I understand. Bumps on your shins that are red, hard, and painful for a few weeks. That definitely sounds bothersome. To get a better idea of what's going on, can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed them?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... it was probably around the end of July, maybe the first week. I was doin’ some work outside, helpin’ my son with his garden. Lots of walkin’ and bendin’ over. I didn’t really think much of it at first, figured it was just a little soreness. But then they got redder and started to really hurt when I touched ‘em.
DOCTOR: Okay, end of July, started while gardening with your son – lots of walking and bending. And they've gotten progressively redder and more painful with touch. Good information. Have you noticed anything else about them?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it... they seem a little itchy sometimes, but not all the time. Mostly just when I'm tryin’ to sleep. And, uh… they don’t seem to be gettin’ bigger, but they sure don’t seem to be gettin’ better either. I put some ointment on 'em, just somethin’ I had at home for cuts and scrapes, but it didn't do much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clarke. So, some itchiness, mostly at night, no change in size, and the over-the-counter ointment didn't provide relief. That helps. Have you had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get the usual scrapes and bruises from work, you know? But nothin' like this. These bumps are hard... and they hurt deeper than just a scrape would. My wife, Elena, she hasn’t had anything like this either. She’s usually the one with the little aches and pains, but not these.
DOCTOR: Alright, so this is new for you. And your wife hasn’t experienced anything similar. Good to know. Now, just to get a broader picture, do you have any other medical conditions – like diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, um... let me think. I have high blood pressure, the doctor's been tellin’ me for years to watch my salt. I take a pill for it every mornin’. And my knees are kinda achy, old work injury. But other than that, I’m pretty good for my age, I think! Elena keeps me goin’, makes sure I eat right and all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, managed with medication, and some knee pain from an old injury. That’s helpful. Do you take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pill, like I said. And sometimes, when my knees are really botherin’ me, I take a little bit of ibuprofen. Just when I really need it, though. Elena gives me a multivitamin every day, says I need my vitamins. But that's pretty much it, Doc. I don’t really like takin’ a lot of pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication, occasional ibuprofen, and a daily multivitamin. And no allergies to any medications, right?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’ before. Elena always double-checks when she gets my prescriptions, she's very careful like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No known allergies. Now, Clarke, I'm going to take a look at your legs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doc, that's fine. Go ahead. Just let me know if you need me to move ‘em or anythin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clarke. I see several raised, reddish bumps on both shins. They are firm to the touch and tender. There’s no warmth around them, and no fluid draining. I don’t see any broken skin or open sores. Based on what you've told me and what I'm seeing, it looks like you might have stasis dermatitis with some possible venous insufficiency. Does that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Stasis... what now? Venous... I'm sorry, Doc, that sounds like a lot of medical words. I don't think I've ever heard of those before. Is that somethin' serious?
DOCTOR: No, no, it’s okay. I apologize for the jargon. Let me explain it simply. "Venous insufficiency" means the valves in the veins in your legs aren’t working as well as they should, making it harder for blood to flow back up to your heart. This can cause fluid to build up in your legs, and that fluid buildup can lead to inflammation and skin changes – that’s the “stasis dermatitis.” It's not usually immediately serious, but it can become uncomfortable, and if left untreated, it can lead to skin ulcers. It’s more common with age and conditions like high blood pressure. It sounds like your history fits, but to be certain, I’d like to do a quick non-invasive test to check the blood flow in your legs. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Okay, I think I understand a little better now. So, it's the blood not goin' back up right, and that's causin' the bumps. That makes sense, I guess. I do get kinda swollen ankles sometimes, especially at the end of the day. And yeah, sure, Doc. If you think it's a good idea to do a test, then go ahead. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Great. Thank you, Clarke. It's a simple ultrasound, completely painless. It won't take long. While I'm doing this, can you tell me a little bit about your activity level?
PATIENT: Well, I try to stay busy. I help my son with his garden a couple times a week, like I said. And I walk around the neighborhood most days, try to get a little exercise. I used to do more, but my knees aren't what they used to be. I mostly do lighter work these days, you know? Not too much heavy liftin’ or long walks. Elena makes sure I don’t overdo it.
DOCTOR: Okay, gardening, walking – moderate activity. That's good. Alright, Clarke. The ultrasound confirms some evidence of venous insufficiency. The valves aren’t working as efficiently as they should, and there’s some blood pooling in your legs. Now, we can manage this with a few things. First, compression stockings. These will help improve blood flow and reduce swelling. Second, elevating your legs when you’re resting. Third, we can talk about some topical creams to help with the inflammation. And lastly, I’m going to recommend a referral to a vascular specialist. They can do a more in-depth assessment and discuss other options if needed. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, stockings, elevatin’ my legs, and some cream. That doesn't sound too bad. And seein' a specialist, well, if you think it's best, then I'll do it. I trust your opinion, Doc. So, these stockings… are they like the really tight ones? My wife has some, and they look kinda uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Clarke. They come in different levels of compression. We'll start you with a mild compression level, not the super tight ones. We want to improve circulation, not cut off your legs! I’ll give you a prescription for those, and the pharmacy will help fit you properly. As for the cream, I’m prescribing a topical corticosteroid to help with the inflammation and itching. It’s a mild strength, and you only need to apply it once or twice a day to the affected areas. And I'll send a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a great vascular specialist here in town. They'll schedule an appointment for you. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good, Doc. Mild stockings and cream, and seein' Dr. Ramirez. I think I understand everything. No, I don't think so. Thank you for explainin' it all so clearly, and for not makin' me feel like I was talkin' in circles with all them medical words. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Clarke. I'm glad I could help. Here's your prescription for the stockings and cream, and the referral to Dr. Ramirez. Please follow up with them to schedule an appointment. And remember, elevate your legs whenever possible, and if you notice any worsening of your symptoms—like open sores, fever, or increased pain—contact me or seek immediate medical attention. Take care, Clarke, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. .
