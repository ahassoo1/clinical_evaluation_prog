DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I… my heart, it feels funny sometimes. Like it's beating too fast, but not always. It’s hard to explain. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Maybe a month?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's helpful that you're able to describe it, even if it is difficult. “Feels funny” is perfectly alright. So, it's been happening for roughly a month, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Not every day, you know? Some days are okay, no problem. But then… then it starts. It’s not pain, not like chest pain. More like…fluttering? Inside. Like a bird in my chest. It makes me a little worried. My wife, she tells me to come see you.
DOCTOR: Okay, “fluttering” – that’s a very helpful description. And it’s good that your wife encouraged you to come in. It's always wise to get these things checked out. When it happens, does anything seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Hmm… trigger? I don’t know. Nothing I have noticed. I work… I work with chemicals, at the plant. Sometimes it happens at work, sometimes at home. Sometimes when I am just… sitting. It feels random. It doesn’t happen after I eat, or after I walk, or anything. Just… happens. It doesn't last long, maybe a few minutes. Then it stops. But I worry it will not stop one day.
DOCTOR: I see. Random occurrences, lasting just a few minutes. That's important information. And you mentioned working with chemicals at the plant. Could you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, sure. I work with… things for making plastic, mostly. I check the machines, make sure they are working right. Sometimes I mix the chemicals. I wear gloves and a mask, always. They tell us to. But… the smell is strong sometimes. It doesn't feel like that makes the heart do the fluttering, but I think I should tell you everything, yes? I clean the machines too, after we are done for the day. It is a big plant, very busy.
DOCTOR: Yes, please do tell me everything. It's good you’re wearing protective gear at work – that's very important. The type of chemicals you work with and the possibility of exposure, even with protection, is relevant. Now, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical problems that you know of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or cholesterol issues?
PATIENT: No, no problems. I… I try to eat healthy, mostly. Not too much salt, not too much sugar. My wife cooks good food. I don’t go to the doctor often. I’ve never had high blood pressure or… diabetes, or any of those things. I feel okay, mostly. But this heart thing… it scares me. I don’t want to get sick. I have a family.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Puder, and it's good you don’t have a history of those conditions. It's always best to get these things checked out, even if it turns out to be nothing serious. Now, have you ever had this happen before, even when you were younger?
PATIENT: No, never. Not before. Not ever. This is… new. Always new. Even when I was a boy, growing up in Yemen, I never felt this. My heart was always strong. I played soccer, ran around a lot. I don’t know… maybe it's the stress? The work is busy, and I worry about my family. But I don’t feel that stressed. It is just… a feeling. A bad feeling. I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, it’s truly a new symptom, and not related to any past medical history. And you feel it's unlikely related to significant stress. Let’s talk about your family. Are there any heart problems that run in your family - perhaps a parent or sibling who has had heart disease, high blood pressure, or sudden cardiac death?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father, he had problems with his blood pressure. He took pills for it, I think. A long time ago. He lived a long life, though. He died when he was very old. My mother, she was healthy, mostly. No heart problems that I know of. My brother, he is healthy too. He lives in Sanaa. We don’t talk often. But he doesn’t have any problems, I think. But my grandfather… I don't know much about his health. He died before I was born. That’s all I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. History of hypertension in your father. Now, Mr. Puder, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure and pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That’s alright. Whatever you need. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax and breathe normally. I listen carefully for any murmurs, extra sounds, or irregularities. After a moment, I move to listen to his lungs. Your breathing sounds clear. I take his blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 130/80, and pulse is 78 and regular. I palpate his pulse, noting its strength and regularity. Your pulse feels normal. I gently palpate his chest, checking for any tenderness. No tenderness to palpation. Everything appears normal so far, but to be thorough, I'd like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to get a better look at your heart's electrical activity. Also, a basic blood panel to check your electrolytes, kidney function, and thyroid levels. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay. Everything… normal? That's good, I guess. But my heart feels funny sometimes, so I am glad you are doing the tests. EKG and… blood tests? Yes, okay. That's fine. Whatever you think is best. Can I still go to work tomorrow? I don’t want to lose a day’s pay.
DOCTOR: Yes, it's good we're getting these tests done. Just because the initial exam appears normal doesn’t mean we’ve ruled everything out. And I understand your concern about work. For tomorrow, I think it’s reasonable for you to go to work, as long as you avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please stop working immediately and go to the nearest emergency room. We'll have the results of the EKG and blood tests back within a few days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. No running around, I understand. And if anything feels bad, I go to the hospital. Okay. A few days… I hope it’s nothing serious. My wife will be happy to hear you say that. She worries a lot. Can I ask… what are you looking for with the tests? What could be causing this fluttering?
DOCTOR: Certainly. The EKG will help us assess your heart's rhythm and identify any potential irregularities, like an arrhythmia – which is simply an irregular heartbeat. The blood tests will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms, such as thyroid problems or electrolyte imbalances. Sometimes, these “flutterings” can be caused by something as simple as caffeine or stress, but we need to rule out anything more serious. It's also possible it’s a benign condition called palpitations, which are usually harmless. But it's important to investigate, which is why we're doing the tests. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Puder?
PATIENT: No, I think that makes sense. I don't drink much caffeine, so it’s probably not that. I try to stay calm, but work… work is stressful sometimes. So, tests, and then we talk. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very helpful. I feel a little better now, just knowing what's going on. I will see you in a few days then. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Puder. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. Remember, if anything changes or worsens, please don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, and please give your wife my best. .
