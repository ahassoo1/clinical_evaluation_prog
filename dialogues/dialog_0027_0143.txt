DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s a bit… complicated. My… someone I care about, she wants to… have a baby. And I thought maybe… maybe I should get checked out first? Just to be sure everything is okay. It’s been a long time, you see. A very long time. I don’t… I don’t really know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: That's very thoughtful of you, Mr. Verrall. It is a good idea to get a check-up before starting a family, especially after a long time. It’s good you’re thinking ahead. Okay. To start, let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any current medical problems – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart trouble, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I don't think so. Nothing the doctors ever told me about, anyway. I used to work a lot, travelling… Sales Engineers, you see. Lots of stress, maybe. But I felt okay. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, I honestly can't remember. A long time. I think I'm pretty healthy for my age, but… you never know, right? I don’t really… keep track of things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Now that's a hard one. I… I think maybe when I was a little boy? Something with my tonsils, maybe? It was a very long time ago. And… I think I broke my arm once, when I was maybe ten? But nothing… serious, as an adult. No, I don't think so. It's all a bit blurry, if you don't mind me saying. I don’t have good memory for those things.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Mr. Verrall. It’s perfectly common to not remember details from a long time ago. Let’s move on then. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I eat… pretty much everything. Never had any trouble with food. And I don’t take any pills regularly, so… I don’t think so. But… is there a way to find out if I have allergies? Maybe I just haven't eaten the thing I'm allergic to yet? It sounds silly, I know.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound silly at all. It's good you're thinking about these things. We can test for allergies if you’re concerned, but for now, we’ll assume you don’t have any known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a single one. I really don’t take anything. Never been much of a pill person. I try to eat good food, get enough sleep… that’s about it. My… friend, she’s always telling me to take vitamins, but I always forget. She worries a lot, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, if you don’t mind me asking, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… difficult. I didn’t grow up with my family, really. Left Kurdistan a long time ago. I haven't seen them in… decades. I don’t know much about their health. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. But I don’t know details. And my father… I don’t even remember much about him. I’m sorry, Doctor. I wish I could tell you more. It's all a bit… foggy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. It's not always possible to know your family history, and that’s okay. We’ll proceed based on what you do know. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My… friend, she used to smoke, but she quit years ago. I always told her it was bad for her. I don’t like the smell of it, and… well, it just doesn't seem healthy. I try to stay healthy, you see. For her.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… I used to drink a little bit, when I was travelling with work. A glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. But I haven't really drank anything in… years. Not since I met her. She doesn’t like it. I don’t mind not drinking, to be honest. Makes me feel better to stay clear-headed. It’s… better that way.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, just a few more questions about your overall health. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes in weight… A little bit, maybe? I've gotten a bit… softer, I suppose, since I stopped travelling. Used to walk a lot, you see. But I haven't been as active lately. Nothing serious, though. Just… a few extra pounds. It's probably my age. I eat good food, though! Maybe too good.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you been experiencing any pain, fatigue, or other symptoms recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… No, not really. I get a little tired sometimes, but that’s just… being my age, I think. And my knees ache a bit in the cold weather, but nothing I can’t walk off. Nothing that worries me, you see. I feel… pretty good, all things considered. Maybe a little bit… anxious, thinking about all this… about having a baby. But that’s not a physical symptom, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not a physical symptom. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about such a big life change. Okay, Mr. Verrall, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I just want to make sure everything is okay… for her. And… well, for the baby, if it’s meant to be. Just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not concerning at this point. Now let’s take a look at your ears, nose and throat… Everything looks clear here. Now, I'm just going to palpate your abdomen. No tenderness. Everything feels normal here. Finally, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Alright, everything seems to be within normal limits. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and I would like to repeat this test in a few weeks to keep an eye on it. Also, given your age and the fact that you haven't had a check-up in a while, I'd like to order some blood work to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. Blood work… cholesterol… I don’t even know what that is, really. But if you think it’s important, then yes, please. I just want to make sure I’m… healthy enough. For her. And for the baby. It’s… a big responsibility, you see. Can you tell me… if there’s something wrong? Will you tell me straight? Even if it’s… bad?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Verrall. I will always be honest with you and explain everything clearly. We’ll go through the results together, and I’ll answer any questions you have. Right now, there’s no reason to be overly concerned. The blood work is just a precaution. I'm going to order the blood work now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll send the results to me in a few days. I'd like to see you again in two weeks to discuss the results and check your blood pressure again. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That works perfectly. Two weeks… I’ll mark it on the calendar. Blood work… and then see you again. I think I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate you taking the time. And for being… honest. I just… I want everything to be okay. For her. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verrall. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. And remember, we’ll go through everything together.
