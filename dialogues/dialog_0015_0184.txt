DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I ain't got all day, you know? It's... well, it's this body. It's just... gone soft. Used to be muscle, all strong from the pile driving. Now? Flabby. My wife, bless her soul, she always liked a man with some shape. Don't want to disappoint her memory, even now. So, you fix it? Can you fix it?
DOCTOR: I see. You're concerned about loss of muscle mass and changes in your body composition. While I understand your desire to maintain your physical health, and I certainly sympathize with wanting to honor your wife's preferences, “fixing” it isn’t quite how we approach these things. It sounds like you're experiencing age-related muscle loss, which is quite common. To get a better understanding of what's going on, and to determine the best course of action, I need to ask you a few more questions. Can you tell me more about when you first noticed these changes?
PATIENT: Changes? When did I notice? Hmm... Probably... after I retired. Pile driving keeps a man busy, you know? Strong. Stopped doing that, maybe... five years ago? Six? Time flies. Started noticing the trousers getting a little tight, then looser, then... well, you see. Not a fan of this soft business. It ain't dignified. Don't ask me about weights or... whatever you young people do. I just want it back how it was.
DOCTOR: Alright, five to six years ago, coinciding with retirement. And you haven't been engaging in any regular exercise since then?
PATIENT: Exercise? Look, lady, I was exercise. Swinging a pile driver all day? That’s more than enough for any man. Now I mostly sit. Read the paper. Watch the cricket. Occasionally potter in the garden, but that's hardly a workout, is it? I don’t do exercise. Never have. Never needed to. It's just... everything’s gone downhill. And I don't like it.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a significant decrease in physical activity over the past several years. Let's talk about your diet then. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Diet? What’s wrong with my diet? I eat. What do you want to know? Breakfast, usually toast and a cup of tea. Lunch... sometimes a sandwich. Dinner, whatever my daughter brings over. She worries about me. She tries to make me eat... greens. Don't like greens. Used to eat plenty of saltfish and yam when I was younger, but... nowadays, it's just... food. Does it matter? I'm not weak, just... softer. A bit jiggly, maybe. But I eat. Enough to keep me alive, don’t you worry.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a fairly standard diet, perhaps lacking in certain nutrients, and a decrease in overall activity. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Medical history? Nothing much. Bit of arthritis in the knees, that's all. Gets worse when it rains. Doctor gave me some pills for it, take 'em when it bothers me. Blood pressure... they checked it once, said it was a little high, but nothing to worry about. They always say something’s a little high. Old age, you know? I’m not falling apart. Just... not what I used to be. And frankly, lady, I'm getting impatient. What can you do about this softness?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, with all due respect, simply stating you're “soft” isn’t a medical complaint. And demanding a fix without allowing me to properly assess your condition is… unhelpful. However, I understand your frustration. The “softness” you describe is likely a combination of age-related muscle loss – sarcopenia – decreased activity, and possibly dietary factors. Before we proceed, I need to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and assess your overall body composition. I also want to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical issues that could be contributing to your symptoms. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work? Examination? Look, lady, I ain't got time for all this poking and prodding! I just want to know if you can make me look less like a pudding and more like… well, me. Can you do that, or can’t you? And if you can't, just say so. I’ll find another doctor. I ain’t paying for you to write things down about my “softness”. Honestly, the things they make you go through these days.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I assure you, I am not attempting to waste your time. However, a proper medical assessment is essential before I can determine an appropriate course of action. I cannot simply wave a magic wand and restore your muscle mass. We need to understand the why behind your changes. If you refuse a physical examination and blood work, I cannot provide you with a diagnosis or treatment plan. And frankly, seeking another doctor will likely yield the same request for proper evaluation. Now, I can appreciate your desire for a quick fix, but I am a physician, not a magician. If you are unwilling to cooperate with a standard medical process, then I’m afraid I can’t assist you further. Perhaps you should consider consulting a personal trainer if you are simply seeking cosmetic changes. But a medical concern requires a medical evaluation.
PATIENT: Fine. Fine! Do your poking and prodding. Just get it over with. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And if it turns out I'm perfectly healthy and you can't do anything about this... softness... I’m not paying the bill. Honestly, the indignity of it all. Just… get on with it.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit back and relax as much as possible. I’m going to start with your reflexes, then assess your muscle strength in your arms and legs. I'll also listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure again. Can you tell me if you’ve noticed any weakness or numbness in your limbs?
PATIENT: Ouch! What was that for? No, no weakness. Just... a bit stiff sometimes, especially in the mornings. And a bit jiggly, if you must know. That’s what brought me here in the first place. Don’t tell me you haven’t noticed. A man doesn’t come to a doctor complaining about nothing. Now, hurry up. My daughter’s waiting to pick me up. And I’m missing the cricket.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are slightly diminished, which is common at your age. Your heart and lungs sound clear, although your blood pressure is a bit elevated – 148 over 85. And, as you mentioned, there is a noticeable decrease in muscle mass. I also note some mild swelling in your ankles. Can you describe your typical daily activities?
PATIENT: I told you, lady! I sit. Read the paper. Watch cricket. Occasionally potter in the garden. It's not exactly a grueling schedule, is it? I used to be a pile driver operator. That was a daily activity. That built muscle. Sitting around doesn't build anything but a bad back. Look, you're asking me a lot of questions I've already answered. Are you actually going to do something, or are you just trying to fill up a chart? And don’t tell me about my ankles. They swell when it rains, always have.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, I am attempting to gather a comprehensive medical history to determine the cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Repeating the same questions may seem redundant, but it is crucial for accurate diagnosis. Based on my preliminary examination and your history, it appears you are experiencing a combination of age-related muscle loss, decreased physical activity, and potentially some mild fluid retention. I am ordering a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. These tests will help rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. I also want to order a urine analysis to assess your kidney function. Once we have the results, we can discuss potential treatment options, which may include dietary modifications, an exercise program, and potentially medication to manage your blood pressure. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Tests, tests, tests. Fine. Do whatever you need to do. But don't expect miracles. And if it turns out it’s just old age, I’m not paying for any fancy diets or exercise programs. Just… tell me when I can go. I’m missing the cricket. And frankly, lady, you’re starting to give me a headache. Just get those tests done, and let me know the results. No promises I’ll actually do anything about them.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab technician will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. They’ll provide you with instructions on how to do that. I anticipate the results will be available within three to five business days. My assistant will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I would strongly advise you to avoid prolonged sitting and engage in some gentle activity, such as walking, if possible. And while I understand you may not be inclined to make any significant changes at this time, I believe even small steps can make a difference. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Mr. Trendler?
