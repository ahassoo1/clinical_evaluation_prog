DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schieber. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor Billman, I don't have a lot of time for this. It's… a bit embarrassing, really. Something's going on in my mouth. It's white, patchy… looks rather unpleasant. I haven't a clue what it is, and frankly, I don't want to dwell on it any longer than necessary.
DOCTOR: Embarrassing or not, Mr. Schieber, you came to me for help. We all have things we'd rather not talk about. “Patchy white stuff in the mouth” isn't terribly specific, though. Is it painful?
PATIENT: Painful? No, not really. More… irritating. It feels a bit rough, like sandpaper. And it’s quite unsightly, if I may say so. I assure you, Doctor, I’m not one for complaining about minor discomforts, but this is… noticeable. It’s just… there. And it doesn’t seem to be going away.
DOCTOR: "Doesn't seem to be going away," right. How long has it been there, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… a few weeks, perhaps? It’s difficult to say exactly. I don’t spend a great deal of time examining my mouth, you understand. My wife mentioned it first, actually. She has a very keen eye for these things. I just… dismissed it at first. Thought it was something I ate, perhaps. Clearly, I was mistaken.
DOCTOR: Right. A few weeks. And has anything changed with your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? No, not particularly. The usual. Steak, potatoes, a bit of rice. I maintain a fairly… stable routine, Doctor. I’m not one for experimentation. Though, I did have some rather exotic fruit last month when visiting my brother. Perhaps that has something to do with it? But honestly, I doubt it. I’ve eaten far stranger things without incident.
DOCTOR: “Exotic fruit,” you say. What kind of fruit?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I believe it was… dragon fruit? And some sort of… rambutan, maybe? Honestly, Doctor, I don’t pay much attention to the names. They were colorful, tasted quite pleasant, and that was the extent of my concern. Are you suggesting that fruit is responsible for this… condition? It sounds rather preposterous, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Schieber, I need you to be a little more forthcoming. These details matter. We'll get to the bottom of this, but I need a complete picture. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Absolutely not. Disgusting habit. My father smoked, and it shortened his life considerably, I assure you. No, Doctor, I have never touched a cigarette in my life. And I find your line of questioning rather… accusatory, if I may say so. I came here for a diagnosis, not an interrogation.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No smoking. Let's just move on. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? No. Nothing obvious. Perhaps a slight… dryness in my mouth, but that could just be the weather. It’s been quite warm lately, you know. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a fairly robust individual. I don’t typically complain about minor inconveniences. I have important things to attend to. Are we getting anywhere with this, or shall I simply seek a second opinion?
DOCTOR: “Important things to attend to,” right. Well, let’s see if we can make this quick. I’m going to need to take a look inside your mouth. Open wide.
PATIENT: Get it over with, please. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes. Okay. It appears to be…patches of leukoplakia on your buccal mucosa and tongue. It doesn’t appear to be causing any acute trauma, and there are no signs of ulceration. It could be related to irritation, like from tobacco – despite what you say – or even certain foods. But, it's important to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to recommend a biopsy just to be sure.
PATIENT: A biopsy? Absolutely not. That sounds… invasive. And frankly, unnecessary. I told you, it’s just a bit of white stuff! Are you suggesting I have something… serious? I demand a second opinion. This is preposterous. I have a business to run, Doctor, I don't have time for… experiments. I think I’ll just… leave.
DOCTOR: Hold on, Mr. Schieber. I understand your reluctance, but I'm simply following protocol. Leukoplakia can be benign, yes, but it can also be precancerous. A biopsy is the only way to know for sure. I'm not trying to frighten you, but I need to be thorough. I can refer you to an oral surgeon for a second opinion, if you prefer. They will likely recommend the same thing. But dismissing it without investigation is simply irresponsible.
PATIENT: Fine. But if it turns out to be nothing… absolutely nothing… I expect a full apology. And I’m charging you for my time, Doctor. This whole ordeal is an utter waste. Get it over with, then. I suppose. But quickly. And gently. I have a very important meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll write you a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a very reputable oral surgeon. He’s on Elm Street. He’ll explain the procedure in detail and address any concerns you have. I'll also have my nurse schedule you for a follow-up appointment in two weeks, regardless, to discuss the results. And Mr. Schieber, while I understand your frustration, I'm obligated to prioritize your health. This isn't about wasting your time; it's about ensuring there isn't a more serious issue developing. I’ll have the nurse print out these instructions on proper oral hygiene in the meantime. Stop smoking, even if you haven't been. Avoid alcohol-based mouthwashes. And please, follow up with Dr. Ramirez as soon as possible.
