DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Grumman. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, good morning to you too. I am... tired. Very tired. Not just a little sleepy, you understand. Like... the sun goes down and I have nothing left. My wife, she says I need to see someone. Says I am not myself. She is probably right, she usually is. It's my liver, you see. They told me a long time ago, something is wrong with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Grumman. "Tired" can mean a lot of things, and it’s good your wife is encouraging you to get it checked out. It’s helpful you remember being told something was wrong with your liver previously – that’s a good starting point. Do you happen to know when you were told about your liver, or what tests were done at that time?
PATIENT: Tests... hmm. A long time ago. Maybe... fifteen years? No, more. Twenty years, maybe? At the big hospital in the city. They poked and prodded, took blood. Lots of blood. They said something about… enzymes. Were those the things? And something about… not drinking so much. I did not think it was that much, but my wife… she always said different. They just told me to watch it. I mostly did. Until now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, enzymes… that’s helpful. So, roughly twenty years ago, they found some abnormal liver enzymes and advised you to reduce your alcohol intake. And you’ve mostly followed that advice until recently?
PATIENT: Yes. “Mostly.” It’s not like I was drinking every day, you understand? Just… with friends. Special occasions. A little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. My wife… she makes a good wine. It's hard to refuse. And then… last few months, maybe a little more than usual. Stress at work. Bad news about a cousin. Things like that.
DOCTOR: I understand. Life throws things at you. And it's good you're being honest about the increased alcohol consumption recently. Stress and difficult news can definitely contribute to that. Beyond the tiredness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Let me think. My stomach… it sometimes feels… full. Even when I haven't eaten much. And… itchy. Very itchy. All over. My wife says my skin is… yellowing. I do not see it myself. Old man skin, you know? But she is very observant.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fullness even with limited food intake, generalized itching, and your wife has noticed some yellowing of your skin. That’s important information. The yellowing of the skin is called jaundice, and it can be a sign of liver problems. I'm going to listen to your abdomen and feel it gently. Just let me know if anything feels tender or painful. Then I’ll take a look at your skin. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… fine. Do what you need to do. I do not mind. My wife always says I am a tough old bird. But… be gentle. It does not feel good when you poke too hard. Especially here. <points to lower right side of abdomen>
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m noticing some mild tenderness on the right side, where you pointed, and a bit of fullness. Your liver feels slightly enlarged, but it’s hard to tell definitively without further testing. I also see some yellowish discoloration to your skin and the whites of your eyes, confirming what your wife noticed. I don’t hear any unusual sounds with the stethoscope. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will check your liver enzymes again, as well as other things like your bilirubin levels and blood counts. We may also need to do an ultrasound of your liver. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Ultrasound? Is that… safe? And blood tests… many? I do not like needles. But… if you think it is necessary. My wife… she will be happy I am finally doing something about this. Yes. Do what you think best. And please… try not to take too much blood.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question. The ultrasound is completely safe – it uses sound waves, not radiation, to create an image of your liver. As for the blood tests, we’ll take what we need to get a complete picture, and I’ll ask the phlebotomist to be as gentle as possible. I understand your aversion to needles, and we'll minimize the amount drawn. Okay, I’ve ordered the tests. The lab should be able to get you in today, and we can schedule the ultrasound for tomorrow morning. The results will take a couple of days to come back. In the meantime, it’s very important to completely avoid alcohol. Are you able to do that?
PATIENT: Completely avoid? Hmm. That may be difficult. But... for my health. Yes. I will try. Very hard. My wife will be watching, anyway. She is very good at that. What happens if… the results are bad? I do not want to think about that.
DOCTOR: That's a good attitude, and a strong commitment. We'll take it one step at a time. If the results indicate a problem with your liver, we'll discuss the best course of action. That could range from lifestyle changes and medication to further testing and, in some cases, referral to a specialist – a hepatologist, which is a doctor who specializes in liver diseases. We will have a very frank discussion about all your options. I want to assure you, we are taking it one step at a time and will address any issues as they arise. In the meantime, avoiding alcohol is the most important thing. Are there any questions I can answer for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. Not at the moment. Just… try not to take too much blood. And tell the person doing the ultrasound to be gentle. My wife… she will want to know everything. She always does. I think I am ready to go now.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll be as gentle as possible with both the blood draw and the ultrasound. I'll make sure your wife is kept informed, as you requested. Here’s the lab requisition and the appointment information for the ultrasound. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. Thank you for coming in today, Mr. Grumman. I'm glad you took this step.
PATIENT: Yes, goodbye to you too. Thank you, Doctor. Hope they don’t take too much blood.
