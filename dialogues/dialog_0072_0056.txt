DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I am Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s rather… inconvenient, truthfully. All this fuss. I was told, by… someone, that I had to come. Something about… stress. Honestly, I’ve been a teacher for a very long time. One expects a bit of… bother. It’s the students, you know. Always the students. It’s not what it used to be, I assure you.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds like you were encouraged to come in due to stress related to your work. And you feel this is… simply a part of the job?
PATIENT: Encouraged is a… polite way to put it. More like told. And yes, of course it’s part of the job! When I started, students had respect. Now… now it’s all about… well, I don’t even know what it’s about. It’s… disheartening. And frankly, a waste of my time to explain it to you. I’ve got a great deal to do, you know. Books to… organize.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer. However, to properly address what’s going on and rule out any underlying medical causes for your feelings – and perhaps offer some assistance – I do need a bit more information. Could you describe how this stress manifests?
PATIENT: Manifests? Are you… a doctor or a poet? Honestly. It means… I'm tired. I don’t sleep as well. I find myself… irritated. Easily irritated. And I have… a general feeling of… unwellness. But I assure you, it's not anything serious. It’s just… life. Really.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Schlatterer. While it may feel like simply “life,” these symptoms – fatigue, irritability, and a general feeling of unwellness – can be indicative of a number of things. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about your sleep?
PATIENT: My sleep? What is there to tell? I lie down. I attempt to sleep. Sometimes I succeed. Sometimes I don't. I used to have a very regular schedule, of course. But… things change. Now, I wake up several times a night. Thinking about… things. Mostly… students. And the state of the library. Honestly, it’s a disaster. Are we going to discuss my students all day?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Schlatterer, we are not going to discuss your students all day. I am merely trying to understand the nature of your sleep disturbances. You mentioned waking up several times a night. Can you recall what you are thinking about when you wake up?
PATIENT: Honestly? I barely remember. Fragments. Disorganized thoughts. A book out of place, a student behaving… inappropriately. A misplaced decimal point in the catalog. It's all… jumbled. It’s not as if I have a detailed log of my nocturnal anxieties! I’m eighty-seven years old, not a… a researcher!
DOCTOR: I understand. Disorganized thoughts and fragmented recall are certainly… common. To rule out anything further, I’d like to ask a few more general questions. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Well, I eat. One must eat, of course. I don’t have much time for elaborate meals, I assure you. Mostly… soup. And toast. It’s sufficient. I don’t go out of my way to… indulge. Honestly, the thought of a large meal sounds… exhausting.
DOCTOR: I see. A reduced appetite, along with fatigue and disturbed sleep… Have you experienced any weight loss recently, Mr. Schlatterer?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Good. Probably needed it. I wasn't one to put on weight. I have never been one to put on weight. Perhaps a pound or two, but hardly anything worth mentioning. I find these questions terribly… intrusive, truthfully.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Schlatterer, but these questions are necessary to get a complete picture of your health. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Excuse me? I think we've gone far enough! I came here because someone insisted I was… stressed! I hardly came to discuss… that with a complete stranger. This is… preposterous! I think I’ve had enough. I’m quite finished. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. It seems you are not interested in exploring potential medical causes for your symptoms. However, I would strongly recommend a follow-up appointment to discuss your concerns further. I'll make a note of your resistance to a full assessment. Before you leave, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
