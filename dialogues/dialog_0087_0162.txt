DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Kristofik. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It's good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have a lot of time. Just…my stomach. It's been puffed up. Feels like I swallowed a balloon, you know? Not comfortable. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: I understand you're short on time, sir. But to best assist you, I do need a bit more information. “Puffed up” can mean different things to different people. Could you describe the bloating further?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. It’s…bigger. My gut, I mean. Like, I usually have a bit of a…well, you see me. It's just…rounder. And harder. Not like gas pains, exactly. Just…full. I don’t know why it's full, that’s what I came here to figure out. Honestly, I haven't been eating anything different. Maybe a little more bread lately…but who doesn't like bread? Is that important? It just…happened, alright? A few weeks ago, maybe. It's been sticking around.
DOCTOR: Okay, “rounder and harder” for a few weeks. No significant changes in diet other than possibly increased bread intake. And no associated pain, specifically. Has this fullness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I guess. It's worse at night. After I eat, usually. Then it kinda…settles. Not completely gone, just…less noticeable. And sometimes I wake up feeling it pretty bad. Like I haven't digested anything at all. It’s just…annoying, okay? I just want it to stop. Is this something serious? Because I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Kristofik. We’ll work to figure out what’s going on. To help me narrow things down, could you tell me a little more about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Ugh. Seriously? You gotta ask about that? Look, it's…regular enough. I go. It's not…like, a disaster, if that's what you’re getting at. Normal color, I guess. Sometimes a little…harder than usual, now that you mention it. But nothing crazy. I'm a grown man, I know what normal is. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: I apologize for the line of questioning, sir, but it's important information. So, generally normal, but perhaps a little harder stools lately. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any changes in its color beyond just harder consistency?
PATIENT: No! No blood. Look, I told you, normal! Maybe a little harder. Everything's a big deal with you people. It’s not…black or anything. Just…solids. Regular solids. I don’t spend all day inspecting my…waste, alright? I just noticed it wasn't as easy to…pass, sometimes. Is that good enough? I got a job to do. Pile driving doesn't wait for stool inspections.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, no blood, generally normal color, slightly harder stools. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No vomiting. And no, I haven't lost weight! If anything, I'm probably…bigger. You know, from the…bloating. I ain’t exactly wasting away. Look, I’m a working man. I eat. I lift. I…exist. Is this getting anywhere? I’m starting to feel like I’m being interrogated.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Mr. Kristofik. I am simply gathering information to help determine the cause of your discomfort. One final question before we move on to a brief physical exam, if you’re agreeable. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had allergies. I'm a Somali man, we're pretty tough. Dust, dirt, a little sunshine...doesn't bother me. Maybe a bit sensitive to…stupid questions, but that's about it. Can we just get this over with? The exam, I mean.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could please lie down on the examination table, we'll begin with listening to your abdomen and then palpating it to assess the fullness you've described. I will need to examine your abdomen, so please let me know if anything causes discomfort.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just…be quick about it, alright? I don’t like being poked and prodded. And try not to make it weird.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. I will be as efficient as possible. I'm listening for bowel sounds now. Can you tell me if you’ve had any recent surgeries or significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never needed 'em. Just…bumps and bruises from the job. Pile driving, you know? It's not exactly a desk job. One time I twisted my ankle pretty bad, but they just wrapped it. Significant medical conditions? My wife…she passed away a few years back. Cancer. But that was…her. I'm relatively healthy, alright? Just this stupid bloating.
DOCTOR: I’m palpating your abdomen now. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness. I do note some firmness to your abdomen, particularly in the lower quadrants. Is this where you experience the most fullness?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's it. Right there. Lower down, kinda in the middle. It feels…tight. Not painful, exactly, just…full. Like someone pumped air into my gut. And sometimes it feels…gassy, even though I'm not…you know. It's weird. Honestly, I haven't felt right since…well, since my wife passed. Maybe it's just stress? Is that a thing?
DOCTOR: Percussion reveals some tympany, which is consistent with gas. Stress can certainly contribute to gastrointestinal symptoms. Given your symptoms – the bloating, firmness, absence of pain but presence of fullness, and slightly harder stools – and considering your recent history, I’m considering a few possibilities. It could be related to increased gas production, potentially from dietary factors, or it could be something more. I would like to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. Would that be agreeable?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Ugh. Look, I don’t do well with needles. But…fine. If it gets me out of here faster, I guess. But you gotta promise me you won't find anything terrible. I just want this bloating to stop. Can we just get it over with? I got things to do, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Kristofik. The blood tests will provide us with valuable information to help determine the cause of your bloating. I can assure you we will discuss the results thoroughly. I’ll have the lab technician draw the blood now. Afterwards, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and formulate a plan. Please have a seat in the waiting room and they will call your name shortly.
PATIENT: Fine. Just…wake me up when it's over.
