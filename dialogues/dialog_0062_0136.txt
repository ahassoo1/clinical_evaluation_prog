DOCTOR: Hi Lucia, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… it’s my… burping. I burp a lot. It’s been… a while now. Not sick burps, just… regular ones. A lot of them.
DOCTOR: Okay, “a lot of burps” for a while now. Can you tell me a little more about that "a while"?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe… three months? Something like that. It started slow, just after meals, you know? Now it’s… pretty much all the time. Not every second, but… often. It doesn’t hurt, it’s just… annoying. And sometimes… a little embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months, started after meals and now pretty constant. No pain, just annoying and sometimes embarrassing. That's helpful to know. And is there anything specific you're eating or drinking when it seems worse?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. I think… soda makes it worse? And… beans, definitely beans. But sometimes it happens even if I don't eat anything special. I drink a lot of water too, maybe that has something to do with it? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Okay, soda and beans seem to be triggers, but it happens even with just water. That's good information. Besides the burping, have you noticed any other symptoms along with it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmm… Not really. My stomach sometimes feels a little… full? Even if I haven't eaten much. But it’s not pain, just… bloated. And maybe… a little tired, but who isn’t tired these days? I don’t know if that’s connected.
DOCTOR: Okay, some bloating and tiredness, but nothing major. That's good to know. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing… serious. I had… the flu once, maybe twice? And I broke my arm when I was a little girl. But no… doctors telling me I have something. Just… normal things, I think. I don't go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical history. Just the flu and a broken arm as a child. And you don’t typically see the doctor often. Good to know. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries. Not even… little ones. I don't like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Understandable! Now, can you tell me about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my mom and dad are both okay, they’re older now, in Cuba. My sister lives in Miami. No one… has this burping problem. Or… not that I know of. My mom always had a sensitive stomach, but this is… different. They are healthy, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, family is generally healthy, with your mom having some sensitivity but nothing like this. And just to get a full picture, what do you do for work, and what’s your lifestyle like?
PATIENT: I work… I’m an Industrial Engineering Technician. At a factory, making… things. It's okay work. I mostly sit at a computer, or walk around checking things. And… I don’t really do much. I come home, cook, watch TV. Not a lot of exercise, I’m sorry. I should, I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Industrial Engineering Technician, mostly sedentary work. Understandable. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. No medications. Not even… headache pills. I try to avoid them, if I can. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that's it. And I stopped taking that a few weeks ago. It didn’t seem to help with the burping.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications and you stopped the multivitamin because it wasn't helping. And lastly, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I’ve… eaten everything, pretty much! Never had a problem. I like food! Not that's it's helping with the burping, but...no allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to hear. Alright Lucia, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m listening to your stomach now. It sounds… a little hyperactive. Not alarming, but more active than usual. And this isn't tender, which is good. Lungs sound clear. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, no pain. It feels… normal. A little pressure, but not bad. It always feels a little soft, I think. But no pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain with palpation, just a slightly soft abdomen. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing excessive gas, possibly related to your diet and lifestyle. The fact that it's not accompanied by pain or other symptoms is reassuring. However, it’s persistent, and that’s why we want to investigate further. To rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order a few simple tests. A complete blood count to check for any underlying inflammation, and a stool test to rule out any infection or malabsorption. Does that sound okay to you?
PATIENT: Tests…? Um… okay. If you think it's best. I don't like going to the hospital, but… I want to feel better. What does… stool test mean? Do I… have to bring something with me?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns. A stool test simply involves collecting a small sample of your stool – it's not pleasant, but it's a very quick and painless procedure. You’ll be given a container and instructions on how to collect the sample at home and bring it to the lab. It will help us rule out any hidden causes of the gas, like a bacterial imbalance or a food intolerance. The blood test is just a routine blood draw that will give us a general overview of your health. Both tests are relatively quick and straightforward. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… I think so. Collect… a sample? Okay. At home. It’s… not very nice, but if you think it's important… And blood test too. Okay. Can you… give me the instructions? And tell me where I need to go for the blood test? I hope it doesn't cost too much. I don't have insurance.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here are the instructions for the stool test. It's pretty detailed, but please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions. It's important to follow the instructions carefully for the most accurate results. And for the blood test, you can go to the lab at Suburban General Hospital - it's just down the street, at 123 Main Street. They have a payment assistance program for patients without insurance, so please explain your situation when you check in. They’ll be able to work with you. I’ll write down the lab's phone number for you as well, in case you want to call ahead and ask about their pricing. We’ll get the results back in a few days. Once we have those, we can discuss a plan to get this burping under control. In the meantime, you might want to try avoiding carbonated drinks, beans, and other foods that seem to trigger it. Smaller, more frequent meals can also help. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Carbonated drinks and beans… okay. I can try that. And smaller meals. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for the phone number. I hope the tests aren't too bad. I really just want to be able to eat without… this.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lucia. I understand, and we'll do our best to figure out what's going on and get you some relief. If you experience any severe symptoms like abdominal pain, fever, or blood in your stool, please call the clinic immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Otherwise, take your time, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Lucia. And we'll see you soon.
