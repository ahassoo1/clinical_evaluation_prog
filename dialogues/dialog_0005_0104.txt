DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ottaviani. Good morning. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Look, I haven’t got all day, so let’s just get on with it, alright? My throat… it hurts. Real bad. Been hurting for… well, a little while now. I don't really keep track of things like that. Is that enough information for you?
DOCTOR: Alright. A sore throat. “A little while now” isn’t terribly specific, but we’ll work with it. Is it constant pain, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. It… it just is. Sometimes it’s worse when I… swallow, I think. And when I talk, maybe. I don't know. Look, I work with machines all day, very loud machines. It’s hard to notice these things, alright? I separate and filter and clarify… very important work. Not like sitting around all day. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Okay. So, it’s worse with swallowing and talking. Any fever, chills, cough, or runny nose accompanying the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever? Honestly, I haven't taken my temperature in… well, I don't think ever. I don't get sick. I’m a strong woman. I work hard. Cough? Maybe a little, but that’s just from all the dust at the plant, alright? It's always dusty. A runny nose… I don't recall. I just want something for my throat, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we need to rule out a few things before I can just prescribe something. Have you noticed any white patches on your tonsils, difficulty breathing, or any pain in your ears?
PATIENT: White patches? Look, Doctor, I didn’t come here for a lesson in… in body parts. I just want this pain to stop. I don't poke around in my mouth. Difficulty breathing? No. I breathe just fine. Ears? They… ring sometimes, from the machines. It's a very noisy job, alright? Are you going to help me, or just ask questions? My time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, I am trying to help you, but I need information to make an informed decision. It's important to understand what we're dealing with before giving you anything. Have you had strep throat before?
PATIENT: Strep…throat? Never heard of it. Look, I told you, I don't get sick. I work. I separate and filter and clarify. My husband... my late husband, he used to take care of all that. I barely remember… what year was it? Everything gets blurry after… never mind. Just give me something for the pain, alright? It's probably just… irritation. From the dust. From talking too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just take a quick look at your throat. Please open wide and say "Ah." I'm going to use a tongue depressor and a light.
PATIENT: Ah… There. Happy now? It’s probably nothing. Just dust. And… and a little irritation. Can we be done now? Really, I haven't got all day, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay. Your throat is quite red and swollen. It’s difficult to tell much with a quick look, but it doesn’t appear to be a severe case. I’m going to listen to your lungs quickly, just to rule anything else out. Please take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Alright, there. Happy? It’s just dust, I tell you. I work with machines all day. Very noisy, very dusty machines. Can we please get this over with? I have things to do, alright? Important things. Not like… sitting around.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your lungs sound clear. It’s likely a viral pharyngitis, or inflammation of the throat. It sounds like it’s not a serious infection. However, because you haven’t been formally diagnosed with anything before, I'd like to be cautious. I'm going to order a rapid strep test, just to rule out strep throat. It’s a quick swab, and it will give us a result in about ten minutes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A swab? Really? Must you poke and prod? Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with quickly, alright? But if it's nothing, I expect a full refund of my time. And… don't touch my tongue, alright? It’s very sensitive. And… and be gentle. I have things to do. Important things.
DOCTOR: Alright. This will just take a moment. I’m going to gently swab the back of your throat. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. Please open wide and say "Ah." Now, let's wait ten minutes for the results. In the meantime, I’ll document our findings.
PATIENT: Hurry up, alright? This is very unpleasant. And… don't touch my tongue. I told you. Honestly, the things I do for… this. Very, very unpleasant. Can I have a glass of water when this is over? My throat is already drier than… dust.
DOCTOR: Alright, the test came back negative for strep throat. That's good. It does seem to be a simple viral pharyngitis, likely brought on by irritation. I’m going to recommend some supportive care: plenty of rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. A throat lozenge or gargling with warm salt water can also provide some relief. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Supportive care? Rest? Fluids? Honestly, Doctor, I work. I don't have time for rest. And… ibuprofen? Acetaminophen? I don’t take things. I separate and filter and clarify. That's what I do. Look, can I just get a written prescription for something, anything, so I can go? Something to numb the pain? And… is there any way to get compensated for my time wasted here today? Honestly, the things I do… .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ottaviani. While I respect your need to get back to work, I am not comfortable prescribing a medication simply to satisfy your request without a clear medical need. I can write you a prescription for a throat lozenge with benzocaine to numb the pain temporarily. However, I strongly advise you to rest and hydrate if possible, even if it means taking a short break from work. I am also unable to offer compensation for your time. Here's the prescription for the lozenges. Please follow the instructions on the label. If your symptoms worsen or do not improve within a few days, please return for a re-evaluation. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
