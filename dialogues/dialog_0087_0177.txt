DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're a new patient with our clinic. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Doctor… Soodeen, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s… down there. Something’s just not right. It’s… leaking. I don’t know what else to call it. It’s embarrassing, really. A woman my age… shouldn’t have to be dealing with this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Genard. It is often a sensitive topic, and you’ve come to the right place. “Leaking,” as you put it, can have several causes. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the leaking a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically? Oh, goodness. Well… it’s… wet. And a little smelly, if I’m being honest. Not terrible smelly, but… noticeable. It’s not like a flood, you understand. Just… a dampness. And it’s been going on… oh, I don’t know… a week? Maybe more? Time just slips away, you know? I don’t know what it looks like, I haven't really looked at it. Too… personal.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Genard. It's perfectly alright that you haven't examined it yourself. We can certainly take a look here in the examination room. To help me narrow down the possibilities, has this dampness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes, I think. Some days it’s not there at all, and I feel just fine. Other days… well, like this morning. It’s… more noticeable then. I don't really pay attention unless it's bothering me, to be honest. I’ve got better things to worry about, you know? Like my orchids. They're very fussy.
DOCTOR: Orchids are fussy, I've heard. Alright, Ms. Genard, let's do a quick examination to get a better idea of what's going on. If you don’t mind, I’ll need to ask you to change into a gown. I'll be right outside, and I’ll just be listening and checking some things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… change? Well, now. I wasn't expecting that. I suppose so. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, I’m a modest woman. But if you say so… it’s just… everything’s so exposed these days, you know? Alright, alright, I’ll change. But you be quick about it, dear. And try not to stare.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Genard. It is necessary for me to properly assess the situation. I assure you, I am very mindful of your comfort and privacy, and will be as quick and professional as possible. I'll leave the room while you change, and I’ll let you know when I’m ready to come back in. There's a gown in the closet, and I’ll be just outside. Please just call out if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Just… hurry. This is… unnerving. Young people these days… always poking and prodding. It wasn’t like this when I was young.
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, are you all set when you’re ready?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, yes, I’m ready. It’s… terribly drafty in here, you know. And this gown doesn’t do much to keep a lady warm. Just… get it over with, dear. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Genard. Thank you for your patience. Now, if you don’t mind, I'm going to start with a quick external examination, and then I may need to do a gentle internal examination to get a clearer picture. I’ll explain everything as I go, and please, don't hesitate to tell me if anything feels uncomfortable. First, let's just lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Internal? I don’t know about all this poking and prodding, dear. You're sure it’s necessary? I told you, it’s just a little dampness. It's not like I’m in pain. But… alright, alright. I suppose I have no choice. But be gentle, now. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Genard. I assure you, I will be as gentle as possible. The internal examination will help me determine the source of the dampness. It is often the most accurate way to diagnose the issue. Now, I'm just going to take a look at the external area first. I’m noting some mild redness around the labia, and a small amount of clear discharge. No significant tenderness to palpation of the abdomen. Now, to get a better understanding, I would like to perform a pelvic exam. I’ll use a speculum, which is a gently opened instrument to visualize the vaginal canal and cervix. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A speculum? Now you're just being ridiculous, dear. I haven’t heard such nonsense in all my life. It sounds… invasive. And painful. Look, I’m an old woman. I've lived a long life. A little dampness isn’t going to kill me. Maybe it's just… old age. I think I’m alright just leaving it be. I don’t see the point of all this poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, you are absolutely right to voice your concerns. Your comfort and peace of mind are my top priority. I apologize if I’ve made you feel uncomfortable or pressured. A speculum examination is not mandatory, and we can certainly proceed without one. However, I feel it's important to explain why I recommended it. While it may be “just old age,” there are several potential causes for this discharge, some of which are easily treatable and important to rule out, such as infection or prolapse. Without a proper examination, it's difficult to know for certain. We can discuss alternative options, such as a referral to a gynecologist who may be better suited to address your concerns, or we can simply monitor the situation for now. What feels most comfortable for you?
PATIENT: Oh… well. You make it sound… sensible. I don't like the sound of "infection," that’s for sure. And “prolapse”? Goodness gracious. I've got enough to worry about without all that hanging down. A gynecologist, you say? Someone who specializes in… all that? Perhaps… perhaps that would be best. Someone who isn’t going to poke and prod me unnecessarily. Yes. A referral. That sounds… reasonable. I’d like that, dear. A referral to a nice, gentle gynecologist.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Genard. That’s an excellent idea. I understand your concerns, and I’m happy to provide a referral to a qualified gynecologist. I have a list here of specialists in the area with good reputations for gentle care. I can give you a few names and numbers to choose from, and you can schedule an appointment at your convenience. In the meantime, I recommend practicing good hygiene, and if you notice any increase in odor, pain, or fever, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. I'll also document our conversation and your desire for a referral in your chart. Would you like me to print out the list of gynecologists for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A list would be wonderful. And thank you, dear. You've been… patient with an old woman. I appreciate it. It's just… everything’s so different these days. When I was young, you just dealt with things yourself. No poking and prodding, no lists of specialists… just common sense. But I suppose times change. Yes, a list would be lovely. And maybe… maybe I’ll schedule an appointment with one of them. Just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Genard. You're very welcome. It’s my pleasure. And you’re right, times have changed. It’s good to take advantage of the resources available to us. Here’s the list. They all have excellent reputations, and you can read through their profiles to find someone who feels like a good fit. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think that’s all. Just… thank you. For not laughing at an old woman and for being so patient. I really appreciate it. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll go home and put my feet up. And maybe tend to my orchids. They need me, you know.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Genard. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please do take care of yourself, and enjoy your orchids. Don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day. .
