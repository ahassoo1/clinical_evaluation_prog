DOCTOR: Bula! Hello, Sherion. I’m Dr. Kimm. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor! Is okay to call you Doctor Kimm? Yes… um, I have some pain here… <gestures to chest> It’s been happening for a few days now. Not all the time, but… it worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Yes, please do call me Doctor Kimm. And okay, you're having some chest pain. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. It’s… a squeezing feeling. Like someone is… hugging my chest too tight? It comes and goes. When I walk fast, or… climb the stairs, it gets worse. When I sit down and rest, it feels better. Does that make sense? It’s not a sharp pain, more… heavy. And sometimes, my arm… this one <points to left arm>… feels a little numb. Not always, just sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. A squeezing, heavy feeling that's worse with exertion and relieved by rest, and sometimes you get numbness in your left arm… I want to get a good understanding of everything going on. How long exactly has this been happening?
PATIENT: Let me think… <taps chin> It started… maybe five days ago? Tuesday, I think. I was doing some gardening, bending down a lot. It wasn’t too bad then, just a little uncomfortable. But yesterday… yesterday it was more noticeable. And this morning, when I woke up, it was still there. Not always there, but… I feel it. You know? Like a little worry in my chest.
DOCTOR: Okay, five days ago, starting with gardening, and getting more noticeable yesterday. And you said it's not constant, but more of a "worry" feeling. On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate the pain when it’s at its worst?
PATIENT: Hmm… zero is no pain, and ten is… really, really bad. <grimaces slightly> When it's bad… maybe a four? Five, sometimes. It doesn’t stop me from doing things, but it makes me… careful. I don’t want to push it. It’s not a pain that makes me fall down, but it makes me… stop and breathe. Is that good? Is five too much? I don't want to make it sound worse than it is.
DOCTOR: No, that's good, Sherion. It’s good you're paying attention to it and describing it so clearly. A four or five that makes you stop and breathe is definitely something we need to look into. Now, have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life. A few aches and pains, like everyone gets, but nothing like this. My husband, Ricardo, he has some problems with his knees, but I've always been good. I eat good food, I walk… not so much lately, with the heat, but I try to stay active. I don’t smoke, I don’t drink much… maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. <pauses> This is new. Really new.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know this is a new symptom for you. And it sounds like you generally live a healthy lifestyle, which is great. Now, let’s talk about other things you might be feeling. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, nausea, sweating, or dizziness along with this chest pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… shortness of breath… a little, maybe. But I live on the third floor, and the stairs… you know? So I get a little breathless sometimes even without the pain. <chuckles softly> Nausea… no, not really. Sweating… maybe a little more than usual in this heat, but I thought that was just the weather. And dizziness… no, I haven’t felt dizzy. I do feel… tired. More tired than usual, but I thought that was just getting older. <smiles weakly> Is 62 old? Sorry, I ramble sometimes.
DOCTOR: You are not rambling at all, Sherion! And 62 is certainly not old. It’s very helpful to know all of this. So, some shortness of breath, maybe a little more sweating, and increased fatigue along with the chest pain. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No, not recently. I had a little cold in March, but that was… a long time ago. I felt fine after a few days. Ricardo got the flu last winter, but I stayed away from him and didn't catch it. I always try to be careful about those things. <pauses> I got my flu shot, though, every year. And the pneumonia shot, a few years ago. I try to stay on top of things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good, you're up to date on your vaccinations. Now, let’s talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any other medical conditions, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high, so he gave me a little pill to take. Just a small one, every morning. I think that’s all. No diabetes, no cholesterol problems, nothing like that. My husband, Ricardo, he has diabetes, but I don't. <pauses> Oh! And I had my gallbladder out, many years ago. Maybe 20 years ago? But I haven’t had any problems with that since. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure that’s managed with medication, and you had your gallbladder removed 20 years ago. That's helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Just the little white pill for my blood pressure. Every morning, with my coffee. I don’t take anything else. Just vitamins sometimes, a multivitamin. But I haven’t taken one in a while, to be honest. I forget. <chuckles softly> Old age again! But really, just the blood pressure pill. And sometimes I take a little something for my knees when they bother me, but that’s not every day. It's an over-the-counter thing, you can buy it at the drugstore. <pauses> Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication daily, and occasionally an over-the-counter medication for your knees. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything. I don’t have problems with pollen or dust or anything like that. I used to have a little bit of trouble with cats when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. I haven’t been around a cat in years. <smiles> I’m pretty lucky, I guess. No allergies. <pauses> Unless you count dust when I’m cleaning, but that’s just sneezing! Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Do you have any family members who have had heart problems, like heart attacks or strokes?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father… he had a heart attack when he was older. Maybe in his 70s. He smoked a lot, though, and didn't take care of himself. My mother, she had high blood pressure, like me. And my brother, he had a stroke a few years ago. He’s doing okay now, but he has to go to therapy. <pauses> So… yes, some heart problems in the family. Mostly on my mother’s side, I think. It worries me a little, to be honest. Does that make sense? It runs in the family, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart attack in your father, high blood pressure in your mother, and stroke in your brother. It’s good you're aware of your family history. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Oh, not much, Doctor. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. When I'm feeling fancy! <chuckles softly> Ricardo likes his beer, but I don't really care for it. Just a little wine, maybe two or three times a week. Not every day, for sure. It helps me relax, you know? But I don't drink to excess, never have. <pauses> Is that okay? I don’t want to sound like a bad patient! I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: You are not a bad patient at all, Sherion! It's good to know you drink only a small amount of wine occasionally. And finally, have you ever smoked cigarettes or used any other tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. My mother always told me smoking was bad, and I listened! <chuckles softly> I don’t like the smell of it, either. Ricardo used to smoke, but he quit many years ago. He says it was the best thing he ever did. <pauses> No, never smoked. Never even tried it. It's bad for your health, you know? Is that good? I try to take care of myself, Doctor. Really, I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. That’s a lot of helpful information, Sherion. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your chest. It shouldn't take too long. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. I trust you, Doctor Kimm. You seem very nice. <smiles reassuringly> Whatever you need. Just tell me what to do. I want to know what's going on, and I want to feel better. <pauses> Take your time. I'm not in a hurry.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Sherion. Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 88. That’s a bit higher than your usual, which you said is managed with medication. Now, let’s listen to your heart. I'm listening for any unusual sounds. Your heart rhythm is regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not alarming, but something we should keep an eye on. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackling sounds. I’m just checking for any tenderness in your chest. It doesn’t seem particularly tender to the touch. Now, I’m going to check your pulse in your arms and legs. Your pulses are strong and equal on both sides. Everything seems normal so far, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and murmur warrant further investigation. Given your symptoms and what I’m hearing, I think it would be wise to order an EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity and some blood work to rule out any other potential causes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. EKG and blood work… okay. Is it… painful? The blood work, I mean. I don’t like needles. <pauses> But if you think it’s important, I’ll do it. I want to know what’s going on. It just worries me a little, you know? Is it something serious? <looks concerned>
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Sherion, and it’s good you’re asking questions. The blood work is not painful, just a quick pinch. We'll use a small needle to draw a few vials of blood from your arm. It’s over very quickly. As for whether it's serious, we don't know yet. That's why we're doing these tests – to get more information and figure out what's going on. The EKG is also painless; it just involves placing some stickers on your chest to measure your heart's electrical activity. The results will help us determine the cause of your chest pain and develop the best course of treatment. We'll rule out the most serious possibilities first. I'm going to have the nurse draw the blood now, and then we'll get you set up for the EKG. Would you like me to explain a little bit about what the EKG involves before we proceed?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Just… explain it to me. What does it show? What will you be looking for? <pauses> I get nervous easily, you see. Knowing what’s going to happen helps. <looks hopeful> And… how long will it take? And will it interfere with my blood pressure medicine? I don’t want anything to change the results. <fidgets with hands>
DOCTOR: Of course, Sherion. I understand. It’s perfectly normal to be nervous, and I’m happy to explain everything. The EKG, or electrocardiogram, is a simple test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn’t hurt at all. We'll place about 10 small stickers, called electrodes, on your chest, arms, and legs. These electrodes are connected to a machine that traces a graph of your heart's electrical signals. It’s like taking a picture of your heart's rhythm. What are we looking for?
PATIENT: Yes, please tell me. What will the picture show? And is it possible there’s nothing wrong? Maybe it’s just… stress? Or the heat? I’ve been so worried lately with my grandson starting school… <pauses> I just hope it’s nothing serious. What if it is my heart? <looks genuinely scared>
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Sherion. It’s good you’re thinking about other possibilities. The EKG can help us identify several things. We’ll be looking for any signs of a previous heart attack, irregular heart rhythms , signs of reduced blood flow to the heart , or any abnormalities in the electrical pathways of your heart. It can also tell us if your heart muscle is enlarged. And yes, it is absolutely possible that there’s nothing seriously wrong. It could very well be stress, or even the heat, as you suggested. Anxiety and hot weather can definitely cause chest discomfort. It's important to rule out any underlying heart problems first, just to be safe, and that’s what the EKG will help us do. The EKG doesn’t involve any radiation, and it won’t interfere with your blood pressure medication. It will take about 5-10 minutes to complete. You just need to lie still and relax while the machine records your heart's activity. The nurse will be right in to explain the procedure and answer any further questions you have. Do you have any questions for me right now before she comes in?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Stickers on my chest… 5-10 minutes… no radiation… won't mess up my medicine. <pauses, takes a deep breath> It’s just… scary thinking about it. My father… he didn’t take care of himself. <looks down at hands> But I’m taking my medicine. I’m trying to be good. <pauses> Okay. I guess… I guess I’m ready. Just… let the nurse be gentle, okay? I don't like needles or stickers very much. Thank you, Doctor Kimm. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherion. And absolutely, I will let the nurse know to be as gentle as possible. She’s very experienced and will make sure you’re comfortable. You’re doing the right thing by getting this checked out, and you’re already taking good care of yourself with your medication. I’ll leave you to the nurse now. She’ll explain everything one more time and get the tests started. I’ll be reviewing the results as soon as they come in and will discuss them with you. Just try to relax, and remember I’m here if you have any questions or concerns. Nurse, could you please come in and assist Sherion with the EKG and blood work?
