DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Finco. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I received some results back from a test… a test of my insides, I believe it was called an endo test. And it seems something wasn’t quite right, according to the paperwork. I must admit, I’m a little unclear on what it all means, precisely.
DOCTOR: An endo test… that would be an endoscopy, I presume. Yes, sometimes those reports can be a bit… technical. Don't worry, we'll go through it together. Do you happen to have that paperwork with you, Denis?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do. I made sure to bring everything they gave me. I always try to be prepared, though understanding it all is another matter entirely! It’s rather… detailed.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Yes, it is quite detailed. Alright, it seems you had an upper endoscopy and colonoscopy performed… on July 18th, if I'm reading this correctly. The report mentions some inflammation in your esophagus and… some polyps were found in your colon. Now, inflammation isn’t necessarily a huge cause for alarm – it can be caused by a lot of things, like acid reflux. The polyps, though… those need a little more attention. Do you recall the doctor who performed the procedure discussing the size or number of polyps with you?
PATIENT: Yes, I do recall the doctor… a very nice young man, Dr. Ramirez, I believe his name was. He did mention something about the polyps, yes. He said there were… three of them. And he used the word “small,” I distinctly remember that. Small polyps. He said we needed to keep an eye on them, but didn’t seem overly concerned at the time. He suggested a follow-up, which is why I am here, I suppose. Though, as I said, I don’t always grasp the specifics of these things. Is “small” good, Doctor? It sounds good.
DOCTOR: “Small” is generally good, Denis. It’s much better than large ones! However, even small polyps need to be monitored because they can sometimes change over time. It’s good Dr. Ramirez suggested a follow-up. Now, to get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little about your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, they’ve been… regular, I suppose. I haven’t had any major difficulties, if that makes sense. I usually go… once a day. Sometimes twice, if I’ve eaten a lot of fruit. No… no blood in my stool, and no change in… consistency, if you will. I do sometimes feel a little… bloated, especially in the evenings, but I always attributed that to… well, to simply getting older, perhaps. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. No blood in the stool is good to hear, and a consistent bowel movement is positive. The bloating… that could be related to a number of things. We’ll explore that further. Now, have you experienced any unintended weight loss recently, Denis?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. That's a good question. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, I must confess. But… thinking about it, my clothes have felt a little looser lately. Not dramatically so, but… noticeable. I hadn't consciously been trying to lose weight, certainly. I enjoy my food far too much for that! Perhaps a few pounds, Doctor? I wouldn't be able to give you an exact number, I’m afraid. I simply haven’t paid much attention.
DOCTOR: A few pounds, even unintentional weight loss, is something we should investigate. It's good you mentioned that. And, just to get a complete picture, have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. My appetite is… normal, I believe. I still enjoy my meals as much as ever. I haven’t lost any interest in food, thankfully! I still cook regularly, and I still eat a hearty breakfast. It's just… the clothes, as I said. Perhaps it's simply the summer heat, making everything feel looser. But it’s best to be thorough, isn’t it? I always appreciate a careful approach.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right – a careful approach is always best. Alright, Denis, given the small polyps, the slight unintentional weight loss, and the normal appetite, I'd like to order a few blood tests. Just routine things to start – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a test to check for inflammation. It will give us a baseline and help rule out any underlying issues. And, I’m going to recommend a repeat colonoscopy in six months. We want to monitor those polyps and see if they’ve changed in size or number. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Blood tests and another colonoscopy… I can certainly manage that. Six months is… a manageable timeframe. I trust your judgment completely. I’d rather be cautious than… well, than ignore something important. And if there is anything I need to do to prepare for the tests, please do let me know. I want to be as helpful as possible. I do apologize for being… a little vague at times. I simply don't have a medical background, you see.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Denis. It's perfectly understandable. I appreciate you being so forthcoming, and I’m happy to answer any questions you have, at any time. For the blood tests, you'll need to fast for 12 hours beforehand – no food or sugary drinks. Just water is fine. We’ll give you a detailed instruction sheet when you schedule the appointment. As for the colonoscopy, the preparation is a little more involved – it involves cleaning out your bowel, and we’ll provide very specific instructions for that as well. It's not the most pleasant process, but it's essential for a clear examination. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see. No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. I haven’t had any allergic reactions to medications in the past, as far as I recall. I had a reaction to a bee sting when I was a child, but that was many years ago. Nothing recent, and nothing related to any medications. I’ve taken antibiotics occasionally, for minor infections, but never had any trouble with those. And I’m not currently taking any medications at all, prescription or over-the-counter. Just herbal teas, Doctor. Does that answer your question? Perhaps I should mention the herbal teas… just in case?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Denis. Herbal teas are good to mention. Could you tell me which ones you typically drink?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Well, I enjoy chamomile tea most evenings, for its calming properties. It helps me sleep, you see. And I occasionally drink ginger tea, when my stomach is feeling a little unsettled. And sometimes, peppermint tea after a meal, to aid digestion. Nothing exotic, Doctor, just common herbal teas. I grow some of them myself, actually, in my small garden. It’s very relaxing. I don’t drink them in large quantities, though. Just a cup or two a day, at most. I wouldn’t think those would interfere with anything, would they? They’ve always been very good to me.
DOCTOR: No, those are unlikely to interfere with anything, Denis. You’re right to mention them, though. It's always best to be thorough. Chamomile, ginger, and peppermint are generally very safe. Okay, Denis, I think we’ve covered everything for now. We'll get those blood tests scheduled, and we’ll set up a repeat colonoscopy for six months. I’ll have the nurse give you detailed instructions for both procedures, and a list of contact numbers if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve answered all my questions, even the ones I hadn’t thought to ask yet. I appreciate your patience and your kind manner. It’s… reassuring to know you’re taking good care of me. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel much better now, knowing what to expect. I suppose there’s nothing more to do for now, then, except schedule the tests.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. The nurse is just outside; I’ll let her know you’re ready, and she’ll take care of the scheduling. Don’t hesitate to call if anything comes to mind later. It was a pleasure meeting you, Denis. Take care.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor Finco. Thank you again for everything. Goodbye.
