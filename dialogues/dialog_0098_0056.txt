DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Though I must say, these waiting rooms are…drafty. What brings me in? Honestly, it’s this job. This…teaching. It’s simply dreadful these days. Utterly dreadful. I don’t have much time, you understand. A man of my age has…commitments.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Commitments are important. But let's focus on why the teaching is dreadful. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms that are making it difficult – perhaps fatigue, trouble concentrating, or even…pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Doctor, I'm eighty-seven years old! A little ache here and there is to be expected. No, it’s not physical…though my feet do swell, sometimes. It's…the students. They have no respect, no discipline. And the curriculum! Utterly pointless modern nonsense. It’s exhausting, constantly having to…correct them. It's just…a waste of a perfectly good mind, if you ask me. Honestly, it’s the principle of the thing!
DOCTOR: I see. So the swelling in your feet… is that new, or has this been happening for a while?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Longer than I care to remember, frankly. It's worse at the end of the day, naturally. After being on my feet, dealing with…them. Though, I suppose it could be the shoes. I’ve had the same pair for…a considerable time. A man doesn’t need a closet full of footwear, you know. It’s all very…frivolous. Are we nearly finished? I have a rather important book to catalogue.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a few more questions, Mr. Schlatterer, and then we’ll get you sorted. Besides the swelling in your feet, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Doctor, at my age, everything is a change! But…let me think. I suppose I’ve been…a bit more forgetful than usual. Misplacing things, not remembering names…though that could just be the students. They’re all the same, you see. A blur of indifference. And…I haven’t been sleeping as well. Tossing and turning, thinking about…well, the state of the world. Is that relevant? It’s all quite depressing, really.
DOCTOR: <stage>I nod, writing quickly. Forgetfulness and sleep disturbance…that adds another layer. I need to get a clearer picture of the forgetfulness – is it mild, or is it interfering with his daily life?
PATIENT: Interfering? Well, I had to ask Mrs. Henderson twice today what she wanted. And I left my spectacles on the bus yesterday. It's…unsettling. Not like me at all. A man of my profession requires a sharp mind, you understand. Though, frankly, one can't expect much from the younger generation these days. They simply don’t value intellect. Perhaps it’s the…the music they listen to. Utterly dreadful. Are we quite finished?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, I understand your frustration, and I assure you, we will get to the bottom of this. Just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a broader picture. Have you experienced any dizziness, headaches, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No. Though the world is generally a rather dizzying place, wouldn’t you agree? Headaches…occasionally. A dull ache behind the eyes, usually when I'm dealing with particularly…uncooperative students. Vision…well, it's not what it used to be. Everything seems a bit…blurred. But that’s to be expected at my age. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure what all these questions are for. I simply came because…well, because I'm tired. Utterly, exhaustingly tired. Can we please just finish? I have a first edition to examine. A rather important volume, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. I understand your desire to get back to your work. Just a brief physical exam, then. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your feet. It won't take long. If you don't mind if we start with your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But please be quick. I assure you, this first edition won't catalogue itself. And, if you wouldn't mind, perhaps a comfortable chair? My back isn’t what it used to be, you understand. Though, truthfully, whose is at my age?
DOCTOR: Just lean back and relax as much as possible. I’m going to wrap this cuff around your arm now. It will tighten briefly.
PATIENT: Most uncomfortable. Honestly, the indignities of aging are quite…extensive. And rather unnecessary, if you ask me. I’ve spent my life cataloguing knowledge, contributing to society… and now I’m subjected to this… squeezing. Is there any chance this can be expedited? I really must get back to my work. This volume is a rather rare find, you see. A first edition of… well, never mind. It's probably irrelevant. Just… hurry, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, if you could just lift your arms for me, please?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure what you’re looking for. My arms are perfectly functional, thank you very much. Though a little stiff, naturally. It's the climate, you see. Damp and dreary. Not conducive to…optimal physical condition. Can we please skip this part? I really must get back to my work. This volume…well, it’s simply too important to delay.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schlatterer. No need to strain yourself. Let’s move on. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look at your feet. If you could just remove your shoes and socks, please.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, the indignities continue. A man of my stature… subjected to such… examinations. And all for a little swelling! I assure you, it’s nothing serious. Simply the consequences of a life well-lived… and dealing with particularly… challenging students. Can we please expedite this process? This volume…well, it's a first edition, you see. Utterly irreplaceable.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Schlatterer. I see some swelling here, as you mentioned. Does this cause any pain?
PATIENT: A little, yes. Though I’ve had this swelling for years, as I’ve already explained. It’s worse at the end of the day, naturally. After being on my feet, dealing with… well, you know. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not sure what you’re trying to ascertain. I simply came because I’m tired. Utterly exhausted. And this volume… it’s a first edition, you see. Quite rare. A truly important piece of literature. Can we please wrap this up? I have a catalogue to complete.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. I understand. Just a few more quick questions, and then we can discuss a plan. Are you experiencing any shortness of breath, or any chest pain?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Good heavens, no! I walk to work every day. Though the air quality has been… deplorable lately. And chest pain? Only emotional distress, Doctor. Caused by… well, by the state of the world. And, of course, the students. Honestly, they’re a constant source of… aggravation. Can we please conclude this examination? This volume… it's a first edition, you see. A truly remarkable piece of work. And it won't catalogue itself.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of fatigue and some swelling in your feet, which has been ongoing for a while. You’ve also mentioned some forgetfulness. Given your age and these symptoms, I think it would be prudent to order a few simple blood tests to rule out any underlying issues, and perhaps an EKG to check your heart. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? An EKG? Honestly, Doctor, this is… excessive. I simply came because I’m tired! Utterly exhausted! And this volume… It is a first edition, you see! A truly remarkable piece! I have commitments, you understand? A catalogue to complete! I haven’t got time for…tests. Can we at least discuss a solution that doesn’t involve…medical procedures? Perhaps a strong cup of tea? Or a quiet room to rest? Honestly, I haven’t felt this agitated in years.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer, I understand your reluctance. Perhaps we can start with a more conservative approach. We could try some simple lifestyle changes—making sure you're getting enough rest, staying hydrated, and perhaps elevating your feet at the end of the day. And I can give you a referral to a podiatrist to address the swelling in your feet. How does that sound?
PATIENT: A podiatrist…that I suppose is acceptable. And rest…yes, rest is always a good idea. Though finding the time is…challenging, given my commitments. And elevating my feet…well, it’s not the most dignified position for a man of my stature, but I suppose I can manage. But I must insist, Doctor, that I have a very busy schedule. This volume… it's a first edition, you see. Quite rare. And it won’t catalogue itself. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Perfectly understood, Mr. Schlatterer. We will work around your schedule. I'll write you a referral to a podiatrist, and a note outlining the recommendation for rest and elevation. I'll also have the nurse give you some information on managing fatigue. And if you don't see any improvement, or if your symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We can always revisit the option of further testing. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds…acceptable. A reasonable plan. I appreciate your…flexibility. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must get back to work. This volume… it's a first edition, you see. And it’s waiting for me. Thank you for your time. Though, frankly, I’m not sure what all the fuss was about. A little tired, a little swelling… it’s all part of growing old. Good day, Doctor.
