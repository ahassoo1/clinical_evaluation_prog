DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I am Dr. Blim. Please, have a seat. Now, to what do I owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t the faintest idea why I’m here. My…assistant, I believe, scheduled this. Something about…being tired? It’s all rather ridiculous, if you ask me. I’ve been a librarian for…well, a very long time, and one is expected to be diligent. It’s not as though these youngsters understand the value of hard work these days.
DOCTOR: Indeed. Well, your assistant may have had some valid concerns, regardless of your…commitment to your profession. “Tiredness” can be symptomatic of a multitude of things, Mr. Schlatterer. Let’s attempt to clarify. When did you first begin to notice this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I first notice… Honestly, Doctor, time blurs. Probably…around the time they decided to replace the card catalog with these…computers. It was a disaster, a complete and utter disaster. All that…clicking and flashing. Very unsettling. I suppose it’s been…years? Perhaps a decade? I really haven’t kept track. It’s not something one discusses, you understand.
DOCTOR: A decade, you say. And has this fatigue been constant over that period, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant? Good heavens, no. There are peaks and valleys, naturally. Peaks when I have to…deal with the incompetence of the new hires. And valleys when…well, when I can avoid them entirely. It’s more…intense lately, if I’m being honest. More draining. But one must persevere, wouldn’t you agree? It’s not as though these books will organize themselves.
DOCTOR: Perseverance is admirable, Mr. Schlatterer, certainly. However, ignoring a persistent symptom is rarely advisable. Now, aside from the fatigue, have you noticed any other changes in your health?
PATIENT: Changes? Doctor, I am eighty-seven years old. Naturally, there are changes! My knees ache, my back protests, and my memory…well, you’ve likely observed that already. Is that what you mean? Because frankly, listing every ailment would take all day, and I have a perfectly good collection of first editions that require my attention.
DOCTOR: I understand your…frustration, Mr. Schlatterer. However, we must differentiate between the expected effects of aging and something potentially more concerning. Specifically, have you experienced any shortness of breath, chest pain, unexplained weight loss, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… hmm. I do occasionally find myself a bit…winded when climbing the stairs to the rare books collection, but that’s hardly new. Chest pain, no. Appetite…well, I’ve never been one for large meals. I prefer a light tea and a biscuit, thank you very much. Weight loss… perhaps a pound or two? But I suspect that’s simply due to the dreadful cafeteria food they serve these days. It’s all… processed. Simply dreadful.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, no. I’ve never been one for taking pills. A bit of chamomile tea solves most ailments, you know. Though…there was that unfortunate incident with the penicillin when I was a boy. A rather nasty rash, I recall. But that was…ages ago. Before the war, even. I’ve been perfectly healthy ever since, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? Good heavens, no! I get all the vitamins and minerals I need from a balanced diet and a good book. Honestly, these youngsters and their…fads. No, Doctor. Absolutely nothing. I wouldn't dream of polluting my system with those…chemicals. Perhaps a bit of honey in my tea, if that counts. But that’s simply for soothing the throat.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, Mr. Schlatterer, to proceed with a proper assessment, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick neurological assessment. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A…physical examination? Really, Doctor? Must we? I assure you, I am perfectly capable of assessing my own health. I’ve been a librarian for decades, you know. One develops a certain…awareness of one’s surroundings. But…very well. If you insist. Though I warn you, I am rather sensitive to cold stethoscopes. And please, be gentle. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Of course. If you'll just follow me. And I'll be as…considerate as possible. Please, sit here. I'll begin with your blood pressure. Now, just relax, and try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: Honestly, the indignity of it all. One spends a lifetime cataloging knowledge and ends up being poked and prodded by a… well, never mind. Just get it over with, Doctor. And do try not to linger. I have a first edition of Dickens waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is…elevated. 158 over 92 on the right arm, and 160 over 95 on the left. Now, if you’ll please take a deep breath. Breathing is slightly diminished on the lower lobes, with some faint crackles noted bilaterally. Now, just follow my instructions. Can you squeeze my hand?
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient? Honestly, Doctor, I’m not accustomed to physical exertion. All this…handling. It’s quite…distracting. And these rooms are terribly cold. Is there no warmth to be found anywhere? Perhaps a blanket?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, please extend your arms. Reflexes are diminished, particularly in the lower extremities. Now, Mr. Schlatterer, based on this brief examination, and your responses to my questions, I believe some further investigation is warranted. Your blood pressure is significantly elevated, your breathing is diminished, and your reflexes are weak. We need to rule out any underlying cardiac or pulmonary issues. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an EKG, and a chest X-ray. Do you consent to these tests?
PATIENT: Good heavens. Tests? More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming quite…excessive. Is this absolutely necessary? I assure you, I feel perfectly well – aside from the general fatigue, of course. But…very well. If it will put your mind at ease. I suppose. But I trust these tests won't take all day? I have a rare book auction to attend next week.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Schlatterer. These tests are standard procedure to rule out any serious underlying conditions. The lab is just down the hall. They'll draw some blood, and the technician will perform the EKG and arrange for the chest X-ray. It should take approximately two hours, give or take. I'll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results once they are available. Do you have any questions before you proceed?
PATIENT: Questions? No, no. Just…get it over with. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can return to my books. And please, tell your assistant to schedule the follow-up appointment for a time that doesn't interfere with my auction. It's a first edition of Bleak House, you understand. A rather important event.
DOCTOR: Very well. My assistant, Ms. Rodriguez, will escort you to the lab. She’s been fully briefed on your schedule. And Mr. Schlatterer…please, try to rest. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
PATIENT: Emergency room… Honestly. Such drama. Very well. I suppose one must endure these…modern inconveniences. Bleak House… that’s all that matters.
