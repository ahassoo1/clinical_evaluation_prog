DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I’m Dr. Dechene. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s a bit… complicated. My daughter, she wants… a baby. And she thinks I should come with her, to… talk about things? Before it happens, she said. I don't really understand all of it, to be honest. I just want to make sure everything is okay, for her… and the baby, of course. Is that… right?
DOCTOR: Right. A pre-conception consultation for your daughter, with you accompanying her. I see. Though, frankly, it’s unusual for the father to be involved at this stage. But, alright. Let’s start with you, Mr. Verrall. Just to get a baseline. How is your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh… well, I get by. A few aches and pains, you know, for a man my age. I try to walk a bit, but not as much as I should. I haven't been to the doctor in… a long time, I think. I don’t really feel sick, if that makes sense. Just… old. Does that help? I don’t remember any big illnesses, nothing serious… but my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: "Old" isn't a diagnosis, Mr. Verrall. And vague recollections aren't particularly helpful. Alright. Have you been diagnosed with anything at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… I think the doctor, years ago, said something about my blood pressure? It was a bit high, maybe? But they gave me some… pills, and I took them for a while. I don't remember exactly when that was. And I stopped taking them eventually. It just… didn't seem like a big deal, honestly. I really can’t recall much more detail about it. Sorry. Is it important?
DOCTOR: Uncontrolled hypertension, history of… medication non-compliance. Wonderful. And any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat… most things. Sometimes my skin gets a bit itchy, but I always thought that was just the weather. Or maybe something I touched. Nothing… serious enough to go to the doctor about, never. I don't really remember ever having a bad reaction to anything, not really. Does dust count? I sneeze a lot.
DOCTOR: No, dust doesn't count, Mr. Verrall. Let's move on. Are you currently taking any medications, prescriptions or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No… not right now. Like I said, I stopped taking those blood pressure pills a long time ago. I might take something for a headache sometimes, if it's really bad, but it’s just… whatever’s at the store. I don’t take anything regularly, if that makes sense. I try not to, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That’s a tricky one. My father… he had a bad heart, I think. He died when I was young. My mother… she lived a long life, but I don’t really remember any specific illnesses she had. She just… got old, I suppose. My sister… she’s still alive, but we don’t talk much anymore. I don't really know anything about her health, sorry. It's hard to remember… and we weren't close. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: History of cardiovascular disease in father. Unremarkable maternal history. Limited information. And your social history, Mr. Verrall?
PATIENT: Social…? Oh. You mean… do I drink? Smoke? I used to smoke, a long time ago, when I was younger. But I quit, years and years ago. And I… occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner. Maybe once or twice a week? Nothing heavy, just a small glass. I don't do… anything else. I live a quiet life. Mostly at home, reading. Does that… help? I don't go out much anymore.
DOCTOR: Minimal alcohol use, former smoker. Alright. Now, I understand your daughter is planning a pregnancy. Do you know anything about her medical history?
PATIENT: Oh… she tells me bits and pieces. She's healthy, I think. She goes to the doctor regularly, more than I ever did. I know she’s been trying to… get ready, for a while now. Taking vitamins, I think? And she asked me to come here, to… make sure everything’s okay on my side. I don't really know the details of it, sorry. She's the one who knows all the… medical things. I just want to support her, you know? Is there anything specific you need to know about her?
DOCTOR: This is… less helpful than I anticipated. Very well. I’ll access her electronic record. Just a moment… Alright. It appears she's had routine prenatal screenings. No significant concerns noted thus far. Now, Mr. Verrall, I need to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment of your current health status. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just… let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. My knees aren’t what they used to be, so getting up and down might be a bit… tricky. And I get a bit cold easily. Just thought you should know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the examination table. I'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. 150/90. Not ideal. And pulse is… somewhat irregular. Murmur present. Noted. Soft, non-tender. 2+ bilaterally. Your cardiovascular health is… suboptimal. Given your blood pressure, irregular pulse, and murmur, I recommend a full cardiac work-up. An EKG and echocardiogram, at minimum. And I strongly advise you to consult a cardiologist.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That… doesn’t sound good. A cardiac… what was it? Work-up? And a… cardiologist? Is that… serious? I just wanted to make sure everything was okay for my daughter’s baby. I didn’t realize I would need… all this. Is it… expensive? I don't have insurance, you see. Will it cost a lot of money? I just… I'm a bit worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s prudent to assess your cardiac status, Mr. Verrall. Your blood pressure is significantly elevated, and the murmur requires further investigation. As for cost… yes, it will likely be expensive without insurance. I can provide you with a list of cardiologists who offer sliding scale fees, and perhaps there are charitable organizations that can assist with coverage. However, delaying assessment could have… serious consequences. We need to rule out any underlying cardiac issues before proceeding with your daughter’s pregnancy. I will also provide you with a referral for an EKG and echocardiogram. And I strongly recommend you schedule an appointment with a cardiologist as soon as possible. This is not something to be delayed, Mr. Verrall. Your health is… a priority.
PATIENT: Oh… I see. Well… okay. If you think it’s important. A sliding… scale? I’ll ask around, see if my daughter can help. She's good with that sort of thing. I just… I feel a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. So much to worry about. Is there… anything else I need to do right now? Or is that all for today? I just want to get this over with, if that makes sense. And go home and… sit down. It’s been a long morning. .
DOCTOR: The referral slip contains the cardiologist's contact information and instructions for scheduling an appointment. I also suggest you begin monitoring your blood pressure at home. I can provide you with a list of affordable home blood pressure monitors. And please, avoid strenuous activity until you’ve been evaluated by a cardiologist. Do you have any questions before I conclude the consultation?
