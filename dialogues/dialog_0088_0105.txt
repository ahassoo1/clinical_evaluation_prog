DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about getting surgery. For my weight, I mean. I think my wife set this up. I don’t really remember all the details, to be honest. Something about checking if I’m okay for it?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re exploring weight loss surgery. That's perfectly alright that you're not sure of all the details; we can go through everything together. So, just to confirm, you’re Bradlee Kochubey, age 38. I see here you’re uninsured. And it looks like your height is listed as 155 centimeters and your weight as 139 pounds. Is that all correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. 155… centimeters. And 139… pounds. I think so. It’s been a while since I checked, honestly. I mostly just know I’ve… been bigger lately. And my wife said something about getting a check-up before anything else. Does it matter that I don’t remember the exact numbers?
DOCTOR: It’s alright if you don’t remember the exact numbers. We'll re-check them here today, and it's more important to get an accurate measurement now. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a little bit about how long you've been concerned about your weight?
PATIENT: Um… a long time, I guess. It feels like it’s always been a bit of a struggle, but it’s definitely gotten worse in the last… few years? Maybe five years or so? I don’t know exactly. It’s hard to pinpoint. I just… get tired easier now. And clothes don’t fit anymore. That’s when my wife started talking about… options.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about five years of noticing a gradual weight gain, along with feeling more tired and clothes fitting differently. That gives me a starting point. Besides the tiredness and clothes not fitting, have you noticed any other changes in your health?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think… My knees bother me sometimes, especially when I go up the stairs. And… I get out of breath pretty easily now, even with just walking. I used to be able to walk for miles, but now… not so much. Oh, and I think I snore a lot. My wife complains, anyway. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that definitely counts. Knee pain, shortness of breath, and snoring—those are all important things to know. Have you tried anything to lose weight in the past?
PATIENT: Yeah, a few things. I tried a diet once, a long time ago. It was… really strict. Didn’t last long. And I tried to go to the gym a couple of times, but… I didn’t really stick with it. It’s hard, you know? I work long hours. It’s tough to find the time and… the energy. I mostly just end up eating whatever’s quick and easy.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be very challenging to make those changes, especially with a busy work schedule. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Um… Not that I know of. I haven’t been to the doctor in a while, to be honest. My wife usually handles all that stuff. I think she said my cholesterol was a little high last time, but… I don’t really remember the details. She didn’t seem too worried about it, though. I just… haven't really paid attention. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. It's alright if you aren’t sure of your medical history. We can look it up, if you’d like. Okay, I see a record from about two years ago. It does show your cholesterol was slightly elevated, but otherwise, nothing significant. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache, if I need it. Like ibuprofen, or something. Nothing regularly. Definitely nothing prescribed. My wife always says I don’t like taking pills. And… I usually just try to sleep it off, if I can. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t count as a regular medication. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… I don't think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything, that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. I don’t think my wife has ever said anything about allergies, either. I’m pretty sure I'm okay. But… it’s possible, I guess. I don’t really remember.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or obesity?
PATIENT: Hmm… That's a tough one. My dad… he had some problems with his heart, I think. But I don't really remember the details. He passed away a few years ago. And my mom… she's pretty healthy, as far as I know. She always eats a lot, but… she's always been thin. I don’t think anyone else in my family really had any major health problems. It’s… hard to say, honestly. We don't really talk about that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s alright. Just a few more questions, and then we can do a quick physical exam. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. I've never really been one for any of that. My wife doesn’t like smoking, so I never started. And I just… don’t really have an interest in drinking or anything else. I usually just drink water, or maybe some tea. I'm pretty boring, I guess.
DOCTOR: Not at all! It's good that you're prioritizing your health. Okay, last question, before we move on to a physical exam: can you briefly describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Uh, okay. Well, I wake up pretty early, around 6:00 AM. I usually skip breakfast, don’t really have the appetite. I go to work, I work in a retail store, mostly selling electronics. It’s pretty busy. I usually grab something quick for lunch, like a sandwich or a burger. I work long hours, sometimes until 8:00 PM or later. I come home, eat dinner with my wife, usually something simple like pasta or chicken. Then I just relax for a bit, watch some TV, and go to bed. It's… pretty routine. Not very exciting. I mostly just stand on my feet all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture. Thank you. Now, if you’re comfortable, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs. I’ll also take a look at your abdomen and check your reflexes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… tell me if it’s going to be uncomfortable, okay?
DOCTOR: Of course. I will. Okay, first, I'm going to take your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, and try to breathe normally. … Okay, your blood pressure is 148 over 92. That's a little elevated. Next, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. … Okay, your heart rate is a little fast, 90 beats per minute. And I hear some slight wheezing in your lungs. It's not alarming, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. … It feels a little soft, and I don’t feel any unusual masses or tenderness. And finally, I’m going to check your reflexes. Everything seems normal there. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, you have some risk factors for weight loss surgery, including a slightly elevated blood pressure, a fast heart rate, and some slight wheezing in your lungs. I also noticed your BMI is 32, which puts you in the obese category. I would recommend further investigation with some blood work to check your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and kidney function before we proceed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… okay. Blood work, right? To check everything? I trust your judgment, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary, let’s do it. I just… want to get this figured out. And… I’m hoping surgery could help. What happens next?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. So, I'm going to write you a lab order for a complete blood count, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and blood sugar. You can go to any lab that accepts your insurance – or, since you mentioned you’re currently uninsured, we can help you find an affordable option. The results usually take a few days to come back. Once I have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine if you’re a good candidate for weight loss surgery. If the results are favorable, we’ll also need to get a referral from your primary care physician and a psychological evaluation to assess your readiness for the procedure. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… a lot. But okay. A plan. Lab work first, then… the doctor and the… evaluation. Can you write down all that stuff? So my wife and I don’t forget? And… what kind of affordable lab options are there? That would be really helpful. I don't want to cause too much trouble with the money.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here you go. This list has some labs in the area that offer discounted rates for uninsured patients. I’ve also highlighted the ones that are closest to you. And this summary details each step, from the initial consultation to the post-operative care. Don’t worry, we’ll help you navigate this process every step of the way. There are programs available to assist with the cost of surgery, and our financial counselor can help you explore those options. Do you have any questions about the lab work, the process, or the financial assistance options?
PATIENT: Okay… this looks… helpful. Thank you. Um… I guess… how long does all of this usually take? From the lab work to actually having the surgery? My wife and I need to plan for time off work, and… everything else. It's a big thing, you know? And… is the surgery… safe?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is a big thing, and it's perfectly reasonable to be concerned. The timeline can vary depending on the results of your tests, how quickly we can get the referrals, and your insurance approval—or, in your case, the availability of financial assistance. Generally, from the initial consultation to the actual surgery, it can take anywhere from 3 to 6 months. As for safety, weight loss surgery, like any surgical procedure, carries some risks. However, it's generally considered safe when performed by a qualified surgeon at an accredited facility. The risks include infection, bleeding, blood clots, and complications related to anesthesia. We'll thoroughly discuss all the risks and benefits with you before proceeding, and we'll take every precaution to minimize those risks. We’ll also discuss pre-operative preparation, such as diet changes and exercise, to ensure you're in the best possible condition for surgery. Post-operative care is also crucial, and we'll provide you with detailed instructions on wound care, diet, and follow-up appointments. Do you want me to provide you with some brochures or websites with more information about the surgery and the associated risks?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Brochures would be great. And websites… anything that can help me understand it better. My wife and I can read them together. We want to make sure we're making the right decision. It's a scary thing, you know? Thank you for explaining everything. You've been very helpful. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. It’s absolutely understandable to be scared, and it’s good that you and your wife are taking the time to gather information and make a well-informed decision. Here are some brochures with detailed information about different types of weight loss surgery, the risks and benefits, and post-operative care. I’ve also written down a few websites that you might find helpful. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any further questions or concerns. We’re here to support you every step of the way. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once your lab results are back. In the meantime, feel free to reach out. Have a good day, Mr. Kochubey, and please give my best to your wife.
