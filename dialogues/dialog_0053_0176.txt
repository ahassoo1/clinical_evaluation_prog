DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. REDEYE. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Thank you. It's…well, it's these hiccups. They just won't stop. It’s been, let me see… over two days now, I think. More than 48 hours, definitely. It’s really getting annoying, honestly.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, right. Over 48 hours. Annoying is…understandable, I suppose. Usually they resolve on their own. But let's get some details. Have you tried anything to get rid of them?
PATIENT: Oh, you name it, Doctor! Holding my breath, drinking water really fast… my daughter told me to try a spoonful of sugar, that’s a silly one. I even tried getting someone to scare me, but that just made them jump! Nothing seems to work, not even for a little while. It’s just…hic. …constant.
DOCTOR: Right. So, various home remedies, unsuccessful. And they're truly constant, not just sporadic?
PATIENT: Yes, constant. Honestly, it’s…hic… exhausting. Like every few seconds, hic, there’s one. It’s interrupting everything. I’m a manager at a… well, a place with entertainment, so I need to talk to people all day. It’s making things very difficult. Do you… do you think it could be something serious?
DOCTOR: Serious is…a strong word. Prolonged hiccups are rarely a sign of something catastrophic. However, they can be indicative of underlying issues, especially if they're lasting this long. Let’s rule some things out. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying the hiccups?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Well, my throat feels a little… scratchy. Not sore, exactly, just a bit irritated. And I’ve been feeling a bit tired, but I always am, to be honest. It’s a busy job. Oh! And maybe a little heartburn, now that I think about it. Not bad, just… a warm feeling sometimes. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Scratchy throat, fatigue, heartburn… Alright. And have you experienced any difficulty swallowing, any nausea or vomiting, or any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, no difficulty swallowing. And definitely no vomiting. Nausea, maybe a little bit sometimes, but it’s probably just from the hiccups, honestly. They make me feel a bit queasy. And no, no abdominal pain. It’s mostly just… this constant hiccuping. It’s really… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your lungs, check your throat, and feel your abdomen. Just a standard check. Then we can decide if any further investigation is needed. If you don't mind.
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. Please do. Whatever you think is best. I just want these hiccups to stop!
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale. Another one… Good. Lungs sound clear. Now, open your mouth… say "ah." Throat’s a little irritated, as you mentioned. Not severely inflamed. And I’ll just palpate your abdomen… Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, no tenderness. It feels… normal. Except for the hiccups, of course. Honestly, it’s like a little jolt every time. It’s very distracting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Everything seems… within normal limits, physically. Given your age and the lack of any other significant symptoms, I suspect this is likely a case of benign, prolonged hiccups. Sometimes, they just happen. But, given the duration, and to rule out anything more serious, I'm going to order a basic blood panel—just to check your electrolytes and rule out any underlying infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. That sounds… sensible. A blood panel. Yes, that’s alright. If it makes sure nothing is seriously wrong, I’m happy to do it. Will it tell us what’s causing them, though? Or just if something else is wrong? I’m just worried it’s something I should’ve known about… something serious.
DOCTOR: It won’t necessarily pinpoint the exact cause of the hiccups, no. It’s more to rule out potential contributing factors – things like electrolyte imbalances or signs of infection. Often, hiccups are idiopathic – meaning there’s no identifiable cause. But we need to be thorough. I’ll write you a lab requisition. You can go to the lab downstairs, and they’ll draw some blood. It should only take a few minutes. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any allergies to latex or anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Oh, no allergies to latex, thankfully. Idiopathic… that sounds… complicated. So, just… wait for the results, and then see what happens? Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Aside from the things I’ve already tried, of course. Anything to soothe it, maybe? It’s really… distracting.
DOCTOR: There's not much you can do beyond what you've already attempted, to be frank. Hydration is good. Avoid carbonated beverages and spicy foods, as those can sometimes exacerbate hiccups. And try to relax – I know it’s easier said than done, but stress can certainly worsen the situation. The blood work will give us a clearer picture. I'll have the nurse take your vitals before you leave. If the hiccups become severely debilitating, or you develop any new symptoms – difficulty breathing, chest pain, severe abdominal pain – go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we'll follow up once the lab results are in. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll go get the blood work done. I just hope it stops soon. It’s… very annoying. .
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will see you now. Stop by the front desk to schedule a follow-up appointment once you have the results.
