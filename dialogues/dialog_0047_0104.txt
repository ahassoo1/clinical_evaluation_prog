DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doctor, it's my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for… a little bit now, I suppose. I don't really keep track of these things. Just want it fixed, if that's alright. I have things to do, you see. Important things.
DOCTOR: Right. "Fixed" is always the goal, isn't it?
PATIENT: Precisely. I don't have time for… lingering. Is that what you do here? Lingering? It sounds… inefficient.
DOCTOR: We aim to be as efficient and thorough as possible, Ms. Ottaviani. Now, tell me a bit more about this throat pain. When did it start, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I told you, I don't remember. A few days, maybe? A week? It doesn’t matter. It hurts when I swallow. And… it feels scratchy. Like sandpaper, almost. Is that a common thing? I don't usually get sick, you know. I'm a strong woman.
DOCTOR: Scratchy and painful swallowing… right. And is this pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It… comes and goes, I think. But it's mostly there. It's… annoying. Especially when I'm trying to… concentrate. Look, doctor, is it serious? Because I really don't have the capacity for… serious. I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Ottaviani, without examining you, it's impossible to say. However, 'mostly there' does suggest something more than just a passing irritation. Have you noticed any fever, chills, cough, or runny nose?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? Goodness, no. I don't do chills. A cough? Sometimes, perhaps. Just a little one. Old habits, you see. From… things. And a runny nose… maybe. I keep a tissue handy. But those are… unimportant. It’s the throat that’s the problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any white spots or pus on your tonsils, if you can see them?
PATIENT: Tonsils? Honestly, doctor, I haven’t been looking at my tonsils. What a thing to ask! Do you spend your days looking at people’s tonsils? I just want to know if it’s going to stop hurting. It's…distracting.
DOCTOR: It's helpful information, Ms. Ottaviani. It helps me determine the cause of the pain. Alright, let's have a quick look. Could you open your mouth for me, please?
PATIENT: Fine. But hurry, please. I have… responsibilities. And don't poke around too much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your throat is a bit red, and I do see some mild swelling. Your tonsils don't appear to have any pus or white spots, which is good. No visible lesions. Do you have any difficulty breathing, or feel like you're having trouble swallowing even liquids?
PATIENT: No. I can breathe just fine. And I drink plenty of water, thank you very much. Swallowing is… uncomfortable. But not impossible. Look, is it just a cold? Because I don’t have time for a cold. I need to be… functional.
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say definitively without further testing, but it doesn't appear to be a severe infection. It could be a viral pharyngitis – a sore throat caused by a virus. Unfortunately, those typically have to run their course. There's not much we can do about a virus other than manage the symptoms. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? I’ve never bothered with such things. I don't have time for… sensitivities. I take what needs to be taken. And if it works, it works. Honestly, doctor, this is all very… inefficient. What do I do to make it stop hurting?
DOCTOR: Alright. We can try some supportive care. I can recommend a throat lozenge or spray to soothe the irritation. And over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help with the discomfort. Plenty of rest and fluids as well, of course. Are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: Oh, little things. For my… back. And sometimes, for the… nerves. But nothing important. Just things I picked up… over time. They don't interact with anything, I assure you. I'm a very… resilient person. Look, are you sure it’s not something serious? Because I have deadlines, you see. Very important deadlines.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, I understand you have commitments. However, it's my responsibility to ensure your health. While it doesn't sound like a severe infection, it's also not something I can definitively diagnose without knowing the specific medications you're taking. Interactions are possible, even with over-the-counter remedies. Could you please list the names of those medications for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, doctor. All this fuss. Fine. There’s… naproxen, for the back. And… lorazepam, sometimes, when things get… stressful. And a vitamin D supplement. Is that all you need? Honestly, it's hardly a complex medical history. Can we please be done now?
DOCTOR: Naproxen and lorazepam… Right. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine, and combining it with even over-the-counter pain relievers can have… effects. Given your stress levels and the lorazepam use, and the fact this is persisting, I'd like to rule out a few other possibilities. I’m going to recommend a rapid strep test just to be safe. It’s a quick swab of the throat, and we’ll have the results in a few minutes. And, perhaps more importantly, I’m going to recommend you speak with a mental health professional about managing your stress. It sounds like that’s contributing to your current situation. Do you consent to the strep test?
PATIENT: A mental health professional? Are you suggesting… I’m unstable? This is outrageous! I am perfectly capable, thank you very much. And a test? Really, doctor. All this for a sore throat? Fine. Do your… test. But I expect it to be negative. And I refuse to discuss any… personal matters. Just give me something for the pain, and let me leave.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Ottaviani. I’m simply offering a suggestion for your overall well-being. Now, if you’ll open your mouth wide, I’ll take the swab. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it will be quick. While we wait for the results, I’m going to write you a prescription for a mild throat lozenge with benzocaine to help numb the pain. But, I want you to understand this is only to manage the symptoms. It does not address the underlying cause, and I still strongly encourage you to consider speaking with someone about your stress. We'll have the results in just a moment.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. And please, no further lectures. I have… important things to attend to. Frankly, I find this entire process…degrading.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, the test came back positive. You have strep throat. That’s why you’re feeling unwell, and why it’s not improving. We need to treat it with antibiotics. I’m going to prescribe you amoxicillin. It’s important you complete the full course of medication, even if you start feeling better after a few days, to prevent complications. Do you have any allergies to penicillin?
PATIENT: Positive? Antibiotics? Honestly, doctor, this is getting ridiculous. I told you, I'm a strong woman. I don't need antibiotics. And penicillin… I don't recall. Perhaps. I took a lot of things over the years. But… are you sure? Couldn’t it be… just a really bad cold? This is all very… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, the rapid strep test is a reliable indicator. And ignoring strep throat can lead to serious complications like rheumatic fever or kidney inflammation. It’s not something to take lightly. As for penicillin, even a past mild reaction warrants caution. We can do a full allergy workup, but that will take time. To be safe, I'm going to prescribe you azithromycin instead - it’s a different antibiotic. Do you understand the importance of completing the full course of medication, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished?
PATIENT: Azithromycin… fine. Whatever. Just… less fuss, please. And yes, I understand. I’m not an idiot, doctor. Take the pills, feel better, go back to work. Is that it? Can we finally be done now? I have deadlines, you know. Very important deadlines. And I’m wasting valuable time here.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is the prescription for azithromycin. Take it as directed, and please, if your symptoms worsen or you develop a rash, fever, or difficulty breathing, seek immediate medical attention. I also want to reiterate my recommendation regarding a mental health professional. Stress can significantly impact your immune system and overall health. I'm giving you a referral to a local clinic that specializes in stress management. I understand you have commitments, Ms. Ottaviani, but taking care of yourself is also a commitment. Do you have any further questions for me?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. I have everything I need. And I assure you, doctor, my health is perfectly manageable. Thank you for your… time. Good day. And please, don't expect to see me again.
