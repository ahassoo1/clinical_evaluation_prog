DOCTOR: Hi Arbie, it’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it's about my…bathroom habits, I suppose you'd call it. Not something a man likes to discuss with a woman, naturally, but here we are. There was blood. In the stool. A few times now. Don't know what's causing it, and frankly, I doubt it's anything serious. Probably just something I ate.
DOCTOR: Okay, Arbie, I understand. It is a bit sensitive to talk about, and I appreciate you being open with me. It’s good you’re getting it checked out, even if you suspect it’s nothing major. Blood in the stool is always worth investigating. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Investigating? Honestly. I’ve lived 88 years, seen a lot, and I doubt you can tell me anything I don’t already know. But fine. It wasn't a lot of blood, mind you. More like…streaks. Dark red. And it happened after…well, after a particularly good steak. Though it's happened once or twice since then with other things, not just steak. And it’s not every time, you understand. Just…sometimes. I used to have a strong constitution, you know. Things just aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand you’ve lived a long life and have a good sense of your body, Arbie. I’m not trying to tell you anything, just gathering information to help figure out what might be going on. It’s helpful that you noticed it wasn't a large amount and that it’s intermittent. Dark red blood can sometimes indicate bleeding closer to the rectum, while brighter red blood often suggests a source higher up. But it's not always that simple. You mentioned it’s happened with things other than steak – can you recall what else you ate around the times you noticed the blood?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don't keep a log of my…digestive outputs! Do you expect me to remember every single bite I’ve taken over the past month? I eat a varied diet. Vegetables, fish, sometimes chicken. I like a good roast now and then. It’s all proper food. Not like this…modern processed nonsense. I doubt it’s the food, honestly. More likely something just…irritating things. Old age, probably. Everything gets a bit…sensitive, you know?
DOCTOR: You're right, of course, you shouldn't have to keep a log! I apologize for asking. It was a bit of a silly question. It’s good you eat a varied diet, that’s excellent. Okay, let’s put the food aside for a moment. Has there been any change in your bowel habits besides the blood?
PATIENT: Change? Well, I'm 88 years old! Everything changes eventually. But…let me think. It’s not more frequent, that's for sure. And not less, either. Just…regular. As regular as an old man can be, I suppose. Maybe a bit…thinner sometimes. Harder to…pass, if you catch my drift. But that's been happening on and off for a while now. Not new. Just…part of getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know, Arbie. So, regular frequency, but sometimes a bit thinner and harder to pass. And you've noticed this on and off for a while. Now, have you experienced any abdominal pain, cramping, or bloating along with any of these changes?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. A little discomfort now and then, but nothing to write home about. Old men are always a little creaky, you know. It’s just…life. Bloating…maybe a little, after a big meal. But who doesn't get bloated after a good dinner? I’m not made of iron, you know. And I certainly don't go around complaining about a little stomach discomfort. It’s…unmanly.
DOCTOR: I understand, Arbie. You're very stoic, and that’s admirable. Just to clarify, so no significant abdominal pain or cramping, and the bloating is mild and related to meals. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you noticed any unintended weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Well, I’ve probably lost a bit. But who doesn’t lose weight as they get older? It’s inevitable! And frankly, I’m not overly concerned about it. I’m not exactly packing on the pounds, if that’s what you’re implying. I eat what I want, when I want. And I’m not about to start weighing myself every day like some…housewife. It's a waste of time. I feel fine, generally. A little stiff in the mornings, but that's just age.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. You feel generally well, and the weight loss is not a major concern for you. Now, have you had any history of constipation or diarrhea?
PATIENT: Constipation? Diarrhea? Good heavens, woman. Are you grilling me here? Of course I’ve had those things! Everyone does, at some point. It’s part of being alive! But nothing…chronic. Nothing serious. Just the occasional upset stomach. I've a strong constitution, remember? I haven't spent weeks stuck in the bathroom, if that’s what you're hinting at. Though, I did have a bit of trouble on that cruise to Alaska back in '98…but that was the shellfish, I assure you. Bad shellfish. Not me.
DOCTOR: You’re right, of course. I apologize for all the questions. It's just standard procedure to get a complete picture. The shellfish on that cruise sounds unpleasant. Now, one last question before we move on to a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable. Have you ever had a colonoscopy or any other screening tests for colon cancer?
PATIENT: Colonoscopy? Now you're just being ridiculous. Colonoscopy! Absolutely not. Never. And I don't intend to, either. Invasive. Unnecessary. I've lived a long life, haven't I? If something's going to happen, it's going to happen. No need to poke around where it doesn't belong. Frankly, I find the whole idea…indecent. I trust my body. And I certainly don't need a young woman telling me what's going on inside it. Though, I suppose my ex-wife would have liked that. Always liked a bit of control, she did. But that's another story entirely. No. No colonoscopy. Never.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Arbie. You’re entitled to refuse any medical procedure, and I respect your decision. I just want to be sure we’ve explored all avenues to ensure your health. Given your history and your refusal of a colonoscopy, a physical exam will be especially important today. I'd like to listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll do a quick rectal exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will help me assess the situation and determine the best course of action. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A rectal exam. Honestly. Now you've truly outdone yourself. A rectal exam! Look, I'm an old man, not a…specimen. But…fine. If you insist. But don’t expect me to enjoy it. And be quick about it, will you? I haven’t got all day. And try not to make a mess. I have a reputation to maintain, you know. Though, what reputation remains at this point, I’m not entirely sure. Just…get on with it. But be gentle. And discreet. This is…highly undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Arbie. I will be as quick and gentle as possible, and I assure you, complete discretion. I'll explain everything as I go. Okay, Arbie, if you could lie on your left side with your knees bent toward your chest. I'm going to listen to your abdomen first, just to check for any unusual sounds. Then I'll proceed with the rectal exam. It will only take a moment. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort at any time.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Left side. Knees bent. Like a…a pretzel. Honestly, what is the point of all this poking and prodding? I've lived 88 years without anyone sticking things where they don't belong. And I suspect I’ll manage perfectly well without it for the remaining few. But…go ahead. Just…don't linger. And keep your hands to yourself. It’s…unsettling. And try not to make any surprised noises. I have a sensitive constitution, you know. Just…get it over with.
DOCTOR: I understand, Arbie. I will be very mindful and gentle. Okay, Arbie. I’m finished now. Findings: I’ve detected some slight tenderness on palpation, and I did note the presence of a small amount of dark, dried blood on the examining glove. There are no palpable masses, and the tone feels normal. Given your history and the findings from the exam, the blood is concerning, even if it’s a small amount. While you’ve declined a colonoscopy, it’s important we investigate this further to rule out any serious underlying cause. I suspect it's likely a minor issue like hemorrhoids or a small anal fissure, but we can’t be certain without additional testing.
PATIENT: Hemorrhoids? Fissures? Now you're just making up words again. Honestly, I’ve never had any trouble in that department, if you catch my drift. And I don't appreciate you implying otherwise. Though, my ex-wife always said…never mind. So, what are you suggesting? More poking and prodding? More invasive procedures? I thought you said a minor issue? If it’s minor, why all the fuss? I feel fine, generally. A little stiff in the mornings, but that's just age. I’m not about to start submitting to…torture. I’ve lived a long life, and I’d like to spend my remaining years in peace, not stuck in a hospital bed. What are my options? And be quick about it. I haven’t got all day. And no more talk of…fissures. It’s…undignified.
DOCTOR: You’re right to question me, Arbie, and I apologize if I’ve caused any discomfort with my terminology. I didn't mean to imply anything negative, and I understand your reluctance to undergo further testing. Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the rectum, and fissures are small tears in the lining, both common and usually not serious. However, bleeding can also be a sign of something more serious, such as polyps or even cancer, which is why it's important to investigate. Since you’ve declined a colonoscopy, the next best step would be a fecal immunochemical test . It's a simple stool test you can do at home. It detects hidden blood in your stool, which can indicate a problem. If the FIT comes back positive, we would then discuss further options, which might include a sigmoidoscopy - a less invasive test than a colonoscopy that only examines the lower part of the colon. Would you be willing to consider a FIT test?
PATIENT: A…stool test? You’re asking me to submit my…waste for analysis? Honestly, woman. This is preposterous! It's…degrading. And what if it comes back positive? Then what? More poking and prodding? More invasive procedures? I’m not about to start submitting to…medical indignities. I’ve lived 88 years without anyone poking around in my…digestive system, and I’d like to keep it that way. I feel fine, generally. A little stiff in the mornings, but that's just age. And if something’s going to happen, it’s going to happen. I’m not about to start worrying about…hidden blood. It’s…unmanly. No. Absolutely not. No stool tests. No sigmoidoscopies. No more poking and prodding. I think I’ve had enough for one day. I’ll just…monitor things myself. And if something happens, I’ll…deal with it. I have a strong constitution, remember? And I don’t need a young woman telling me what’s going on inside my…body. I’ve lived 88 years. I think I’ve earned the right to make my own decisions. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Arbie. You have every right to refuse any medical testing, and I respect your decision completely. However, I want to emphasize that ignoring this bleeding could have serious consequences. If you do experience any changes in your bowel habits – such as persistent diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, or significant weight loss – or if the bleeding becomes more frequent or heavier, please seek medical attention immediately. I will document your refusal of further testing in your chart. I will also provide you with a written summary of our conversation and some information about the signs and symptoms to watch out for. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
