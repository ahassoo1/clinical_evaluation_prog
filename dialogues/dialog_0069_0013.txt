DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out, you see. It just… stays in there. It’s been happening for a little while now. Not real bad at first, but getting worse lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re having difficulty completely emptying your bladder, and it’s been gradually worsening. That’s good you’re bringing it to our attention. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It feels… full, even after I try. And I have to… push, sometimes, to get it going. It’s not painful, not usually, but it’s… uncomfortable. And I find myself going back to the bathroom pretty soon after I thought I was done.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it feels like you’re not fully emptying, you sometimes have to strain to urinate, it’s not usually painful but uncomfortable, and you’re finding you need to return to the bathroom relatively quickly after you’ve just gone. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… let me think. Not really the color, I don't think. No blood or anything like that. Sometimes… sometimes it seems weaker, the stream is not as strong as it used to be. That’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in color or blood in the urine, but you've noticed the stream is weaker than it used to be. Good observation. Now, let’s talk about how often you’re going to the bathroom throughout the day. Can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Well, that’s a hard one. I… I don’t keep track, Doctor. But… more than usual. Used to be, I could go a good few hours. Now, it feels like I’m going every couple of hours, maybe even less. Especially at night. That’s the worst part, having to get up so often.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re going more frequently than usual, and nighttime trips are particularly bothersome. That's helpful to know. Have you noticed any urgency – a sudden, strong need to go, like you have to rush to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Yes! That happens sometimes. Not every time, but… suddenly, I just have to go. Like if I wait even a minute, it’ll be a problem. It's… unsettling. Makes me nervous when I’m out, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. That sudden urgency can be quite disruptive and anxiety-provoking. Now, let’s step back a bit. Have you had any fever, chills, lower abdominal pain, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. My belly… sometimes a little ache, just a dull one. Not bad enough to worry about, I didn’t think. And no pain in my back or sides, no. I’ve been feeling pretty good, health-wise, except for this water trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, significant abdominal or back pain. Just a mild, occasional ache. That's good. Let me ask about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Well… I had the high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor had me on pills for it and it’s been… well, managed, I guess you’d say. They check it when I go for my regular visits. Other than that… not really. Never had any trouble with my… prostate, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, you have a history of high blood pressure that's currently managed with medication. And you haven’t been diagnosed with any prostate issues. Do you take any other medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: Just the pills for my blood pressure, Doctor. A little white one, I take it every morning. And sometimes, when my joints ache, I take some… some ibuprofen. But not every day. Just when I need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're taking medication for high blood pressure and ibuprofen as needed for joint pain. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Years ago, I had my appendix out when I was a young man. And… and I broke my leg once, when I was ice fishing. They had to put a cast on it. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, you had your appendix removed many years ago and a broken leg that required a cast. Nothing else significant. Now, regarding family history, have any close family members – father, brothers, or sons – had any problems with their bladder or prostate?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My father… he didn’t talk much about his health, to be honest. I never heard him mention anything about his bladder. And I don’t have any brothers. I had a son, but he… he passed away a few years back. I don’t know if he had any trouble with that, I never asked.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your son. That must be difficult. Okay, so we don't have much information about family history regarding bladder or prostate issues. Finally, I'm going to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't smoke. Never have. And I don't drink alcohol either. Not anymore, at least. Used to have a little beer now and then, but not for a long time. And no, no recreational drugs. I'm a pretty simple man. Just like my fishing and… well, taking care of things around the house.
DOCTOR: Okay, you don’t smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs. Thank you for answering all those questions. That gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your abdomen, check your vital signs, and I'll also perform a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. That just involves a quick check and it will help me determine if there are any abnormalities. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… alright. I don’t like the sound of it much, but if you think it’s necessary… then go ahead. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, if you would.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be as gentle as possible. First, let’s listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. Your abdomen sounds normal, no unusual noises. Now, I'm going to take your vital signs - blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 138/82, pulse is 72, and temperature is 98.6 - all within normal limits. Now for the digital rectal exam. I'm going to ask you to bend over the examination table and take some deep breaths. This will help me relax. I'll be using a lubricated, gloved finger to gently examine your prostate. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Please let me know if you experience any pain. … Okay, I’m finished. Your prostate feels slightly enlarged, but there are no obvious nodules or areas of tenderness. Everything seems normal, but the enlargement warrants further investigation. I think it would be best to order a urinalysis to check for infection, and a PSA blood test to screen for prostate issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If you think it’s best, then let’s do those tests. Infection or prostate trouble… I’d rather know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. So yes, please order those tests. How do I… where do I go to get them done?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I agree – it's best to have a clear picture of what's going on. I'm ordering both a urinalysis and a PSA blood test. You can get both of these done at the lab right across the hall, room 203. They are open until 5 PM today. You don’t need an appointment. Just tell them Dr. Andraca ordered these tests for you and they will take care of it. Once the results are back – usually within a couple of days – my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend you try to drink plenty of water – about 8 glasses a day – and avoid excessive caffeine or alcohol. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Eight glasses… that's a lot of water. But I can try. And no caffeine, that might be hard. No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… what if the results aren’t good? What does that mean?
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly reasonable question. If the urinalysis shows an infection, we'll treat it with antibiotics. That's usually straightforward and resolves quickly. If the PSA level is elevated, it doesn't necessarily mean you have cancer. A lot of things can raise the PSA, including prostate enlargement, inflammation, or even recent ejaculation. If the PSA is significantly elevated or if we suspect something is wrong, we would likely recommend a referral to a urologist for further evaluation. They may suggest additional tests, such as a prostate biopsy, to get a definitive diagnosis. It's important to remember that we’re just gathering information at this point. We won’t jump to conclusions until we have all the results. We'll discuss everything thoroughly and make a plan together. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… that makes sense. A lot of things can cause it, and it doesn't mean the worst right away. I appreciate you explaining it so… calmly. It's good to know we're just finding out what's going on, not assuming anything. Okay, I'll go to the lab across the hall and get those tests done. Thank you very much for your time and… well, for not making me feel too worried.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. It's my job to provide you with the best possible care, and that includes making sure you feel informed and comfortable. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. My nurse’s number is on the information sheet I gave you. Get those tests done and we’ll see you soon. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. And… I'll try to drink more water. .
