DOCTOR: Right. Kiante Sayar, 33 years old. Good. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, thank you, Doctor Batara. It's... a bit of an odd request, actually. I need a letter saying I'm able to fly. My husband… passed away last year, and we had a trip planned. The airline is asking for a doctor's note before they'll let me use the ticket – something about the booking being in his name, and… well, it’s complicated. I just need confirmation that I’m healthy enough to travel, that’s all.
DOCTOR: A letter to say you’re able to fly. Right. Airline paperwork. Honestly, the things I hear these days. It's…unusual, but I suppose it’s not entirely unheard of. Still, a medical note for the ability to travel… I need to be clear, I'm not validating the ticket transfer itself, just your health. So, to be thorough – and because airlines do occasionally ask pointed questions – let's start with your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No major illnesses, thankfully. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager – routine, no complications. And… I've had the usual childhood things, you know, chickenpox, measles… all that. Nothing ongoing. I haven’t been hospitalized since then. I do have Medicare, though, just in case. Is that helpful? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Appendix, childhood illnesses… standard. Medicare is… documentation. Good. Let’s move on. Any family history of, say, blood clots, heart problems, lung issues?
PATIENT: Hmm. My father had high blood pressure, later in life. He was a… a herdsman, so very active, always outdoors. My mother… she was generally healthy, actually. No major heart problems or lung issues on either side that I know of. They both… they both lived fairly long lives, all things considered. Is that the sort of thing you need to know? I just… want to make sure I don’t miss anything.
DOCTOR: Herdsman. Interesting. And both lived to a good age. Okay. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to eat healthy, get enough sleep… just basic stuff. I haven’t needed any medication since… well, since I was a child, really. No regular vitamins or anything like that either. Just… plain water, mostly. I really don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: No medications. Alright. Any allergies?
PATIENT: No known allergies. I've never had a reaction to anything. Food, animals, pollen… nothing. I'm quite lucky, I think. My husband, he was terribly allergic to bee stings, so I’m very mindful of those, but I'm clear.
DOCTOR: Right. No allergies. So, and please be specific, have you experienced anything unusual lately?
PATIENT: Unusual… let me think. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness… I’ve been a little… tired, I suppose. But that's just from… everything. It's been a hard year, adjusting to things. But nothing medically concerning. No coughing, no fever, no… I don’t know, swelling in my legs or anything like that. I'm trying to be thorough, I promise.
DOCTOR: "Tired." Yes, well, I can imagine. Adjusting to loss is… taxing. Let’s do a quick exam, just to be certain. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and oxygen levels. It's standard procedure, even for a letter about travel. Sit back, please.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Thank you, Doctor Batara. I appreciate you taking the time to do that. I just… I really want to be able to use the ticket. It would… mean a lot.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 120 over 80. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs auscultated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Oxygen saturation is 98% on room air. Normal findings. No immediate concerns. Do you experience any pain with deep breaths?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. I can take a deep breath without any discomfort. Perfectly fine. I haven't had any trouble breathing, like I said. Just… the fatigue, but I assumed that was just… grief.
DOCTOR: Fatigue is…common. Alright. Well, based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, I don’t see any medical contraindications to air travel. I will write a letter stating you are cleared for travel from a medical perspective. However, I must reiterate: this does not validate the ticket transfer. That is an airline matter. And please, if you experience any symptoms while travelling – shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness – seek medical attention immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. I completely understand. I don't expect you to validate the ticket, just confirm that I'm healthy enough to fly. And I will absolutely seek medical attention if I experience any problems. Thank you so much, Doctor Batara. You've really put my mind at ease. When can I expect the letter?
DOCTOR: It’s ready. Here you are. It's dated today, August 2, 2025, and includes my contact information if the airline requires further verification. I do advise you to keep a copy for your records. Now, I'll need to document this encounter in your EHR. Do you have any other medical concerns I should be aware of, or is this the sole reason for your visit today?
PATIENT: No, that’s everything. Just the letter, thank you. I really appreciate your help, Doctor. I think I'm good to go. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: Very well. Then I'll make a note of that. Have a…safe trip. .
