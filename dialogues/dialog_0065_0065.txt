DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’ve been… well, I’ve been gaining weight, and I don’t understand why. It’s quite unsettling, really. It’s not as though my habits have changed drastically.
DOCTOR: I see. Weight gain, and you haven't noticed any significant changes in your diet or exercise routine. And how long has this been going on, Ms. Selbitschka?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… approximately six months, I would say. Perhaps a little longer. It started gradually, and I initially dismissed it as simply… adjusting. But it continues, and it’s become rather noticeable, even to my husband. I’m quite concerned, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Six months… and it’s been progressive. Alright. And approximately how much weight would you say you've gained over those six months?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a rather precise question. Let me see… I weigh myself regularly, you understand. Approximately… fifteen pounds, I believe. Perhaps a little more. It fluctuates, naturally, but fifteen pounds is a reasonable estimate. I’m usually quite stable, you see. This is… unusual.
DOCTOR: Fifteen pounds over six months with no changes to your routine… That is notable. Now, Ms. Selbitschka, I'm going to ask a few more detailed questions, if you don’t mind. It helps me get a clearer picture. First, let’s talk about your diet. You say it hasn’t changed drastically, but can you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I understand. A typical day… Well, breakfast is usually oatmeal with fruit, and a cup of tea. Lunch is often a sandwich – perhaps ham and cheese – with a small salad. And dinner… my husband does most of the cooking, and it’s typically meat – chicken or pork, usually – with potatoes and vegetables. I do enjoy a small piece of dark chocolate after dinner, sometimes. Nothing excessive, I assure you. I don't drink soda, and I rarely have sweets.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you noticing any other symptoms along with the weight gain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me consider. I’ve been… a little more tired than usual, perhaps. And my skin feels rather dry. But I attributed that to the weather, honestly. It's been quite warm, and the air conditioning can be very drying. I’m not sure if that's related. No changes in bowel habits, no swelling… nothing truly remarkable, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and dry skin. Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – thyroid problems, diabetes, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing of the sort. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I have regular check-ups with my family doctor, and everything has always been normal. My husband passed on a tendency towards high blood pressure, but mine remains stable. I’ve never needed any serious medical intervention, honestly. Just the usual vaccinations and… a broken wrist when I was a child, but that’s hardly relevant, is it?
DOCTOR: No significant medical history. Good. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had… arthritis, towards the end of her life. And, as I mentioned, my husband's father had high blood pressure. But nothing… significant. No history of thyroid issues or diabetes on either side of the family, to my knowledge. My grandmother was rather… robust, if that's a helpful descriptor. She lived to a very old age, despite enjoying quite rich foods. So, I don't think there's a strong genetic predisposition to weight problems, at least.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I prefer to avoid medications whenever possible. I take a vitamin D supplement during the winter months, as my doctor suggested, but that's it. I find a healthy diet and regular exercise are usually sufficient. I haven't needed anything else, truly. I dislike the idea of relying on pills if I can manage without them.
DOCTOR: No medications. Alright. Now, Ms. Selbitschka, I'm going to need to perform a physical exam. We'll start with your height and weight, just to confirm what you've told me. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your thyroid. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. I understand. Please proceed. I want to get to the bottom of this, and I trust your judgment. I’m rather relieved you’re taking this seriously. It’s unsettling to experience changes in one’s body without a clear explanation. Please, do whatever you deem necessary.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let’s confirm your height and weight. Please step onto the scale, facing forward. And then we’ll proceed with the rest of the exam. ... 83 kilograms, and your height is 155 centimeters. That confirms your reported weight gain. Now, if you’ll please have a seat on the examination table, we’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Thyroid feels normal in size and consistency, no nodules detected. Alright, everything appears normal so far. However, given your weight gain and fatigue, I would like to order some blood tests. Specifically, a complete blood count, a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and a basic metabolic panel.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood tests seem a logical next step. I trust your expertise. Will these tests provide a clearer understanding of the cause? And… how long will it take to receive the results? I have a commitment next month, and I’d like to know if there’s a timeframe to consider.
DOCTOR: These tests will help us rule out several potential causes for your weight gain and fatigue, including hypothyroidism and any metabolic imbalances. The lab results typically take 3 to 5 business days to come back. I will have the results sent directly to this clinic, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend maintaining your current diet and exercise routine. Avoid any drastic changes until we have a clearer picture of what’s going on. We can also discuss a referral to a nutritionist if you'd like, though I don’t believe that’s necessary at this stage. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly acceptable. Three to five business days is reasonable. And no, I don’t think a nutritionist is necessary yet. I'm quite capable of maintaining a sensible diet on my own. Thank you for being so thorough. I appreciate your careful consideration. Is there anything else I need to do or be aware of before the follow-up appointment? Perhaps dietary restrictions while awaiting the results?
DOCTOR: No, there are no dietary restrictions while awaiting the results. Just continue with your usual routine. However, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as excessive fatigue, unexplained swelling, or changes in your mental state – please contact the clinic immediately. It’s always better to err on the side of caution. I will also send you a copy of the lab order and a brief summary of our discussion. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful and reassuring. Thank you again for your time and attention. I’ll await the results and schedule a follow-up appointment accordingly. I appreciate your thoroughness and your… pragmatic approach.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. I’ll have the receptionist schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. If you have any questions or concerns before then, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. .
