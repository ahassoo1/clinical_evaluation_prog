DOCTOR: Good morning, Ellan. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, it’s about this… medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on about it for my arthritis. Says it'll do wonders. I’m not one to jump on bandwagons, mind you, but… well, I thought I’d see if it’s something I qualify for. It just seems… a bit much, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ellan. It's good you're coming to me to discuss this instead of starting anything on your own. Medical marijuana can be helpful for some arthritis patients, but it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. First, let's talk about your arthritis. How long have you been dealing with it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time, Doctor. A long time. Probably… fifteen years now? Maybe more. It started in my hands, mostly. Just a little stiffness, you know? Thought it was from gardening. But it’s spread, of course. Knees now, hips… makes getting around a bit of a bother. Though I refuse to use a cane, mind you. Not yet.
DOCTOR: Fifteen years. That’s quite a while. And it’s spread to your knees and hips, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Though my hands are the worst, really. Makes it hard to do… well, anything that requires a bit of finesse. Knitting, sewing… even just opening a jar. It’s quite embarrassing, to be honest. A woman likes to keep busy, you know? Not just… sitting. I used to be very active, always puttering about. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ellan. It’s frustrating when something you enjoy becomes difficult. And it sounds like it’s affecting more than just your physical abilities. Do you experience any pain with these activities?
PATIENT: Oh, pain? Yes, Doctor. A good deal of it. It’s not a constant, throbbing sort of pain, thankfully. More of an ache, a deep, grinding ache. It flares up after I’ve been doing something with my hands for a while, or if I’ve been on my feet too long. Sometimes it feels… swollen, if that makes sense? Though I don’t know if it actually is swollen. It’s hard to tell with my age, you know. Things just… ache. And sometimes, it goes up my arms. A real nuisance, it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a better picture. A deep, grinding ache that flares up with activity and sometimes goes up your arms. Has anything, over the years, helped manage the pain at all?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I’ve tried a few things. The doctor before, he gave me some pills. Ibuprofen, mostly. They took the edge off, I suppose, but they upset my stomach something awful. Couldn’t eat a thing. Then there were the creams. Rubbed them in religiously, but they didn’t do much good. My daughter suggested those glucosamine supplements, but I can’t stand swallowing all those pills. Honestly, I just sort of… deal with it. Try not to overdo it. Warm baths help, a bit. That's about it, really. I'm not one for taking a lot of medication, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I completely understand wanting to avoid unnecessary medication, Ellan. It sounds like you’ve tried a few common approaches. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any other health conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... Well, I have a touch of high blood pressure, Doctor. Nothing too serious, my regular doctor keeps it under control with a small pill each morning. And my cholesterol is a little high, but again, it’s managed with medication. Otherwise, I'm remarkably healthy for my age, if I do say so myself. No major surgeries, no serious illnesses. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, really. Though my daughter worries about everything, bless her heart. She’s convinced I’m one step away from the hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure and high cholesterol, both managed with medication. That’s good to know. Any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Though I avoid taking new medications if I can help it. You just never know, do you? I’m a bit sensitive, perhaps. My stomach gets upset easily, as I mentioned. But no actual allergies. I used to take penicillin as a child, but that was ages ago. I don't think that counts, does it?
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Good. Now, before we discuss medical marijuana specifically, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just to get a better sense of what's going on with your joints. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that would be fine. I suppose I should expect that, shouldn't I? Though don’t expect much, mind you. I’m not exactly a flexible specimen anymore. Still, if it helps… yes, please do. Though perhaps start gently? My knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ellan. We'll take it very gently. If anything is uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. Let’s start with your hands. Can you make a fist for me, please?
PATIENT: There we are. Though it’s a bit stiff, you see? Doesn't bend as easily as it should. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a resistance. Feels a bit like gravel grinding, if that makes any sense. Do you need me to do anything else with them? I'm not sure what you're looking for, you understand.
DOCTOR: I see. There is some mild swelling in the knuckles of both hands, and I can feel a bit of crepitus – that’s the grinding sound you described – when you move them. Your range of motion is slightly limited, but not severely. Now, can you open and close your hands for me, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: There you are. It’s not a smooth movement, you see? It catches a bit, especially when I open them. It feels… tight, like a rubber band that's a bit too old. And there’s a little bit of ache when I do it, mostly in the base of my thumb. It's not a constant pain, just… a reminder that I've used these hands for a good many years. Do you need me to squeeze anything? Or move them in a different way? I'm happy to cooperate, Doctor. Just tell me what you need.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I can feel some tenderness at the base of both thumbs, and a slight bump there as well. That could be indicative of early arthritis changes. Now, let's move to your wrists. Can you bend your wrists up and down for me, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: There we are. It’s not as bad as my hands, thankfully. But there’s a little bit of stiffness there, you see? It doesn’t move as freely as it should. And there’s a little bit of ache on the outside of my left wrist. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a dull throb. I used to do a lot of gardening, you see. Perhaps that’s the cause of it. Do you need me to rotate them, Doctor? Or squeeze anything? I'm happy to do whatever you need. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel a little tenderness on the outside of your left wrist, but no significant swelling. Now, let's move to your knees. Can you sit up a bit straighter for me?
PATIENT: There we are. Though be warned, Doctor, my knees aren't what they used to be. I try not to put too much stress on them, you see. They creak something awful when I move them. It's a bit embarrassing, to be honest. Though I refuse to use a cane, mind you. Not yet, anyway. Are you going to bend them? Because I might need a moment to brace myself.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ellan. We'll take it very slowly. I’m just going to feel around your knees first. Can you point your toes for me, please?
PATIENT: There we are. Though it's a bit stiff, you see? Doesn't go as far as it should. And there’s a bit of ache on the inside of my right knee. Not a sharp pain, just... a dull throb. I used to enjoy dancing, you see. A long time ago. But that was before my knees started acting up. Do you need me to bend them, Doctor? Because I might need a moment to prepare myself. They creak something awful, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, I can feel some mild tenderness along the inside of your right knee, and a bit of crepitus – that grinding sound – when you move it. Your range of motion is slightly limited, but not severely. Now, can you try bending your knees as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: There we are. Oh, goodness, it creaks something awful, doesn’t it? It’s not a sharp pain, but it’s definitely uncomfortable. It feels… tight, like a rusty hinge. And there’s a bit of ache on the back of my right knee. I used to be able to squat down with no problem at all, you see. But now… well, now it’s a bit of a struggle. Are you going to bend them further, Doctor? Because I might need a moment to brace myself. They're not what they used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Your range of motion is limited, and I can feel some mild tenderness on both sides of your knees. There doesn’t appear to be any significant swelling. Alright, Ellan, that’s enough for the physical exam for now. I have a good sense of what's going on. Let's discuss your medical history a little more in-depth. Do you have any family history of arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes, Doctor. My mother had it something awful. Mostly in her hands and wrists, just like me. She was a seamstress, you see, and she used her hands all the time. It crippled her eventually, poor thing. She couldn’t knit or sew anymore. And my aunt, on my father’s side, she had it in her hips. She needed a replacement eventually, I believe. So, yes, there’s a bit of a family history, unfortunately. It seems to run in the family, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: It does seem so, Ellan. Knowing that your mother and aunt both had arthritis is helpful. Now, regarding your lifestyle, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, Doctor. Not a drop. Never have. My mother always said it was a waste of good money. And smoking? Absolutely not. I used to work with a woman who smoked like a chimney, and it smelled just dreadful. No, I take care of myself, as best I can. I eat a balanced diet, mostly, and I try to get a bit of exercise when my knees allow it. Though dancing is out of the question these days, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ellan. So, to summarize, you have a history of arthritis for fifteen years, primarily affecting your hands, wrists, and knees. Your mother and aunt also had arthritis. You've tried ibuprofen and creams with limited success, and you're currently not taking any other medications for your arthritis. You have a history of high blood pressure and high cholesterol, both managed with medication, and you don't smoke or drink. Now, you mentioned your daughter suggested medical marijuana. What specifically did she say about it?
PATIENT: Oh, bless her heart, she reads all sorts of things online. She says it helps with the pain, of course, that it’s a natural remedy, and that it doesn’t have the side effects of all those pills the doctors keep prescribing. She says it'll help me sleep, too, because the pain keeps me up at night sometimes. And she keeps going on about the creams and oils you can use, all sorts of fancy things. Honestly, I’m a bit skeptical, Doctor. It just seems… a bit much, doesn’t it? It’s not something I ever thought I’d consider, but she insists it’s worth a try. I just don’t want to get myself into something I can’t handle, you understand?
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism completely, Ellan. Your daughter is right, medical marijuana can be helpful for some people with arthritis, particularly with pain and sleep. However, it's not without potential side effects and risks, and it doesn't work for everyone. Given your medical history, it's important to weigh the potential benefits and risks carefully. Now, before we discuss whether medical marijuana is right for you, I want to be clear: I can't simply prescribe it without further evaluation and a thorough discussion of the legal and logistical aspects in our state. Given your age and health conditions, I would recommend starting with a more conservative approach. Have you considered physical therapy?
PATIENT: Oh, physical therapy… My regular doctor mentioned it once, years ago. Said it might help strengthen the muscles around my knees and hands. Honestly, I dismissed it at the time. Seemed like a lot of bother, and I wasn't sure it would actually make a difference. But… well, if you think it's worth considering, Doctor, I suppose I could look into it. It wouldn’t hurt to ask, would it? Though I’m not sure how much running around I’m up for these days. It just seems like a lot of effort for something that might not even work. But… if you truly believe it’s a better first step… perhaps I should give it a try.
DOCTOR: I do believe it’s a good first step, Ellan. Physical therapy can strengthen the muscles supporting your joints, improve your range of motion, and teach you strategies to manage your pain. It's a non-invasive approach with minimal risks. I’m going to write you a referral for a physical therapist specializing in arthritis. They’ll assess your condition and develop a personalized treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to manage your pain with gentle exercise, warm baths, and over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. Would you like me to provide you with any written information about arthritis and physical therapy?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be lovely, Doctor, thank you. Anything to help me understand things a little better. My daughter always has a stack of printouts from the internet, but honestly, it's a bit overwhelming. Something from a proper doctor, with clear explanations, would be much appreciated. And thank you for the referral, as well. I’ll see what I can arrange. Though I’m not promising anything, mind you. My schedule is a bit… full these days. But I’ll certainly look into it. And perhaps, if the physical therapy doesn't work… we can revisit this medical marijuana discussion?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ellan. We can certainly revisit the medical marijuana discussion if physical therapy isn't helpful. I want you to feel comfortable and informed about all your options. Here's a handout with information about arthritis and the benefits of physical therapy. I’m also including a list of reputable physical therapy centers in the area. I'll also write a note for your primary care physician, letting them know about our conversation and the referral. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. It’s a bit overwhelming, to be honest, but I feel much better informed now. Thank you again for everything. Perhaps I’ll see you again in a few months, to let you know how the physical therapy is going?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ellan. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And yes, please do schedule a follow-up appointment in a few months to let me know how the physical therapy is progressing. Here's a card with my office number. Have a good day, and I wish you all the best with your treatment.
