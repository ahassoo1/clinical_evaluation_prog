DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vankampen. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor... Georgiou, right? Yes, Georgiou. My back, it’s been bothering me. Low part of my back. It hurts to stand for long, and sometimes even sitting is bad. It’s…old age, I guess. But it’s getting worse, so my daughter said I have to come see someone.
DOCTOR: Yes, Georgiou is correct. And it’s good of your daughter to encourage you to come in – it’s always best to get things checked out. “Old age” can definitely be a factor, but we want to make sure there isn't something else going on, or something we can do to help. So, this pain in your low back… how long has it been bothering you, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm...let me think. It’s been…well, I noticed it first maybe six months ago? Just a little ache after gardening. I like to keep busy, you see. But it's gotten…steadier, I guess you’d say. Not sudden pains, just…always there, a dull ache. Maybe the last two months it’s been worse, like I said. Harder to get up from a chair.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months with a gradual worsening, and more noticeable in the last two months. And it's a dull ache, not sharp or stabbing, and makes getting up from a chair difficult. That’s helpful to know. Does anything specifically make the pain better or worse, besides sitting and standing?
PATIENT: Well...lying down helps. Always does. Especially on my back, with a pillow under my knees. That takes the pressure off. And…warm baths. Those are nice. But nothing really makes it go away, just…less bad for a little while. Walking doesn't seem to bother it too much, surprisingly. It's the being still that’s the worst.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying down with a pillow under your knees and warm baths offer some relief. Walking doesn’t aggravate it significantly, but being still is difficult. That's good information. Now, has this pain ever radiated down your legs?
PATIENT: Radiated? You mean...go down my legs? Sometimes, yeah. Not all the way to my feet, but down my thighs, a little bit. Mostly just a tingling, not a real bad pain. It doesn't happen all the time, just sometimes when I bend over.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling radiating down the thighs sometimes when bending over. That's helpful. And when you say bending over, is it bending at the waist, like reaching for something on the floor, or more like trying to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oh, bending at the waist, yes. Reaching for something, or even just tying my shoes. It's not every time, mind you. Some days I can do it and be fine. Other days…oof. That’s when the tingling happens, and maybe a little bit of pain in my back at the same time.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, intermittent tingling in your thighs with bending at the waist, accompanied by back pain on those days. Have you noticed any weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness…hmm. No, not really. I haven’t dropped anything, or stumbled. But…sometimes my legs feel a little heavy, like they're tired. Especially at the end of the day. But I’m 77, Doctor. Maybe that’s just old age again!
DOCTOR: That's a very fair point, Mr. Vankampen! It’s good you’re aware of what’s normal for you. But it's still good we're discussing it. Now, let's talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was no problem. And I had a little bit of trouble with high blood pressure, but the doctor put me on a pill for it. I take that every day. Other than that…not much. I try to eat healthy, and I walk when I can. I haven't broken any bones or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal in the past and currently managed high blood pressure with medication. That’s good to know. What is the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that’s a good question. My daughter handles most of that stuff. Let me see… It’s… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. 10 milligrams, once a day.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Lisinopril 10mg daily. And how about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had any trouble with pollen or anything like that. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy in the winter, but that's just the dry air. I don't take anything for it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, before we do a quick exam, have you had any recent changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. No, not really. Everything's pretty normal there, if you don't mind me saying so. I go to the bathroom when I need to, no trouble holding it. And no blood or anything like that. Sorry to be so…blunt.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Vankampen. It’s important to be honest! Okay, good. No changes in bowel or bladder habits. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. Could you please lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Be careful now, my back isn’t what it used to be!
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Vankampen, I’m just going to gently feel along your spine and the muscles around it. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender or painful. And now I'm going to see how easily you can bend in different directions. Again, just let me know if anything causes pain. Finally, I'm going to lift your leg up while you keep it straight. This will help me check the nerves in your back and legs. Okay. There's some tenderness to the touch along your lower spine, particularly on the left side. Your range of motion is a bit limited, especially bending forward. The straight leg raise test is positive on the left side, meaning it reproduces some of the tingling you described. Your reflexes are normal, and I don't detect any significant weakness in your legs.
PATIENT: Positive…on the left side? That doesn’t sound good. What does that mean, Doctor? Is it serious? I’m getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Mr. Vankampen. "Positive" in this case means that lifting your left leg up reproduces some of the pain and tingling you've been experiencing, which suggests there may be some irritation or compression of a nerve in your lower back. It doesn't necessarily mean it’s serious, but it does help me narrow down the possibilities. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds most likely that you have a lumbar radiculopathy - which is a fancy way of saying a pinched nerve in your lower back. This can be caused by a number of things, like a bulging disc, arthritis, or just general wear and tear. It is a very common condition, especially as we get older. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. Would you be willing to get an X-ray and an MRI of your lower back?
PATIENT: X-ray and… an MRI? Oh dear. Those sound…expensive. And scary. What will they show me? And what happens if they do find something bad? I haven't had an MRI before.
DOCTOR: Those are very reasonable concerns, Mr. Vankampen. I understand it can be daunting. An X-ray can show us the bones in your spine and help rule out any fractures or significant arthritis. An MRI gives us a much more detailed picture of the soft tissues, like the discs and nerves, and can help us identify if there's anything pressing on a nerve. The X-ray is relatively quick and painless. The MRI involves lying in a tunnel for about 30-45 minutes. It's noisy, but you'll be given earplugs. You won't feel anything during the scan. Regarding cost, I'll have my staff check with your insurance to see what is covered. Even without insurance, we can explore options to make it affordable, like a payment plan. If the tests show something, like a bulging disc, we have several treatment options, like physical therapy, pain medication, or injections. In rare cases, surgery might be necessary, but we would discuss all of those options thoroughly before making any decisions. For now, let's focus on getting these tests scheduled. Would you like me to have my staff contact you to arrange them?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Have your staff contact me. My daughter, Lila, she handles all the paperwork and things. She's a good girl, very organized. Her number is 555-123-4567. And...thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly. I still worry, but I feel a little better knowing what might be going on.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. It’s my pleasure. And Lila sounds wonderful. I'll make a note to have my staff contact her at 555-123-4567 to schedule the X-ray and MRI. In the meantime, to help manage your pain, I recommend continuing to lie down with a pillow under your knees and taking warm baths. You can also try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, if you are able to take them. I’ll be in touch as soon as we have the test results. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, or if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Thank you again, Doctor Georgiou. You’ve been very kind. I’ll let Lila handle the rest.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vankampen. I’m glad I could help. Please give Lila my best, and I look forward to seeing you both again soon. Have a good day, and take care.
