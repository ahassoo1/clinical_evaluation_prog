DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s my waterworks, really. I’m having trouble… going. It’s not a sudden thing, it's been building for a little while now. It takes me a long time, and sometimes… sometimes it just doesn’t come out all the way.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Yadao. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty with urination. That's certainly something we can look into. When you say it's been building for a while, can you give me a rough estimate of how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, I’d say… maybe six months ago? At first it was just a little hesitation, nothing major. I thought it was just getting older, you know? But it’s gotten worse steadily since then. Not a quick change, more like… a slow leak of trouble, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Yadao. A slow progression is common with these kinds of issues. And you're right to bring it up – it’s good you’re addressing it now. You mentioned hesitation, and feeling like you don’t empty your bladder completely. Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort while you’re trying to urinate?
PATIENT: No, not really pain, Doctor. Not a sharp pain, anyway. It’s more… a straining feeling. Like I have to push a little harder than I used to. And sometimes, after I think I'm done, there's a little dribble afterward. It’s not a lot, but it's enough to be… annoying, really. And a bit worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, straining and post-void dribbling. That's helpful information. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the… the colour, you mean? No, not that I’ve noticed. It looks pretty normal, I think. Maybe a little darker sometimes, when I haven't had enough to drink, but that's just me being forgetful and not drinking enough water. I try to drink plenty, but… well, old habits, you know? It's a struggle. No blood, no funny smells, nothing like that. Just… the usual.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao, no blood or change in smell is good. And you're right to stay hydrated. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any other medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Well, let me see. I have a bit of high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a pill for it every day, a small white one. And my knees are giving me trouble, arthritis, I think it is. That’s why I walk with a cane sometimes. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy for my age, I think. I've never had any major surgery or anything like that. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication and arthritis. That's good to know. What about past surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never had any. I always worried about being put under, you know? My mother had a bad reaction to anesthesia when she had her gallbladder out, so I always avoided it if I could. Thankfully, I haven’t needed anything major, so I haven't had to. Just the usual doctor visits for checkups and the occasional flu shot.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Ms. Yadao. Family history can certainly influence our decisions. Now, thinking about your family… do any of your close relatives – parents, siblings – have any medical conditions, specifically anything related to the kidneys, bladder, or prostate?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My father, he had some trouble with his kidneys when he got older, I remember him going to the hospital a few times for it. Not sure what exactly it was, it was a long time ago. And my brother, he had a bit of trouble with… I think they called it an enlarged prostate? He had some surgery for it, years and years ago. He's passed away now, unfortunately. My mother was healthy as a horse until the very end, never had any trouble with her waterworks that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Father with kidney issues, brother with prostate enlargement. We’ll keep those in mind. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little about your daily habits?
PATIENT: Daily habits? Oh dear, where do I start? I live alone, you see. I try to eat regular meals, mostly soup and bread, things that are easy to make. I used to garden, but my knees don’t allow for much of that anymore. I read a lot, mostly history books. And I drink tea. Lots and lots of tea. Black tea, usually. And I try to walk a little bit every day, but not always successful. I get tired easily, you know? It's a pretty quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay, quiet life, enjoys tea and reading. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother was very strict about that. She always said it was a terrible habit, and I listened to her. My father smoked a pipe for a while, but he quit when I was a little girl. He said it was bad for his lungs. I've always been a bit sensitive, you know? Smells bother me, and smoke definitely bothers me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking history, good. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think... Oh, yes! The doctor gave me something for my knees, a cream I rub on twice a day. It doesn’t help much, to be honest, but he said I should try it. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the nurse recommended it because I don't get much sun. That’s it, I think. Just the blood pressure pill, the knee cream, and the vitamin D. Nothing else. I try to keep it simple, you know? Too many pills and I get confused.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure medication, knee cream and vitamin D supplement. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to worry about shellfish, but I’ve eaten it plenty of times without any trouble. I get a bit of hay fever in the spring, but that’s just a runny nose and itchy eyes, nothing serious. No real allergies, no. Just a bit sensitive, you know? I get startled easily, and loud noises bother me. But that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not an allergy, Ms. Yadao. Alright, so no known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief abdominal exam, and checking a prostate exam, if that is acceptable to you. We’ll also do a neurological exam. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a prostate exam? I'm a woman, Doctor. I don't… I don't think I need one of those. I thought those were for men? Everything else sounds fine, checking my blood pressure and listening to my heart, that's no problem. But the prostate… that sounds like a mistake.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right, Ms. Yadao. My apologies – that was a mistake on my part. I am reviewing your chart now and see that is not indicated. I sincerely apologize for that oversight and any discomfort that suggestion may have caused. We will skip that part of the exam. Let’s proceed with the blood pressure, heart and lungs, and abdominal exam. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly fine, Doctor. Mistakes happen, I understand. I'm just glad you caught it. Blood pressure, heart and lungs sounds good. As long as we skip the… other thing. Thank you for checking your notes. It's good you're careful.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Yadao. It’s my responsibility. Now, if you could please lie back on the examination table, we'll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not significantly different from your usual readings, according to the chart. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take some deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling sounds. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. It will feel a little like a firm massage. Your abdomen is soft and there’s no noticeable tenderness. No masses or enlargement. Now, can you please bend your knees and tell me if you have any pain in your knees?
PATIENT: Alright, that doesn't hurt, pressing on my tummy. And yes, my knees… they ache, of course. They always ache. It's worse when I walk, or when it's cold. It's a dull ache, not a sharp pain, just a constant reminder that they're getting old. It’s mostly on the inside of my knees, I think. And sometimes a bit of stiffness in the morning. I’ve gotten used to it, really. It’s just part of getting older, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Yadao. It sounds like you’re managing the arthritis reasonably well. Based on the exam and your history, it’s likely the urinary issues are separate from the arthritis. I suspect we're dealing with some degree of bladder dysfunction. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a couple of tests. A urinalysis to check for infection or other abnormalities, and a post-void residual urine test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A test to see what's left in the bladder… that makes sense. And checking for infection is a good idea too. Yes, I’m happy to have those tests. How long will they take? And will I need to come back again? I hope it's not too much of a bother. I do try to limit my trips out these days.
DOCTOR: The urinalysis is quick – we can collect a sample right here in the office. The post-void residual test is also fairly simple. After you urinate, a small handheld device will measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder. It takes just a few minutes. You’ll need to come back in a couple of days to discuss the results. I'll schedule that appointment for you now. While we're waiting for those results, I recommend trying to drink at least eight glasses of water a day, unless your doctor has told you otherwise. It can help flush out your system and improve bladder function. Also, try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds manageable, Doctor. Eight glasses of water… I can try. I’m not always very good at remembering, but I’ll make an effort. And I don’t drink much alcohol anyway, just a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. No caffeine either, I switched to herbal tea years ago. Avoiding the wine is the hardest part, I suppose! So, just give the sample here, and the device after I go to the bathroom? And then come back in a couple of days? That sounds alright. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Yadao. Just let the nurse know when you're ready for the urinalysis and the post-void residual test. She’ll get you set up. I’ll also have the nurse give you a handout with information about bladder health and some simple exercises you can try. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything, Doctor. You've covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease knowing we're getting this checked out. Thank you again, Doctor AX. You're a good doctor.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Yadao. That’s my job, and I’m glad I could help. Remember, if your symptoms worsen or you develop a fever, please contact the office immediately. We'll see you in a couple of days to discuss the results. Have a good day, and try to stay hydrated!
