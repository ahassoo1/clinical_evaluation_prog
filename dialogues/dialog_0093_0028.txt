DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's this cough. It just won’t go away, and my heart… it hasn’t been feeling the best lately either. It feels… heavy, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Sadhu. A persistent cough and feelings of heaviness in your chest – I understand that must be concerning. Let’s try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. To start with the cough, could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been going on for… oh, I’d say close to a month now, maybe a little longer. It’s not a bad cough, not like a whooping cough or anything. More of a… dry tickle, really. And it’s worse when I lie down. Especially at night. It wakes me up, you know? I have to sit up to breathe easier. I’ve been trying to drink a lot of tea, but it doesn’t always help.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Ms. Sadhu. A dry cough worsening when lying down and relieved by sitting up – that’s helpful information. And you’ve been experiencing this for close to a month. Now, regarding the feeling of heaviness in your chest, could you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s hard to explain. It's not exactly pain, Doctor. It's more like… a pressure. A squeezing, almost. Like someone is sitting on my chest. It happens mostly when I walk, or even just climb a few stairs. I get winded really easily, and then that heavy feeling starts. It doesn’t happen all the time, but… it worries me. My husband… he used to get something like that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Sadhu, particularly given your husband's history. A squeezing pressure in the chest that occurs with exertion is certainly something we need to investigate thoroughly. To get a more complete picture, let’s move through some other questions, if you don’t mind. First, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the cough and chest heaviness?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Well, I get tired easily, like I said. But that's just getting old, isn't it? Hmm… sometimes my ankles swell up a bit at the end of the day. Not terribly, but I notice it. And I’ve been a little… breathless, even when I'm just sitting. Not like I can't breathe at all, but… shorter of breath than usual. I don’t know if that makes sense. And I haven’t been eating much lately. Just don’t have much of an appetite, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful information, Ms. Sadhu. Fatigue, ankle swelling, shortness of breath, and decreased appetite – these are all important details. It’s good you’re sharing all of this with me. Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh yes. Well, the doctor told me years ago I have something wrong with my heart. It's… congestive heart failure, I think he called it. It’s been stable for a long time, mostly managed with… pills. I take a few different ones every day. And I had a little bit of arthritis in my knees, but that's just aches and pains, you know? Nothing serious. I've been seeing Dr. Ramirez for my heart for years, but he retired last year and I haven’t really found a new doctor yet, until now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Ms. Sadhu. Congestive heart failure is important to be aware of, especially given your current symptoms. It’s understandable that finding a new cardiologist after Dr. Ramirez retired has been a challenge. Could you tell me what medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I have them in my purse. Just a minute… Here we are. Okay, let’s see. There’s… Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And Furosemide, 40 milligrams, every morning. And… Digoxin, 0.125 milligrams. I take that every day too. Oh, and Aspirin, 81 milligrams. Just a baby aspirin, the doctor said. And… sometimes I take Tylenol for my knees, but not every day. Is that everything? I think so. I usually have my daughter refill them for me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sadhu. That’s a very helpful list. Lisinopril, Furosemide, Digoxin, and Aspirin – I’m noting all of that. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. I eat pretty much everything, and I’ve never had any problems with any pills. I've been lucky that way, I suppose. Though I don’t eat much these days, like I said. It's just… not appetizing. But allergies? No, I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Sadhu. No known allergies are helpful. Now, let's move on to your past surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Years ago, when I was younger, I had my gallbladder taken out. That was a long time ago. And… oh, when I broke my wrist, I had to have a cast on, and they took some x-rays. But that wasn’t really a surgery, was it? Besides that… no, I don't think I've been in the hospital for anything else. Just the usual colds and flu, you know? Nothing serious. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Even with my heart… it’s been stable for a long time. Until now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sadhu. Gallbladder removal and a broken wrist, noted. Now, regarding your family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My mother had heart trouble, I remember that. She ended up with a bad heart and had to… well, she passed away when I was still young. My father, he had diabetes, I think. And my brother… he had cancer, a long time ago. Lung cancer. He smoked a lot. But that’s about it, I think. Nothing else major that I can remember. It was a long time ago, you know. My memory isn't what it used to be. But heart trouble and diabetes… those run in the family, I’m pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sadhu. That’s helpful to know about your family history of heart trouble, diabetes, and cancer. Finally, let’s talk a little bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I've never touched a cigarette in my life, and I don’t drink alcohol. It’s just… not for me. And drugs? Absolutely not! I was raised a good Catholic girl, you know? I just… don’t do those things. I do enjoy a good cup of tea, though. And I used to love to dance, when I was younger. But now, with my heart… I don’t get out much. Mostly I just stay home and watch television. And I have my daughter visit, of course. She's a good girl.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sadhu. That’s very helpful. So, no smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drug use. Alright, Ms. Sadhu, thank you for answering all of those questions. That gives me a much better understanding of your overall health. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination to get a better assessment of your condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, please. My old bones aren’t what they used to be. And… I might get a little cold, I always do when someone touches me. But don't worry about that. Go ahead, do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sadhu. I will be as gentle as possible. And don’t worry about getting cold; we can take our time. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Is that alright? It's a little hard, you know, with my heart. I feel a little… funny sometimes when I breathe deep. But I'll try my best.
DOCTOR: I'm hearing some crackles in the bases of both lungs, Ms. Sadhu. And your heart sounds a bit… distant, with a slightly irregular rhythm. I also detect a slight swelling in your ankles. Does that surprise you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Crackles? Irregular rhythm? Swelling? Well, now… I have noticed my ankles were a bit puffy lately, but I just thought it was the heat. And I do get short of breath, like I told you. But… crackles sounds bad, doesn’t it? Is that serious, Doctor? My heart… is it getting worse? I’m worried now.
DOCTOR: It’s good you're being open with your concerns, Ms. Sadhu. Crackles in the lungs can indicate fluid buildup, which is something we often see with congestive heart failure. The irregular rhythm and swelling are also consistent with that. It doesn’t necessarily mean things are getting drastically worse, but it does mean we need to investigate further and adjust your treatment plan if necessary. Your abdomen is soft, and your pulses are a bit weak, but present. Now, I’d like to check your blood pressure and oxygen saturation. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better, you know? Weak pulses… is that bad? It's all so confusing. Go ahead, do what you need to do. And thank you for explaining things, even if I don't understand all of it. It helps to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 140/90, and your oxygen saturation is 92%. Those numbers are a little elevated, and on the lower end for oxygen saturation, respectively. Alright, Ms. Sadhu, that completes the physical examination. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve observed during the exam, I believe your symptoms are likely related to worsening congestive heart failure. However, to confirm this and rule out other possibilities, I would like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, kidney function tests, and a BNP level. A BNP level will help assess the amount of stress on your heart. I would also like to get an EKG to assess your heart rhythm in more detail, and a chest X-ray to look for fluid buildup in your lungs. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. More tests? That sounds… a little scary, Doctor. But… if it will help me feel better, then yes. Yes, do whatever you think is necessary. Blood tests, EKG, chest X-ray… I trust your judgment. Will they be painful? And… how long will it take to get the results? I just want to know what's going on, you know? And I hope it's not something too serious. I'm a bit worried, Doctor. Really worried.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to be worried, Ms. Sadhu. I want to assure you that these tests are routine and generally not painful. The blood test will involve a small needle prick, and the EKG involves placing some sticky pads on your chest. The chest X-ray is painless; you’ll simply stand in front of a machine. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back, and my nurse will contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I want to emphasize that we are being proactive in investigating your symptoms, and we’ll develop a plan based on the results. To potentially alleviate some of your symptoms while we wait for the results, I recommend reducing your sodium intake and monitoring your weight daily. If you notice any sudden weight gain or increased shortness of breath, please contact my office immediately. Would you like me to provide you with a written list of these instructions?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. A written list would be wonderful. My memory… it's not what it used to be, you know. Sodium intake… that means less salt, right? And monitoring my weight… I have a scale at home. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. You've put my mind at ease a little, knowing you're taking this seriously. I just want to feel better, and I trust you to help me with that. What happens after the tests? Will you call me with the results, or do I need to come back for another appointment?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right, less salt. And it’s good you have a scale at home. Keeping track of your weight is very helpful. Once the results are available, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. During that appointment, we’ll discuss the results in detail and develop a personalized treatment plan. This may involve adjusting your current medications, adding new ones, or recommending other therapies. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as increased shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or significant swelling in your legs or ankles – please do not hesitate to contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Ms. Sadhu?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Thank you so much for taking the time to listen to me and explain things so clearly. You’ve been very kind and patient. I feel a little better just knowing what’s going on, and that you’re here to help me. I'll try to follow the instructions as best I can, and I'll wait for the nurse to call. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been a blessing.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sadhu. It was my pleasure to meet you, and I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Please remember, I’m here for you, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. My nurse's number is on the handout. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
