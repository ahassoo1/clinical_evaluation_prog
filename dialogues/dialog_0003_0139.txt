DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Shanor. I’m Dr. Yackey. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. I… need check for referee. For fitness. They want me to get checked. For… work. I do… fix things. Hot things. But I also… referee games. Basketball, mostly. They need me fit.
DOCTOR: A referee physical… right. And you “fix hot things”?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… inside the ovens. Big ovens. Factories. Very hot. Sometimes I… patch them up. It’s… hard work. Lots of bending. And lifting. But the referee… that’s important too. I need to run fast. Not so much lifting for that. Just… running. And seeing.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re requesting a fitness evaluation for both your occupational duties – oven repair – and your extracurricular activity as a basketball referee. To clarify, are you experiencing any specific symptoms or concerns that prompted this evaluation now?
PATIENT: No, no symptoms. Not really. Just… getting older. Thirty-one is… not young anymore. They want to make sure I can still… do it. Before something… happens. I don’t want to fall or… something. While I’m working. Or refereeing. Just… be safe. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Preventative measures. Very well. Let's proceed with a standard physical assessment, then. I suppose we should start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, hypertension, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I… had a bad flu last year. Very bad. But I got better. My wife… she took care of me. But… she is gone now. So… no, no long-term sickness. Just… the flu. And… sadness.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. Just… a broken arm when I was little. Fell from a tree. But it healed good. Doctor fixed it. A long time ago. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Very good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My parents are in China. I… talk to them sometimes. They are… old. Healthy, I think. But… far away. My wife… she had a sister. But we don’t… talk much. She is busy. No one sick in family. Not that I know.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills. My wife… she used to take some for… her head. But I don’t. Just… water. And sometimes tea.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to the physical examination, then. I'm going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate – and then perform a basic musculoskeletal assessment. Please remove your shirt and shoes. We'll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Okay. Okay, sure. Is… is it cold in here? I feel… a little cold.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 128 over 76. Within normal limits. Pulse is 72, regular. Respiration rate is 16. Now, if you could extend your arms… I’ll assess your range of motion. Can you reach for the ceiling?
PATIENT: Ow… a little tight. Here. I… fix things with my arms. Lots of reaching. It sometimes… hurts. But I work through it. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Mild tenderness to palpation, limited range of motion in external rotation. Could be a rotator cuff strain, though it’s difficult to say definitively without further evaluation. Now, let’s check your lower back. Bend forward and touch your toes, if you can. And don't push yourself if it causes significant pain.
PATIENT: Ow! No… can’t go further. It… pinches. Here. I… lift heavy things. Ovens are… not light. Sometimes I… feel a pop. But it goes away. It’s okay. I just… be careful. Is that… bad? Really bad?
DOCTOR: Limited forward flexion, tenderness to palpation in the lumbar spine. Possible lumbar strain. We'll need to rule out any nerve impingement. I'm going to perform a straight leg raise test. Lie flat on your back. Now, I'm going to lift your leg while keeping it straight. Tell me if you feel any pain radiating down your leg.
PATIENT: Ow! Yes… there. Down the leg. Not… so bad. But… there. Like… pins and needles. It’s… a little scary. Is something… broken?
DOCTOR: Possible sciatic nerve irritation. It’s unlikely to be a fracture, but we need to be certain. I’m going to order an MRI of your lumbar spine to evaluate the extent of the nerve compression. In the meantime, I recommend you limit heavy lifting and strenuous activity. I’ll also prescribe you a muscle relaxant and an anti-inflammatory to manage the pain. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss?
PATIENT: MRI… that sounds… expensive. And… a long time? I need to… work. And referee. Can I… still referee? Just… small games? And… what about the shoulder? Is that… bad too? The muscle relaxant… will it make me… sleepy?
DOCTOR: The MRI is necessary to rule out any serious pathology. As for the cost, that's something you'll need to discuss with your insurance provider. Regarding your ability to referee, I strongly advise against it until we have the results of the MRI. Continuing to exert yourself could exacerbate the injury. As for your shoulder, it appears to be a mild strain. Rest, ice, and over-the-counter pain relievers should provide some relief, but we'll need to monitor it. The muscle relaxant can cause drowsiness, so avoid operating heavy machinery or driving. I’m going to schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks to discuss the results of the MRI and formulate a comprehensive treatment plan. Do you have any questions about the medication?
PATIENT: No… no questions. Just… scared. Scared about work. And… getting old. Two weeks… that’s a long time. Maybe… maybe just small games? I’m careful. I promise.
DOCTOR: Mr. Shanor, I understand your concerns, but I must prioritize your health and safety. Continuing to engage in strenuous activity while potentially suffering from a nerve impingement is irresponsible. I strongly advise against it. We need to gather more information before we can determine a safe course of action. I've given you my recommendations. We will discuss the results of the MRI in two weeks. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. Thank you, Doctor. .
