DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I’m Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Dondre. It’s… well, it’s my water. Or, not getting my water out, really. It just… stays. It’s uncomfortable, and I have to… well, strain a bit to go. It’s been happening for a little while now. Not all the time, but often enough to bother me.
DOCTOR: Hmm, alright Dondre. So you're experiencing difficulty emptying your bladder completely, and it’s causing you discomfort?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. That’s right. Discomfort is a good way to put it. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, but it feels… full, even after I’ve… gone. And sometimes it feels like I haven’t gone enough, you know? It’s hard to explain. I just… feel stuck. It’s been worse the last few weeks, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how often would you say this is happening?
PATIENT: Let me think… most days, now. Not every time I try to go, but most times. Maybe six or seven times a week? It’s hard to keep track, really. I don’t write things down. Used to be just now and then, but lately… more often. It’s worrying me a little. I don’t like feeling like I can’t… empty myself, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, it does. And have you noticed any changes in your urine stream itself?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, really. It’s… well, it feels normal when it comes out. Not weak, not strong, just… normal. Maybe a little bit slower than it used to be? But I’m not sure if that’s just me getting older. I’m 53, you know. Things slow down when you get older, I figure. I haven’t seen any blood or anything like that, if that’s what you mean. Just… hard to get it all out.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Have you had any fever, chills, lower back pain, or nausea or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. No fever, no chills. My back's a little achy sometimes, but that’s just from working. I stand a lot at my job. And no nausea or vomiting. I eat regular, feel pretty good, other than this water problem. Just… tired sometimes, but who isn't? It’s been a hot summer, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well… I don’t have a whole lot of history, thankfully. I had the flu a couple times, broke my arm when I was a boy, but nothing serious. My wife… she had some problems with her heart, but she's gone now. Passed away five years ago. I have Medicare, if that helps. I get my check-ups, but usually it’s just blood pressure and cholesterol. I don’t take any regular medicines, unless you count a little something for my knees when they act up.
DOCTOR: Okay, and when you say something for your knees, what exactly do you take?
PATIENT: It's just… over-the-counter stuff, Doctor. A cream, mostly. Sometimes a little pill, the orange kind, for when they're really sore. I can’t remember the name right now, old man’s brain, you know? It's not a prescription, I promise. Just something to help with the aches. I mostly try to just walk it off, but sometimes I need a little help. It's not every day, though.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife was the one with allergies. Pollen, mostly. I can eat anything, take anything, as far as I know. Never had to worry about it. It's a blessing, really. Makes things simpler.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. I'll need you to lie down on the exam table. I'll listen to your abdomen and do a quick neurological check. Then I'll need a urine sample. Is that okay?
PATIENT: That sounds… alright, Doctor. I trust your judgment. A little nervous, but I suppose it needs to be done. Yes, I can lie down. And I can give you a water sample, no problem. Just tell me what you need me to do. I haven’t had one of those in a long time, though. Just point me towards the bathroom, and I’ll do my best.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could collect a sample in this cup, please. And then come back, and we’ll get started. Try to get a mid-stream sample if you can – that means start urinating, and then collect the sample a few seconds into it. It's cleaner that way. I’ll be right here when you’re done.
PATIENT: Right. Mid-stream… okay, I think I remember that from when I was younger. I’ll do my best. Give me a minute.
DOCTOR: Take your time, Mr. Hilber.
PATIENT: There you go, Doctor. Sorry if it took a minute. It wasn't… easy. Still feels a little empty, if I’m honest. But I got it for you.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Hilber. Now, if you could lie down on the table, please. I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Just relax and breathe normally. Your abdomen sounds… normal. No unusual sounds. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and sensation. It’s just a standard part of the evaluation. Can you feel this when I touch your leg?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that, Doctor. Feels… normal. A little cold, maybe, but that’s just the gel, I suppose. Is something wrong? It feels like you're looking for something specific. I'm not trying to be rude, but I like to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: Everything feels normal so far, Mr. Hilber. I'm just being thorough. Now, I’m going to need to perform a digital rectal exam. This is to check your prostate gland. I understand this can be uncomfortable, but it's important to rule out any issues there. It may provide some information about your difficulty urinating. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Oh. A… a what exam, Doctor? I’ve never had one of those before. It sounds… unpleasant. I don't like the sound of that at all. Is it absolutely necessary? I'm a little embarrassed, if I'm honest. And… well, it just doesn't sound very comfortable. Is there anything else we can try first?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Hilber. It is not the most comfortable exam, I won’t lie. However, given your symptoms – the difficulty emptying your bladder, the sensation of incomplete emptying – it’s a very important step in ruling out potential causes. An enlarged prostate is a common cause of these issues, especially as men get older. It allows us to assess the size and texture of your prostate gland. We could order a PSA blood test first, which can give us an indication of prostate health. However, a PSA test isn't always accurate, and it can sometimes lead to unnecessary further testing. The digital rectal exam is the most reliable way to get a clear picture of what’s going on. I wouldn’t recommend something without good reason. I'm trying to get to the bottom of this for you, and this is a crucial step. I’ll be as gentle and quick as possible. Do you have any questions about the procedure itself?
PATIENT: A PSA test… that sounds better, at least. Less… invasive. But you say it's not always accurate? So, we could do that, and then still end up having to do… that exam? And what are we looking for, exactly? Is it something serious? I don't want to worry about something terrible. Just… tell me straight. What are the chances it's something bad? I'm an old man, Doctor, but I still want to be around for a little while longer.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber, let's talk about the PSA test and what we might find. A PSA test measures the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood. Elevated levels can indicate prostate issues, such as an enlarged prostate, prostatitis , or even prostate cancer. However, many things can cause an elevated PSA level – age, certain medications, even recent ejaculation. So, it’s not a definitive test on its own. If the PSA test is elevated, we would likely recommend a digital rectal exam to further assess the prostate. And it’s true, we could end up there regardless. Now, as for the chances of something serious… it's difficult to say without doing any tests. Most men with an enlarged prostate do not have cancer. It's more likely to be a benign condition. However, it’s important to rule out cancer, and that's why we need to investigate. We can start with the PSA test. If it’s normal, we may not need to proceed with the digital rectal exam. If it’s elevated, we can discuss your options and make a decision together. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Alright. The PSA test… yes, that sounds better. Let's start with that. And if it's high… then we'll talk about the other thing. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… be honest with me, okay? No sugarcoating. I want to know what's going on, even if it's not good news. How long does the test take? And when will I get the results? I don’t want to be waiting around for weeks, worrying myself sick.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hilber. I completely understand. Honesty is paramount. I will explain everything to you clearly, no matter what the results are. The PSA test is a simple blood draw. It will only take a few minutes. I’ll order it right now, and our lab usually gets the results back within 3 to 5 business days. I’ll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain while urinating, please call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And for being patient with me. It's not easy talking about… well, that stuff. I appreciate you not pushing me right away. Let's just get the test done, and see what it says. I’ll wait for the nurse to call. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Hilber. I understand it can be difficult to discuss these issues. That’s what I’m here for. My nurse will be in touch soon. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Have a good day, Mr. Hilber.
