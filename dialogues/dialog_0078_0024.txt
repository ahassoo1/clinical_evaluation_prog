DOCTOR: Good morning, Kiante. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. I need a letter saying I'm able to fly. That's really all. My insurance, Medicare, needs it, and I'd like to travel soon, if possible. It's for a trip…a personal one.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A medical clearance for air travel, to be submitted to Medicare. That's perfectly reasonable. Just to be thorough, and to ensure I can provide a complete and accurate letter, could you tell me a little bit about why Medicare is requesting this clearance?
PATIENT: It’s…because of my heart. I had a problem a few years back, and they just need confirmation I'm okay to fly now. It was…after my husband passed. A really stressful time. It wasn’t anything major, they patched me up, and I’ve been fine since. No problems at all, really. But they need the letter anyway.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for sharing that with me, Kiante. It's completely understandable that a stressful event like that would affect your health, and it’s good they are being cautious. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about what happened a few years ago?
PATIENT: It was…arrhythmia, I think. My heart was racing, wouldn’t settle down. I ended up in the hospital for a few days. They did some tests, and a little…procedure to fix it. A catheter, I believe. They said it was stress-induced. That was…February 2022, I think. It was right after…right after the funeral. I don’t really like to talk about it, but I can tell you it was scary. And now Medicare needs a letter. Do you need anything else?
DOCTOR: I understand this is difficult to talk about, and I appreciate you sharing what you’re comfortable with. February 2022, arrhythmia requiring a catheter procedure…that’s helpful. Just a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you been experiencing any symptoms related to your heart since that event?
PATIENT: No, none at all. Truly. Not a single one. That’s why I’m so frustrated with Medicare, to be honest. I feel perfectly fine. I walk every day, I eat well, I take my vitamins. I’ve been to my regular check-ups, and everything is always normal. They just want a letter. Honestly, it’s a bit of a hassle.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear – no symptoms and regular check-ups are encouraging. And I understand your frustration; it’s definitely a hassle when paperwork stands in the way of things you want to do. Now, just to be complete, do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have mild arthritis in my knees, but it’s managed with over-the-counter medication. Nothing serious. And…I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. But that was a one-time thing, and I’ve had no problems since. Other than that, no. Just the arthritis and the gallbladder. And the heart thing, of course, but that was a few years ago, and I’m fine now.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild arthritis managed with OTC medication and gallbladder removal ten years ago. That’s helpful. And before we proceed, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take glucosamine and chondroitin for the arthritis. Just the one bottle, twice a day. And a multivitamin, every morning. That’s it. Really. I try to avoid taking too many pills. I think that’s everything.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Glucosamine and chondroitin for the arthritis, and a multivitamin. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and make sure everything sounds good. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Get it over with. The sooner I get the letter, the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’m just listening to your heart and lungs. Take slow, deep breaths for me, please. Your heart rate is regular, and I’m not hearing any murmurs or abnormal sounds. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Pulses are strong and regular. Blood pressure is 128/78. Everything sounds good so far. I'd also like to check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter. Your oxygen saturation is 98% on room air, which is excellent.
PATIENT: That’s good, isn't it? Everything sounds good. Can we just get the letter now? I really need to get this sorted. I have a trip planned, and I’d like to book my flights before prices go up.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything does sound good, Kiante. That’s reassuring. And I understand your urgency regarding your trip. Based on your history, the physical exam, and the absence of any concerning symptoms, I am comfortable providing a letter stating that you are medically cleared for air travel. I will draft it now and have it ready for you before you leave. It will include a statement confirming your stable cardiac status and the findings of today's examination. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes! That's perfect. Thank you, Doctor. That's exactly what I needed. You’ve saved me a lot of trouble. I appreciate it. Is there anything else you need from me?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. I’m glad I could help. Here you go. I've included my contact information in case Medicare requires any further clarification. I also recommend keeping a copy for your own records. Just to be certain, are there any other medical concerns I should address today, or are you all set?
PATIENT: No, that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I think I’m all set now. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kiante. You have a wonderful trip, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Take care.
