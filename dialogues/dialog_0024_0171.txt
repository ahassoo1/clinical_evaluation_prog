DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of this visit today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. It's... my nails, I think. They just don't look right. I don't remember exactly when they started, honestly. Things kinda blur together, you know? They're just… funny colors. And one's kinda loose. It's bothering me, I guess.
DOCTOR: "Funny colors," you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Not good funny. Like... not a nice pink or anything. More like... dingy. And one is, like, peeling. It’s just…not me. I usually keep them neat. It's just…odd. I don’t know what happened. Did I…do something? I don't think so.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, with all due respect, “odd” is not a clinical descriptor. To properly assess this…situation, I require more precise information. When you say “dingy,” can you elaborate?
PATIENT: Ugh. See, this is why I don’t like doctors. Always needing details. Okay, fine. They’re…yellowish. And kinda thick. Not…smooth, you know? Like they haven’t been filed or…polished. Even though I always get them done. Honestly, it’s just strange. I don’t even remember the last time I had a manicure, and I always have them done. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: “Probably nothing” rarely is, Ms. Thut. Thickening and discoloration…have you noticed any changes in the shape of the nails themselves?
PATIENT: Shape? Hmm. I don't know. I just look at the color mostly. They feel… harder, maybe? Like when you try to cut them and they don't really...cut. It's hard to explain. Look, is this going to take long? I have… things to do. Important things. Not that this isn't important, but...you know. Time is precious.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, I assure you, I am quite efficient. However, a cursory examination will not suffice. Allow me to perform a basic physical assessment of your nails. It will be…illuminating. Please extend your hands.
PATIENT: Oh, now you need to poke and prod? Honestly. Fine. But be gentle, okay? I have sensitive skin. And don't take too long. What even are you looking for? Is this some kind of… fungus thing? I really hope not. Those commercials are awful.
DOCTOR: “Fungus thing” is a rather unrefined term, Ms. Thut. However, onychomycosis – a fungal nail infection – is a possibility. I am also noting some subtle pitting and lifting of the nail plate. The color is, as you mentioned, yellowish and appears to be…diffuse. Your nails do appear abnormally thick, and the texture is decidedly…coarse. Have you experienced any pain or discomfort in or around the nails?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. Just…annoyed. They catch on things, you know? Like when I’m trying to button my coat. It’s a small annoyance, that’s all. I don’t get why this is such a big deal. Maybe I just need a better nail polish. Or… a different salon. You think that could be it? Is it possible they messed something up? Honestly, those places aren’t always the cleanest.
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, while a suboptimal manicure is certainly a possibility, your symptoms suggest a more… systemic issue. I am noting no swelling or inflammation around the nail beds, which decreases the likelihood of a local infection. However, the thickening and discoloration, combined with your reported difficulty cutting the nails, raises concern. Have you experienced any other changes – fatigue, unexplained weight loss, skin changes anywhere else on your body?
PATIENT: Ugh, now you're asking about my weight? That's rude. Honestly. I haven't really… noticed anything else. I’m tired sometimes, but who isn't? I work, you know. It’s exhausting. My skin? It’s fine. A little dry, maybe. But I live in the desert, okay? It's supposed to be dry. I don’t know what you’re getting at. Is it…serious? Are you going to send me for a bunch of tests? I hate tests.
DOCTOR: “Hate tests” is hardly a medical justification for ignoring potential underlying pathologies, Ms. Thut. Given your symptoms – and your admittedly vague medical history – a basic blood panel and a fungal culture are… advisable. I will order those now. And, to address your concern about “serious,” we are merely ruling out possibilities. However, it is essential to ascertain whether this is a localized issue, or indicative of a broader systemic condition. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. I mean, I get a little itchy sometimes, but that's probably just the dust. Or the cats. I have two cats. They’re very fluffy. And they shed. A lot. I don’t think I’ve ever had a serious allergic reaction, though. Like, never had to go to the hospital or anything. But, you know, I sometimes get a rash if I wear cheap jewelry. Does that count? It’s probably just the metal, though.
DOCTOR: "Cheap jewelry" is noted, Ms. Thut. The lab requisitions are now printed. Please proceed to the lab for blood work and a fungal culture of your nails. The results typically take 7-10 business days. I will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: Ugh, 7-10 days? That's forever. And I have to go to another place? Fine. I guess. I mean, what choice do I have? Okay, just one question. Will this cost me a lot of money? My Medicare… does it cover all this? Because I really don’t want a huge bill. And where is this lab, exactly?
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, I am a physician, not a billing specialist. However, Medicare generally covers diagnostic testing as medically necessary. I can assure you this is, in my professional opinion, prudent. The lab address and contact information are clearly printed on the requisition. If you encounter any billing issues, you will need to contact Medicare directly. I have limited involvement in insurance matters. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Okay. I guess not. You’ve been…helpful. Sort of. It’s just…a lot. Okay, I’ll go to the lab. And I’ll deal with Medicare. Just…don't expect me to be happy about it. Thank you. I think. .
DOCTOR: Very well. .
