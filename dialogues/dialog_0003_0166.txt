DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Kinjerski. I am Dr. Yackey. Please, have a seat. Now, I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to put it simply, my leg has been…numb. It started a few weeks ago, and it hasn’t really gone away. It’s mostly in my left leg, though sometimes I feel a little tingling in my right one as well. I wanted to get it checked out, just to be sure everything is alright.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. Approximately three weeks, give or take a few days. It began subtly, just a slight…lack of feeling, I suppose. I initially dismissed it as sleeping on it wrong, but it’s persisted, and now it’s become quite noticeable. It doesn't come and go, it's just…there. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: “Just there,” is…vague. Can you describe the quality of the numbness?
PATIENT: That’s a fair question, Doctor. Let me think… it isn’t a sharp pain, certainly. More like… a dulling. Like when your foot falls asleep, but it doesn’t quite go away completely when you get the feeling back. And it isn’t cold, though sometimes it feels like it could be. It’s just… absent. If that makes any sense at all. It’s difficult to describe, honestly. It's not painful, but it’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling. Right. And is this numbness constant, or does it fluctuate throughout the day?
PATIENT: It’s fairly constant, yes. Though, I have noticed it seems to be a bit worse after I’ve been standing for a long time, or after I've been working on… well, my projects. I do special effects and animation, so I spend quite a bit of time sitting at my workstation. I wouldn't say it gets worse with activity, exactly, but more that the feeling is just… more pronounced when I'm still afterwards. Does that clarify things at all?
DOCTOR: Special effects and animation. So, prolonged sitting. And has this been a recent change in your routine, or have you been doing that for some time?
PATIENT: It hasn’t been a recent change, no. I’ve been doing that work for about five years now, since I finished school. I try to take breaks and stretch regularly, but… well, deadlines can be demanding. I suppose it's possible it's related, but I hadn't considered it a serious enough factor to seek medical attention until recently, when the feeling became… more persistent.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No weakness in the leg, no shooting pains, no changes in skin color or temperature. My balance feels normal. I haven't noticed any issues with my feet, or any problems with my bowel or bladder control. Nothing else springs to mind, honestly. It really is just the numbness, and the slightly unsettling feeling that comes with it.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's have a look at the leg. Please, lie down on the examination table. I’ll need to do a basic neurological exam.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please let me know if you need me to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, though slightly diminished on the left. Muscle strength is 5/5 in all major muscle groups. Sensation to light touch is slightly decreased in the distal left lower leg and foot. No obvious signs of injury. It appears there’s some mild sensory deficit. Now, have you experienced any recent trauma to the leg, even minor bumps or scrapes?
PATIENT: No, sir, I haven’t. I’ve been quite careful to avoid any injuries. I work with a lot of equipment, but I’m always very mindful of safety precautions. I haven't had any falls, or any incidents that would explain a sudden onset of nerve damage. It truly did seem to come on gradually, almost imperceptibly at first. Though, thinking about it, I did help a friend move some furniture about a month ago… a fairly heavy couch, I recall. But it wasn’t anything particularly strenuous, and I didn’t notice any pain at the time. Could that have been the cause, do you think?
DOCTOR: Possibly. Or it could be… a number of things. We’ll need to rule out more serious causes first. Do you have any history of diabetes or peripheral vascular disease?
PATIENT: No, sir. No history of either, as far as I know. My mother has slightly elevated blood sugar, but she manages it with diet and exercise, and it's not a full-blown case of diabetes. I've always been reasonably healthy, and I have regular check-ups with my primary care physician. I don’t smoke, and I only drink occasionally. Is there anything specific you’re looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to order some blood work to check your glucose levels, kidney function, and vitamin B12 levels. We’ll also need to do an electromyography to assess the nerve function in your leg. That's to rule out nerve compression. Do you have any allergies to contrast dyes or other medications?
PATIENT: No, sir, I don’t have any known allergies. I've had various vaccinations and medications over the years without any adverse reactions. I'm not currently taking any prescription medications, aside from a multivitamin occasionally. An EMG, you said? I'm unfamiliar with that procedure, Doctor. Could you explain it briefly? Is it painful?
DOCTOR: It involves inserting a small needle into your muscle to measure electrical activity. There may be some mild discomfort, a slight stinging sensation. It’s not overly painful, but it’s not entirely pleasant either. We’ll need a referral to a neurologist for that. I’ll have the nurse schedule that for you. Until then, try to avoid any strenuous activity, and if the numbness worsens, or you develop any weakness or pain, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. An EMG with a neurologist, avoid strenuous activity, and seek immediate attention if things worsen. It sounds… thorough. And what if the blood work comes back normal? What would be the next step then, if the blood tests don't reveal anything? I’m just trying to understand the possible course of action here.
DOCTOR: Then we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. It could be a number of things, peripheral neuropathy, nerve impingement… It’s unlikely to be serious, but we need to rule everything out. The neurologist will be best equipped to determine the cause and recommend appropriate treatment. Any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything for now. Thank you for your time and thorough examination. I appreciate you explaining the process so clearly, and I’ll be sure to follow up with the nurse to schedule the appointment with the neurologist. I’ll let you get back to your other patients. Have a good afternoon.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will contact you. Have a good day. .
