DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I haven't got all day, so let's get on with it. I need a signature, that's all. For the… the face thing. My daughter said I need clearance before I go under the knife. She worries too much, that girl.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. So, you need a medical clearance for a facial surgical procedure. Could you tell me a little more about what's being done?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't rightly know all the details. Some lifting, tightening… she picked the doctor, handled all the arrangements. Said it’ll make me look “fresher.” Sounds like a waste of money, if you ask me, but a man can’t argue with his daughters, can he? It’s not like I wanted this. She says I’m starting to look… well, never mind what she says. Just need the paper signed.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like your daughter is taking the lead on this. To ensure your safety and proper clearance, I do need some information from you, Mr. Orwin. Have you had any medical evaluations specifically for this surgery – things like an EKG or blood work?
PATIENT: Evaluations? Blood work? Now you’re talking gibberish. She didn’t mention anything like that. I went to the doctor she sent me to, he poked around a bit, asked some questions… that was it. I thought that was the evaluation. This is getting ridiculous. I just want the form signed so I can get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any existing medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or breathing difficulties?
PATIENT: Breathing difficulties? No. A bit of a cough in the winter, but that’s it. I’m a sturdy Norwegian, you know. We don’t get difficulties. Blood pressure… maybe a little high sometimes, but nothing a good nap doesn’t fix. I worked with terrazzo for fifty years, hauling heavy stone. That’ll put some pressure on a man, wouldn't you say? I'm generally a healthy man. Look, is this going to take long? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: I understand your time is valuable, Mr. Orwin. Just a few more questions to be thorough. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think... Just a little something for my arthritis now and then. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called. When it flares up. And… that’s it. A vitamin D supplement in the winter, my daughter insists. Says I don’t get enough sun. Honestly, I feel like she's treating me like a child sometimes. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: It is, Mr. Orwin. We need to have a complete picture of your health before giving clearance for any surgery, even a relatively minor one. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, I don’t have allergies. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me my whole life. Fish, meat, vegetables… you name it. I worked alongside all sorts, you learn to eat what’s available. No, no allergies. Really, this is taking a long time. Is there a quicker way to do this? My daughter will have my hide if I’m late for lunch.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. One last quick check. Have you had any previous surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. There was that time I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree. And… oh, and I had my appendix out when I was young. Other than that? No. Nothing major. Just the usual bumps and bruises from a life of hard work. Honestly, I'm starting to feel like I'm being interrogated here. Can we just get to the signing, please? I'm a perfectly healthy man.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Orwin. Just to confirm, you’ve had a broken arm as a child and an appendectomy. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam – just to check your heart and lungs and listen to your breathing. It won't take long. After that, we can discuss whether or not I can sign the clearance form. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. I haven’t got all day, you know. Just be quick about it. My lunch is waiting. And don’t tell my daughter I complained, alright? She'll never let me hear the end of it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Orwin. I’ll be as efficient as possible. If you could just sit back and relax… Your heart rate is a bit elevated, 88 beats per minute, and the rhythm is regular. I'm also listening to your lungs… take a deep breath for me, please. Breath sounds are clear bilaterally, but slightly diminished at the bases. Do you feel any chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Shortness of breath… not unless I’m climbing a steep hill. I'm 81 years old, doctor, things aren’t quite what they used to be. This is probably just normal for a man my age. Look, are you going to sign the form or not? My daughter is going to be furious if I'm late. I've already told you, I'm a sturdy Norwegian! We don't complain.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, while you are a “sturdy Norwegian,” as you say, the slightly elevated heart rate and diminished breath sounds do warrant some further investigation before I can comfortably sign the clearance for surgery. It’s important to ensure your heart and lungs are functioning optimally, especially with an upcoming procedure. I'm concerned about the possibility of underlying heart or lung issues that haven't been diagnosed. I'm not comfortable signing the form without first ordering an EKG and a chest X-ray. Would you be willing to undergo those tests?
PATIENT: Tests?! Now you're really pushing it! An EKG? A chest X-ray? This is ridiculous! I came here for a signature, not a full medical workup. Look, doctor, I appreciate your… thoroughness, but I'm telling you, I'm fine. My daughter will have a fit if I have to delay the surgery for tests. She's already booked everything, made all the arrangements… Honestly, just sign the darn form. I'll take responsibility. If anything goes wrong, it’s on me. Just... please. I don’t want to deal with this anymore.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration and your desire to avoid further delays. However, as a physician, I have a professional and ethical obligation to prioritize your safety. Signing a clearance form knowing there’s a potential risk to your health would be irresponsible. I cannot, in good conscience, sign the form without those tests. It's not about delaying your surgery; it's about ensuring you're healthy enough to undergo it safely. I am willing to compromise. We can schedule a quick appointment for tomorrow morning for the EKG and X-ray, and I can review the results and sign the form as soon as possible. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Tomorrow?! Are you kidding me? My daughter will have my hide! This is a disaster! Fine! Fine! Do your tests. But if it delays the surgery, you're dealing with my daughter. She’s a lawyer, you know. A very good lawyer. Just… get it over with quickly. And don’t tell her I complained. This is a nightmare. A complete and utter nightmare.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I've scheduled the tests for tomorrow at 9:00 AM. The order will be sent to the radiology department. Please bring any previous medical records you have with you. I understand your frustration, and I assure you, we'll do everything we can to expedite the process. Before you leave, do you have any questions for me?
