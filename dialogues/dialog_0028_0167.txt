DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Stoegbauer, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, dat is me. Emiliano Stoegbauer. Pleased to meet you, Doctor… Memmolo, you say? It’s a good day, yes? Warm, but not too warm.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. The weather is…fine. Let’s not dwell on that. You're here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, my foot. It’s been…troublesome. A sore, you see. A bad sore dat won’t get better. Been hurting for maybe…two, tree months now? It’s on my…right foot. Down near my toes. I walk with a little limp now, because of it.
DOCTOR: Right foot, sore for two to three months. And it’s affecting your gait, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, my walk. It’s not so good anymore. I used to be able to walk for miles, you know? Now… not so much. And it aches, even when I’m just sitting. It's…uncomfortable. Is dat what you want to know, Doctor? I try to keep it clean, but it’s hard when you can’t see so well.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any…discharge from the sore?
PATIENT: Discharge? Hmm. Like…water coming out? Sometimes, yes. A little. It makes the sock wet. It’s not much, but it’s…there. And sometimes it smells…not so good. I change my socks often, though. Very often. I don’t want it to get infected. My wife…she always told me to keep things clean.
DOCTOR: Right. So, some drainage, possibly malodorous. Any fever, chills, or redness spreading around the sore?
PATIENT: Fever? Not really. I feel warm sometimes, but dat’s just because it’s hot outside, I think. No chills, no. And…redness. Hmm. It’s a little red around it, yes. Not a lot, but it’s…there. It’s hard to tell, you know? My skin…it’s not like it used to be. Old skin.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look. Please, sit back on the table and remove your shoe and sock. I need to see the area in question.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I can do dat. It’s a little slow, you know? Old bones. Here we go… Yes, you can see it now. It doesn't look pretty, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, there’s a lesion present, approximately 2 centimeters in diameter. There is some surrounding erythema and mild edema. The wound bed appears…granulated, and I do detect a small amount of purulent drainage. Do you have diabetes, Mr. Stoegbauer?
PATIENT: Oh. Dat… yes. I do. Doctor told me years ago. I take my medicine, but sometimes… I forget. It’s hard to remember everything when you get old, you know? Is dat bad? Is dat why my foot is so sore?
DOCTOR: It’s…less than ideal. Poorly controlled diabetes can certainly contribute to foot ulcers and delayed healing. We need to get this properly assessed. I’m going to order a wound culture to rule out infection and a blood sugar test to see where your levels are at currently. Do you know when the last time you had a foot exam was?
PATIENT: A foot exam? Oh, goodness. I don't remember. A long time, I think. Maybe… before my wife passed? Dat was… five years ago, maybe more. I don't go to the doctor much, you know? I don't like doctors. Too many pokings and proddings.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we need to address that. Lack of regular foot care is a major concern with diabetes. I’m also going to order an X-ray to check for any underlying bone infection. Based on what I see, this could be a diabetic foot ulcer. It's not something to take lightly. We'll get the results back as soon as possible. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you avoid putting weight on it as much as possible.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A bone infection? Dat sounds…scary. I'll try to stay off it, Doctor. Really, I will. But I have to walk to get my mail, you know? And I like to sit on the porch and watch the birds… Is it going to be a long time before it gets better? Will I have to go to the hospital? I don't like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions about the hospital. We’ll address one thing at a time. The X-ray will give us more information. For now, minimizing weight-bearing is crucial. Do you have someone who can assist you with errands?
PATIENT: My daughter, Leilani, she comes by sometimes. Maybe two times a week. She can get the mail for me, yes. And she brings me food. She's a good girl. But she has her own family, you know? She's very busy. I don't want to bother her too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we’ll see what the tests reveal. I'm going to write you a prescription for some topical antibiotic ointment to apply to the wound twice daily. And I want you to keep it clean and dry. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to review the results and assess your progress. Do you have any questions for me before I finish?
PATIENT: Topical… ointment. Yes, okay. Twice a day. I can remember that, I think. Hmm… One question, Doctor. Will it hurt when you… when you put the ointment on? I don’t like pain. And… will I be able to walk again? Dat’s the most important thing, you know. To be able to walk and watch the birds.
DOCTOR: Applying the ointment shouldn't be painful, though the wound itself may be tender. We'll proceed carefully. As for walking, that will depend on the severity of the infection and how well it responds to treatment. I can't give you a definitive answer at this point. It's… unpredictable. I've documented everything. The nurse will go over the discharge instructions with you. Is there anything else right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think dat’s all. Thank you for looking at it. And… please be gentle. My old bones don’t bend so easily anymore.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will see you shortly. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again, Doctor. I hope it gets better soon.
