DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor...Paulino, was it? Honestly, it’s a bit of a blur why I’m here. Something about a letter? For a pet, I think. My niece, Ifunanya, she said I needed something official-like. She handles most of my…things, you see. I just…show up when she tells me to. It’s probably for the dog. Or maybe the cat. They’re both a handful, honestly.
DOCTOR: A letter, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a letter. She was very insistent. Something about proving I own them. Honestly, it sounds ridiculous. They’re my animals, aren’t they obvious? I feed them, I yell at them when they chew the furniture…what more proof does anyone need? It's probably for that apartment complex she found. A bit…fancy for my taste, but Ifunanya says it's a good opportunity. Young people and their rules.
DOCTOR: Right. And this “official” documentation is…required for housing purposes, as you understand it?
PATIENT: Housing…yes, that’s it. That’s what she said. Something about the landlord needing to know who’s responsible. Honestly, I’ve had pets my whole life. No one ever asked for a letter before! It’s all very…bureaucratic. I just hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a hair appointment later, and Agatha – that’s my stylist – does not appreciate being kept waiting.
DOCTOR: Very well. So, to be clear, you are seeking documentation to verify pet ownership for a new rental property. And these pets are…a dog and a cat, you mentioned?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! A dog and a cat. Though, to be fair, the cat owns me more than I own her. She’s quite the character, that one. A real diva. A Persian, you know. Very fluffy. The dog…oh, what is his breed? A…a terrier mix, I think? Ifunanya knows all these details. I just…provide the funds and the occasional scolding. It’s all very tiring, keeping track of these things.
DOCTOR: Terrier mix and a Persian. And you’d like a statement verifying your ownership of these animals for housing purposes. Do you have any medical records for either of them, or perhaps vaccination records?
PATIENT: Vaccination records? Oh, goodness. I…I honestly haven’t the faintest. Ifunanya usually handles all that too. She’s very good with that sort of thing. I think…I think she mentioned taking them to Dr. Anya’s place, down on Elm Street, but I don’t remember the specifics. I pay for it, of course, but I don’t really get involved in the details. Honestly, it all feels a bit unnecessary. They're perfectly healthy animals! You can see that, can't you?
DOCTOR: While their apparent good health is reassuring, for the purposes of documentation, especially for housing, a record of veterinary care is often required. Do you have their ages, or approximate dates of birth?
PATIENT: Oh, ages…that’s a good question. The cat, Cleopatra, she’s…older. I got her when Ifunanya was still in university, so…at least eight years? Maybe nine? The dog…oh, dear. I rescued him from that shelter, the one near the market, about…three years ago, I think? It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. I just know they're good company. And a lot of work. Honestly, I should write these things down. But then where would I put them? Everything gets lost, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Approximately eight to nine years for the cat, three years for the dog. And you have no documentation regarding their vaccinations or previous veterinary care. This will make providing an official statement…challenging. I can, however, perform a basic physical examination to assess their current health. This will at least provide some documentation of their condition today. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Well… I suppose that's better than nothing. Honestly, it all seems like a lot of fuss over a couple of animals. But if it gets Ifunanya off my back… yes, alright. Examine them, I guess. Though, be warned, Cleopatra doesn't appreciate strangers touching her fluff. She’s a bit…particular. And please be gentle. She scratches.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll need to ask a few questions regarding their diet and any current medications or observed health issues. And then we can proceed with the examination. Do either of them have any known allergies or sensitivities?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, goodness. I honestly haven't the faintest. I feed them whatever Ifunanya tells me to. She buys that expensive stuff, the kind with the…salmon? Or is it tuna? Something fishy, anyway. They seem to like it. The cat is a bit fussy, she'll only eat it if it's served on a ceramic dish, not plastic. And the dog…he’ll eat anything, really. A real vacuum cleaner, that one. Honestly, it’s all very exhausting, keeping track of their preferences. Are we nearly finished? My hair appointment…
DOCTOR: No known allergies, diet is commercially prepared, preference for ceramic dish for the cat. And you do not currently administer any medications to either animal?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Ifunanya would know if they needed anything like that. She’s very diligent, always reading articles online about pet health. No, nothing at all. Just the food. And a lot of complaining from Cleopatra, naturally. Honestly, I'm starting to think this whole letter thing was a waste of time. It's just a couple of animals! Are we sure you can’t just write a letter saying they’re mine? It’s obvious, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, while it may be obvious to you that you own these animals, for legal and housing purposes, documentation is required. Without any records of veterinary care, vaccinations, or even a confirmed date of birth, providing a definitive statement is…problematic. However, I can perform a basic physical exam and document their current health status. This is the best I can offer without further information. Would you like me to proceed with the exam?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake! Fine! Yes, examine them. Just…please be quick. And try not to upset Cleopatra. Honestly, it's just a couple of animals! A letter, a physical exam… it's all so much fuss. Get it over with. The sooner this is done, the sooner I can get to Agatha. She’s not a patient woman.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's begin with the dog, then. If you could tell me his approximate weight, that would be helpful. And if you happen to recall any past illnesses or injuries, please do share. Otherwise, we will proceed with a standard examination: listening to his heart and lungs, checking his temperature, palpating his abdomen, and examining his ears and eyes.
PATIENT: Oh, weight… goodness. He’s… medium-sized? Not a tiny little thing, but not enormous either. Perhaps… thirty pounds? Maybe thirty-five? It’s hard to say, honestly. As for past illnesses… I honestly can’t recall. He was a rescue, you see. They didn’t have much information about him at the shelter. I think he had a bit of a cough when I first brought him home, but that cleared up quickly. Ifunanya gave him some sort of…syrup, I believe. It was a long time ago. Honestly, I try not to dwell on unpleasant things. Just examine him, please. And be gentle. He's a bit of a scaredy-cat, ironically enough.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lift him onto the examination table, we can begin. I’ll need to listen to his heart and lungs, so try to keep him as still as possible.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. He's not exactly light, you know. Jasper! Here, boy! Come here! Here, come on, darling. It’s alright. Just a quick look, Ifunanya said. There, he’s on! Be gentle now, he doesn’t like being poked and prodded. Honestly, it’s all so undignified.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is slightly elevated, but rhythm is regular. Lung sounds are clear, no evidence of congestion or wheezing. Abdomen is soft and non-distended. No palpable masses or pain on palpation. Ears are clean, no evidence of infection or inflammation. Eyes are clear, pupils are equal and reactive to light. Overall, Jasper appears to be in relatively good health for his age. He is slightly overweight, and a weight management plan may be beneficial. His gums are a bit pale, which could indicate mild anemia, but further blood work would be needed to confirm this. Now, if you could bring Cleopatra up, we’ll examine her as well. I understand she may be… less cooperative.
PATIENT: Less cooperative is putting it mildly. Cleopatra! Darling, come here! Don’t be difficult! Honestly, she thinks she’s royalty. Oh, goodness, she’s not having any of it. There, there, darling. Just a quick look. Ifunanya said… oh, never mind. She'll probably scratch my face if I try too hard. Honestly, it’s not worth it. Perhaps…perhaps you could just look at her? From a safe distance? She's very particular about who touches her fluff.
DOCTOR: Very well. I can perform a limited visual assessment. From here, I can see that she is a well-groomed cat of substantial fluffiness. Her coat appears healthy and free of external parasites. Her eyes are clear, though she does appear… somewhat displeased with the current situation. Her respiratory rate is normal, and I detect no obvious signs of respiratory distress. Overall, Cleopatra appears to be in relatively good condition, despite her…attitude. However, without a more thorough examination, it is difficult to assess her overall health accurately. It is my professional opinion that both animals would benefit from a full veterinary examination, including blood work and fecal analysis, to rule out any underlying health issues. And vaccinations, of course.
PATIENT: Vaccinations! Blood work! Honestly, it's never-ending with these animals! Ifunanya is going to be thrilled. Fine. Yes, alright. I'll… I’ll take them to the vet. Ifunanya will be happy to hear that. Can we just be done now? My hair appointment… it’s probably long gone by now. Can I at least have a letter saying they’re mine? Even if it’s just based on this…limited examination? It's the least you can do.
DOCTOR: Very well. I can draft a statement verifying your ownership of Jasper, a terrier mix, and Cleopatra, a Persian cat, based on my limited physical assessment today. The statement will note their apparent good health, but will also strongly recommend a full veterinary examination, including blood work and fecal analysis, to establish a more comprehensive health profile. Here you are. Please review it carefully. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank goodness. Yes, that’ll do nicely. Thank you. No, that’s all. Honestly, it’s been quite an ordeal. I really must be going. Agatha is going to be furious. Thank you again, Doctor. Goodbye!
