DOCTOR: Hi Esthela, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s rather… complicated. I’m seeing someone, and I thought it prudent to get a check-up before things go any further. One must be careful, you understand. It’s not every man who appreciates a woman of… my standards, and I wouldn’t want any unfortunate surprises to derail a potentially good thing.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s very sensible of you, Esthela. So, to clarify, you're looking for a general health check-up, specifically with a new relationship in mind?
PATIENT: "General" is such a… pedestrian term, Doctor. Let’s just say I want to be certain I’m… robust. And that he is worthy. One doesn’t simply entrust one’s well-being to just anyone, you know. It’s about peace of mind, really. Do you do… comprehensive screenings? The kind that leave no stone unturned?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can do a very thorough assessment. It sounds like you're interested in a full physical exam with some additional screening tests. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history? Really, Doctor. Must we delve into such… unpleasantness so quickly? I assure you, I maintain a very… refined lifestyle. But very well. I’ve had the usual female… things, naturally. A hysterectomy some years ago – a necessary evil, really. And my blood pressure sometimes runs a bit high when I’m… agitated. My mother, God rest her soul, had diabetes, though I’ve always been meticulous about my sugar intake. I do hope you don't expect me to list every childhood ailment. It's terribly tedious.
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not. That’s a good start, Esthela. Hysterectomy, occasional high blood pressure, and a family history of diabetes. Thank you. And just to confirm, are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Occasionally. When things get… stressful. A small dose of lisinopril, if you must know. Though I prefer natural remedies when possible. Lavender oil and a good cup of chamomile are far more effective, in my opinion. But one can’t always rely on nature, sadly. It’s rather… unreliable.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, I'm a woman of discerning taste. I don't simply ingest anything and everything. I have a slight… sensitivity to shellfish, but that's hardly an allergy. More of a… disagreement with the ocean's offerings, really. And I find certain perfumes give me a headache, but that's hardly a medical concern, is it? Honestly, I haven’t had a proper reaction to anything in… decades. I’m quite… robust, as I mentioned.
DOCTOR: Shellfish sensitivity noted. Alright. And how about your social history, Esthela?
PATIENT: My… social history? Is this some sort of interrogation, Doctor? I assure you, my life is perfectly respectable. I’m married, have been for many years. A perfectly good man, though… lacking in certain… qualities. We attend social events, charity galas, the occasional theater performance. I enjoy reading, gardening, and maintaining a beautiful home. Is that not sufficient? I don’t gamble, smoke, or engage in… undesirable behaviors. It’s a quiet life, but a refined one.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Esthela. Just to clarify, you mentioned being married. Are you currently sexually active?
PATIENT: Doctor! Really. Is this absolutely necessary? I find that question… rather impertinent. Let’s just say my personal life is… complex. And frankly, I don't see how it relates to my overall health. I came here for a check-up, not a… confession. I will say this: discretion is paramount. Must you pry into every detail? It’s terribly vulgar.
DOCTOR: Esthela, I apologize if my question felt intrusive. It’s a standard part of a medical assessment, particularly when considering new relationships, as it can impact our recommendations for preventative screenings. It allows us to provide the most appropriate care. We don’t need to go into detail, but knowing if you are sexually active helps us determine if certain tests are needed to protect your health. Would you be comfortable telling me yes or no?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you must know, and I assure you, I’m doing this solely to avoid further… questioning. Yes. But do not expect any…graphic details. This is a doctor’s office, not a confessional booth. And I trust this information will remain strictly confidential? I have a… reputation to uphold.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. Your privacy is of utmost importance. Thank you for your honesty. Now, let’s move on to a brief physical exam. I'd like to check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I do hope you’ve washed your hands. And please be gentle. I have sensitive skin. I trust you have a comfortable examination table? One doesn’t expect to be subjected to… rough handling. And do refrain from any unnecessary… prodding. I assure you, I know my own body.
DOCTOR: Of course, Esthela. I’ve just sanitized everything, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. Please, have a seat. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s a little elevated, but not unexpected given you mentioned occasional high readings. Heart rate is 78, which is within the normal range. Lungs sound clear. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s likely benign, but we should do an EKG to get a better look. Now, I’d like to take a quick look in your ears, nose and throat.
PATIENT: A murmur, you say? Honestly. Everything seems to be falling apart these days. I do hope it’s nothing serious. I have a gala next month, and I simply must look my best. An EKG? How long will that take? And will it be… uncomfortable? I do have a low tolerance for medical… procedures. And please, be careful with the otoscope. I’ve always had delicate ear canals. Honestly, Doctor, all of this is terribly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: The EKG will only take a few minutes, Esthela. It’s a very simple test – just some stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. It’s not painful at all. Your ears, nose, and throat look normal. Now, let’s talk about weight. Your chart indicates you weigh 93 pounds. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Ninety-three pounds?! Doctor, are you quite certain? That's… preposterous! I haven't weighed that little since… well, a very long time ago. I’m a woman of substance, you understand. I maintain a very… refined figure. Perhaps your scale is faulty? Or you’ve misread the numbers? I assure you, I weigh considerably more. Perhaps closer to… one hundred and ten. A perfectly respectable weight for a woman of my… stature. Honestly, this is becoming quite upsetting.
DOCTOR: You're right to question it, Esthela. My apologies. There seems to be an error in the chart. It lists your weight as 93 kilograms, which is approximately 205 pounds. That's what I should have said. I apologize for the mistake and the upset it caused. Now, with that corrected, I’d like to ask about any family history of heart disease, diabetes, or cancer.
PATIENT: Ah. That makes much more sense. Two hundred and five pounds. Yes, perfectly respectable. I knew something was amiss. Honestly, Doctor, attention to detail is paramount. As for family history… my mother, as I mentioned before, had diabetes. And my paternal grandfather had some sort of… heart trouble. He was a very… robust man, always indulging in rich foods. My aunt, on my mother’s side, passed away from breast cancer, but she wasn’t one to take care of herself. A very… flamboyant lifestyle, you understand. And my sister had skin cancer, but that was easily treated. Honestly, they weren’t the most…health-conscious individuals. It’s a good thing I’m more diligent.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Esthela. That’s helpful. Given your family history and your current weight, we should run some blood tests to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. It will also be important to do an EKG, as we discussed, to evaluate the murmur. Would you be comfortable providing a urine sample?
PATIENT: A urine sample? Doctor, really. Must we delve into such… personal matters? I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary. But I do hope there’s a… private facility. And a comfortable one, at that. I simply cannot abide by unsanitary conditions. Honestly, the indignity of it all. Is there anything else I must endure? This is becoming quite… taxing. And do tell me, how long will I be here? I have a luncheon engagement this afternoon, and I simply must not be late.
DOCTOR: Of course, Esthela. We have a private restroom just down the hall. It's clean and comfortable. The urine sample will only take a few minutes, and then we can get the EKG done right here in the exam room. It should take about 15-20 minutes total. Once we have the results from the blood tests and the EKG, we can discuss a plan for managing your health. It may include some lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, and possibly medication if needed. But let's get those tests done first. Would you like me to show you to the restroom?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Lead the way. But do try to be swift. And please, ensure the restroom is… spotless. Honestly, I simply cannot tolerate any… unpleasant odors. It's bad enough having to undergo all of these… examinations. And do remind me, what exactly are we looking for in this… urine sample? It's simply dreadful to think about all of these… bodily fluids being analyzed. It's terribly vulgar.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Esthela. We're looking for signs of infection, kidney problems, and diabetes. It's a routine test, and it helps us get a complete picture of your overall health. I’ll be right here when you're finished. Just let me know if you need anything. Take your time.
PATIENT: "Honestly, the state of this soap…"
DOCTOR: .
