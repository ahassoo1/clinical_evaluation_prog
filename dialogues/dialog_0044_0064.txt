DOCTOR: “Good morning, Sherion. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It’s lovely to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is okay if I call you Doctor Asami? I have… a pain in my chest. It started a few days ago, maybe three? It’s… hard to say exactly. Not a sharp pain, more like… heavy. Like someone is sitting on my chest.
DOCTOR: “Doctor Asami is perfect, please do. And thank you for telling me. Chest pain is certainly something we need to take seriously. Three days ago, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, three days. Maybe a little longer. It comes and goes. Not all the time, thankfully. When I walk upstairs, it gets worse. And… when I get excited, like talking fast… it feels tighter. But when I rest… mostly okay. Does that make sense? I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: “That makes perfect sense, Sherion. You’re explaining it very well. It sounds like it’s related to activity, which is important information. Can you tell me a bit more about where exactly you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Right here. In the middle. Not on the side, not my back. Just… here. It's not a pain you can… point to exactly, but that's the general area. Sometimes it feels like it’s spreading to my arms, but mostly here.
DOCTOR: “Okay, center of the chest, and sometimes radiating to your arms. Thank you. Is the pain constant when it is present, or does it come and go in waves even during an episode?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, even when it’s happening. Like… a little bit better, a little bit worse. Not steady. It’s not always bad, even when I’m doing something. Sometimes I feel it for a minute or two, then it gets better. Then maybe later it comes back. It's very… unpredictable, I think is the word. Is that okay? I hope I am explaining this well enough.
DOCTOR: “You’re doing wonderfully, Sherion. Unpredictable is a good way to put it. And that's helpful information. Now, on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain at all and 10 being the worst pain you've ever felt, what would you rate the pain when it's at its worst?
PATIENT: Hmmm… that’s a hard one. I don’t like pain very much! At the worst… maybe a 6? Not like… a broken bone pain, but… uncomfortable. Like someone is squeezing my chest very, very tight. I could still walk and talk, but it’s… worrying. It makes me a little short of breath too, sometimes. Not always, but sometimes.
DOCTOR: “A 6, with a squeezing sensation and occasional shortness of breath. Thank you. And you mentioned it started a few days ago. Has anything specific happened recently that might have triggered it?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can think of. Nothing different. I have been a little stressed with my daughter, she’s having some trouble with her job, but that's… normal. It's not new stress. I did help my neighbor move some boxes last week… maybe that? They were heavy boxes. But I’ve moved heavy things before. I don’t know. It just… started. It feels… strange.
DOCTOR: “Okay, no specific trigger that you can pinpoint. Helping your neighbor move boxes is good to know, though. And stress can certainly play a role. Now, I'm going to ask you a few more general questions, just to get a broader picture. Have you ever had chest pain like this before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I’ve had… aches and pains, like everyone gets, but never this. Never a squeezing feeling. Never worried me before. This… this is different. I'm a little scared, to be honest. It's silly, maybe, but it makes me feel… weak.
DOCTOR: “It’s not silly at all, Sherion. It’s perfectly reasonable to be scared when you’re experiencing something new and concerning. We’re going to figure this out. Now, do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel a little dizzy. Not falling over dizzy, just… lightheaded. And I've been a little tired, more tired than usual. I thought it was just because of the heat. I haven’t been sleeping very well either. But I don't know if that's from the chest pain, or… something else. Does that make sense? I have so many little things going on!
DOCTOR: “That makes perfect sense. Lightheadedness, fatigue, and trouble sleeping – all good things to tell me. Okay, now I’m going to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of – like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well… my doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high. He gave me a pill, but I didn’t like how it made me feel, so I stopped taking it. He got a little upset with me, but I didn’t like the side effects. And… my mother had some problems with her heart when she was older. She had to have… something done, I don't remember what it was called. But she lived to be 85! So maybe it's not important. I have Medicare, so they know about most things, I think.
DOCTOR: “Okay, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure and a family history of heart problems. Thank you. It’s good you mentioned the family history, even if your mother lived a long life. And thank you for telling me about not liking the medication, that’s important to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything besides routine things?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder out many years ago. That was… a long time ago. And I broke my arm when I was a child, but that's it. Nothing else that I can remember. Just the gallbladder, and a broken arm when I was little. I haven't been in the hospital for anything serious. I try to stay healthy! I walk every day, when it's not too hot.
DOCTOR: “Okay, gallbladder removal and a childhood broken arm. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. I take a little bit of aspirin sometimes, for my knees, but it’s not every day. Just when they bother me. And I take a vitamin D pill in the winter, because the doctor said my levels were low. But that’s it. Nothing else. I don't like taking pills, if I can avoid it. They always make me feel funny.
DOCTOR: “Okay, occasional aspirin for your knees and vitamin D in the winter. And you don't like taking pills when you can avoid it. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. My daughter is very allergic to peanuts, but I am okay. I've never had a reaction to anything. I'm very lucky, I think. I can eat all the chocolate I want!
DOCTOR: “That’s wonderful. No known allergies. Okay, Sherion, thank you for sharing all of this information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your general condition. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. You seem very nice, and I want to know what’s going on. Just… try not to poke too much, okay?
DOCTOR: “Of course, I’ll be gentle. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm for me. Okay… 148 over 88. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily concerning, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear. I'm going to check your pulse now. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, let's just have you take a few deep breaths for me. Breathing seems normal. Okay, now, I'm going to listen to your heart again. Still hearing that murmur. It's a Grade 2/6 systolic murmur. We'll need to investigate this further. Are you experiencing any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: A murmur? What does that mean? Is that bad? And Grade 2… what is a Grade? I’m sorry, Doctor, I don’t understand these things. Swelling… no, not really. My feet sometimes get a little puffy at the end of the day, but I thought that was just from standing too long. Is the murmur related to the chest pain?
DOCTOR: “It’s perfectly okay to ask questions, Sherion. That’s what I’m here for. A heart murmur is simply an extra sound heard when listening to your heart with a stethoscope. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong, but it’s something we want to investigate to rule out any potential issues. The 'Grade' refers to how loud the murmur is – Grade 1 is very faint, and Grade 6 is very loud. A Grade 2 is considered mild. It could be something you’ve had your whole life and just never noticed, or it could be something new. As for whether it's related to the chest pain, it's hard to say at this point. They could be related, but we need more information to determine that. The fact that you're experiencing both warrants further investigation. Now, I'm going to order a few tests to help us get a clearer picture. I'd like to start with an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity, and a chest X-ray to look at your lungs and heart. I'm also going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, and a cardiac enzyme test to rule out any heart damage. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An EKG… and X-ray… and blood work? That sounds like a lot! Is it… is it serious? I mean, what could it be? My neighbor said her cousin had chest pain and it was just… stress. But I’m worried about the murmur now. Is there something wrong with my heart? I’m getting a little scared again. Can we just… try some medicine first? Something to calm me down?
DOCTOR: “It does sound like a lot, I understand. And it’s perfectly normal to feel scared when facing the unknown. We're not jumping to conclusions here, Sherion, these tests are simply to gather information. The tests will help us determine the cause of your chest pain and understand what’s going on with the murmur. The most common causes of chest pain are often not heart-related – things like muscle strain, acid reflux, or stress, as your neighbor mentioned. However, because you have a murmur, and because you’re experiencing symptoms, we want to rule out anything serious, just to be safe. While I understand your desire to try medicine to calm you down, it’s important to address the underlying cause of your symptoms first. Taking medication without knowing what's causing the chest pain could mask the symptoms and delay a proper diagnosis. It’s always best to have a clear understanding of what we’re dealing with before starting any treatment. We're going to take things one step at a time. First, we'll get these tests done. Then, we'll review the results together and discuss the best course of action. I will explain everything clearly, and we'll make a plan together. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… one step at a time. You’re right. I just… I don’t like being poked and prodded. And I really don’t want anything wrong with my heart. Okay, fine. Let’s do the tests. When can I do them? And will they be… painful? Will I have to lie flat for a long time? I get nervous when I have to lie down for a long time. And who will tell me the results? Will it be you, Doctor Asami?
DOCTOR: “That’s a very good attitude, Sherion. One step at a time is the way to go. And I completely understand your concerns. The EKG is completely painless – it involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. It takes just a few minutes, and there’s no discomfort at all. The chest X-ray is also painless, but you will need to stand or lie down briefly while the image is taken. You won’t have to lie flat for a long time, just long enough for the technician to get the picture. As for the blood work, there might be a slight pinch when the needle is inserted, but it’s usually quick and painless. I will personally review all the test results with you. I will explain everything clearly, answer all your questions, and we’ll make a plan together. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for you as soon as the results are available, usually within a few days. The lab usually processes the results quickly. I'll have the nurse schedule those tests for you right away. She'll give you all the instructions you need. She's very good at explaining things and will answer any questions you have. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… less scary. The nurse will help me? That’s good. Maybe I’ll feel better if someone else explains it. And you’ll tell me everything? You promise? Sometimes doctors don’t tell you everything. And… will I be able to drive myself home after the tests? I don't have anyone to drive me.
DOCTOR: “I absolutely promise, Sherion. I will personally review all the results with you and explain everything clearly, in language you understand. I believe in open communication and want you to be fully informed every step of the way. You deserve nothing less. And yes, you should be able to drive yourself home after the tests. The tests themselves are non-invasive and don't typically cause any side effects that would prevent you from driving. However, if you start to feel unwell at any point, please let the nurse or me know immediately, and we’ll make sure you get a safe ride home. I will also write a note for the nurse just to be safe. Let me call the nurse now and get things set up for you. She'll come in and explain everything in detail and answer any remaining questions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds good. Thank you, Doctor Asami. You’ve been very kind. I still feel a little nervous, but… less nervous than before. Thank you for listening to me. And… thank you for promising to explain everything. That means a lot. I guess… I guess I’ll just wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: “You’re very welcome, Sherion. It’s my pleasure. And you’ve been a very good patient – asking all the right questions and letting me know your concerns. That’s important. I’ll be right back with the nurse. Please just try to relax, and she’ll take excellent care of you. .
