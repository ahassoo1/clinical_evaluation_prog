DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my skin, you see. It’s gotten awfully yellow. My daughter… she insisted I come. Something about my liver, I believe. It’s all rather confusing, truthfully. I do apologize if I’m not very clear. My memory… isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Durig. We’ll take our time. Yellowing of the skin… that could be related to the liver, yes. It's called jaundice. And it’s good your daughter brought you in. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's going on. First, can you tell me when you first noticed the yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Jaundice, you say? When did I first notice… Hmm. It wasn’t sudden, not at all. Perhaps… a few weeks ago? It started subtly, I think. I mostly noticed it in my eyes, then it seemed to spread. Honestly, Doctor, it's hard to pinpoint. Everything feels a bit… blurred these days. I was hoping it would just go away on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks ago. And it started in your eyes, then spread. That’s helpful. Now, besides the yellowing, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes…? Let me think… I’ve been rather tired, yes. More tired than usual. And… my stomach. It’s been a bit upset, I suppose. Not painful, exactly, just… uneasy. And a loss of appetite, certainly. I haven’t been eating much lately. Everything just… doesn’t appeal to me. Oh, and I’ve been feeling a bit itchy all over, now that I think about it. Is that… relevant?
DOCTOR: Tiredness, upset stomach, loss of appetite, and itchiness. Yes, all relevant. Now, has the color of your urine changed at all?
PATIENT: Oh… my urine? I… I honestly don’t recall, Doctor. I try not to pay too much attention to such things, if you understand. Is it supposed to be a certain color? I apologize for being so vague. My daughter usually handles these… details.
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all, Ms. Durig. It's perfectly alright. We'll figure things out together. It's just that changes in urine color can sometimes be a clue. Okay. Let’s switch gears a little. Have you had any fever, chills, or nausea?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… No, I don’t believe so. No fever, no chills. A little nausea, perhaps, on occasion, but nothing severe. Mostly just that lack of appetite. It’s hard to say what’s causing what these days. Everything feels… mixed up. Oh, and I've been a bit… forgetful, if you haven't noticed. It's terribly frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, chills, or severe nausea. Just the tiredness, upset stomach, loss of appetite, itchiness, and forgetfulness. Now, have you been taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see… Just a little something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, a half of a sleeping pill. But that’s it, Doctor. Really. Nothing else. I don't like taking too many pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for blood pressure and occasionally a sleeping pill. Do you know the names of these medications, Ms. Durig?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. No, I’m afraid not. My daughter handles all of that. She puts them in these little containers for me, labeled with the days of the week. I just… take them as instructed. I’m terribly sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. I’m just… not very good with details. Perhaps you could ask my daughter? She has all the information.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Durig. We can certainly ask your daughter. It’s good you have someone to help manage things. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or liver disease?
PATIENT: Liver disease… Oh… yes. I… I think so. A long time ago. Many years ago. Something about… hepatitis. I had to take some… injections. It was quite unpleasant. But I thought it was cured. Or… treated, at least. It was so long ago, I barely remember. It was before my husband passed. Everything feels so hazy these days. I apologize. This is all rather difficult.
DOCTOR: Hepatitis, treated many years ago. Okay. Do you remember what type of hepatitis it was, Ms. Durig?
PATIENT: Oh… dear. No, I truly don’t. I remember the doctor’s visits, the needles… the worry. But the specifics… they’ve faded. It was a long time ago, and I wasn't one for asking many questions. My husband… he always handled those things. I wish I could be more helpful, Doctor. It’s all just… a blur. Perhaps my daughter would know? She keeps all my medical records.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Durig. We'll talk to your daughter. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as liver disease, cancer, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s a difficult question, Doctor. I come from a large family, and we weren’t very good at keeping track of such things. I know my mother… she had some kind of heart trouble, I believe. And my brother… he had cancer, many years ago. But beyond that… I honestly couldn’t tell you. We didn’t talk about these things much. It wasn't considered polite, I suppose. I apologize. It’s all very vague. I wish I could be of more assistance.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble in your mother and cancer in your brother. Now, have you ever had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a young girl, I believe. And… oh, yes. A hysterectomy, many years ago. That’s all I can recall, Doctor. I wasn't one for… medical procedures. I tried to avoid them whenever possible. Honestly, everything feels so distant now. It's hard to remember the details. I apologize for being so unhelpful. Perhaps my daughter would know more?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Durig. We'll ask your daughter. Now, finally, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. And I… very rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a small glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And absolutely no… recreational drugs. Never been interested in such things. I always believed in living a clean and healthy life. That's what my mother taught me.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, very rare alcohol use, and no recreational drugs. Now, Ms. Durig, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and looking at your skin. It shouldn’t take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment completely. I just… I do hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a bit of an appointment later this afternoon. But please, do what you need to do. I want to get to the bottom of this, whatever it is.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, please. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, but there's some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. Now, let's take a look at your skin. As expected, there’s noticeable jaundice, particularly in your eyes and skin. I also notice some mild scratching. Now, I’m going to feel your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes are within normal limits. Okay, Ms. Durig. That's all for the physical exam. Based on your history and the exam, it seems likely that your jaundice is related to a problem with your liver, possibly a recurrence of your previous hepatitis, or something new. To get a clearer picture, I'm going to order some blood tests. These will help us assess your liver function, check for any infection, and rule out other potential causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests… yes, whatever you think is best. I just… I do hope they don’t take too long to get the results. And I hope it’s nothing serious. My daughter… she worries so much. What kind of things will the tests be looking for, exactly? If you don’t mind me asking, of course. I just… I like to know what’s happening. Even if I forget it later.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Durig. I understand wanting to know. The tests will look at different enzymes and proteins in your blood that indicate how well your liver is functioning. We’ll also check your bilirubin levels, which are elevated in cases of jaundice. We'll also do a complete blood count to check for infection or anemia. There's also a test to check for viral hepatitis. It will take a few days to get the results back, but we'll contact you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, or confusion, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… perfectly clear. Enzymes, proteins, bilirubin… I may forget the exact names, but I understand the general idea. And I will, of course, contact you immediately if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience. I know I'm not the easiest patient. Is there anything else I need to do or know at this point? Perhaps a list of things to avoid? Or foods to stay away from? Just to be on the safe side?
DOCTOR: You're a very good patient, Ms. Durig. And you’re right to ask about precautions. For now, I recommend avoiding alcohol completely. Also, try to eat a light, healthy diet, and stay well-hydrated. Avoid fatty or fried foods, as those can be harder on your liver. And, as I said before, if you notice any worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact us. We'll call you as soon as the results are in, and we can discuss them and come up with a plan. Is there anything else I can answer for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s… everything. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you again for your time and your patience. I just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. I’ll wait for your call. And I’ll be sure to avoid alcohol. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Durig. We’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take care of yourself. Have a good day.
