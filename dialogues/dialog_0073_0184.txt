DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you. Look here, I ain't got all day. It's about... well, it's about how I look. My wife, God rest her soul, always said I was a handsome man. But things... things change, you know? I see myself in the glass these days and... it ain't pretty. I want to fix it. Simple as that.
DOCTOR: Right. “Not pretty.” I see. And when did you start noticing these changes, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... maybe five, six years now? After Martha... after she passed. Everything kinda went downhill then, if I'm honest. Didn't have the energy for much of anything, let alone looking good. And now... well, now I just want to get things back to some kind of order. It's the wrinkles, mostly. And... the saggy bits. You know.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you’ve noticed increased wrinkles and some laxity of the skin, particularly on your face and neck, developing over the past five to six years. Has anything specific triggered this concern now, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Triggered? What kinda question is that? I just woke up one morning and said enough is enough! I’m tired of looking like a dried-up prune. It's not a trigger, it's common sense! I want to look respectable again. People used to respect me. A man's appearance matters, you know. Especially a man who used to be... well, a man of standing.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, appearance can be important. I understand. And you said this has been gradually worsening over these past years?
PATIENT: Gradually? Yes, gradually! Like a slow leak in a tire, it just… got worse and worse. Didn't happen overnight, you know? I ain't expecting miracles, I just want... something done. I seen advertisements on the television, for things to tighten up the skin. They make it look so easy.
DOCTOR: Those advertisements... they rarely tell the whole story, Mr. Trendler. Before we discuss any procedures, let’s just get a clearer picture of your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Hmm... let me think. My knees ache something awful in the cold weather. Been that way for years, ever since I was working on the pile driver. And I got a bit of arthritis in my hands. Nothing major, just makes it hard to open jars sometimes. Oh, and my blood pressure gets a little high now and then, but the doctor gives me pills for that. Otherwise, I'm as strong as an ox for a man my age.
DOCTOR: Alright. Knees, arthritis, and managed hypertension. Are you currently taking any medications for these conditions, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. For the blood pressure. Little white pills. I think the doctor said... amlodipine? Something like that. And I take some ointment for the knees, when they're really botherin' me. Smells like wintergreen. Don’t much like the smell, but it helps a bit.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, and topical ointment for the knees. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah, not really. I eat everything. Always have. Never been one to be picky. Martha used to say I had a cast-iron stomach. Never mind. That was a long time ago. No allergies, doctor. Just a sensitive nose when the dust is flyin'.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And have you had any surgeries in the past, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Surgeries... let me see. Had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was… a long time ago. And I had a bit of work done on my shoulder after I got it pinned under a beam on the job site. That was nasty. Lots of stitches. But that was… forty years ago, easy. Nothing since then.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy, and shoulder repair. And finally, Mr. Trendler, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? What for? You think wrinkles run in the family? My mother had good skin, I'll have you know. And my father... well, he was a strong man, that's for sure. Let me see... my sister had high blood pressure, like me. And my uncle… he had some kinda heart trouble. But other than that… nothin' special. Mostly strong, hardworking people.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, family history of hypertension and some heart trouble. Now, let's take a look at you. If you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just a general assessment. Would you mind stepping onto the table?
PATIENT: Exam? You need to poke and prod at me? I told you what's wrong! I'm gettin' old and saggy! Look, I ain't got time for all this. I got things to do. If you can't fix me just by lookin' at me, then there's no point in wastin' my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, a proper assessment is necessary to determine the best course of action, and to ensure any procedure would be safe for you. It’s standard medical practice. I understand your frustration, but I assure you, it won't take long. Just a quick look. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs… and a quick examination of your skin. If you’re uncomfortable, we can certainly discuss other options. But I need to gather information first.
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick, doctor. I got a perfectly good afternoon planned. And don't go pokin' around too much. I'm a delicate flower, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back. First, let's check your blood pressure. 148 over 82. A little elevated, as expected. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Lungs are clear. Skin appears consistent with age, some loss of elasticity, as you described. Some mild laxity. No unusual masses or lesions. Alright. Everything appears generally healthy, within normal limits for your age. Now, I need to review your EHR to see your past lab results and imaging. One moment.
PATIENT: Hmph. Told you so. Ain't nothin' wrong with me. Just get on with it, doctor. This is a waste of a good afternoon. I got a garden to tend to, you know. Tomatoes don't pick themselves.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Your recent blood work from six months ago shows slightly elevated cholesterol, but otherwise within normal range. No significant findings on previous EKGs or chest X-rays. Based on my assessment and your EHR, there are a few cosmetic procedures we could consider. However, given your slightly elevated blood pressure and cholesterol, I would advise against any invasive procedures at this time. It could pose unnecessary risks. We could discuss non-invasive options, such as topical treatments or microcurrent therapy, but the results would be… modest. Alternatively, we could focus on managing your blood pressure and cholesterol, which could improve your overall health and potentially address some of the skin concerns indirectly.
PATIENT: Modest? I didn’t come here for modest! I want results! I want to look like me again, not some dried-up prune! And you're tellin' me I can’t have nothin' done 'cause my blood pressure is a little high? I take pills! That's what doctors are for, to fix things! I don't need a lecture about my health, I need a solution! What kinda doctor are you, anyway?
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, my responsibility is to ensure your safety first. Proceeding with a procedure when you have uncontrolled risk factors would be unethical and potentially harmful. I understand your frustration, but I will not compromise your health for cosmetic reasons. We could certainly revisit the possibility of procedures once your blood pressure and cholesterol are better managed. In the meantime, I can refer you to a cardiologist for a more thorough evaluation. And I can provide you with information on lifestyle modifications that could improve your overall health and potentially address some of your cosmetic concerns. Or, if you're dissatisfied with my recommendations, I'm happy to provide you with a list of other dermatologists in the area.
PATIENT: Look here, doctor. I came to you for help, not a lecture and a referral to another doctor. I've wasted enough of my afternoon already. I think I'll take your list of other dermatologists. And frankly, I'm not impressed. You're all talk and no action. Don't bother calling me. I'll find someone who understands what I want. .
