DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let's get straight to the point. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I got a letter saying my cholesterol is a bit high. That's what the letter said, anyway. Hyper… something? I don't really understand all those big words, but it said I should come talk to someone about it.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia. Yes, a rather common ailment these days. It simply means you have elevated cholesterol levels in your blood. We'll determine the extent of the elevation, of course. Now, do you have any family history of heart disease, stroke, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. My father… he had some heart trouble later in life, I believe. He needed a… a bypass, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I wasn't really involved in his care. My mother was pretty healthy, as far as I know. No strokes on either side, that I’m aware of. Does that help? It’s hard to remember specifics, you know.
DOCTOR: It's…adequate. A family history of cardiovascular disease is pertinent, naturally. And you say 'later in life'?
PATIENT: Yes, later. He was…oh, I’d say in his late seventies, maybe early eighties when he had the trouble. He lived to be ninety-two, so it wasn’t anything that cut his life short, thankfully. He just slowed down a lot after the surgery. He used to be very active, always gardening and walking. Then…not so much. It was a long time ago, though. I was busy raising my family.
DOCTOR: Ninety-two is…respectable. And you've not experienced any symptoms yourself?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not that I've noticed. I feel… fine. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who doesn't these days? I walk a good bit, I do. Helps keep me going, you know. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, nothing like that. I just wanted to get this cholesterol thing checked out since the letter worried me a bit. It's just…a number, right? Can it be fixed?
DOCTOR: "Just a number" is a rather simplistic view, Ms. Geho. Elevated cholesterol contributes to the development of atherosclerosis, leading to potentially serious complications. Now, let's get a more complete picture. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I didn't mean to sound dismissive. I just... I try not to worry too much. Let me see... No regular medications. Just a multivitamin sometimes, and I take fish oil every now and then, for my joints. My friend swears by it. And, oh, I use a cream for my hands, because they get so dry in the winter. Is that what you mean? Not anything for my heart, or anything serious.
DOCTOR: Multivitamins and fish oil… noted. And the hand cream is irrelevant. Do you smoke, Ms. Geho?
PATIENT: No, never have. My mother always said it was a dreadful habit, and I listened to her. Always been a bit of a rule-follower, I suppose. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, though. Is that…bad? I’m starting to feel like everything is bad.
DOCTOR: Moderate alcohol consumption is…debatable. Now, let's proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. And please, try to relax. We need to be thorough.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’ll try my best to relax. It’s just… tables aren’t always made for tall people, you know. Hopefully, that won’t affect the reading.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs appreciated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 72. Your vitals are… acceptable. Now, I'd like to order a complete lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels. We'll also check your blood glucose and kidney function, as a standard precaution.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible. A blood test. I don't mind those. Do I need to fast beforehand? I had breakfast this morning, so I probably should have waited. And where do I go for that? Is it here at the clinic? I don't drive much anymore, so I was hoping to keep it simple.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for at least nine hours prior to the blood draw. It impacts the accuracy of the lipid panel. As for the location... The lab is just down the hall, room 203. They take walk-ins, but I recommend calling ahead to minimize wait times. The number is on the brochure on the counter. We'll review the results in approximately one week. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh, nine hours! That does complicate things. Okay, I'll try to manage that. I'll call the lab right away and see if I can get an appointment. No, I think that's all for now, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything. And thank you for not being… too cross about the breakfast. I guess I'll see you next week, then.
DOCTOR: Very well. I expect you to adhere to the fasting instructions. We'll discuss the results and formulate a plan accordingly. Good day, Ms. Geho.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I will. I promise. Thank you again. Have a good day, too. .
