DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's nice to meet you. I see you’re here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well… it’s about the cancer. I was told to come see you.
DOCTOR: I understand. That must be a lot to process. To help me understand what’s going on, and how I can best assist you, could you tell me a little more about what you were told?
PATIENT: Um… okay. My husband… he passed away a few months ago. He had… a bad sickness. And the doctors said it was cancer. Then, a little while after… they told me I might have it too. They did some tests, and… well, I’m waiting on more results, but that’s what they think. It’s… scary.
DOCTOR: I can only imagine how frightening that must be, Chellsea. Losing your husband and then receiving this news… that’s a tremendous amount to cope with. I want to assure you that we’ll take things one step at a time. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me what kind of tests were done?
PATIENT: They did… a blood test, I think. And… a scan. A big machine. It was… loud. And they took some pictures. I don't really remember all the details, to be honest. It all happened so fast after… everything.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It is a lot to take in, and it's common to not remember all the specifics. A blood test and a scan… that sounds like they were looking for signs of cancer in your body. Do you know where they were looking specifically?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. The doctor… he said something about my chest? And maybe my bones? I think he said the scan was to see if it had… spread? I’m sorry, I’m not very good with remembering things like that. It all just sounded very… serious.
DOCTOR: You don't need to apologize at all, Chellsea. It is serious, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Chest and bones… that gives us a starting point. Let’s try to gather a little more information. Have you been experiencing any symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms… well, I’ve been very tired. More tired than usual, I guess. And… I’ve had a cough. It’s not a bad cough, really. Just… persistent. And sometimes my chest hurts a little. Not all the time, though. Just when I… move a certain way.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tiredness, a persistent cough, and some chest pain that's worse with movement. That’s helpful information. Now, have you had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been losing weight, I think. My clothes feel a little looser. But I haven't been eating much, since… well, everything. I haven’t really been hungry. Is that… a symptom?
DOCTOR: It can be, Chellsea. Unintentional weight loss is something we definitely want to explore. And it makes sense that your appetite would be affected given everything you’ve been through. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I’ve always been pretty healthy. I mean, besides… my husband. He had… a lot of problems. I don’t think I have had anything serious. Just… colds, sometimes. Nothing that needed a doctor. I’ve never really been to a doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No significant medical history of your own. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’ve never needed any surgeries. Just… a few stitches when I was a little girl. I fell out of a tree. But that was a long time ago. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, a few stitches as a child doesn’t count as a surgery. Good to know. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: Um… my mom… she had… problems with her heart. A long time ago. She passed away when I was young. My dad… he was healthy. Very healthy. And my husband… his family had… a lot of problems, too. But I don’t really know what. We didn’t talk about it much. Is that helpful? I feel like I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: You’re doing just fine, Chellsea. It’s not always easy to recall family history. Knowing your mom had heart problems is helpful. And it’s alright if you don’t know specifics about your husband’s family history. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I’ve never really taken much medicine. A little bit for headaches sometimes, but nothing regular. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything before.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you’re not currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just… vitamins sometimes. But that’s it. I try to eat healthy, but sometimes I forget. My appetite… it’s been bad lately. Especially since… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional vitamins. Now, before we move onto a physical exam, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…? Um… I used to… I used to go for walks a lot. With my husband. But… not anymore. Since he passed away, I haven't really… done much. I mostly stay at home. I don't really see many people. It's… lonely. Is that what you mean? I don't smoke, and I don't drink much. Just… a glass of wine sometimes. To help me sleep.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Chellsea. I understand. It’s natural to withdraw after a loss. It's good to know you don’t smoke and only drink occasionally. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and just do a general assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best. I trust you, Doctor. I just… I just want to know what’s going on. It’s been very scary.
DOCTOR: Of course, Chellsea. That’s exactly what we’re here for. And we’ll go at your pace. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, please let me know. If you could please sit up on the examination table for me, that would be great. I’ll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. And again… I'm hearing some diminished breath sounds on the lower left side. It’s subtle, but worth noting. I'll also listen to the upper lobes… okay, those sound clear. I'm also hearing some mild crackles at the base of your left lung. Can you tell me if you've been experiencing any pain when you take a deep breath?
PATIENT: Um… yes. Sometimes. It’s not a sharp pain. It’s more like… a dull ache. Especially when I breathe in deeply. It's mostly on this side. It’s not constant, though. Just… sometimes. It feels… tight, too. Like something is squeezing my chest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache with deep breaths and a feeling of tightness. I’m palpating your chest now to check for any tenderness or masses. It feels slightly tender when I press here… …and here. Nothing that’s alarming, but worth noting. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart sounds. Your heart rate is regular, but a little fast. No murmurs or extra sounds that I’m detecting at this time. Now I'm going to check your abdomen to ensure there are no abnormalities.
PATIENT: Okay. It’s… kind of scary, all this poking and listening. I just want to know what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand, Chellsea. It’s perfectly natural to feel anxious during an exam. I’m just trying to gather as much information as possible. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly that I’m detecting. Now, I'm going to check your lymph nodes. No palpable lymphadenopathy that I'm detecting. Finally, I'm going to check your reflexes and neurological function. Reflexes are normal, and neurological function appears intact. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and my examination, you’ve reported tiredness, weight loss, a persistent cough, chest pain with deep breaths, and a feeling of tightness in your chest. I heard diminished breath sounds and mild crackles in your left lung, and I felt some tenderness in your chest during palpation. Given your history and these findings, we need to investigate further to determine the cause of your symptoms.
PATIENT: Okay… investigate further? What does that mean? Will I have to… have more tests? I’m scared, Doctor. It feels like… everything is happening so fast. Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your fear, Chellsea. It's natural to feel overwhelmed. “Investigate further” means we need to run some additional tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on in your body. Yes, it will likely involve more tests. We'll start with a chest X-ray to get a better view of your lungs. We'll also need to do a complete blood count, and likely some other blood work to look for any signs of infection or other abnormalities. We may also consider a CT scan of your chest if the X-ray findings are inconclusive. As for whether it will hurt… the blood tests involve a small needle prick, which can be a little uncomfortable, but it’s usually quick and painless. The chest X-ray and CT scan are non-invasive and shouldn’t cause any pain. I want to assure you that we’ll explain every step of the process and make sure you’re comfortable. The goal is to identify the cause of your symptoms so we can develop the best treatment plan for you. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Chest X-ray… blood tests… CT scan… It sounds… scary. But… I guess it’s better to know, right? Will the tests tell me… if I have cancer? That's what I'm really afraid of. I lost my husband to it, and… I don’t know if I can go through that again.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be afraid, Chellsea. And yes, the tests can help us determine if cancer is a possibility. However, it’s important to remember that these tests are just one piece of the puzzle. Many other conditions can cause similar symptoms, and we won’t jump to any conclusions until we have all the results. I want to assure you that we’ll be with you every step of the way. If the tests do indicate cancer, we'll discuss all your options and develop a treatment plan that’s right for you. We have a wonderful oncology team here, and we’ll make sure you receive the best possible care. Right now, let's focus on getting the tests done. I’ll write the orders for the chest X-ray and blood work. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll be able to draw your blood right away. Then, we’ll schedule a CT scan for a later date. Do you have any questions about the tests or the scheduling process?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… when will I get the results? I hate waiting. It feels like… I’m just hanging here, not knowing. What if it's bad? I don't know what I'll do.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety about waiting, Chellsea. It’s the hardest part. The blood test results usually come back within 24-48 hours. The chest X-ray results should be available within a few hours. The CT scan results will take a little longer, usually 2-3 business days, as they need to be interpreted by a radiologist. I'll have the lab and radiology departments send the results directly to my office. As soon as I have them, I'll call you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. We won't leave you hanging. And remember, we'll face whatever comes together. We’ll explore all your options, and we'll make a plan. You’re not alone in this. Do you have anyone you'd like me to notify after this appointment?
PATIENT: No. No one. My husband… he was the only one. I don’t have any family nearby. It’s just… me.
DOCTOR: I’m so sorry, Chellsea. You’re going through so much. It takes incredible strength to face things on your own. Please know that while I can't replace the support of family, I and my team are here for you. We’ll make sure you have all the information and support you need, every step of the way. Let’s get those tests ordered, and then we’ll focus on taking things one step at a time. I'll write you a referral for the chest X-ray and bloodwork, and the front desk staff will assist you with scheduling. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. I think… I think I’m okay. Just… let’s get it over with. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. That’s my job, and I’m glad I can be here for you. Here are the referrals. The front desk will help you schedule the appointments. Once you’ve scheduled them, please let them know you’re already seen me. I’ll be here for you, Chellsea. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And please, try to take care of yourself. Remember, you’re not alone.
PATIENT: .
