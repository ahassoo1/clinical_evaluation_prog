DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. It's about this… discoloration. It's rather unsightly, really. It started a few weeks ago, I suppose. On my arms, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. A few weeks ago, discoloration on your arms. Can you describe the discoloration for me?
PATIENT: Well, it's not… a rash, exactly. It's not bumpy or itchy. It's… patches. Sort of brownish. Like someone took a very weak tea bag and rubbed it on my skin. And it’s definitely more noticeable if I’ve been… out. You know, in the sun. Though I always wear sunscreen, or I try to. It's just… not very attractive.
DOCTOR: Okay, brownish patches that appear more noticeable after sun exposure, even with sunscreen use. And you said it doesn’t itch or feel bumpy. Hmm. Have you noticed it anywhere else besides your arms?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes. A little bit on my chest. Not as much, thankfully. It’s rather… discreet there. Though, honestly, I don’t spend a lot of time examining my chest. I just noticed it when I was… getting ready this morning. It’s always something, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Right, so chest as well, less prominent than on your arms. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean? Like… my life? No, not really. Same routine, same husband, same everything. We did go on a little trip to the countryside last month, but that was just for a weekend. And I always wear sunscreen. Honestly, I don't know what could be causing it. I take very good care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay. No recent changes to routine or medications, and you consistently use sunscreen. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Nothing major. I had chickenpox as a child, of course. And I had a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back. But beyond that… no. I’m generally very healthy. My husband says I worry too much about germs, actually. He thinks this is probably just… nothing. But I’d rather be safe, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s always best to check things out. And no surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, none of either. Never needed them, thankfully. I've always been… careful. I eat a balanced diet, I exercise regularly… I really do take care of myself. It's just… concerning. It’s not like I want to be covered in brown spots. It feels… unseemly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant medical history, no surgeries or hospitalizations. What about your family?
PATIENT: Oh. Family. My mother had… well, she had a lot of little things. Nothing serious. High blood pressure, a bit of arthritis. My father was perfectly healthy, until the very end. A heart attack, suddenly. But neither of them had anything like this. No skin problems, at least not that I remember. My sister’s always been rather… robust. She doesn’t worry about things like discoloration.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. And sometimes I take something for… indigestion. It's a little herbal thing my husband gets me from a specialty shop. It's supposed to be very good for your gut, or something. But that’s it. Really. I don’t like taking pills. It makes me feel… unwell. And I certainly don't go around self-treating things. That sounds dreadful.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just a multivitamin and an herbal supplement for indigestion. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Not a single one. I've always been quite lucky in that regard. My husband is the one with the sensitivities. Pollen, dust mites… the whole thing. He's a bit of a hypochondriac, to be honest. But me? Perfectly fine. I can eat anything, take anything… well, almost anything. Except maybe shellfish. I don’t particularly like shellfish. But that’s not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, that's a preference, not an allergy. Okay, so no known allergies. Now, let's take a look at the areas of discoloration. Could you please lift your sleeves and perhaps adjust your blouse a bit so I can examine your arms and chest?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. It's not that bad, you know. But I suppose you need to see it properly. Honestly, the lighting in here is dreadful. It makes everything look worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just taking a look here… The patches are fairly flat, not raised or bumpy. The skin feels normal in terms of temperature and texture. They do seem more noticeable in areas that would be exposed to the sun. Do you notice any itching, burning, or pain with these areas?
PATIENT: No, absolutely nothing. That's the strange thing. It's just… there. A discoloration. It doesn’t bother me, except aesthetically, of course. It's not itchy, it's not painful, it doesn't feel different. It's just… unsightly. Like a bad stain. Honestly, I'm starting to feel rather foolish for even coming in about this. Perhaps it is nothing.
DOCTOR: It’s good that it's not causing any discomfort. Based on what you’ve told me and the examination, it could be a few things. One possibility is post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation—meaning discoloration that occurs after some minor skin irritation. Sometimes even mild sun exposure can cause this. Another possibility is a type of sun spot, though they often present a bit differently. To be on the safe side, I'd like to order a skin biopsy just to rule out anything more serious. It's a very quick procedure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A… biopsy? Oh, goodness. That sounds… invasive. And isn't that… for serious things? I mean, it’s just a little discoloration. Are you sure that’s necessary? I was hoping for something… simpler. Perhaps a cream? Or some kind of lotion? I really don't like the sound of a biopsy.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. A biopsy is the most definitive way to determine the cause of the discoloration and rule out anything concerning. It's a very minor procedure—we'll just take a tiny sample of skin for testing. It’s a very small incision and usually doesn’t require stitches. However, I also don’t want to dismiss your concerns. We can try a topical lightening cream first. It may help fade the discoloration over time, but it won't give us a definitive diagnosis. If the cream doesn't work, or if the discoloration gets worse, we would still need to consider a biopsy. What do you think?
PATIENT: Hmm. A cream… that sounds… acceptable. Much more acceptable than a biopsy, certainly. But what kind of cream are we talking about? Something strong? I don’t want to end up with… peeling skin. Or something that smells awful. And how long would I have to use it for? I have a very busy social calendar, you know. I suppose I could try a cream… for a little while. But if it doesn't work quickly, I'm not wasting any more time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ll prescribe a hydroquinone cream, which is a common lightening agent. It's generally well-tolerated, but it's important to use it as directed and avoid sun exposure while using it—even more important than usual. We'll start with a low concentration, 2%, and see how your skin responds. It may take several weeks, even months, to see noticeable results. And yes, it's important to protect your skin from the sun during treatment. I'll also give you a prescription for a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 50 or higher. We’ll want to reassess in about eight weeks to see if it’s having any effect. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Eight weeks… alright. As long as it’s not a lifetime commitment. And 50 SPF… goodness. That sounds rather sticky. But I suppose I can manage. And it's important to apply it even on cloudy days, I presume? This is all rather… inconvenient. But alright. I'll try the cream. And the sticky sunscreen. Just… please, no biopsies. Now, how do I go about getting these prescriptions?
DOCTOR: Excellent. No biopsies unless absolutely necessary. I’ll send the prescriptions electronically to your usual pharmacy. Do you know which one that is?
PATIENT: Yes, it's Miller's Pharmacy. On Elm Street. They've been… reliable, for the most part. Though the young man behind the counter is a bit slow. But he's polite enough. Will they need anything special from you? A code, or something? I’ve had issues in the past.
DOCTOR: They should have everything they need on file, but I’ll make a note in the prescription just to be sure. No code necessary. They'll likely ask you about any other medications you’re taking, and allergies, just to confirm. And I’m going to print out a sheet with instructions on how to use the cream and the importance of sun protection. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I believe that's all. Although… Is it possible to get a letter, just to confirm everything we discussed? I’m rather… meticulous. I like to keep everything documented. For my records, you understand. And… just in case.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I can absolutely provide a summary letter detailing our discussion, the prescribed medications, and the instructions for use. It might take a few minutes for the nurse to prepare it, would you like to wait, or have it faxed or emailed to you?
PATIENT: Oh. That's… thoughtful. Email would be best, I think. To gabrielle.bartock@email.com. Yes, that's correct. And thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. Even the sticky sunscreen part. Now, if you'll excuse me...
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll have the nurse email that summary to gabrielle.bartock@email.com right away. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Bartock. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Yes, well. Thank you. Sticky sunscreen… honestly. .
