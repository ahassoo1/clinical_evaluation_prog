DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome. I'm Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Bombara, is it? Yes, yes… well, it’s just… the paperwork said something about lab work. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. I think… I think someone told me I needed some tests done. Just want to get it over with, if that’s alright. Is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. It is about some lab work. It seems there was a recommendation for some tests. Honestly, the details are a little… fuzzy for me, to be frank. It’s been a busy few weeks. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me anything you remember about why you might have been asked to get these tests?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Fuzzy is a good word for it. I… honestly, I don’t recall who even suggested it. Maybe it was… the fellow at the pharmacy? Or perhaps my neighbor, old Mr. Habibi, he’s always talking about his doctor visits… It was something about… checking things. You know, just making sure everything’s… functioning. I really wish I could be more help. It's all a bit of a blur, I’m afraid. Is there a list somewhere of what needs to be done?
DOCTOR: It's quite alright, Mr. Croonquist. Don't worry about it at all. It happens. Let me see… Ah, here we are. It appears your primary care physician, Dr. Ahmadi, ordered a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. Do those terms mean anything to you?
PATIENT: Dr. Ahmadi… that name does sound familiar. But… those other things? Complete… blood count? Metabolic… panel? No, no, they don’t. Not at all. They sound… complicated. Are those things… serious? I just want to be sure… are we talking about something I should be worried about? I'd really prefer to just get the tests done and be on my way, if possible. This thinking is making my head spin.
DOCTOR: They sound complicated, yes, but they’re quite routine, Mr. Croonquist. A complete blood count checks the different types of cells in your blood – red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets – and can help us look for things like anemia or infection. The basic metabolic panel looks at things like your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. And the lipid panel checks your cholesterol levels. They're all fairly standard tests used to get a general picture of your health. It doesn't necessarily mean something is wrong. We just want to have a baseline, or see how things are functioning. Before we proceed, would you mind if I quickly ask a few questions about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, I see… a baseline, you say? That sounds… less frightening. Alright, a baseline is good. Less frightening. Yes. Medical history… hmm. Well, I’ve… I’ve always been a fairly healthy man, all things considered. I used to work at the power plant, you know. Lots of walking, surprisingly. I don't recall any serious illnesses. Maybe a bad cold here and there. Nothing major. I haven't been to a doctor in… a while. Probably longer than I should admit. Does that help? Are these questions important? I'm just trying to be cooperative.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. And it's alright that you haven't been to a doctor in a while; many people find themselves in that situation. Knowing you used to work at the power plant is good to know as well. Just to be thorough, have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized…? Let me think… No, no, I don't believe so. Not ever, as far as I can recall. I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree, but that was… well, that was a long time ago. Just a simple break, a cast for a few weeks. Nothing serious. Never been in a hospital as an adult, though. Definitely not. No surgeries either. No, no hospital visits, to the best of my knowledge. I'm fairly certain. Unless… unless something happened a long, long time ago that I've forgotten. But I doubt it.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. And it's perfectly normal to not remember everything, Mr. Croonquist. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. That's a tricky one. My family… well, we weren't really ones for talking about health issues. Lots of farmers, mostly. My father… he was a strong man, worked the land his whole life. I think he had… some problems with his heart, towards the end. But it wasn't something we discussed openly. My mother… she lived a long life, but I don't recall anything specific. No one talked about diabetes or… or cancer, if that’s what you're getting at. Just… old age, mostly. Honestly, I couldn't tell you if there's a family history of anything. It's a bit of a blank, I'm afraid. Does that answer your question? I'm doing my best here.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Croonquist. It's very common for families not to discuss these things. We can work with what we have. Just a few more quick questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. No, not that I’m aware of. I've never really had any reactions to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I’ve never had a problem with pollen or… or bees. No hives, no swelling, nothing like that. I'm fairly certain I'm not allergic to anything. Though… I did eat a bad oyster once, many years ago, but that wasn't an allergy, it was just a bad oyster! Does that count? No, I can confidently say I have no allergies. At least, none that I know of. Is that good?
DOCTOR: That’s very good, Mr. Croonquist. And a bad oyster doesn't count! Finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I try to avoid taking pills if I can help it. Never really been one for medication. I might take an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. No regular prescriptions, no vitamins, no supplements… nothing. I believe in eating a healthy diet and getting plenty of rest. That’s my approach. So, no, I'm not currently taking any medications. Is that all the questions? I’m starting to feel a little… tired, honestly. Just want to get these tests done and be on my way, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Croonquist. That's very helpful, thank you for your patience. It sounds like you're generally a very healthy man, despite the fuzzy memory. So, to recap, we’re doing a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a lipid panel, just as a baseline to get a better understanding of your overall health. I'll order these tests for you now. The lab is just down the hall, third door on the left. They’ll take a small blood sample. It shouldn’t take too long. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Just… just get it done, please. The sooner the better. I appreciate you being patient with my… forgetfulness. Just tell me when I can expect the results. And… where do I go to get them? Down the hall, you said? Third door? Alright. Yes, just get it done. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Croonquist. The lab technician will let me know when the results are available. I'll have my nurse contact you with the results, usually within a few days. She’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. And please, don’t worry about your memory. It’s perfectly normal, and we'll take things at your pace. Down the hall, third door on the left. Just let them know Dr. Bombara sent you. Have a good day, Mr. Croonquist. And don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns.
