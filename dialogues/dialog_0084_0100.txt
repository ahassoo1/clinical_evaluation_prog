DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I'm Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it’s about a test, I think? Something… someone said I needed to get done. It's a bit fuzzy, honestly. Medicare sent me, I believe. Something about checking what’s in my system. It’s all a bit of a blur, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: No, not at all. Medicare often recommends preventative screenings, and it sounds like you're due for a colon cancer screening. They likely sent you for a fecal immunochemical test, or FIT, to check for blood in your stool. Is that what you were told, or does that ring a bell?
PATIENT: Colon… cancer? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. I don’t really remember anyone saying colon cancer. I mostly just got a letter with a bunch of forms and a place to come. And… blood? No, nobody mentioned blood either. I’m really not good with remembering things, you see. Is that test… painful? I don’t do well with… procedures.
DOCTOR: It can be a bit scary when it’s unexpected, Ms. Hughston, and it's perfectly normal to feel anxious. Colon cancer screening is important, and often catches things early when they are most treatable. The FIT test itself is not painful at all. It just involves collecting a small stool sample – like a tiny bit, you don't have to fill a container. You take it home, and then send it to the lab. The reason they check for blood is because sometimes, even small amounts of blood in your stool can be a sign of polyps, which can sometimes develop into cancer. But most of the time, it's not cancer. Do you have the paperwork Medicare sent with you today?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… alright, a little sample. That's good. Much better than… other things. Let me see… paperwork… Medicare… forms… Oh, here we go. Yes, I think this is it. It’s a bit crumpled, sorry. It has a lot of boxes. And… medical words. I didn’t really understand any of it.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Yes, this confirms you’re scheduled for the FIT test. It looks like it also asks about your family history, any past medical problems, and medications you're taking. Do you mind if I ask you a few questions about those things?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… hmm. Let me think. My mother… she had some trouble with her heart, I think. And an uncle… he had something, but I don't remember what. It was a long time ago. As for medical problems, just the usual aches and pains for someone my age. And… well, I take something for my blood pressure. A little white pill. I don't recall the name, though. I have a terrible memory, you see. I rely on my daughter to keep track of all that.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Hughston. We can figure things out. It’s helpful to know about the heart trouble and the uncle’s issue, even if we don't have specifics. And knowing you take something for blood pressure is good. Do you know approximately how long you've been on the medication?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tough one. Let me see… I think… maybe five years? Or was it longer? It’s around the time my husband passed away, I think. Everything feels… blurry around then. I started feeling a little weak, and the doctor put me on something. It’s a small, white pill, like I said. I take it every morning. Honestly, I really rely on my daughter to fill my pill organizer. She's very good at keeping me on track. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Hughston. And it’s perfectly common for memory to be affected by difficult life events. We can always contact your daughter to confirm the medication if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful! Yes, please do. Her name is Simone. She’s very organized, that girl. And she knows all my medications and… everything. It would take a load off my mind, honestly. I just… I get so flustered trying to remember details. I appreciate you being so patient with me.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll reach out to Simone to confirm the medication name and dosage. Now, aside from the blood pressure medication, are you taking anything else, even over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Vitamins… sometimes I take a multivitamin, but I’m not very consistent with it. Simone usually reminds me. And… over-the-counter… occasionally, I take something for my arthritis, when it’s really bad. Something for the pain. Ibuprofen, I think? Or maybe naproxen? I get them both, and I forget which one is which. Honestly, I just grab whatever’s in the cupboard. I’m terrible at this, aren't I?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Hughston. Many people find it difficult to keep track of their medications. Knowing you occasionally take ibuprofen or naproxen for arthritis is helpful. Okay, let’s talk briefly about your medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think… oh! Yes, when I broke my wrist a few years ago. I was gardening and tripped over a hose. It was a clean break, thankfully. And… I think I was in the hospital once when I was younger, with a bad case of pneumonia. But that was a long time ago. Before my husband… before everything. It’s all a bit fuzzy. I remember being very sick, but not much else.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken wrist and pneumonia. And how about any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh! Yes, I had my gallbladder removed, years ago. It was causing me a lot of trouble, awful pain. And… I think I had something done on my knee, a small operation, when I was younger, to fix a torn cartilage. But that was a long time ago, before my husband passed. It doesn’t bother me anymore. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. I try not to think about it too much. It's all so long ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and knee surgery. Now, just a couple more questions. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I used to get hives when I was a child, but I haven’t had those in years. Simone always checks when she fills my prescriptions, just in case. I don’t think I’ve ever had a serious allergic reaction to anything. Just the usual seasonal sniffles, that’s all. I’m pretty lucky, actually. I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hughston. That’s very helpful. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you need. A quick exam sounds fine. I don't mind at all. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. Honestly, I'm just glad we're getting this sorted out. It's been weighing on my mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Good. And again… Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Blood pressure is 138/82. Everything sounds and feels normal at this time. I’m going to review your chart and will discuss the FIT test and next steps. Just one moment.
PATIENT: That sounds good, Doctor. Thank you. Take your time, I'm not in a hurry. Just let me know if you need anything from me. Honestly, I'm just grateful you're being so thorough. It puts my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Hughston. As we discussed, you’re scheduled for the FIT test. It’s a very simple procedure – you’ll receive a kit with instructions on how to collect a small stool sample at home. You’ll then mail the sample back to the lab, and they’ll test it for any hidden blood. Based on your medical history, you are at average risk for colon cancer. If the FIT test is negative, you’ll simply repeat it in one year. If it's positive, we will need to schedule a colonoscopy to investigate further. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… What exactly is a colonoscopy? I've heard the name, but I don't really know what it involves. Is it… painful? And what if they find something? Honestly, I'm a little nervous just thinking about it. I wish my daughter was here, she's much better at understanding these things. I’m just worried, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel nervous, Ms. Hughston, especially when you’re unsure about something. A colonoscopy is a procedure where we use a long, thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end to look inside your colon. It allows us to detect any polyps or abnormalities. You would receive a sedative to make you comfortable and relaxed during the procedure – most people don’t feel anything at all. It's typically an outpatient procedure, so you’d go home the same day. If we do find polyps, we can usually remove them during the colonoscopy, and then send them to the lab for testing. Most polyps are not cancerous, but it’s important to remove them to prevent any potential problems down the road. We would discuss all the details and risks beforehand, and you’d have plenty of time to ask questions. Would you like me to explain the prep process for the colonoscopy in detail, even though we're hoping it won't be necessary?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… a little scary, honestly. A camera… inside… And the prep… I've heard things about the prep. Is it… unpleasant? Simone mentioned something about having to… clear everything out. I'm not sure I could handle that. Honestly, I wish I hadn't come. It’s just all so overwhelming. Perhaps I should just forget about it. It sounds much better to just pretend nothing is wrong.
DOCTOR: It's understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed, Ms. Hughston. It is a lot to take in, and the prep is often the most daunting part. It's not the most pleasant experience, I won’t lie, but it's necessary to ensure a clear view during the colonoscopy. There are different prep options available, and we can choose one that's less intense, if needed. However, I want to emphasize that early detection is key with colon cancer. The FIT test is a simple, non-invasive way to screen for any potential problems, and if it's negative, you may not need a colonoscopy at all. We can start with the FIT test, and if the results are normal, you can simply repeat it next year. I completely respect your feelings, and if you’re not comfortable proceeding, we can certainly discuss other options. However, I strongly recommend at least considering the FIT test as a first step. Would you like me to provide you with more information about the test, and perhaps a referral to a gastroenterologist to discuss any concerns you may have?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… reasonable. A simple test first. That doesn’t sound so bad. And if it’s normal… then I don’t have to worry about… everything else. Yes, I suppose I could try the test. But please, no pressure if I decide it’s too much. And information about the test would be good. And… the gastroenterologist… yes, perhaps talking to someone who specializes in… all of this… would be helpful. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate that.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Hughston. That's perfectly fine. We'll start with the FIT test, and we can go at your pace. I’m going to print out some information about the test, including detailed instructions on how to collect the sample. I’ll also provide a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a highly respected gastroenterologist in the area. You can schedule a consultation with her to discuss any concerns you have. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. The information and the referral… that’s perfect. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I just… I worry so much. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I suppose I should be going then. It's been a long morning.
DOCTOR: Of course. Here’s the information and the referral. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. And please, don’t worry too much. We'll take things one step at a time. Have a good day, Ms. Hughston, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I appreciate everything. Bye bye!
