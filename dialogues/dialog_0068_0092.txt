DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Guilds, yeah, that's me. Look, it's… hard to breathe, kinda. And my mouth feels like sandpaper, always dry. Eyes too. Like I been starin' at the sun too long. It’s been gettin' worse, I think. Don’t remember when exactly, though. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath and dryness… mouth and eyes, you said. And it’s been gradually worsening. Hmm. Can you tell me a little more about the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Gradually… yeah, that sounds right. It ain’t like it happened all at once. Just… more effort, you know? Like climbin' stairs, or walkin' to the mailbox. Used to be nothin'. Now… gotta stop and catch my breath. And it's not just when I’m doin’ stuff. Sometimes just sittin' here! Makes a fella nervous, ya know? Don’t like feelin’ like I can’t… fill my lungs.
DOCTOR: Okay, exertion makes it worse, but it’s also happening at rest. Any chest pain with that, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Nah, not really. A little… tight sometimes, maybe? But not like a real pain. More like… pressure, I guess. Hard to explain. It comes and goes. Mostly just the breathin’ is the problem. And this awful dry mouth. Drives me crazy. You got any water?
DOCTOR: Yes, help yourself. Now, about this dryness… Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant. Pretty much always. I sip water all day long. Doesn't even help much, to be honest. Feels like the desert in here. And my eyes… burnin’ all the time. I try those drops, but they don't last. Used to be able to go a whole day without thinkin' about this. Now it’s every five minutes!
DOCTOR: Alright. Constant dry mouth and eyes, with the shortness of breath and occasional chest tightness… Hmm. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Appetite… well, not really. I eat what my daughter brings over. She worries about me, ya know? Keeps me fed. I don’t really feel hungry, but I eat anyway. Don’t wanna cause her trouble. Food tastes kinda… bland, now that I think about it. Maybe that's why I don’t eat much. Hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay. Bland taste… let's see. Any fever, chills, or night sweats lately?
PATIENT: Fever? Nah, I don’t think so. I haven't taken my temperature. Chills… not really. Gets kinda cool at night, but that's just the air conditionin' cranked up too high. My daughter likes it cold. Night sweats… no. I just… sleep. Or try to. Gets hard to breathe when I lay down sometimes, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any medications currently, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Medications… uh… let me think. Just what the doctor gave me for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. Can't remember the name. My daughter handles all that. She fills the little boxes for me. I just take 'em. Don't wanna mess anything up. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay. Blood pressure medication… We'll need to get the specifics on that. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had a problem with nothin'. My daughter always asks when I go to the dentist, and they say no. I eat everything. Cuban food, you know? Lots of spices. If I was allergic to somethin', I'd know by now, right? This is all just… breathin’ and dryness. Makes me nervous, that's what it does.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to do a quick exam, just to listen to your lungs and check a few things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you gotta do. Just… don't take too long, okay? Makes me anxious, sittin' here.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. And again… Okay. Your breathing sounds a little… diminished on both sides. Some mild wheezing as well. Now, let’s take a look at your throat. Your throat is a little dry, as you mentioned. No obvious signs of infection, but definitely dry. And your lymph nodes are normal. Blood pressure is… 140 over 85. Within normal limits, but could be better. Okay. So, we've got some shortness of breath, wheezing, dry mouth, and dry eyes. Given your age and these symptoms, we need to rule out a few things. I want to order a chest X-ray, and some blood work to check your electrolytes and kidney function. And a complete blood count. Also, I will ask your daughter about the exact medications that you are taking. That will help me better understand your condition.
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood work? Sounds… complicated. My daughter will freak out. Is it somethin' serious? I just want somethin' for the breathin' and the dryness. Is that too much to ask? I feel like I’m fallin’ apart.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Guilds. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s serious, but we need to get some information to figure out what’s going on. These tests will help us rule out potential causes like pneumonia, heart failure, or dehydration. It could also be something simpler, like a medication side effect or even allergies. The breathlessness and dryness could be related, and it's important to get to the bottom of it. We want to make sure there isn't anything serious going on, and then we can treat it accordingly. I'll explain everything to your daughter, and we'll work together to make a plan. I will place the orders now. The lab is just down the hall, and we can schedule the X-ray for later this afternoon. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Afternoon… okay, I guess. Just… don’t keep me waitin’ too long. And tell my daughter… tell her I’m okay. Don’t wanna worry her. This whole thing is makin’ me nervous. Just… get it over with, okay? And can you… can you give me somethin’ for the dryness now? My mouth feels like sandpaper.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. We’ll get this done as quickly as possible. I’m going to write you a prescription for artificial saliva and lubricating eye drops. That should help with the dryness in the meantime. It will be sent to your pharmacy. I will also ask the nurse to bring you a cup of water. We'll get these tests done, figure out what's going on, and get you feeling better. I will call your daughter after the tests to discuss the results and plan. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Water would be good. And callin’ my daughter… fine. Just… please, don’t find nothin’ bad, okay? I’m too old for all this. I just want to breathe easy again. And not feel like the desert in here. That's all.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Guilds. We’ll do our best. The nurse will be right in with the water. Please don’t hesitate to let us know if you feel any worse. Thank you for your patience. .
