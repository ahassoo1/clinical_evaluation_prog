DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a reset, you know? A jumpstart to get things going again. I’m not really sick, sick, but I don’t have the energy I used to, and everything feels…difficult.
DOCTOR: "Stuck," you say. Difficult… I see. And how long have you been feeling this way, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. It hasn’t been sudden, not at all. Probably…the last six months, maybe? It started slowly, just feeling a bit more tired than usual. Now it's…well, it’s more noticeable. It’s hard to explain. It’s not a specific thing, just…a general lack of pep. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A gradual onset over six months… Alright. And has anything specific changed in your life during that time?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific? Let me think. My daughter got married in February, which was wonderful, but a lot of planning, of course. And my husband, Ricardo, retired last September. That’s been…an adjustment. We’re both getting used to having him around all the time. Not a bad thing, mind you, but different. And…oh! I did start a new batch of sculptures, a larger project than I’ve done in a while. It’s been keeping me busy.
DOCTOR: Marriage, retirement, a new project… A lot of life changes. Okay. And you mentioned a lack of energy. Can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: It’s…not that I can't do things, Doctor. I still manage everything. But it takes more effort. Like, I used to be able to work on my sculptures for hours without a break. Now I need to stop and rest every hour or so. And I just feel… drained at the end of the day. Not necessarily sad, just… depleted. And honestly, I’ve been sleeping more, but it doesn’t always feel restful. Does that make sense? It’s a bit hard to put into words.
DOCTOR: So, fatigue, requiring more rest, and non-restorative sleep. Alright. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not really, no. No aches or pains, no fever, no…I suppose I’ve been a bit more forgetful lately, but I chalked that up to getting older! Ricardo teases me about it. Nothing serious, just…where did I put my glasses? Oh. Like that. No, nothing else that I can think of. Just…tired. And a bit…stuck.
DOCTOR: Alright. Forgetfulness… We can address that later. Now, Ms. Pitzel, I’m going to ask you a few routine questions, just to get a broader picture. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: That’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go ahead. Hmm… appetite… not really. I still eat pretty normally, maybe a bit less when I’m really focused on my sculptures, but nothing drastic. And my weight… …it’s probably gone down a little, maybe five or ten pounds. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, but my clothes feel a bit looser, if that makes sense. Nothing intentional, I assure you. I enjoy my food too much!
DOCTOR: A slight weight loss… Alright. And what about bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a bit personal, isn’t it? Well, they're…regular, I suppose. No changes there. Everything is…functioning as it should, if you understand. It's not something I've given much thought to, to be honest. Sorry if that's not a very helpful answer.
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright. We simply cover all bases. Now, Ms. Pitzel, do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder out when I was in my thirties, but that was years ago and hasn’t been a problem since. And I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, which is common for sculptors, I think. But it’s manageable with over-the-counter pain relievers. Otherwise, I’ve been quite healthy, thankfully. I’m on Medicare now, of course, since I turned sixty-five. I consider myself a lucky woman.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gallbladder removal years ago, arthritis… Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve always been able to take most medications without issue, though I try to avoid them when possible. I prefer to handle things naturally, if I can. Though I suppose that’s getting harder as I get older. It just seems like everything takes a bit longer to work these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a multivitamin, just a standard one, and some fish oil for my joints. Ricardo keeps telling me to take glucosamine and chondroitin, but I haven’t gotten around to it yet. And sometimes, if my hands are really bothering me, I take ibuprofen. But that's it, really. Nothing regularly prescribed by a doctor, if that makes sense. I’m not much of a pill-taker, as you can probably tell.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Pitzel, for the sake of completeness, I’m going to perform a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I understand it’s part of the process. I haven’t had a full check-up in a while, so it’s probably a good idea. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72. Temperature is normal. Now, let me check your thyroid. Thyroid is normal in size, no nodules palpated.
PATIENT: That all sounds…good, doesn't it? I'm glad everything seems normal. I always worry about my thyroid, you know? My mother had some trouble with hers when she got older. But it's reassuring to hear it's okay. What do you think it could be, Doctor? This…feeling stuck, I mean. Is there anything obvious?
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say definitively, Ms. Pitzel. Your examination is remarkably normal, which rules out many acute issues. The symptoms you describe – fatigue, sleep disturbance, weight loss, and a general lack of energy – could be attributable to several factors. Given your age and history, it could be related to a decline in thyroid function, even though the physical exam was normal – sometimes subtle changes aren't immediately apparent. It could also be related to stress, adjustment to retirement, or even a vitamin deficiency. To rule out thyroid issues, I'd like to order a complete thyroid panel. And I'll also order a Vitamin D level and a basic metabolic panel to assess your overall health.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever tests you think are necessary. It’s just…frustrating, you know? I feel like I should be enjoying my retirement, but I just don’t have the energy to do the things I want to. I suppose I’m just hoping to get my pep back. Thank you for listening, Doctor. It helps just to talk about it. When will I know the results?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel frustrated, Ms. Pitzel. We will get to the bottom of this. The lab results should be available within three to five business days. My office will contact you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend you focus on getting adequate sleep, maintaining a healthy diet, and engaging in light exercise, if you’re able. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as fever, chest pain, or severe fatigue – please contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. That all sounds very reasonable. Thank you again for your time and your attention. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and I’ll be sure to contact the office if anything changes. I’ll look forward to hearing from you.
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re welcome, Ms. Pitzel. Have a good day.
