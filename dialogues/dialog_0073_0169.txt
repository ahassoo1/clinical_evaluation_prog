DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner… Miner. Yes. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Well, it's… my face, mostly. And my legs. They're puffin' up, see? Not like, all the time, but… yeah. It’s a bother. Can't really say why it’s happenin', though. Never had nothin' like this before.
DOCTOR: “Face and legs…” Right. And this is a new development?
PATIENT: New? Yeah, pretty new. Started… oh, geez. A couple weeks, maybe? Hard to say exactly. Time kinda… slips away, ya know? It's not like it was sudden. Just kinda… got more puffy. Nothin’ drastic, mind ya. Just… noticeable. Especially when I try to get my boots on. Ugh. It’s a real pain.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks, gradually worsening. Primarily affecting your legs and face. And is this puffiness… is it worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that ya mention it… I think it's worse in the evenin'. Yeah, definitely worse when I get home from work. After standin' all day, it's like… whoosh. All swollen up. Don't notice it much in the mornin', not really. Just gets bad as the day goes on. Probably just tired legs, I dunno. I'm an old man, after all.
DOCTOR: Worse in the evening after standing… Alright. And you said your face as well?
PATIENT: Yeah, my face. Not as bad as my legs, but… look at it. It's kinda… full, ya know? My wife… well, she used to say I looked like a pufferfish. Not very nice, but… she had a point. It's just… not normal. It wasn't like this before.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? What do ya mean, changed? Work's the same, been weldin' the same stuff for… well, a long time. I eat pretty much the same things. Not much changes around here, ya see? Been widower for five years now, so... not much excitement. Why do ya ask? Is somethin' supposed to have changed?
DOCTOR: Just trying to get a complete picture, Mr. Miner. Sometimes even small changes can be relevant. Any new medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Medications? Nope. Haven’t taken nothin’ but aspirin for a headache now and then. And that’s… not even regularly. I don't like takin' pills. Makes me feel… sluggish. No, definitely no new medicines. Don't trust 'em, really. Always got side effects, ya know? My wife always said… well, never mind. Point is, no pills.
DOCTOR: No new medications… Alright. And do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what kinda symptoms? I feel… tired, I guess. But I'm always tired. Been workin' hard my whole life. Maybe a little short of breath sometimes, but that could be the heat, right? It's been hot. I don’t know… I don’t feel sick, if that makes any sense. Just puffy. And tired. Is that enough for a symptom?
DOCTOR: Tiredness, occasional shortness of breath… And the puffiness, of course. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better feel for things. Could you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Scale, huh? Alright, alright. Always hated these things. Makes me feel… bigger than I am. Don’t look at me too close, now. Don't need no judgement. 152… that what it says? Seems a bit high, don’t ya think?
DOCTOR: 152 pounds. And your height is listed as 5’3”. That puts your BMI at… well, it’s a bit elevated. Now, could I just listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Elevated? What's elevated? Sounds important. Fine, go ahead. But don't poke too much. I'm a welder, not a pin cushion. Quick now, I haven’t got all day. And don’t tell me nothin’ fancy. Just tell me what’s wrong with my legs.
DOCTOR: Okay. Deep breaths in, and out… and again… Alright. Your heart sounds a little… muffled, but nothing alarming right now. Your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling that I can detect. Now, let's take a look at your legs. Please, sit on the examination table.
PATIENT: Careful now, this table feels kinda flimsy. Muffled, ya say? What does that mean? Is somethin' broken? I haven’t broken nothin', not that I know of. Just tell me straight, doc. No fancy words. What’s wrong with my legs? They're puffin' up, that's what's wrong!
DOCTOR: Alright. There is significant pitting edema in both legs, extending up to the shins. And your pulses are a little weak, but present. “Muffled” just means the sounds are a little quieter than I’d expect. It's not necessarily something to panic about right now, but it’s something we need to investigate. Now, regarding your legs, the swelling… this could be a few things. It could be related to poor circulation, kidney issues, or even heart problems. It’s too early to say for certain.
PATIENT: Kidney issues?! Heart problems?! Now hold on a minute! I feel fine! Well, tired, but that’s just… work! I’ve been weldin’ for forty years, I’m supposed to be tired! My wife… she always said I was a strong man. Now you’re tellin’ me somethin’s wrong with my kidneys and my heart? What kinda tests are ya talkin' about? And how much is this gonna cost? I ain't insured, ya know! This sounds expensive…
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Miner. And I’m not saying there is anything definitely wrong, but the swelling and the muffled heart sound warrant further investigation. We'll need some blood work to check your kidney function and electrolytes. And an EKG to get a better look at your heart rhythm. As for the cost… I'll have the billing department give you a breakdown of the costs. We may be able to work out a payment plan. We will also want to do a urine sample to check for protein. These are standard tests, and the sooner we get them done, the better. It's important to rule out anything serious, alright?
PATIENT: Urine sample, blood work, EKG… sounds like a whole lotta pokin’ and proddin’. A payment plan? What's that gonna cost me? And my wife… she'd be furious if I ran up a big bill. Always said I was a spendthrift. Look, doc, can’t ya just give me somethin’ for the puffiness? A cream or somethin’? Maybe a water pill? I just want this to go away. All this testin’… it sounds awful expensive and awful complicated. And I don't like hospitals. Never have. My wife… she always said I was a stubborn old man.
DOCTOR: Mr. Miner, I understand your reluctance. However, simply treating the swelling without finding the underlying cause could be dangerous. A water pill might temporarily relieve the puffiness, but it won’t address the potential issues with your kidneys or heart. And ignoring those issues could lead to more serious complications down the line. While I can’t definitively diagnose anything without the tests, the combination of symptoms warrants a thorough workup. I am concerned about potential heart failure or kidney disease, and those conditions require medical attention. I can write a referral to a cardiologist, as well. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Heart failure…? Kidney disease…? Now you're scaring me, doc. Really scaring me. My wife...she'd kill me if I ignored something serious. But tests… and cardiologists… and bills… Alright, alright. Do the tests. Do 'em all. But please… no surprises. And tell me how much it's gonna cost before you do 'em. And... if it’s really bad, promise you'll just tell me straight. No fancy words. Just… what's wrong. I’m an old man, doc. I deserve to know. And… can I at least get a cream for the puffiness while we're waitin'? Just somethin' to make it feel a little better? Please?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Miner. I understand. We'll get the blood work and urine sample ordered right away. I’ll also have the billing department contact you with a cost estimate. We can discuss the results when they come back and decide on the next steps. I can write you a prescription for a topical corticosteroid cream to help with the puffiness in the meantime. It won't address the underlying cause, but it may provide some relief. And I promise to explain everything in plain language, no fancy words. We’ll take things one step at a time. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it. Just… get it over with, I guess. And thank you, doc. For bein’… straight with me. It’s scary, what you’re sayin’. But I'd rather know. Even if it’s bad. Just… get it over with. And tell the billing department to be gentle. My wife… well, never mind. Just be gentle. Now, where do I go to get these tests done?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the lab technician come in and draw your blood now. The urine sample can be collected in the restroom down the hall – you'll find collection cups and instructions. As for the EKG, it’s done right here in the office after the blood work. I’ll write you a referral to a cardiologist as well, just in case. Here’s a list of the labs and their addresses. Please let the receptionist know you're here for the tests. And if you experience any chest pain or shortness of breath while waiting for the results, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you go?
