DOCTOR: Hi Kile, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Decosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Doctor, yes. Good to meet you too. I… new here. Just moved. Social visit, they said. Something about… health. Old bones, maybe? I do makeup, you know. For the… shows. Very important shows. Not like it matters for health, eh?
DOCTOR: Welcome to the area, Kile! It's good you came in for a check-up, even if it is just a "social visit" as they put it. And don't downplay it – health always matters, no matter what you do. So, you mentioned "old bones" – are you experiencing any pain, stiffness, or trouble with movement?
PATIENT: Pain? Sometimes. It’s… hard to say. My back, maybe? From bending over the… faces, always bending. And the lights! Terrible lights. But pain… everyone has pain, no? It's just… life. I don't think it's bad. Just old. I used to be a dancer, you know. A real dancer. Before… everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for pain to come with age, and especially with physically demanding work, or a history of it like you had with dancing. But it's still important to figure out what's causing it, and if there's anything we can do to help. When you say your back hurts from bending over "faces"... could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Faces? Oh, the actors! I put makeup on actors. For the theater. Big shows, very fancy. I bend over them… a lot. They hold still, mostly. Sometimes they wiggle. It's tiring, you know? My back gets… tight. Like a knot. I used to rub it with… something. A cream, I think. But I forget. Old age, eh? Everything goes.
DOCTOR: So it sounds like the bending and posture while you're applying makeup is contributing to the back tightness. And it's completely normal to have some memory lapses as we get older. We can definitely work with that. Besides the back tightness, are you experiencing any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: Anywhere else… Hmm. My hands, sometimes. They ache. From holding the brushes, always holding. And… my feet. They used to be beautiful, you know? Dancer’s feet. Now… not so much. They swell up. Especially if I stand for too long. Is that… bad? I don’t know what’s bad anymore. Everything hurts a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have some aching in your hands and swelling in your feet, especially with prolonged standing. That's helpful information. It sounds like there could be some wear and tear happening, especially with your history as a dancer. Let's talk about your overall health a bit. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like arthritis, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… oh, that's a fancy word. Let me think. The old doctor… back in Russia, he gave me pills. For my blood. Something about it being… thick? And my heart. He said my heart was… loud. But I stopped taking the pills. Too many pills. Now… I don’t know. I don't really go to doctors. They just tell you bad things, eh? I feel okay. Mostly. A little tired, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like you may have been treated for high blood pressure or high cholesterol in the past. It’s good you remember that, even if it was a long time ago. It's understandable to not want to take a lot of pills, but those conditions are important to manage to prevent more serious problems down the road. Do you happen to know the names of those pills, or what they were for specifically?
PATIENT: Pills… names… no. Everything is blurry. Little white ones, maybe? Or blue? I really don't remember. The doctor just said, "Take these." I took them for a while. Made me feel… strange. A little sleepy. And my stomach didn't like them. So, I stopped. Is it important? Honestly, I just want to be left alone. I’m a busy man, you know. Shows to prepare for. People need their faces done.
DOCTOR: I understand, Kile. It’s perfectly fine that you don’t remember the names. We can focus on what’s happening now. And I won't push you to take anything you’re not comfortable with. Just to get a better picture, have you had any other medical problems, like any surgeries or hospital stays?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me think. When I was a boy, I broke my arm. Fell from a tree. They put it in a cast. A big, heavy cast. That was a long time ago. Other than that… no. No surgeries. I'm a strong man! I don’t get sick. A little tired sometimes, maybe. But who doesn’t get tired? Life is tiring, eh?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No major surgeries is positive. Now, let’s talk a little about your family. Do you have any family history of medical problems, like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… oh, my family is… complicated. My mother… she lived a long time. But she was always… sick. Something with her lungs. Always coughing. And my father… he died young. A heart attack, they said. Very sudden. My sister… she's still in Russia. I haven't seen her in years. I don’t know what she’s doing. Or if she’s even alive. It’s… better not to think about it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like there’s a history of lung issues and heart disease in your family. That's important information for us to know. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. Horrible habit. Makes you cough. And smells terrible. My mother… she smoked, you know. That’s probably why she was always sick. No, never smoked. And I don’t drink much either. Maybe a little vodka sometimes, with friends. But not often. I need a clear head for the shows. Can’t be messing up the faces, eh?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No smoking is excellent. A little vodka occasionally is fine. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Let me think… No, I don't think so. I eat everything. I'm Russian, you know! We eat potatoes with everything. And pickles. And… borscht. Everything! Never had a problem. Maybe… a little itchy sometimes? But that could be anything. The dust, maybe? I work with a lot of powder. For the faces.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, although potential sensitivity to dust from the makeup powder. That’s helpful. Alright, Kile. I think I have a good overview of your medical history. Now, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Exam? What kind of exam? I don't like being poked and prodded. I'm a sensitive man, you know! I work with… faces. They are very delicate. But… alright. If you must. But be gentle, eh? And don’t take too long. I have shows to prepare for.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kile. I promise to be as gentle as possible. It will just be a routine check – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, looking at your joints, and a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes and balance. Nothing too invasive, I promise. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. But hurry up, eh? I have a very important performance next week. The prima ballerina… very demanding. She expects perfection. And if I’m late… well, let’s just say it won't be pretty. Just get it over with, eh? And be gentle! My veins are… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relaxing your arm, please. Deep breaths. 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Heart sounds are a little… strong, but no murmurs detected. Lungs sound clear, although I do hear some faint crackling at the bases. Could be from a little congestion. Do you have any shortness of breath or cough?
PATIENT: Crackling? What does that mean? Is something broken? My heart is strong! I’m a Russian! We have strong hearts! Shortness of breath… sometimes. When I climb the stairs. But who doesn’t get a little winded? And a cough… a little, in the winter. But nothing serious. Just a tickle in my throat. Everything is always a little… something. This is why I don’t like doctors. You always find something wrong!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Kile. "Crackling" just means there might be a little fluid in your lungs, which can be common, especially with a cough or a history of smoking, even if it was second hand. It's not necessarily something serious, but it's good to be aware of it. Now, I'm just going to check your joints for any tenderness or swelling. Can you bend your knees and elbows for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, my knees… They’ve seen better days. Dancer’s knees, you know. Very demanding profession. And my elbows… they ache sometimes. Especially when it's cold. Swelling… a little, maybe? But it’s always like that. Old age, eh? Everything creaks and pops. You’re going to find something wrong with everything, I just know it.
DOCTOR: You're right, there is some mild tenderness and slight swelling in both knees and elbows. And I notice some crepitus – that's the creaking sound you mentioned - as you move them. This is consistent with osteoarthritis, which is a common condition in people with a history of physical activity or as they get older. Now, just a quick neurological exam. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: There! I’m following it! What is this proving? I can see perfectly fine! I have to make sure the actors' makeup is flawless, you know. Very precise work. Now, can we be done? I have a very important appointment… with the costume designer. She’s a very… particular woman. She doesn't like to be kept waiting.
DOCTOR: You're doing great, Kile. And your eyes are tracking perfectly. This was just a quick check to make sure everything is functioning normally. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Now, based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you're experiencing some mild osteoarthritis in your knees and elbows, potentially some mild congestion in your lungs, and your blood pressure is a little elevated. I’d like to order some basic blood work to get a better understanding of your cholesterol levels and kidney function, and a chest x-ray to evaluate the congestion in your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? X-rays? More poking and prodding? This is ridiculous! I just wanted a check-up, not a whole… investigation! But… alright. If you must. But please, be quick. And don’t tell me anything I don’t want to hear. I have enough stress in my life already. This costume designer… she’s a nightmare.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Kile. We'll just get some basic tests done, and I’ll explain everything clearly. I promise to only tell you what you need to know, and we can focus on managing any issues to help you stay healthy and keep doing what you love. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood and schedule the chest x-ray for you. In the meantime, I recommend you try some over-the-counter pain relief medication like ibuprofen or naproxen for the knee and elbow pain, and stay well-hydrated. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Pain relief… alright. I’ll try it. But I don’t like taking pills. And water… yes, I drink water. I’m not an animal. No, I don’t think so. No questions. Just… get it over with. And tell the nurse to be gentle. My veins are… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll make sure the nurse is aware. The results should be back in a few days, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. Thank you for coming in today, Kile. Take care, and I hope you have a successful performance next week! .
PATIENT: .
