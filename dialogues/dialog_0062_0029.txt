DOCTOR: Hi Norval, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Decosta. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. It's… it's my stomach, mostly. I get full awful quick these days. Even if I don't eat much. It's been happening for a while now, I guess. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. Just… quicker and quicker.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing early fullness, even with a small amount of food. That's definitely something we should look into. When you say "a while now," could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… six months? Could be a little more, could be a little less. It's hard to say, really. It wasn’t sudden, you see. Just… crept up on me. I thought it was just getting old, mostly. Everything slows down, doesn't it? My wife, Elsie, she says I should come see someone, though. She worries.
DOCTOR: That's good of Elsie to encourage you to come in, and it's smart to get it checked out, even if it felt gradual. Six months is helpful to know. And you're right, things can change as we get older, but that doesn't necessarily mean we just accept them! Now, besides feeling full quickly, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I’ve been a bit… tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. But I am 88, Doctor! It's hard to tell what's normal and what's not these days. And… sometimes my stomach feels a little uncomfortable, just a dull ache. Not pain, exactly. Just… not right. And I haven’t been as hungry as I used to be, which is… odd, considering I get full so fast. It’s all a bit of a muddle, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a better picture. Tiredness, a dull ache in your stomach, and a decreased appetite… those are all things we need to consider. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements… Oh dear. Well, they’re… regular enough. Not as solid as they used to be, maybe. A bit looser. And… not as frequent. Used to go every day, like clockwork. Now it's more… every other day, or sometimes longer. Elsie keeps offering me prune juice. She's very concerned about my regularity.
DOCTOR: Elsie sounds like a very caring wife! It’s good you can talk about these things. Changes in bowel habits are definitely important to note. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was a long time ago. And… the doctor said my blood pressure was a little high a few years back, so he put me on a pill for it. I take that every day. Aside from that… not much, really. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I used to fish a lot, you see. Good exercise. Elsie handles most of the remembering these days, to be honest. She's got a better memory than me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so appendix removed in your youth and high blood pressure managed with medication. That's helpful to know. What about any surgeries besides your appendix?
PATIENT: No, no other surgeries. Just the appendix, as far as I remember. And Elsie would definitely tell me if there was anything else, she’s very thorough. She keeps all my medical papers, you see. Organized in a binder. Says it’s important. I think she worries I’d wander off and forget everything. She’s a good woman, Elsie.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful Elsie is so organized and supportive. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother, she had… arthritis, I think. Badly, in her hands. Couldn’t knit anymore towards the end. And my father… he had a weak heart. Didn’t live to be very old. Elsie says there’s some… stomach trouble on her side of the family, but I can’t rightly recall what it was. Something about ulcers, maybe? It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about these things much back then. Mostly, we just knew people got sick and… passed away. It wasn’t like today, with all the tests and everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your mother and a weak heart in your father, and some possible stomach trouble on Elsie’s side. That’s good information. Now, let's talk a little about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Not even tried it. Elsie wouldn’t allow it. And I used to have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I haven't had any in… oh, a long time. Maybe a year or so? It didn’t agree with the blood pressure pills, Elsie said. She’s very careful about what I eat and drink. She’s a good woman, that Elsie.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking and minimal alcohol use. That’s good. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Let me think… just the blood pressure pill, as far as I know. Elsie gives it to me every morning. Sometimes she gives me something for my joints, a little white pill, but I don't take it every day. Just when they’re really bothering me. I'm not sure what it's called. She handles all of that. I think that's it, though. I really don’t take much. Elsie keeps a list, I'm sure. She's very organized.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication daily, and a joint pain medication occasionally. That’s helpful. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Elsie always asks when she gets me new things, and I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat most things, though I'm not a big fan of beets. Elsie tries to sneak them into my soup sometimes. She says they're good for me. But no allergies, as far as I know. Not to pills or food or anything. I'm a pretty simple man, Doctor. Don't need much to make me happy.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to know. Alright Norval, I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. It won't take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Elsie always says I should listen to the doctors. She’s right, of course. Go ahead. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Alright, if you could just lie back on the examination table, that would be great. Okay, I’m just listening to your heart now. Sounds a little… quiet, actually. A bit of a slow rhythm, but nothing immediately concerning. And now I'm listening to your lungs. Breath sounds are clear, no wheezing or crackling that I can hear. Now I'm just going to gently feel your abdomen. Is there any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. Maybe a little… uncomfortable, but not painful. It's just… feels a bit… full, I suppose. Like there's something there, even if I haven't eaten much. It’s hard to explain. It's not sharp pain, just… a dull ache, like you said. Especially… right here. It's not constant, though. Comes and goes. Elsie says I shouldn’t eat so much before bed, but… a little something helps me sleep. She's always fussing over me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel a little fullness there as well. No sharp pain when I press, that's good. And I noticed your abdomen is a bit distended, meaning it’s slightly larger than usual. I’m just tapping lightly to check for any fluid. It sounds a little… dull. And just checking your reflexes. All seem normal for your age. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. I’m going to review your chart and then we can discuss what I’m thinking. Just one moment.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Take your time. Elsie always says patience is a virtue. I'm not in any rush. Just glad to be getting it checked out. It's comforting to know someone is looking into it. It's just… getting older is a funny thing. Things just… stop working like they used to. But Elsie keeps me going. She's a remarkable woman, that Elsie.
DOCTOR: Okay Norval, I’ve reviewed your chart. It looks like you've been a generally healthy man, as you said, with well-controlled blood pressure. The records do indicate some recent weight loss, about 5 pounds in the last six months, which is worth noting given your decreased appetite and early fullness. Based on your symptoms – the early fullness, decreased appetite, tiredness, changes in bowel movements, some abdominal discomfort, and the weight loss – and what I found during the exam, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. It could be something as simple as a change in your digestive system due to age, but it's important to rule out other things. One possibility is gastritis – inflammation of the stomach lining. Another is a slow-growing blockage in the stomach or intestines, although I didn’t feel anything particularly concerning during the exam. And, given your age, we also need to consider the possibility of a stomach cancer, although this is less likely. I want to be upfront with you – these are just possibilities at this point, and we need further testing to determine what's going on.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Cancer… That sounds… serious. Elsie will be upset. But you're right, Doctor, it's best to know. I don't want to just sit around wondering. What kind of tests do you want to do? Are they… painful? I don’t handle pain very well these days. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Elsie always says I should listen to the doctors. But please… be gentle. And try not to worry Elsie too much. She gets very anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Norval, and I want to assure you we'll take things one step at a time. It’s important to remember that we’re just exploring possibilities at this point, and many things can cause these symptoms that aren't cancer. The first test I recommend is a blood test. This will help us check your overall health, look for any signs of inflammation, and rule out other potential causes. It's a standard blood draw, so it shouldn't be too uncomfortable – just a quick pinch. The next test I recommend is an upper endoscopy. This involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera attached into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to visualize the lining and look for any abnormalities. It requires some preparation – you'll need to fast beforehand – and you'll be given some medication to help you relax and numb your throat. It can cause some mild discomfort afterwards, but it's generally well-tolerated. Finally, depending on the results of the other tests, we may consider a CT scan of your abdomen to get a more detailed view of your internal organs. I understand these tests may sound daunting, but they’re the best way to get a clear diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment. I will explain everything in detail before each test, and you’ll have plenty of opportunity to ask questions. We’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable throughout the process. And I will definitely be careful not to worry Elsie too much. I’ll keep her informed every step of the way, and we’ll work together to ensure you both feel supported.
PATIENT: That sounds… like a lot. But you're right, Doctor, it's best to know what we're dealing with. The endoscopy… that sounds a little scary. But I trust you. And Elsie will want me to get it done. She's very practical. The blood test is no problem, just a pinch. And you said you'll explain everything before the endoscopy? And give me something to relax? That's good. When can we schedule these tests? And how long will it take to get the results? I don't want to keep Elsie worried for too long. And thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly. And for promising to be gentle with Elsie. She gets very anxious, you know. A little worried all the time. It comes with being a good wife, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Norval. We'll take things at your pace, and I’ll explain everything in detail before each test. You’ll have plenty of opportunity to ask questions and voice any concerns. And yes, you’ll be given medication to help you relax and numb your throat before the endoscopy. The goal is to make you as comfortable as possible. I can schedule the blood test for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. It's a quick procedure, and we can get the results within a few days. We can schedule the endoscopy for next week, giving you time to prepare and ask any questions. It typically takes about 30 minutes, and the results will be available within a week. I will also give you detailed instructions on how to prepare for each test, including any dietary restrictions or medications you need to adjust. And I promise to keep Elsie informed every step of the way. I’ll explain the results to her in a clear and compassionate manner, and we’ll work together to develop a plan that’s right for you. I understand Elsie’s anxiety, and I’ll do everything I can to alleviate her concerns. Let me just get these appointments scheduled for you now…
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. Tomorrow for the blood test, and next week for the endoscopy. Thank you. And thank you for being so patient with me, and for promising to take care of Elsie. You know, Elsie says I get all my worrying from my mother. She was a fretful woman, always anticipating the worst. But she was a good woman, too. A very good woman. I suppose worrying just comes with being a good person. Alright, let me know when you’ve got the appointments scheduled. And thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease, at least a little.
DOCTOR: Alright Norval, I’ve scheduled your blood test for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. You’ll need to fast for 8 hours beforehand, so no food or drink after midnight tonight. And I’ve scheduled your endoscopy for next Wednesday at 10:00 AM. You’ll receive a call from the endoscopy department to discuss the preparation instructions in more detail. Here’s a paper with all the appointment details and contact information. And don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before then. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease a little. Remember, we’re just exploring possibilities at this point, and many things can cause these symptoms that aren’t serious. I will see you tomorrow morning for the blood test. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. And give Elsie my best. It was lovely meeting you, Norval.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Decosta. You’ve been very kind. And I will. I will give Elsie your best. She’ll be very happy to hear it. It’s good to know there are people like you in the world. People who care. I think I’ll go home now and tell Elsie about the appointments. And maybe make her a cup of tea. She likes chamomile, you know. Helps her calm her nerves. Thank you again, Doctor. And goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Norval. It was lovely meeting you as well. And chamomile is a wonderful choice – a very calming tea. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And give Elsie my best. Have a good day, Norval. And please, take care.
