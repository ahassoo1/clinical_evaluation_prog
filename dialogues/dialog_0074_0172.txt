DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Really, it’s just… a formality, I suppose. My husband insisted. New to the area, you see. Said I ought to establish care. Honestly, I'm perfectly fine. Don't recall needing anything from a doctor in… decades. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand. Establishing care is always a good idea, even when feeling well, and your husband sounds very thoughtful. It shouldn't take too long – we'll primarily focus on getting to know your medical history and doing a basic check-up. It typically takes about 45 minutes to an hour. To begin, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Health... Well, I’m… tall. Always have been. And thin. Not that it's ever been a problem. I get around just fine, I suppose. I work. Dispatching, you know. Been doing it for years. Though I can’t rightly recall how many. It’s mostly sitting, of course. Is that what you want to know? Do you need specifics? Because honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I do have Medicare, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare is relevant, thank you for mentioning that. And no worries at all about your memory; it's perfectly normal for things to take a little longer to recall as we get older. We'll take things at your pace. It's helpful to know you're working as a dispatcher – that gives me a good sense of your activity level. When you say 'sitting' for much of the day, are there any periods where you're actively moving around, or is it mostly a stationary position?
PATIENT: Stationary, mostly. Though, I do get up to fetch coffee. And… use the facilities, naturally. It's not a physical job, if that’s what you’re asking. I talk on the phone. A lot. Coordinating things, you know. Drivers, schedules… It's mostly mental. I’ve always been good with organization. Though, again, the details escape me. It’s all a bit…fuzzy. Honestly, I think my husband worries too much. He’s a retired accountant. Very particular about things. Perhaps he should be here instead. He’d have all the dates and specifics memorized.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have a very busy job, even if it doesn’t require a lot of physical exertion. And it's perfectly understandable that details might be fuzzy - you have a lot on your mind! We’ll certainly try to keep things simple. Let’s see if we can piece together some of your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Now that’s a question. I… believe I had the flu, once. A bad one. Many years ago. And… a broken wrist, as a child. Fell from a tree, chasing a cat. Silly thing. That was… ages ago. Beyond that… honestly, I don't recall. I’ve always been rather… robust. Not prone to illness. My mother… well, she had high blood pressure, I think. And arthritis, towards the end. But that was her. I take after my father, I suppose. Strong constitution. Is this important? I feel like you’re fishing for something.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Engelhaupt, even if it's just to know you've generally been healthy. Knowing about your mother’s history of high blood pressure and arthritis is useful, as well. Family history can sometimes give us clues. Let’s talk about medications for a moment. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, vitamins, or over-the-counter supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I don’t believe in all that… modern medicine. I mean, I take a daily multivitamin, just to be on the safe side. And sometimes, if I have a headache, I’ll take… what is it called… ibuprofen, I think? The white pills. But that’s it. Nothing regular. I pride myself on being… self-sufficient. I don’t need medication. It's all a bit… unnecessary, in my opinion. Though, my husband does take a pill for his cholesterol. He’s very particular about his numbers. Always checking them. Honestly, it’s rather exhausting.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good to know you're generally cautious about medications. And it's important that you feel comfortable with any treatment plan we discuss. Just to get a complete picture, have you ever had any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That’s another question. I don’t think so. I’ve eaten everything. Traveled extensively when I was younger. Never had a reaction. Though, I recall my skin getting a bit itchy once, after using a certain type of lotion. But that was decades ago. And it wasn’t severe. Probably just a sensitivity. Honestly, I’m rather… resilient. I don’t react to much. My husband, on the other hand… he’s allergic to dust mites. Can’t stand them. It’s quite the ordeal, keeping the house clean. Is this… necessary? We've been at this for quite some time. I have an appointment to get my hair done this afternoon.
DOCTOR: It’s good to know you haven't experienced any significant allergies. And yes, we are almost finished. I apologize for the length of the questions, but it is important to have a complete picture of your health. Let’s move on to a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. This will just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at your overall condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam. Honestly, I was hoping to avoid that. I haven’t had one in… well, I can’t recall. But… very well. If you must. Just… try to be quick, please. And gentle. I bruise easily. And really, I assure you, I’m perfectly fine. This is all rather unnecessary, but if it will appease my husband… proceed. But I really must reiterate, I'm quite tall. You'll need the taller examination table, I presume?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Engelhaupt. We will absolutely use the taller examination table. And I assure you, I will be as quick and gentle as possible. The examination will be thorough, but we will certainly respect your wishes and comfort level. If you’ll just have a seat here, we can begin with your blood pressure. Would you mind rolling up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Very well. Just get it over with. Honestly, this is all a bit…undignified. And do be careful with the cuff. It always feels so tight. I prefer to remain… in control of my own body, you see. Is there anything else you need to know before you…proceed? Perhaps a family history of…tallness? My father was quite a large man. And his father before him. It's a dominant gene, you see. I believe I read something about it once.
DOCTOR: It’s good to know about the family history of tallness, Ms. Engelhaupt – genetics are always interesting. Your blood pressure is 138 over 72, which is slightly elevated but not significantly concerning at this time. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I’m just going to listen again in a few different spots… Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Everything feels normal here. Your reflexes are normal, and your gait appears steady. Overall, the physical examination is unremarkable. You appear to be in good health for your age. However, given the slightly elevated blood pressure, I would like to discuss some lifestyle modifications and potentially repeat the blood pressure check in a few months. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications? Honestly, I’ve lived a perfectly healthy life. I don’t smoke, I drink only occasionally, and I eat a balanced diet. My husband tries to feed me too much kale, but I resist. It’s all rather… tedious. And repeating the blood pressure check? Is that truly necessary? It's just a number, you see. Numbers can be… deceiving. Look, Doctor, I appreciate your thoroughness, but frankly, I'm perfectly fine. I'm tall, I'm thin, and I'm independent. I don't need to be lectured about kale or subjected to repeated blood pressure checks. I came here to satisfy my husband, not to undergo a medical interrogation. I believe that concludes our… visit. Thank you for your time. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a hair appointment to keep. Is there anything I need to sign? Or… a bill? I have Medicare, you see. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Engelhaupt. I understand your concerns and respect your wishes. I apologize if I caused any discomfort or seemed intrusive. It was never my intention to lecture you or make you feel interrogated. This is just a standard form for Medicare billing. Our office will submit the claim for you. You may receive an Explanation of Benefits from Medicare detailing the charges and coverage. While I respect your decision to forego further testing at this time, I would like to offer you a printed summary of our conversation, including the slightly elevated blood pressure reading. It may be helpful to share this information with your husband, and it’s always good to have a record of your visit. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Engelhaupt. I wish you all the best, and I hope you enjoy your hair appointment. If you experience any changes in your health, please don't hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: .
