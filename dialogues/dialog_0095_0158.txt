DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… something about a letter. A letter for my… pet. Yes, that’s it. A letter saying I can have a pet. Honestly, all this paperwork these days! It’s just ridiculous. I don't even remember why I need a letter, just that someone said I do. Is that what you do here? Write letters for pets?
DOCTOR: Hmm. That's… unusual. Let me just double-check something here. According to the system, you had a recent health assessment… and the note was regarding medical suitability for pet ownership due to potential allergies. Is that sounding right?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh. Maybe. I do sneeze sometimes. But I've always sneezed! It’s probably just… dust. Or the weather. I don’t know about any assessment. Did someone come to my house? Because I would remember that. Honestly, people just show up sometimes. It's very disruptive. But a letter… because of sneezing? It sounds awfully silly, doesn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, the notes indicate a nurse visited on July 10th to discuss potential pet-related allergens and your history of respiratory symptoms. It looks like there was some concern about asthma, and they recommended a physician’s note confirming you’re able to safely care for a pet, given your history. Do you have any history of asthma?
PATIENT: Asthma… Oh, years ago. When I was a little girl. A very little girl. It was just a little cough, really. Nothing serious. I outgrew it, I’m sure. My mother always said I was a strong child. This is getting very complicated. I just want the letter. Honestly, I don’t understand why they can't just give me the letter. Is this doctor going to ask me a lot of questions? I have errands to run, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Wrye. And I’ll try to be as quick as possible. However, it’s important to make sure you're healthy enough to care for a pet, especially if there’s any history of respiratory issues. Even mild asthma can be aggravated by pet dander. Just a few quick questions, if you don't mind. Do you currently experience any wheezing, shortness of breath, or chest tightness?
PATIENT: Wheezing? No. No wheezing. Sometimes I get a little… breathless going up the stairs, but that’s just because I’m not as young as I used to be. And chest tightness… Well, sometimes my bra feels a little snug, if that's what you mean. But that’s just a matter of finding the right size, really. Honestly, Doctor, I feel perfectly fine. I walk every day, I eat my vegetables, I'm a very active woman. This is all rather… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, or are you frequently exposed to smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Goodness, no! I would never. It’s terrible for you. My husband… well, ex-husband, he used to smoke. Dreadful habit. I made him smoke outside. Always. Even in the rain. But I have never touched a cigarette in my life. It's simply barbaric. Honestly, the smell alone is enough to make me ill. Are we getting closer to this letter yet? I have a hair appointment later.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any new or worsening cough, congestion, or runny nose recently?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… I have been sniffing a bit more than usual. But it’s just the pollen, I think. Everything is blooming, you know. It’s beautiful, really. But the pollen… it gets everywhere. Inside the house, in the car… It’s a constant battle. I don’t think it’s anything serious, though. It happens every spring. Honestly, I wouldn’t even notice it if you hadn't asked. Are you sure I need a doctor's note for a pet? This is all very… exhausting.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand your frustration. It does seem a bit excessive. However, the nurse’s concern was valid, given your history and the potential for allergic reactions. To be thorough, I’d like to listen to your lungs quickly, just to make sure everything sounds clear. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to listen to my lungs? After all this questioning? Honestly, Doctor, it feels rather… presumptuous. But… fine. Go ahead. Just please be quick about it. And try not to make it too cold. I don’t like cold stethoscopes. Honestly, it sends shivers down my spine. Just get it over with. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a nice deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Good. Your breathing sounds mostly clear, but I do hear some mild wheezing in your lower lobes. It's very subtle, but it's there. This, combined with your history, does suggest a sensitivity to allergens.
PATIENT: Wheezing? Now you hear wheezing? After I told you I didn't have any? Honestly, this is ridiculous. It must be something you're hearing, not me. I told you I feel perfectly fine. This is all very… accusatory, frankly. I don't appreciate being made to feel ill when I'm not. Honestly, I'm starting to think I should have just gone to another doctor. Just give me the letter. I'm sure a little bit of dander won't hurt me. Honestly, pets are good for the soul.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I’m not trying to make you feel ill. I’m simply trying to be thorough and ensure your health. Given your history and the mild wheezing I'm hearing, I’m hesitant to provide a blanket statement confirming you’re able to safely care for a pet without further investigation. A pet dander allergy can trigger asthma symptoms, even if they're mild, and we want to avoid that. I can write a letter stating you’ve been evaluated and do not currently exhibit severe respiratory distress, but I strongly recommend a pulmonary function test to assess your lung capacity and a possible allergy test to determine specific sensitivities. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Oh, now there’s a test? Honestly, this is getting out of hand. Pulmonary function test? Allergy test? For a pet? It’s utterly absurd. I’m not spending my afternoon in a doctor’s office getting poked and prodded. I just want the letter. You said you’d write a letter saying I don’t have “severe respiratory distress”. Is that enough? Honestly, I don’t even know what that means, but if it gets me my pet, fine. Just write the letter. I’m not dealing with any more tests. Honestly, it's all a bit much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wrye. Here’s the letter stating you do not currently exhibit severe respiratory distress. However, please be aware that this is based on today’s evaluation. If you experience any new or worsening respiratory symptoms after getting your pet, please consult with your primary care physician immediately. I’ve documented my concerns and recommendations in your chart. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Finally. Thank you, Doctor. Honestly, it took long enough. I hope this is enough. I really don’t want to come back here again. Good day.
