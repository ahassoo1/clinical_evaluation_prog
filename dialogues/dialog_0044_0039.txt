DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, I got a letter... said my cholesterol was a bit high. Seems important, so I figured I’d best get it checked out. I don’t really know much about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s very good of you to come in. It is important to keep an eye on cholesterol. Don’t worry about not knowing much about it – that's what I'm here for. We’ll get it sorted out. First, let's talk a little about what you’ve been experiencing. Have you noticed any symptoms that have made you concerned, or is this just something flagged on a routine test?
PATIENT: Routine test, mostly. I get one every year, through the… the senior center, you know? Never had any trouble before. I don’t feel any different, if that makes sense. No chest pains or anything like that. Just… a letter saying I should come see someone. I’m usually pretty good with keeping track of these things, but this cholesterol… it’s new territory.
DOCTOR: That's good to know you're proactive with your annual check-ups, Mr. Bohnett. And it's perfectly normal to feel fine even with elevated cholesterol – often there are no symptoms until something more serious develops. So, just to clarify, this is the first time you've been told your cholesterol is high, despite yearly tests?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. First time. Always came back normal before. Old Dr. Peterson, he always said I was as healthy as an ox… well, maybe not an ox, but you get the idea. He retired last year, so I’ve been seeing different folks at the center. Maybe they’re just… more careful now? Or maybe my numbers really are different this time around. I eat pretty well, I think. Lots of fish, some red meat now and then, but nothing too crazy.
DOCTOR: It’s possible the new doctor is just being more thorough, or it could very well be a change in your numbers. It's good you’ve been consistent with yearly tests; that gives us a good baseline. Let's go over your medical history a little more thoroughly, just to be sure. Do you have any other health conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never been told I had either one. I had a bit of trouble with arthritis in my knees a few years back, but that’s about it. The doctor gave me some cream for it, and it’s mostly under control now. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty lucky, knock on wood. Used to be a pretty active fella, but slowin’ down a bit these days, naturally.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you've been generally healthy, Mr. Bohnett. And it's common to slow down as we get older. Arthritis is something many people experience. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, maybe ten years old. That was a long time ago! And… oh, I broke my wrist when I was tryin’ to fix the roof of the shed. That was probably thirty years ago. Apart from that, no. Never had any major problems that needed a hospital stay. Just the usual colds and flu, but nothing serious enough to get admitted. Does that count? The flu?
DOCTOR: No, the occasional cold or flu doesn’t count, Mr. Bohnett. That’s perfectly normal. So, appendix as a child and a broken wrist… good to know. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother, she lived to be 92, very healthy woman. Never smoked, hardly drank. Dad… he passed away when he was 78, heart trouble, I think. But he smoked a pack a day for fifty years, so it wasn’t a surprise, really. My brother, he’s still alive, lives in Florida. He’s got high blood pressure, but he’s not very good about takin’ care of himself. Stubborn as a mule, that one. And that’s about it, I think. Not much heart trouble on my mother’s side.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, father with heart trouble related to smoking, brother with high blood pressure… and a healthy mother. Now, I’m going to ask about a few lifestyle factors. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother wouldn't allow it. Always said it was a terrible habit, and she was right, of course. I did spend enough time around my father, though. Didn’t like the smell of it, even then. Never understood what folks saw in it.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Bohnett. Avoiding smoking is one of the best things you can do for your health. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Well, I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner now and then. Usually just one, maybe two on a special occasion. Nothing excessive, you understand. It helps me relax, and the doctor always said a little bit was good for the heart. Red wine, of course. Don’t go for the white stuff. Not a big drinker, never have been. Don’t have a head for it, really.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Mr. Bohnett. A glass or two of red wine occasionally is unlikely to be a concern. Now, let’s talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the arthritis cream, like I said. And… let me think. Oh, I take a multivitamin every day. The lady at the senior center recommended it. Said it would help keep me goin’. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I’ll take one of those over-the-counter sleep aids, the kind with melatonin. But not very often, maybe once a month. That's about it, I think. Pretty simple, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis cream, a daily multivitamin, and occasional melatonin for sleep. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to help my mother with her gardening, and she grew all sorts of things. Never had any trouble with pollen or anything like that. I remember one time, when I was a little boy, I ate a whole bunch of wild berries, and my tongue turned purple! But I didn't have any other problems, just a funny-looking tongue for a day or two. Not an allergy, I suppose. Just a bit of mischief.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a bit of childhood adventure! And no, a purple tongue doesn't sound like an allergy. Okay, Mr. Bohnett, that gives me a good picture of your overall health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that’s fine. Go right ahead. I figured you’d want to poke around a bit. Always did trust doctors to know what they were doin’. Just let me know if it’s gonna be uncomfortable. I’m an old fella, bones ain’t what they used to be!
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your throat and ears. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 88. Not critically high, but something we’ll want to keep an eye on. Pulse is 72, regular. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but there is some diminished breath sound on the bases. I’m going to have you take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again… good. That's not concerning at this point, but we should watch for any changes. Throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. Ears are also clear. Alright, everything sounds and looks reasonably good, Mr. Bohnett. But the elevated blood pressure and diminished breath sounds are things we need to investigate further. Do you ever experience any shortness of breath or chest tightness?
PATIENT: No, sir, not really. I get a little winded sometimes, climbin’ the stairs, but that’s just old age, I reckon. And I’ve always had a bit of a cough in the mornin’, especially in the winter. Nothing too serious, just a tickle in my throat. Never kept me up at night or anything like that. Maybe the winter air gets to me, it’s awfully dry these days. But no chest tightness or anything like that, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. So, morning cough, some shortness of breath with exertion… We’ll want to rule out anything serious. Now, I'd like to order a few blood tests to check your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and blood sugar. I’m also going to order a chest X-ray, just to get a better look at your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Blood tests and an X-ray, you say? No problem. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for them? Fasting or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Yes, for the blood tests, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except for water. The X-ray doesn’t require any preparation. I'll have the lab and radiology staff send over some instructions with the details. They’ll call you to schedule the tests. Once we have the results back, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend a heart-healthy diet, low in saturated and trans fats and cholesterol, and regular, moderate exercise, as tolerated. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, sir, I think I understand. Healthy diet and exercise… pretty much what I figured. I used to walk a lot more, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. Maybe I can start with some gentle stretching. And I’ll try to cut back on the red meat a little bit. My wife used to make a mean pot roast, though… she's been gone a few years now, but I still miss her cookin’. But I understand. Healthy diet. I can do that. Do you think I should be worried about this cholesterol stuff? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Bohnett, and I’m sorry to hear about your wife. It’s perfectly natural to be worried when you hear something like this. High cholesterol can be serious if left untreated, but it’s also very manageable. It increases your risk of heart disease and stroke, but with a healthy lifestyle and, if needed, medication, we can reduce that risk significantly. The tests will give us a clearer picture of your cholesterol levels and overall health, and then we can decide on the best course of action. It’s important not to panic, but to be proactive. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it for now, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything so clearly. It’s good to know it’s manageable. And I’ll try to stay positive. I’ve faced tougher things in my life, I reckon. I guess I’ll wait for those phone calls about the tests. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. You've always faced challenges with strength, and I'm confident you'll do well with this too. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your tests. Here’s a brochure on heart-healthy eating, just as a reminder. And again, it was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and we'll talk soon.
