DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Aye, lovely to meet you too. Well, it’s this nausea, see? Been happening most mornings now. Not a good start to the day, I can tell you that much. And the nurse mentioned somethin’ about my heart… is that connected, d’ye think?
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea most mornings. And you're concerned about a possible connection to your heart, which the nurse mentioned. I understand. Let’s start with the nausea. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Aye, right. Well, it's not… violent, if you know what I mean. Not like chuckin’ up, thankfully. More like… a queasy feelin’. Starts usually not long after I get up. Before I’ve even had breakfast, sometimes. And it lingers, you know? An hour or two, then it fades. But it’s enough to ruin me appetite, and I need to eat, see? It's been gettin’ worse the last couple o' weeks, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a queasy feeling, not vomiting, that starts shortly after waking up, often before breakfast. It lasts about an hour or two and is worsening over the past couple of weeks, impacting your appetite. That's helpful. Now, has anything specific made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not that I’ve noticed, really. I've tried havin’ a wee biscuit before gettin' up, just in case it was somethin’ to do with an empty stomach. Didn’t seem to make a difference. And I’ve tried different things for breakfast, too – porridge, toast, even just a piece o’ fruit. Still the same. Actually… I think it’s a bit worse if I lie flat for too long. If I get up and potter about a bit, it seems to settle quicker. Maybe? It’s hard to be sure, mind you.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a biscuit before getting up didn't help, and different breakfasts haven't changed things. It might be worse if you lie flat for too long, and getting up and moving around seems to help a bit. Let's move on to that mention of your heart. Do you know why the nurse brought that up?
PATIENT: Aye, well, she said somethin' about heart failure. I was diagnosed a few years back, now. Not the most cheerful diagnosis, is it? I’ve been seein’ a specialist, havin’ regular check-ups, takin’ the medication they prescribed. I thought I was doin’ alright, honestly. That’s why I was a bit taken aback when she mentioned it. Could this nausea be somethin’ to do with that, d’ye think? Is it… gettin’ worse?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you were diagnosed with heart failure a few years ago and have been under the care of a specialist, taking medication as prescribed. You’re understandably concerned about a possible connection between the nausea and your heart condition, especially if things might be worsening. Yes, it’s absolutely possible the nausea is related to your heart failure. Nausea can be a symptom of worsening heart failure, as it can indicate reduced blood flow to the digestive system, or fluid build-up. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me what medications you are currently taking for your heart?
PATIENT: Aye, I can do that. Let me think… Right, I’ve got… Lisinopril, that’s for blood pressure, I believe. Then there’s Digoxin, a wee tablet for the heart rhythm. And Furosemide, that’s a water tablet, to get rid of the fluid. Oh, and somethin’ for the cholesterol, Atorvastatin, I think it’s called. I take them all every morning, same time. Does that sound right, d’ye think? I usually just ask the pharmacist to keep me stocked up, but I can get the list if you need it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful. Lisinopril, Digoxin, Furosemide, and Atorvastatin – all commonly used medications for heart failure. Now, besides those medications, are you taking anything else at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, I do take somethin’ for my arthritis. It's Naproxen, an anti-inflammatory. Just when my joints are playin’ up, mind you. Not every day. And I take a multivitamin, just a general one, for a bit o’ extra health. That’s it, I think. Definitely nothin’ else. I'm not one for faddish remedies or anything like that. Just the basics, see?
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen for arthritis when needed, and a multivitamin. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk about your appetite. You mentioned the nausea is ruining it. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the nausea?
PATIENT: Aye, right. Well, I’ve not been feelin’ as energetic as I used to, I must admit. A bit more tired, you know? And I’ve been a bit short o’ breath, even with just walkin’ about the house. It’s not terrible, but I’m definitely not able to manage as much as I used to. I thought it was just gettin’ old, to be honest, but now I'm wonderin’ if it's somethin’ more serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've noticed fatigue and shortness of breath, even with light activity, in addition to the nausea. Those are symptoms that can be associated with worsening heart failure. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel for any swelling in your legs and ankles. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’ve no objections at all. I’m used to bein’ poked and prodded, see? Been to the specialist often enough. Just let me know if it’s gonna be cold or anything like that. I get a bit chilly easily these days.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll make sure everything is comfortable. Okay, I'm listening to your heart now. I hear a slightly irregular rhythm, and there’s a bit of a murmur. That’s not necessarily concerning on its own, given your history of heart failure, but it's something we’ll need to investigate further. Your lungs sound a little congested, with some crackling noises, especially at the base. This could indicate some fluid build-up. Your blood pressure is 140/90, which is a little elevated. And I do notice some mild swelling in your ankles, which is also consistent with fluid retention. Okay, based on the exam, there are some findings that suggest your heart failure may be worsening. The irregular rhythm, lung congestion, elevated blood pressure, and ankle swelling all point in that direction. To confirm this, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will help us assess your kidney function, check your electrolyte levels, and measure a protein called BNP, which is elevated in heart failure. I’d also like to get an EKG to look at your heart's electrical activity in more detail, and a chest X-ray to see how much fluid is in your lungs. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Aye, that all sounds very thorough, Doctor. I'm happy to have the tests done, if that's what ye think is best. I trust your judgement. The more information the better, I suppose. I'd rather know what's goin' on, even if it's not good news. When can I get these tests done? And will I need to come back here, or can I do them somewhere else?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I agree, the more information, the better. We can get these tests done right here at the clinic. The nurse will draw your blood now, and we can get the EKG and chest X-ray done within the next hour. We’ll get the results back within a few days, and I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with you. In the meantime, it's important to follow a low-sodium diet and limit your fluid intake to about 2 liters per day. It's also important to weigh yourself every day and let us know if you notice any sudden weight gain. Do you have any questions about that, or about anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Aye, two litres… that might be tricky. I do enjoy a good cup o’ tea! But I can try, aye, I can try. I’ll get one o’ those bottles wi’ the markings on it, to keep track. And I do have scales, so I can weigh myself every day. Hmm… Is there anything I should be lookin’ out for, besides the weight gain? Anything that would mean I need to get in touch sooner? I'm not wantin' to worry needlessly, but it's good to be prepared. And thanks for explainin' everything so clearly, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease a bit, even if it’s just a wee bit.
DOCTOR: I'm glad I could offer some reassurance. Besides weight gain, you should be aware of any worsening shortness of breath, especially when lying down or at night. Also, look out for any new or increased swelling in your legs or ankles, or any chest pain or palpitations. If you experience any of those symptoms, please contact us immediately. We’ll get those tests done now and schedule that follow-up appointment. The nurse will explain the process. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor, and I appreciate it. Just let me get those tests done, and I’ll see what the results say. I’m in your hands, see? Thank you again for your time and attention. I'll go and find the nurse now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Benic. I'm glad I could help. And please, don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns at all. The nurse will be right with you. Take care, and we’ll see you soon.
