DOCTOR: Good morning, Janie. Welcome. I’m Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. It's… nice to meet you too, I guess. Um, well, it's this tiredness. Just… always tired. I don't really know what else to tell you. It's been going on for… a long time, now. Honestly, I can't even remember when it started. It's just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, "always tired," and it's been going on for a while… that’s a good place to start. It’s common for things to creep up on us, and the timing gets fuzzy. When you say "tired," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Ugh, it's hard to explain. It's not like I just need more sleep, though I do sleep. It's… everything feels heavy. Like I'm walking through mud, you know? And I have no energy to do… anything, really. Even things I used to enjoy. It's just… draining. I don't know if that makes sense. It’s… just being is tiring. Honestly, I just want to sit. All the time.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Janie. "Heavy" and "draining" – those are good words to describe it. And wanting to sit all the time… that sounds very telling. Okay. So, it's not just a matter of getting enough hours of sleep, it's a deeper fatigue. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tiredness?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me think. My bones ache, sometimes. Not all the time, but… yeah, aches. And… I get headaches. Dull ones, mostly. Not the really bad kind, just… there. And I… I forget things. A lot. More than usual, I mean. Though, I’ve always been a bit forgetful, to be honest. Is that… helpful? I don't know what's normal anymore.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Janie. Very helpful. Aches, headaches, and increased forgetfulness… all things we should explore. It sounds like it's definitely more than just feeling a bit run-down. Now, when you say the aches, where specifically are you feeling those?
PATIENT: Oh, um… everywhere, I guess. Mostly in my back and my knees. And my shoulders. It's hard to pinpoint. It’s not like a sharp pain, just… a dull ache, like I’ve been working too hard. Which… I haven’t, really. That’s the thing! I mostly just… sit. It's just there when I move, or even sometimes when I don't. It's… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generalized aches, primarily in your back, knees, and shoulders. And they’re present even at rest, sometimes. That gives us some more to work with. Now, thinking about your past medical history – have you been diagnosed with any conditions before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had… arthritis, I think? Years ago. In my hands, mostly. But it wasn't bad. They gave me some pills for it, and it… went away. Or maybe it just stopped bothering me. And… I had high blood pressure, at one point. But I'm on medication for that now. Does that matter? I take it every day.
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely matters, Janie, thank you for telling me. Both the past arthritis and the high blood pressure are important pieces of the puzzle. And good on you for staying on top of your blood pressure medication. What medication are you currently taking for that, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Um… let me see… It’s… lisinopril, I think? Yes, lisinopril. 20 milligrams, once a day. And… that’s it, really. I don’t take much else. Just that, and a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said I was low. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. I just… take what they tell me to take.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril 20mg daily for blood pressure, and a vitamin D supplement. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, or anything else that's been common?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… My mother had… heart problems, I think. She had to have a pacemaker, years ago. And my father… he had arthritis, really bad. He was in a wheelchair for the last few years of his life. And… my sister has diabetes. Type 2, I think? Is that… helpful? It feels like everyone has something, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Janie, thank you. Heart problems in your mother, arthritis in your father, and diabetes in your sister – that gives us a clearer picture. And you’re right, it often feels like everyone has something. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. How is your appetite?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… it's not very good, to be honest. I don't really feel hungry much anymore. I eat… because I know I should, but it's not enjoyable. Everything tastes… bland. I used to love cooking, but now it just feels like a chore. I mostly just have… soup, or toast. Something easy. I’ve lost some weight, I think, but I haven’t really been weighing myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite, food tasting bland, and some unintentional weight loss. That's all important information, Janie. And now, finally, regarding your social history… Are you currently working?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, sort of. I’m a pharmacy technician. It’s… not very stressful, thankfully. Mostly just filling prescriptions, and helping people at the counter. I mostly stand, but I take breaks when I need to. I've been doing it for… a long time, now. It keeps me busy, I guess. But… honestly, I’m starting to think I need to retire.
DOCTOR: Okay, pharmacy technician, mostly standing with breaks, and considering retirement… thank you, Janie. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and feeling your joints. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go ahead. It's… probably just old age, anyway. But… I guess it can’t hurt. Just… try not to take too long, okay? I have a… a thing I need to do later.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a few moments. Heart sounds are… regular, but a little bit muffled. Lungs are clear, I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but not significantly. Now, let’s just check your joints… There’s a little tenderness in your knees and shoulders, but no swelling or redness. And I feel a slight warmth in those joints as well. Okay, that’s all for now. Everything seems… within normal limits, but the diminished reflexes, tenderness, and warmth in your joints, along with your fatigue and other symptoms, are things we need to investigate further. I want to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level, just to rule out anything obvious. Also, let’s get an X-ray of your knees and shoulders to check for any arthritis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best. I just… want to feel better. I'm just tired of feeling like this. When can I expect the results? And… will this take long? I really don't want to have to come back here too many times.
DOCTOR: I understand, Janie. It’s perfectly reasonable to want answers and to avoid unnecessary trips. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back, and the X-ray results should be available within a day or two. Once I have those, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like a fever, severe pain, or difficulty breathing – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Now, while we wait for the results, I'm going to recommend you continue taking your lisinopril as prescribed, and continue the vitamin D supplement. We can also discuss some strategies for managing your fatigue, like gentle exercise and getting enough rest. Would you like to talk about that now, or would you prefer to wait until we have the results?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think I just want to get the results first. I don't want to change anything right now, just in case. I just… want to know what's wrong. And then… we can figure it out. I appreciate you trying to help, though.
DOCTOR: Of course, Janie. That’s perfectly understandable. We’ll take it one step at a time. I’ll make sure someone contacts you as soon as the results are available. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and I look forward to speaking with you again soon.
