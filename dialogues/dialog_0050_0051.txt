DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor… Paraskevopoulos, is it? Yes, lovely name. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me see… it’s about my blood, I think. My daughter, bless her heart, she said I should find out what type I am. Something about… in case of emergencies? I don’t rightly remember all the details. It's been a long time since she told me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s always prudent to be aware of one’s blood type, particularly as we get older. It can be helpful in emergency situations, as you mentioned. Your daughter is quite thoughtful to suggest that. To clarify, are you experiencing any symptoms currently that led you to think about your blood type, or is this solely a preventative measure at your daughter’s urging?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no symptoms at all, Doctor. Perfectly fine, for an old woman, that is! Just… my daughter. She worries, you see. Always has. She said it was just a good thing to know. She's a very practical girl, that one. I don’t feel any different, though. Never have. Do you need me to… fill out a form or something?
DOCTOR: No, no forms are necessary at this time. It’s quite alright. We can proceed with a simple blood test to determine your blood type. It’s a standard procedure. Before we do that, though, allow me to ask a few routine questions, just to get a complete picture of your overall health. Have you ever had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Significant problems… that’s a good question. Well, I’ve had the usual aches and pains, you know, for someone my age. A bit of arthritis in the hands, mostly. And… I had my gallbladder out, years and years ago. That was… somewhere in the eighties, I think? And a bad bout of the flu once, but everyone gets the flu, don’t they? I can't recall anything major, if that's what you mean. It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Arthritis and gallbladder removal. Thank you for letting me know. Do you currently take any medications for your arthritis, or any other condition?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Let me see… I have these little pills for the arthritis. Yellow ones. And… sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take something stronger, but I only take it when I really need to. I don't recall the names of either one, I'm afraid. My daughter usually handles refilling them. She has a chart at home, I think. It's all very organized. She's a good girl. I believe the yellow ones are… twice a day? Yes, twice a day.
DOCTOR: And besides those medications, do you have any allergies to anything – medications, food, environmental factors, anything at all?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. I've always been quite lucky that way. I eat everything, practically! Though… I do get a bit of a tickle in my throat sometimes when I smell strong perfume. But that’s just a sensitivity, I don't think it's a true allergy. My mother was allergic to bee stings, terribly so, but I’ve never been stung, thankfully. So, no, I don’t think I have any allergies to speak of. Not really.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, let’s briefly discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family—heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… that’s a tricky one. My family… well, they lived a long time, mostly. My grandfather, he lived to be ninety-five! But… I don't recall anyone having anything serious. My aunt, she had a touch of high blood pressure, I think. And my uncle… he had trouble with his heart later in life, but he smoked like a chimney, so that's hardly surprising, is it? Cancer… I think there was a cousin, somewhere down the line, but it was a long time ago. Honestly, I’m not very good at remembering those sorts of things. They didn’t talk about illnesses much when I was growing up. It was considered… impolite, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s perfectly alright. Now, regarding your lifestyle… do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never! I've always detested smoking. Dreadful habit, if you ask me. My husband, God rest his soul, he tried it once, years ago, but he didn't care for it. It made him cough something awful. No, I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And I don’t drink much either, just a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally, if I’m feeling festive. Nothing more. I always thought moderation was the key to a long life, you see.
DOCTOR: And finally, Ms. Nini, do you have any questions for me at this point before we proceed with a quick physical exam and the blood test?
PATIENT: Hmm… a physical exam? Oh dear. Well, no, not really. I suppose I trust your judgement, Doctor. You seem a very sensible young man. Just… will the blood test hurt much? I’ve always been a bit squeamish around needles, you see. And how long will it take to get the results? I have a bridge game on Thursday, and I wouldn’t want to miss it!
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Nini. The blood test will be very quick, and the discomfort is minimal—just a brief pinch. It's over before you know it. As for the results, we typically get them back within 24 to 48 hours, so well before your bridge game on Thursday. Now, if you’ll allow me, I’d like to briefly listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just be gentle with the needle, if you don’t mind. And thank you for being so patient with my… forgetfulness. It's a terrible thing, getting old. But, yes, please, listen to my heart and lungs. Whatever you need. I trust you completely.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just take a deep breath for me… Heart sounds are normal with a mild murmur, which is not uncommon at your age. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not significantly so. Now, let's proceed with the blood test. We’ll just need a small sample from your arm. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, a mild murmur? Is that bad, Doctor? My husband always had a strong heart, he used to say. But, yes, please, go ahead with the blood test. The sooner it's over, the better, wouldn't you say? I'll try not to flinch. Just… tell me when you’re about to poke me, if you would be so kind. And thank you again for your patience. It's a blessing to find a doctor who takes the time to listen.
DOCTOR: The murmur is quite mild, Ms. Nini, and doesn't necessarily indicate a problem. We’ll monitor it, but it's likely nothing to be concerned about at this time. Now, if you'll just extend your arm… I’ll clean the area with an alcohol swab, and then you'll feel a quick pinch. I'll warn you before I insert the needle. Alright, here we go… just a little pinch. There we are, all done. Excellent. Now, let's wait a few minutes and I'll prepare the request to the lab. You might feel a slight soreness at the puncture site later, but it should resolve quickly.
PATIENT: Oh! That wasn’t so bad, was it? A little prick, yes, but nothing to write home about. Thank you, Doctor. You were very gentle. Now, about those results… will you call me if something is wrong? I worry, you see. And do you think my daughter will be pleased I finally got this done? She’s been nagging me about it for months!
DOCTOR: I'm glad it wasn’t too unpleasant, Ms. Nini. And yes, absolutely. We will certainly call you immediately if the results indicate anything concerning. Otherwise, you can expect a call from the office in a day or two to let you know they are available. And I'm sure your daughter will be very pleased that you've taken care of this. It’s always good to have that peace of mind. Now, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. You’ve been so kind and patient with me. Honestly, I don’t know what I would have done without you. Thank you again for everything. And please, take care of yourself. It’s a hard job, being a doctor, you know. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must be going. I have a bridge game to prepare for!
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Ms. Nini. I'm glad I could help. And thank you for your kind words. Please, don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your bridge game! It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: Oh, you as well, Doctor. Goodbye now!
