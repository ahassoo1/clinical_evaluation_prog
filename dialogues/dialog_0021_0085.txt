DOCTOR: Alright, Gabbrielle, nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… it’s my skin. It’s been looking rather… off, lately. Not a good off, mind you. I noticed it a few weeks ago, and it hasn’t gotten any better. It’s just… patchy. Different shades where it shouldn’t be.
DOCTOR: Patchy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, patchy. Honestly, it’s quite alarming. I’ve always taken very good care of my skin, you understand. Good soaps, always moisturizer… it’s not like I’ve been neglecting it. It’s just… appearing. Like someone took a brush and decided to… experiment. It’s mostly on my arms and a bit on my face, though thankfully not too noticeable there.
DOCTOR: Alright, "patchy discoloration on arms and face." And you said this started a few weeks ago?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately three weeks, give or take a few days. It wasn’t sudden, you understand. It sort of… crept in. I initially dismissed it as perhaps the lighting, or a trick of the eye, but it’s definitely… progressed. It's not something one simply ignores, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it isn’t. Now, have you noticed any itching, burning, or pain associated with these patches?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. Thankfully. It’s purely a visual… unpleasantness. No discomfort whatsoever. Which, frankly, is the only reason I haven’t rushed in sooner. I don’t bother doctors with things that don’t hurt, you know? There are people with real problems. But it is becoming rather… distracting. And my husband keeps looking at me oddly.
DOCTOR: Distracting, and your husband’s concern… right. Now, have you started using any new soaps, lotions, detergents, or anything else recently?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. Absolutely not. I’ve been using the same products for years. Lavender soap, a simple moisturizer… the usual. I’m not one for experimentation, you see. Stability is key, in all things. I wouldn’t just start using something new and then expect my skin to… behave this way. It's quite illogical, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, quite. Have you been exposed to anything unusual lately?
PATIENT: Unusual? What do you mean, “unusual”? I’ve been gardening, mostly. And visiting my sister. She lives in the next town over. Perfectly normal activities. I haven’t been… scaling mountains or wrestling alligators, if that’s what you’re implying. Honestly, I find the question rather… vague.
DOCTOR: Right. Gardening… and visiting your sister. Any new plants in the garden?
PATIENT: Well, yes, actually. I did plant some new sunflowers. A rather lovely variety, quite tall. And I believe my sister has a new rose bush, a very vibrant red. But I hardly think flowers could be the cause of this… this discoloration. That sounds rather… fanciful, doesn't it? I handle plants all the time, I've never had an issue. It's just a bit… ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Sunflowers… and roses. Alright. Let’s have a look at your arms, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But I assure you, it’s probably nothing. Just a… temporary anomaly. Still, I suppose it doesn't hurt to be examined. There you are. Do be gentle, my skin is rather delicate.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see the areas of hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation. It’s…irregularly distributed. Not a uniform pattern. It's not raised or scaly, is it?
PATIENT: Hypo… what now? Oh, you mean the different shades. No, it’s not raised or scaly. Perfectly smooth, really. Just… uneven. It’s rather… distracting, as I said. It looks like someone took a paintbrush and decided to… dabble. And it's spreading, I think. A tiny bit on my hands now. Honestly, it’s quite upsetting. You’re not seeing anything serious, are you? Because I really don't have time for… complications.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't feel like anything serious at this point. But we need to rule things out. And by "rule things out," I mean I'd like to order a few blood tests, just to be thorough. It’s likely nothing, but it's best to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and a basic metabolic panel. We can also do a skin scraping just to rule out any fungal infection. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests. Well, that’s… inconvenient. And a skin scraping? Honestly, it sounds rather… unpleasant. I suppose, if you insist. But I do hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a luncheon scheduled for next week, and I really can’t afford to be… unwell. What sort of vitamin levels are you looking for, exactly? And is there any chance this could be… contagious? I really wouldn't want to alarm my sister.
DOCTOR: We'll check your B12, Vitamin D, and iron levels. As for contagiousness, it's highly unlikely given what I'm seeing, but we need to confirm. The blood tests and scraping will help us determine that. It’s a standard procedure, shouldn’t take long. I'll have the nurse draw the blood and do the scraping now. It's just a quick sample. Then we'll get the results back in a few days and go from there. Do you have any allergies to latex or any bleeding disorders?
PATIENT: Oh, latex… I believe I had a slight reaction once, years ago. A small rash, nothing dramatic. And no, no bleeding disorders. My husband is a doctor, you see. He would have mentioned it. He’s very thorough. Though, honestly, he dismissed this whole thing as a bit of sun exposure. Men. Very dismissive, generally. So, a small rash from latex, that's all. And… quickly, you say? I do dislike needles. And scrapes. It all sounds rather… barbaric.
DOCTOR: Alright, we'll make sure to use latex-free gloves. The nurse is very experienced and will make it as quick and painless as possible. It's just a standard precaution. I’ll let her know about the allergy and she'll be right in to get started. Once she’s finished, we can discuss the results and plan accordingly. Do you have any other concerns or questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: Well… will this leave a mark? I have a rather important garden club meeting next month, and I really can’t have a bandage visible. And what if it is something serious? What sort of serious things are we talking about? I really don't have the time for… complications, as I’ve said. And what if I need… medication? I’m very particular about what I put into my body. Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite anxious about this. A simple rash, that's all it was, until now.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's take things one step at a time. The skin scraping is very superficial, it shouldn’t leave a mark. As for serious things, it’s unlikely to be anything serious. We're checking for common causes. Things like fungal infections, vitamin deficiencies, or rarely, autoimmune conditions. As for medication, we won't discuss that until we have the results. It’s far too early for that. For now, let’s just focus on getting the tests done. I'll be right back, and the nurse will be in shortly. Try to relax. It's likely nothing to worry about.
