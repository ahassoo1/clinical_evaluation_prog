DOCTOR: Good morning, Gedalya. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for having me. Well, it’s… it’s a bit hard to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re starting to droop. It’s been getting worse over the past few months, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness and drooping eyelids… getting worse over a few months. Can you tell me a little more about the weakness?
PATIENT: It’s not like… a sudden thing. It’s more like… tasks just take more effort. Like, carrying groceries, or even just… holding my arms up for a while. Things I used to do without thinking. And it feels… different depending on the time of day, if that makes sense. Worse in the evenings, usually.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. So, it's a gradual weakness, more effort for everyday tasks, and it fluctuates… worse in the evenings. Do you notice it affecting anything specific – like walking, or your hands, or your face?
PATIENT: Hm… I think my hands are the worst of it, actually. It’s hard to… grip things tightly. And sometimes my speech feels a little… slurred, but I’m not sure if that’s just me being tired. Walking is okay, I haven't noticed any problems with that yet. But definitely my hands. And, like I said, the eyelids. They're really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Hand weakness, fluctuating speech, and the drooping eyelids… that’s helpful. Now, let's try to get a little more history. Have you had any fever, any double vision, any difficulty swallowing, or any changes in your skin rash or anything like that?
PATIENT: No fever, no. And no double vision, thankfully. Swallowing is… okay. I haven’t noticed any problems with that, no. Skin rash? No, nothing like that. I haven't had a rash in… well, I can’t remember the last time I had a rash, actually. Is that… is that important?
DOCTOR: It's good you haven't had any of those symptoms. And no, it's not necessarily important, just trying to rule things out. Okay. And have you noticed anything else at all, even if it seems small?
PATIENT: Hm… well, I’ve been feeling more tired than usual, I suppose. But honestly, who isn’t tired these days? And… I think my appetite has been a little lower, but again, could be stress. I got divorced about a year ago, and things have been a bit… unsettled since then. Does that… does that sound relevant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is relevant. Stress and major life changes can certainly affect your health. Okay. Let’s talk a bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, or heart problems, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty healthy, honestly. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing. But nothing serious. I haven't been to a doctor in… probably five years, if that tells you anything. Just for check-ups. Nothing major. I don’t really… enjoy going to the doctor, if I’m being honest. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. Many people feel that way. Okay, good to know. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any reason for them, thankfully. I broke my arm when I was a child, but it healed fine with a cast. That's it, really. Nothing else. I hope this is helpful? I’m trying to think of everything. I just… I want to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful. It sounds like a pretty straightforward medical history, which is good. Now, let's talk about your family. Any significant medical problems in your family?
PATIENT: Hm… that’s a good question. My mother had… arthritis, I think? In her hands. It was pretty bad towards the end. And my father… he had high blood pressure, I believe. He passed away a few years ago. I don't really know much about their medical histories beyond that, to be honest. We weren’t very close. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Arthritis and high blood pressure. Okay. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean? Do you want to know about… my hobbies? I work as a facilities manager, so I'm mostly busy with that. I don't really have much time for hobbies, sadly. I used to enjoy hiking, but I haven’t done that in ages. I live alone now, since the divorce. I don't drink or smoke, if that's what you mean.
DOCTOR: No, that's all very good to know. I was just asking about lifestyle factors. No drinking or smoking is excellent. Now, one last question about your history - do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I haven't taken much medication over the years, to be honest. Just the occasional painkiller for a headache. I haven't had any issues with those, either. Is that everything? I hope I haven’t forgotten anything. I’m starting to get a little worried now, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: No, that’s a very thorough history, Gedalya. You haven’t forgotten anything important. I think we have a good starting point now. I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s causing this weakness. I’m a little worried about it, as you know. So yes, please, go ahead with the exam. Where would you like me to start?
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just have a seat here on the table, that would be great. I'm going to start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll do a neurological exam to assess your reflexes, strength, and coordination. And I'll take a look at your eyes, ears, nose, and throat. It won't take long. First, let’s just get your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Alright. Blood pressure sounds good. Let me know if it’s uncomfortable. I'm a little nervous, Doctor, but I'll try to cooperate as best I can. This is just… a little unsettling, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to be nervous, Gedalya. I'll do my best to make you comfortable. Now, just try to relax your arm. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, which is a little elevated but not overly concerning. Pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is normal at 98.6. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, let me just take a look at your eyes. Can you follow my finger?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I can follow your finger. Is everything alright? They feel a little dry, actually. I’ve been staring at a computer screen all day, so that's probably it. Do you see anything unusual?
DOCTOR: Pupils are equal and reactive to light. I do notice some mild dryness, as you mentioned, but nothing else concerning at this time. Throat looks clear. No signs of infection. Now, I’m going to ask you to open your mouth and say "Ah." Okay, good. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Knees are two-plus bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Alright. I'm squeezing as hard as I can. Is that enough? It feels a little weaker on this side, actually. My left hand feels a little… less strong. Is that what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do notice some slight weakness in your left hand compared to your right. It's subtle, but it's present. Now, let's check your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I think I got it. Is that alright? It feels a little… clumsy, if I’m honest. I haven't been doing much physical activity lately, so that’s probably it. Is that what you’re seeing?
DOCTOR: Yes, there is a slight clumsiness, as you mentioned. Now, one last thing. Can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Okay. I’m walking. Is that alright? It feels a little… strange. Like I need to concentrate more than usual. Is that what you’re looking for? I'm a little worried now, Doctor. This is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Yes, your gait appears normal, but I do notice a slight hesitation. Okay, that’s enough for now. You can sit back down. Alright, Gedalya. Thank you for your cooperation. Now, based on what I’ve seen and heard, there are a few things I want to investigate further. Your symptoms – the weakness, drooping eyelids, fluctuating energy levels – along with the slight weakness in your left hand and some minor coordination issues, suggest a possible neurological issue. It could be a number of things, and I don’t want to jump to conclusions. The most likely possibilities, given your age and symptoms, include Myasthenia Gravis, a neuromuscular disorder, or potentially something affecting your thyroid. But we need to run some tests to confirm. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and an acetylcholine receptor antibody test to help us narrow down the possibilities. We'll also need to get an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural issues. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Myasthenia… what was it? And thyroid? That sounds… serious. MRI? That sounds… frightening. So, you’re saying there’s something wrong with my… nerves? And my brain? Is it… is it serious? Will I… will I be okay? I… I don’t understand. What does all this mean? And what happens next? I just want to know what’s going on. I’m a little scared, Doctor, if I’m honest. Very scared.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Gedalya, and it’s perfectly normal to feel scared. Let me explain things as clearly as possible. Myasthenia Gravis is a chronic autoimmune neuromuscular disease that causes weakness in the skeletal muscles. Your immune system mistakenly attacks the connections between your nerves and muscles, making it difficult to move. It's not always serious, and it can be managed with medication. Thyroid problems can also cause similar symptoms, so we need to rule that out. The MRI is just a scan of your brain to look for any structural issues that might be contributing to your symptoms. It's painless and non-invasive. It doesn’t mean anything is necessarily wrong, it’s just a precaution. Right now, we don’t know exactly what’s causing your symptoms, and that’s why we need to run these tests. Don't jump to conclusions. It could be something minor. What will happen next is that I'll write up the orders for the blood tests and MRI. You’ll need to go to the lab and have your blood drawn. Then, you’ll need to schedule an appointment for the MRI. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. I'll also give you a referral to a neurologist, a specialist in nerve disorders, to get a second opinion. It’s always good to have a specialist involved. Do you have any specific questions about the tests, the neurologist referral, or anything else?
PATIENT: A neurologist… so you think it is something with my nerves? And the tests… how long will it take to get the results? And… what if it is something serious? What kind of treatment is there? Will I… will I be able to work? I’m a facilities manager, Doctor. I need to be able to… to lift things, to fix things. If I can’t do my job… I don’t know what I’ll do. I just… I need to know what’s going to happen. And I need to know if I’ll be okay. I’m really worried about my job, and… and my future.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Gedalya. It’s perfectly natural to worry about your job and your future. Let’s take things one step at a time. Right now, we don't know enough to say definitively what's going on. The tests will give us a clearer picture. The blood tests usually take a few days to come back, and the MRI results may take a bit longer, perhaps a week or so. As for treatment, it depends on the diagnosis. If it is Myasthenia Gravis, there are several effective treatments available, including medications to suppress the immune system and improve muscle function. There are also therapies that can help manage your symptoms. In many cases, people with Myasthenia Gravis are able to continue working, although they may need to make some adjustments to their workload. We’ll discuss all of your options once we have a diagnosis. I want to assure you that you're not alone in this. We’ll work together to figure out what’s going on and develop a plan that works for you. I'll also connect you with resources that can provide support and information. I’m going to write up the orders for the tests now, and I’ll also give you a referral to Dr. Anya Petrova, a neurologist at the regional hospital. She's a very experienced and compassionate doctor. I’ll also give you some information about Myasthenia Gravis, just so you have a better understanding of the condition. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Dr. Petrova… okay. And the information… that would be helpful, thank you. What kind of… adjustments might I need to make at work? Is it… is it possible I might not be able to work at all? I’ve been a facilities manager for ten years. It’s… it’s all I’ve ever done. And… what if it’s not Myasthenia Gravis? What else could it be? Is it… is it something serious? I’m really scared, Doctor. I don’t know what I’ll do if I can’t work, and I’m terrified of being sick.
DOCTOR: It’s okay to be scared, Gedalya. It’s perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed in this situation. Let's address your concerns one at a time. As for adjustments at work, it depends on the severity of the condition. Some people with Myasthenia Gravis can continue working with minimal changes, while others may need to reduce their workload or take more frequent breaks. In some cases, it may be necessary to explore alternative employment options. We’ll discuss all of your options once we have a diagnosis. As for what else it could be, there are several other possibilities. It could be a thyroid problem, as we discussed. It could also be a nerve compression issue, or a different autoimmune disorder. In rare cases, it could be a sign of a more serious underlying condition. But we’re not going to jump to conclusions until we have the test results. I understand your fear of being sick, but it’s important to remember that many conditions are treatable. Even if it is a more serious condition, there are often things we can do to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. I want you to focus on taking things one step at a time. We’ll get the test results, we’ll see Dr. Petrova, and we’ll develop a plan that works for you. You’re not alone in this. I’m here to support you every step of the way. I’m going to write up the orders for the tests now, and I’ll also give you some information about the conditions we’ve discussed, as well as resources for support and information. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for… for being patient with me. And for explaining things. It’s still scary, but… it’s a little less scary than it was. I’ll… I’ll schedule the tests and the appointment with Dr. Petrova. And I’ll… I’ll try to stay positive. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gedalya. Remember, I’m here if you have any questions or concerns. Don't hesitate to reach out. And try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this. Take care, and I'll see you when you have the test results. .
