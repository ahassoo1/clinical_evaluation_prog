DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s get straight to it. Why are you here today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Schneer, yes, that’s me. Hmm… why am I here? Now, that’s a good question. It’s somethin’ about… not hearin’ so well, I reckon. It’s just… things are a bit muffled these days. Can’t quite make out what folks are sayin’ like I used to. It’s been goin’ on for a while now, I suppose. Not sure exactly how long, though.
DOCTOR: “A while now,” is not particularly helpful, Mr. Schneer. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specific… right. Well, let me think. It’s… before the summer, definitely. Before all the nice weather started. Maybe… spring? I was visitin’ my cousin Millie in… oh, what was that town again? Somewhere up north… anyhow, it was before that visit, I think. I was havin’ trouble hearin’ her on the phone then, too. Is that helpful? It’s all a bit blurry, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s see… your records indicate a routine check-up in March of this year with no documented auditory complaints. Now, is this a sudden onset of hearing loss, or has it been a gradual decline?
PATIENT: A gradual decline, I think. Not like somethin’ just popped. It just… faded, slowly. Like turnin’ down the volume on the radio, bit by bit. Though, to be honest, I don’t listen to the radio much anymore. Too much… noise. Is that makin’ any sense? I’m not good at explainin’ things, you see. My memory… it ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Now you mention it… sometimes. A sort of… faint hum, I suppose. Not constant, though. Comes and goes. More when it’s quiet, I think. Like… after I turn the TV off for the night. A little eeeeeee sound. Is that what you mean? It doesn’t bother me too much, just… there.
DOCTOR: And has anyone commented on your speech?
PATIENT: My speech? Oh, now… folks haven’t said much about it, not directly. But my niece, bless her heart, she sometimes asks me to repeat myself. She says I mumble a bit. But she’s always been quick to point things out, that one! But… yes, I suppose I might be speakin’ a little quieter than I used to. I dunno. It’s hard to tell, isn't it? I don’t notice it myself, not usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need to perform a brief audiological exam. Please follow my instructions carefully. I understand your memory isn't perfect, so I will repeat each instruction twice. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Repeatin’ things is always a good idea with me. Go right ahead. I’ll do my best to follow along. I appreciate you bein’ patient with an old fella like me.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm going to place these headphones on your head. I want you to indicate when you hear a tone. Press the button when you clearly hear a sound, and remain silent when you do not. This will help us determine the extent of your hearing loss. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Sounds alright to me, Doctor. Headphones look comfy enough. Yes, I’m ready when you are. Just tell me what to do, and I'll give it a try. Hopefully I won't press the button too much or too little! Don’t worry, I won’t cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: The preliminary results, as you might suspect, indicate a moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss in both ears, particularly at higher frequencies. While this is common for individuals of your age, we need to rule out other potential causes. Have you had any recent head injuries?
PATIENT: Recent head injuries? Oh, goodness, no. Not that I recall. I've always been a careful fella. I mean, I tripped over the rug a few weeks back, but that wasn’t a serious injury. Just a bit of a wobble, really. And I bumped my head on a low doorway once, but that was years ago, when I was still workin’ at the factory. Nothing major, Doctor. I promise. Mostly just… old age, I reckon. That's usually the culprit, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is a possibility. Now, I am going to briefly examine your ears with an otoscope. This will allow me to look inside and identify any potential blockages or infections. Please remain still. …The ear canals are clear, no visible signs of infection or cerumen impaction. The tympanic membranes appear normal. This suggests the hearing loss is likely related to inner ear function.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds good, if it’s all clear. Inner ear… that's the bit that does the hearin’, isn’t it? Like a little radio inside my head? I always did like listenin’ to the old music. Still, I never could afford a fancy set. Always had to make do with what I had. What does this mean, Doctor? Is it somethin’ serious? Will I be able to hear Millie when I visit her again?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schneer, while it's not immediately life-threatening, ignoring hearing loss can lead to social isolation, cognitive decline, and falls. Your situation requires further evaluation by an audiologist, and likely, hearing amplification – a hearing aid. I will provide you with a referral. It’s highly probable a hearing aid will restore a significant portion of your hearing. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Social isolation… I don’t want that. Millie’s the only family I’ve got left, really. Alright, an audiologist then. A fancy ear doctor, eh? And a hearin’ aid… is it big? I don’t want somethin’ everybody can see. Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Used to love a good bit of shellfish, but I haven’t had any in years. Just get a bit… gassy, sometimes. But not an allergy, not really. No, no allergies, Doctor. Just old age, I suppose. Still, I'll take that referral. If it helps me hear Millie, I'll give it a try.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here is the referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a reputable audiologist in the area. She will conduct a comprehensive hearing assessment and discuss suitable options with you. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter remedies or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. Dr. Vance, you say? I'll write that down. Medications… let me think. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, every mornin’. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes, when my arthritis is actin’ up, I take some ibuprofen. Just the over-the-counter kind, nothin’ fancy. And… oh, sometimes I take a little vitamin D in the winter, but that's about it. Just tryin’ to stay healthy, you see. Old age, again. It takes its toll.
DOCTOR: Alright. The ibuprofen, while generally safe, can occasionally interfere with blood pressure medication. We'll monitor that. Now, before we conclude, do you have any questions for me, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Hmm… questions. Let me think… well, will the hearin’ aid make me… louder? I don’t want to shout at folks, you see. I always did have a quiet voice. And… will it be comfortable? I don’t like things stickin’ in my ear. And… how much will it cost? I’m on a fixed income, you see. Old age, again. It doesn’t pay much. Those are my questions, Doctor. If you can answer ‘em, that is.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schneer, modern hearing aids are designed to amplify sounds selectively, reducing background noise and preventing shouting. Comfort is also a priority; Dr. Vance will properly fit the aid to your ear canal. Regarding cost, it varies depending on the technology and features. Medicare may cover a portion of the cost, and Dr. Vance's office will assist you with insurance claims. However, there will likely be an out-of-pocket expense. I cannot provide a specific figure. Now, I believe that covers everything. Here is the referral again. I advise you to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Do you have any further concerns before we conclude?
PATIENT: Alright. That… that sounds a little better, I suppose. Not shoutin’, that's good. And help with the money… that's very kind. I’ll try to get an appointment with Dr. Vance then. Soon as possible, like you say. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old fella like me. I appreciate your time. No, I think that’s everything. Just… hopin’ I can hear Millie again. That's all that matters, really. Thank you again, Doctor. Good day to you.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schneer. I trust Dr. Vance will be able to assist you. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you experience any unforeseen complications. And I suggest you make an appointment sooner rather than later. Have a good day.
