DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Karry Skarbek. Well, it’s about a friend of mine. He’s hoping to come to the United States, and I believe he needs certain shots before he can get his visa. I’m not sure exactly which ones, and I thought it best to get some advice from a professional. I'm helping him with the paperwork, but I don't want to mess anything up.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Skarbek, that’s perfectly reasonable. It’s good you’re being proactive about this. We definitely want to make sure everything is done correctly for your friend’s visa application. To give you the best advice, I need a little more information. Do you know where your friend is coming from specifically?
PATIENT: That’s very kind of you, Doctor. He’s coming from… let me see… Ukraine. Yes, that’s right. He’s from a small town outside of Kyiv. He’s been wanting to visit his daughter for quite some time, but things have been… difficult, you understand. That's why he's just now able to start the process.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Things have been very difficult there. Thank you for clarifying that he’s coming from Ukraine. Okay, so the required vaccinations for visa applicants can vary depending on their country of origin and, in some cases, their individual health history. For someone coming from Ukraine, generally we look at verifying they are up-to-date on routine vaccinations – things like measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio… and influenza. Also, depending on his age and travel plans within the US, we might consider hepatitis A and B, and potentially others. Do you happen to know if he has a vaccination record available?
PATIENT: That’s a lot of information, Doctor. Thank you. He might have something… he mentioned a small booklet from when he was a boy, but I don’t know where it is now. He’s not very organized, bless his heart. He lived through a lot, so keeping papers wasn't his priority. I don't think he's had any shots in many, many years. Is it possible to figure out what he needs without the record? I just don't want to bother him if it's a lost cause.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Mr. Skarbek. Given the circumstances, it's very likely we can determine what vaccinations he needs even without the record. We'll likely need to do some blood tests to check his immunity levels for certain diseases – that's the most accurate way to proceed. We can order a panel that tests for immunity to measles, mumps, rubella, varicella , and hepatitis B. We can also discuss his history of exposure to tetanus and whether a booster is needed. Before we proceed with ordering anything, could you tell me a little about his medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As far as I know, he’s generally been a healthy man. He worked as a carpenter for most of his life, so he’s always been active. He had a bout with pneumonia a few years back, but he recovered fully. He doesn’t have any known allergies, and he doesn’t take any regular medications. He’s a bit hard of hearing, as most older men are, but that’s about it. He’s never had any serious surgeries or hospitalizations that I'm aware of. He used to smoke, but he quit about twenty years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very helpful information, Mr. Skarbek. So, no known allergies, no current medications, history of pneumonia, quit smoking twenty years ago, and generally healthy aside from some hearing loss. That’s good to know. And just to be thorough, does he have any family history of serious medical conditions that you are aware of – things like heart disease, diabetes, or certain types of cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. His mother lived to be quite old, almost ninety, and she was healthy right up until the end. His father… he passed away when my friend was young, from a heart condition, I believe. And his sister, she had… well, she had some trouble with her blood sugar when she was older, but I don’t know much about it. It was never really discussed openly, if you understand. It was a different time. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. History of heart condition in his father and some blood sugar issues in his sister. It's good to have that information. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam just to get a baseline. I'll listen to his heart and lungs, check his blood pressure, and take a look in his ears. Just a quick check to make sure everything is as you described. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. He’d want me to make sure he’s fit enough to travel, anyway. He worries about being a burden. A quick check would be just fine. He’s a bit sensitive about his hearing, so… perhaps speak a little louder when you’re listening with the stethoscope? Not that he’ll complain, you understand, he just doesn't want to seem difficult.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Skarbek. I will definitely be mindful of his hearing and speak clearly. Alright, if you could have him sit up straight in the chair, that would be great. His heart sounds are regular, rate is around 78, which is normal. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 142/88, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. We can monitor that. Ears are clear, some cerumen present, but nothing obstructing the canal. Okay, everything seems generally good. As you mentioned, his hearing seems slightly diminished, but nothing unexpected for his age. Given his blood pressure, it might be good to have him checked again in a few weeks, just to be sure it’s consistent. But for now, it doesn’t prevent us from proceeding with the vaccinations.
PATIENT: That's very reassuring, Doctor. He does worry about his blood pressure, so it’s good to hear it’s not too concerning. He’s always been a bit stubborn about going to the doctor, so getting him to come in for a follow-up might be a challenge! But I'll try. So, about those vaccinations… what exactly do you recommend, and how do we go about getting them? He's eager to start the process, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, it definitely makes sense. I understand his eagerness. Based on his age and country of origin, and without a vaccination record, I recommend we start with the following: Tdap , influenza, and hepatitis A. We should also test his immunity levels for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella to determine if boosters are needed. We’ll draw the blood for the immunity tests today. The vaccines can be administered here at the clinic. We can give him the Tdap and influenza vaccines today, and schedule a follow-up appointment to administer the hepatitis A vaccine, as it's a two-dose series. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: That sounds like a very sensible plan, Doctor. Testing his immunity levels seems like the best way to be sure. And giving him the first couple of shots today is a good start. He’s always been one to get things done, so he’ll appreciate getting the process moving. About the cost… is this something his insurance would cover? He does have private insurance, but I’m not sure of the details. I wouldn't want him to be surprised by a large bill.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Mr. Skarbek. Let me check his insurance coverage for these vaccinations and blood tests. Okay, it looks like his insurance should cover the influenza and Tdap vaccinations with a small co-pay. The blood tests for immunity levels may have a higher co-pay, or potentially require pre-authorization, depending on the specifics of his plan. I will have our billing department verify the exact costs and co-pays for you before we proceed with the blood draw. They can also check if pre-authorization is needed. I want to make sure he's fully informed of the costs upfront. Would you like me to have them contact you directly with that information?
PATIENT: That would be wonderful, Doctor. Having the billing department contact me directly would be very helpful. I appreciate you looking into that for me. He’s a bit old-fashioned and doesn’t trust dealing with insurance companies himself. So, if you're satisfied with that plan, I think we can go ahead and start with the blood draw then. He's ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, then. I’ll have the phlebotomist come in and draw the blood for the immunity tests. It will just take a few minutes. After that, we can administer the influenza and Tdap vaccines. Just to reiterate, these vaccines may cause some mild side effects – things like soreness at the injection site, fatigue, or a low-grade fever. These are generally temporary and resolve within a day or two. We’ll provide him with written instructions on how to manage any potential side effects. Do you have any other questions for me before we begin?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you've covered everything very thoroughly. He's a bit nervous about needles, but he'll be alright. He's a tough old bird. Thank you for your patience and kindness. You’ve really put my mind at ease. Let’s get started when you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. "Hi, Sarah, could you please draw Mr. Skarbek's blood for the measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella immunity panel?
