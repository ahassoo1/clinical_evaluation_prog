DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s lovely to meet you. Perhaps you could begin by telling me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. It's nice to meet you too. Dr. Shely, is it? Well, it's this tummy of mine. Been feeling poorly for a bit now. Mostly just…sick to my stomach. And I don’t seem to be able to eat much before I feel full. It’s just…not right. I’m not sure what’s causing it, to be honest. It's been going on for a few weeks, I think. Time just…blurs these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Sick to my stomach” and feeling full quickly – that certainly sounds unpleasant. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Maybe longer? It's hard to say exactly. I remember it started after…well, after things got a little rough with the treatments. They did help, mind you, but these side effects…they linger. I used to have such a good appetite, too. Always loved my cooking. Now…not so much. It just doesn't taste the same, and I don’t have the energy to make much anyway.
DOCTOR: I see. And these “treatments” – were those for a specific medical condition?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It was…cancer. They caught it early, thankfully. Had some…chemotherapy and radiation, I believe. It was a while back now, maybe…a year ago? Everything feels a bit foggy. The doctors said it was successful, but now this nausea keeps coming back, and not being able to eat is worrying me. I lost a good bit of weight already, and I’m worried about getting weak.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Kelder. It’s helpful to have the full picture. I’m noting here that you underwent chemotherapy and radiation approximately a year ago for cancer. And now you're experiencing nausea and decreased appetite, with some weight loss. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you describe the nausea for me?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. Well, it’s not like a violent sickness, you understand? Not throwing up or anything. Just…a queasy feeling. Like my stomach is always a little unsettled. It comes and goes, but it’s been pretty consistent lately. Sometimes it’s worse in the mornings, sometimes after I try to eat. It doesn't really matter what I eat, to be honest. And it makes me feel so tired. I just don’t have much energy. It’s…it’s just a general feeling of unwellness.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a persistent queasiness, not associated with vomiting, and it doesn’t seem to be triggered by any specific foods. It’s also contributing to fatigue. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this, Ms. Kelder?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Now, what else… I suppose I have been a little constipated lately. Not terribly bad, but…regular as clockwork I ain’t. And my mouth feels a bit dry sometimes, even when I've had plenty to drink. Oh, and this might not be related, but I've been feeling a bit down, too. Just…not myself, you know? Not as cheerful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so constipation, dry mouth, and you've also been feeling somewhat depressed or down. Thank you for sharing all of this, Ms. Kelder. It's very helpful. Now, regarding your past medical history – aside from the cancer treatment, do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago, must have been… thirty years? More than that even. And I’ve always had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, but it's usually under control with a little pill. Other than that… not much. I've always been a pretty healthy person, despite everything. I used to garden all the time, but I haven't been able to do much of that lately, with feeling so poorly.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and hypertension, which is currently managed. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or any other medications at all, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I take a little white pill for my blood pressure. I think it’s Lisinopril? And sometimes I take a stool softener, if I’m feeling really…backed up. Just the gentle kind. And I used to take a vitamin D supplement, but I ran out a while ago and haven’t gotten around to refilling it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril, a stool softener as needed, and previously Vitamin D. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat just about anything. Always have been able to, which is why this loss of appetite is so strange.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, Ms. Kelder, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. That's a bit of a tangled web. My mother had heart trouble, I believe. And my father…well, he lived a long life, but he had some problems with his kidneys when he got older. My sister…she had some trouble with diabetes, but she's no longer with us. As for cancer…there's been some on my mother's side, I think. But honestly, I don't remember the details very well. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kelder. That's helpful. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never smoked a day in my life. And I haven't had a drink in…well, since my husband passed, which was a long time ago. And I certainly don't take any of those things.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, thank you. And finally, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your current living situation and support system?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I live in my own little house. Been here for…oh, goodness, nearly fifty years! I manage okay on my own, mostly. My daughter, Sarah, lives about an hour away and she comes to visit when she can. She’s a busy woman, though, with her job and her family. And I have a few good friends in town who check on me now and then. But mostly, it’s just me.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kelder. That gives me a good picture of your overall health and well-being. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if anything feels…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will explain everything as I go. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but I do notice some slight tenderness in the upper quadrants. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, that's a little tender. Not terribly painful, just…uncomfortable. Sort of a dull ache. Like a pressure, almost. It's been like that for a little while now, I suppose. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate you letting me know. And no rebound tenderness. I'm going to listen to your bowel sounds now. Your bowel sounds are present, though a little diminished. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are within normal limits. Finally, I'm going to take your weight and blood pressure. Your weight is 56 kilograms, and your blood pressure is 135/85. That's a little elevated, but not significantly. Overall, your physical examination is within normal limits, although I note the tenderness in your upper abdomen, diminished bowel sounds, and slightly elevated blood pressure. Now, Ms. Kelder, based on your history and physical examination, I'm considering a few possibilities. It sounds like you may be experiencing post-cancer treatment syndrome, or potentially some delayed effects from your chemotherapy. It's also possible that you have a gastrointestinal issue contributing to your symptoms. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a liver function test. I also think a stool test to rule out any infection would be a good idea. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds…thorough. Yes, dear, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best to find out what's going on. Blood work and a stool test… alright. I’m just hoping it’s nothing too serious. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests?
DOCTOR: No, nothing major at all. For the blood work, you’ll need to be fasting for at least eight hours beforehand, so no food or drinks besides water. And for the stool test, I’ll give you a collection kit and instructions on how to collect a sample at home. It's a simple process. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood draw, and you can drop off the stool sample at the lab anytime. In the meantime, I would recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids and eating small, frequent meals. Try to avoid any foods that seem to aggravate your symptoms. And if your symptoms worsen, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as fever or severe abdominal pain, please contact me immediately. I’ll let you know the results as soon as they come in, usually within a few days. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you've explained everything very clearly, dear. Fasting for the blood work, small meals, avoid what bothers me…I can do that. And I’ll call if anything gets worse. Thank you for listening to me, Dr. Shely. I feel a little better just knowing we’re trying to figure it out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Kelder. I’m glad I could help. And please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns at all. I’ll be in touch soon with your results. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
