DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s good to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Moshe. Well, it’s this tiredness, you see. Even though I’m using the machine… the one for the sleep apnea… I’m still awfully sleepy during the day. It’s just… frustrating. I feel like I should be better rested, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Moshe. It is frustrating when treatment isn’t providing the relief you expect. You’re using a CPAP machine for sleep apnea, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s the one. CPAP. My doctor – Dr. Ramirez, back in… oh, let me think… 2018, I believe – he said that’s what I needed. It’s a little… uncomfortable, honestly. But I use it every night, or nearly every night. I try very hard to. It just doesn’t seem to be doing the trick anymore, or maybe it never really did, and I just got used to being tired? I don’t know. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how long have you been feeling this persistent tiredness, despite using the CPAP?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. I started the machine in… like I said, 2018. The first few months, it was a struggle. But I think… maybe about a year after starting? That’s when I realized it wasn’t fixing everything. I still felt… sluggish. Not as bad, but definitely not awake, if you understand what I mean. It’s been… a long time, honestly. Years.
DOCTOR: Okay, years. And has anything changed in the past year or so that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… well, my daughter, Elena, she moved to California last spring. That was a big change. I miss her terribly, of course, and I’ve been doing a lot more… just sitting around, I guess. Before that, I was always helping her with the kids, driving them to activities, you know? And… oh! The apartment building started renovations in February. Constant noise. Very disruptive. But… no, I don’t think those things are making me sleepy, exactly. Just… more stressed, maybe. But the tiredness… that’s been pretty constant.
DOCTOR: Alright. And besides the tiredness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes I wake up with a dry mouth. And a bit of a headache, now that you mention it. Not terrible, just… annoying. And… hmm. My wife… well, my ex-wife, she used to say I snored terribly. I haven’t noticed it myself, but she was always very good at hearing those things. Before the machine, of course. I don’t think I snore anymore… but I’m asleep, so what do I know? Does that count as a symptom?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely counts as information, Moshe. Dry mouth, headaches, and a history of snoring are all relevant. Let's move on to a bit more detailed questioning. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That’s a good question. I… well, I’ve put on a few pounds, I suppose. Maybe ten or fifteen. It's hard to say exactly. I used to walk more with Elena and the grandkids. But now… not so much. And I do enjoy my food, you know? I’m Spanish, after all. We like to eat. I’m around 92 kilos, I think. I had a check-up last year, and the nurse told me.
DOCTOR: Okay, around 92 kilograms. And are you experiencing any difficulty with your memory or concentration?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, at my age, a little forgetfulness is to be expected, isn't it? But no, not really. I mean, sometimes I misplace my glasses, or forget a name… but nothing major. I still teach, you know? Ethnic studies. Lots of dates and names and historical details. I can recall those perfectly well. I pride myself on that. It’s more… just the everyday things. Like where I put the remote. Or what I had for breakfast. Not a big deal.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a little something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And that’s it, really. Oh! And sometimes I take an over-the-counter sleep aid, just when I’m really having trouble. But that’s not very often. As for allergies… no, not that I know of. Never had a problem with pollen or anything like that. I can eat shellfish, which is good, because I love paella.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure and occasional over-the-counter sleep aid. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Well, Dr. Ramirez said I had mild asthma when I was a boy, but I haven’t had any trouble with it in… oh, goodness, decades. I had my gallbladder removed in… 1998, I think. And… oh, yes! I had a bout of pneumonia a few years ago, but that cleared up completely with antibiotics. Nothing else that I can think of. I've been generally healthy, all things considered. Considering my age, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild asthma in childhood, gallbladder removal in 1998, and pneumonia a few years ago. Now, regarding your family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My father… he had heart trouble, I believe. He passed away when I was quite young, so I don't remember many details. My mother… she lived to be 95, very healthy. No major illnesses that I recall. My sister, Elena… she has diabetes, but that’s about it. Nothing else that I know of. My family wasn’t much for talking about health, if you understand what I mean. They preferred to talk about politics. Or food.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Well… I’m divorced, as I mentioned. Elena is my only child. I live alone in a small apartment here in the city. I still teach a few classes at the university, which keeps me busy. I used to enjoy gardening, but my knees aren’t what they used to be. I try to stay active, but it’s difficult. I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. And I don’t smoke. Never have. I used to volunteer at the local museum, but I had to stop during the renovations. It's very noisy there now. Mostly, I just keep busy with my teaching and try to spend as much time as possible with Elena and her children when they visit. It gets lonely, of course, but that’s just life, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Moshe, thank you for that detailed information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I haven’t had a good physical in a while, to be honest. Go right ahead. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Okay, Moshe. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90. Your pulse is 78 and regular, and your temperature is normal at 98.6. Your lungs are clear, but I do hear a slight murmur when listening to your heart – it’s likely benign, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Your ears, nose, and throat appear normal. I also notice some mild swelling in your ankles. Do you experience that frequently?
PATIENT: Oh, the ankles… yes, I do. Especially at the end of the day. I just thought it was… old age, you know? Sometimes they’re quite swollen, sometimes not so bad. I haven't really mentioned it to anyone before. I figured it was just gravity, or something. Is that… a problem? It doesn't really hurt, if that makes any difference. Just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Moshe. The ankle swelling, combined with your elevated blood pressure and the murmur, suggests we need to investigate a bit further. Given your history of sleep apnea, and the fact that the CPAP isn’t fully resolving your tiredness, I'm concerned about the possibility of underlying heart issues or fluid retention. I'd like to order a few tests. Specifically, I’d like a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and a BNP level to assess for heart failure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary, then absolutely. I trust your judgment. I’d rather know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. Just let me know what I need to do. Where do I go to get these tests done? And… will my insurance cover it? I have Medicare, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. We can get those tests scheduled at the lab right across the street – I’ll write you a referral. They accept Medicare, so you shouldn't have any issues with coverage. The lab technician will explain the process, but it mostly involves a simple blood draw and an EKG, which is a painless test that measures your heart's electrical activity. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to use your CPAP as prescribed. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease, honestly. Knowing we’re looking into it… that’s a relief. Thank you. I appreciate your patience and your attention to detail. I’ll go to the lab tomorrow morning, first thing. And I’ll continue with the machine, as you suggested. Just… a little worried about what the results might show, I suppose. But better to know, as you said.
DOCTOR: Alright, Moshe. It’s understandable to be worried, but we’ll take things one step at a time. We’ll discuss the results carefully and develop a plan that’s right for you. Here’s the referral for the lab. Don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And remember, we're here to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s all. Thank you again for everything. You’ve been very kind and helpful. I feel much better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of this. I’ll see you when the results are back. Have a good day.
