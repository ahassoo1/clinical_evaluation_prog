DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I… I have been having trouble with my breathing. A little bit of whistling sound when I breathe. It makes me a little worry.
DOCTOR: Hmm, alright. A whistling sound when you breathe, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like… when you blow on a small bottle. Not all the time, but mostly when I try to sleep. And sometimes when I walk fast. It started maybe a week ago, I think. I not so good at remembering dates.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is this whistling sound… constant while you’re sleeping, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It come and go, Doctor. Sometimes I wake up because of it, then it stop. Other times, I sleep through it. It is… not every night. Just sometimes. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Well, any change in your breathing warrants investigation, Mrs. Kilton. Now, have you noticed anything else accompanying this whistling?
PATIENT: Accompanying? You mean… other things happening at the same time? Let me think. I feel a little… tired, yes. More tired than usual. And a small cough. But I always have a little cough, especially in the morning. It is not new, this cough.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, increased fatigue, and a pre-existing cough. Does this cough produce any mucus?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Sometimes. A little bit. It is… clear, usually. Not much. Just a small… speck. But when I am very tired, it is… a bit thicker. Is that important? I am sorry, I do not understand all the doctor talk.
DOCTOR: It can be important, Mrs. Kilton. Now, have you experienced any chest pain, or any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No chest pain at all. And no swelling. My feet… they are always a little bit wide, but no more than usual. I walk a lot, you see. I used to be a trainer, for the school team. So my feet… they are strong. But no swelling. I promise.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's review some of your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. I never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything. Except maybe… spicy food. That makes my stomach upset, but that is not an allergy, is it? Just… my stomach. I have no medicine allergies. I take nothing, usually. Only when I have a headache. A small pill. But I forget the name.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any existing medical conditions – such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think not. I had a small problem with my back, many years ago, when I was training. But that is fixed now. The doctor… he gave me some exercises. And I do them every day. Other than that… I feel quite strong. My husband… he always said I was very healthy. But he is… gone now. A long time ago. I am sorry. Is that important?
DOCTOR: While your personal history is noted, Mrs. Kilton, we are focusing on your medical history. Any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Sorry, Doctor. No surgeries. Never had one. And no… hospitalization. Except when I had my children. A long, long time ago. It was all very quick. I do not remember much. Just… babies. Is that all? Are we finished with the history now? I feel a little tired talking so much.
DOCTOR: For the moment, yes. Now, Mrs. Kilton, I'd like to listen to your lungs and take your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Of course. Is this going to be… uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t be, Mrs. Kilton. Just breathe normally. I am hearing some mild wheezing in your lower lungs, bilaterally. Your blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, can you try to exhale forcefully, like you are blowing out candles?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is that alright? Is it… enough? I not so good at this. I used to run track, not blow candles.
DOCTOR: Adequate. I’d like to check your oxygen saturation now. Just hold still for a moment. 94%. That’s within normal limits, but on the lower end. Based on your symptoms and these initial findings, it appears you may be experiencing mild asthma exacerbation. Or, it could be early bronchitis.
PATIENT: Asthma? But I have never… I do not understand. My mother, she had arthritis, but not asthma. What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… bad? Will I have to stay in the hospital? I have a small garden to tend to… and I promised my neighbor I would help with her cat.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kilton, it simply means your airways are slightly inflamed, causing the whistling sound you’re experiencing and the mild wheezing I detected. It is not necessarily severe, at this moment. We will need to run some tests to confirm the diagnosis, and determine the best course of treatment. First, I would like to order a chest x-ray and a pulmonary function test. This will give us a clearer picture of what is happening in your lungs. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. A picture… and a test. Is the test… painful? And the picture, will it hurt? I do not like hospitals very much. They always smell… funny. But I will do it, if you think it is best. What do I have to do? Will I need someone to drive me? I live alone, you see.
DOCTOR: The x-ray is painless. You will simply stand in front of a machine for a few seconds while a picture is taken. The pulmonary function test involves breathing into a tube. It may feel slightly tiring, but it is not painful. As you live alone, I recommend having someone drive you to and from the testing center. I have a referral form here for [Testing Center Name], they have early morning appointments available tomorrow. Once we have the results, we can discuss treatment options, which may include an inhaler or other medication. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: An inhaler? Like… for asthma? I have never used one of those. Will it… make me feel different? And tomorrow? That is very quick. I need to think about who can drive me… My neighbor, maybe. She is very kind. But thank you, Doctor. You explain it very well. No, I think… I think that is all the questions for now. What about the garden? Can I still tend to my tomatoes?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kilton, until we have the test results, I would advise against strenuous activity, including gardening. We need to assess the severity of your condition before determining what you can and cannot do. The inhaler, if prescribed, is simply to help open your airways and make breathing easier. It shouldn’t make you feel different, although some people experience slight side effects, like a racing heart. We will discuss this further if it becomes necessary. Here is the form for the testing center. Please schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. No gardening… and call to schedule the test. Thank you. You have been very helpful. Even if I am a little bit worried. Is it alright if I… if I ask my neighbor to come with me to the test? Just for… company? And to drive me, of course.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly acceptable, Mrs. Kilton. Having someone with you for support is a good idea. Here’s a copy of my notes for your records. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe shortness of breath, chest pain, or a high fever – please go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise, I'll see you after you have had the tests completed. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is all. Thank you for everything. You have a good day.
DOCTOR: You as well, Mrs. Kilton. Remember my instructions regarding the emergency room. .
