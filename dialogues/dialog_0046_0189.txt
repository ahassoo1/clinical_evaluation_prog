DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Rowbottom’s the name. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, waste of time if you ask me. But my daughter insisted. Said I needed to get this… looked at. It’s my stool. There was blood in it. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to get her worked up. Honestly, probably just something I ate. But she wouldn’t let it go.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. It's good of your daughter to encourage you to come in – it's always best to get these things checked out, even if it is something minor. And you're right to want to get it sorted quickly. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the blood a little more?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you want to know, the shade of red? Look, it was… well, it was blood. Red, obviously. Not like a bright, fresh kind, more… darker. Mixed in with everything else, you know? Not just sitting on top. And it wasn't a huge amount, I told you that. Enough to make a fuss about, apparently. I haven't had any… problems… like that before, not that I recall. Old age, probably. Everything starts going wrong eventually.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you describing it that way, Mr. Rowbottom. Darker blood, mixed in, and a relatively small amount… that’s helpful. And you haven't noticed this before, as far as you remember. Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Changes? What do you mean, changes? I go to the bathroom when I need to, same as always. Sometimes it's a bit… harder, sometimes softer. That's just how it is. I'm 88 years old, things aren't as reliable as they used to be. Is this what you doctors do? Ask a million questions about… that? Honestly. I don’t keep a log, if that's what you’re after.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Rowbottom, I don't expect you to keep a log. I apologize if the questions seem personal; they’re just important for me to get a complete picture. When you say "harder" or "softer," has the consistency changed noticeably recently?
PATIENT: Not… noticeably, no. It's not like it’s suddenly turned to water or… rocks, if you catch my drift. Just a bit different here and there. I eat my usual food, mostly. Steak, potatoes, you know. Good, solid food. I haven’t been messing around with fancy salads or anything. It’s just… old man stuff. Things aren't always perfect. What's this all about anyway? Is it something serious? Because I haven't got time for… a lot of fuss. I’ve got a fishing trip planned next week.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about getting to the bottom of this quickly, especially with your fishing trip coming up. And you’re right to want to know if it’s serious. Okay, so consistency has been a little variable, but not drastically different. And you haven’t noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I feel… old. Tired, mostly. My knees ache, my back aches, everything aches. That's just getting old, isn't it? No… stomach pain, no… fever, no… throwing up. Nothing like that. I haven't been feeling sick, if that's what you mean. Just… a bit run down. And concerned about this blood business. My daughter made it sound like it was the end of the world. She always exaggerates.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. No fever, no vomiting, no abdominal pain, just feeling generally run down and concerned about the blood. That’s helpful to know. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. I haven't been trying to lose weight. I like my steak. But… now that you mention it… my trousers have been a bit looser lately. But that could just be… shrinkage. You know, in the wash. Or just getting older, things… settle. I haven’t actually weighed myself, not for years. I don't bother with that nonsense. But yes, maybe a bit. Not a lot, mind you. Just… noticeable enough to be a bit odd. Honestly, this is all very unsettling. I just want to know if I’m going to be alright for my fishing trip.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit of unintentional weight loss, possibly. And you’re understandably concerned about your fishing trip. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Medical history… Well, let me think. The doctor back home – a good man, Doctor MacIntyre – he always said I was as strong as an ox. A bit of arthritis, he said, but nothing to worry about. High blood pressure, maybe, years ago. I was told to watch my salt, but I never really did. I like a bit of seasoning. As for diabetes… no, I don’t think so. Never been told. Had a bit of trouble with my prostate when I was younger, had some… treatment… for that. But that was a long time ago. I’ve had the usual – colds, flu, broken bones when I was a kid, that sort of thing. Nothing major. I've always been a tough old bird. Mostly. This blood thing is what's bothering me. And my daughter, of course. She’s a worrier.
DOCTOR: Okay, so arthritis, possible history of high blood pressure, treatment for prostate issues in the past, and generally good health otherwise. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a young man, that was a long time ago. And I had a hernia operation, must be… forty years ago, maybe more. And I had a bit of work done on my knee, when I was playing rugby. Just a scope, they said. Nothing major. And… I think that’s it. I avoided hospitals as much as possible. Didn’t like being poked and prodded. And I certainly didn’t go around having unnecessary operations. A tough old bird, remember? I like to keep things simple. This is all getting a bit long, isn’t it? Are we any closer to finding out if I can go fishing?
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Mr. Rowbottom. And you're right to ask. Knowing your history helps me narrow things down. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I don’t believe in all those pills. Poison, that's what they are. I take a bit of cod liver oil, sometimes, for my joints. And a bit of aspirin, if I get a headache. But that’s it. I’ve always prided myself on being drug-free. Natural remedies, that’s what I believe in. Fresh air, good food, and a bit of common sense. That’s what keeps a man going. All these medications nowadays… it’s just a way for the doctors to make money, if you ask me. Honestly. Are we nearly finished? I’m starting to feel a bit faint. Perhaps it’s the questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, just occasional aspirin and cod liver oil. I understand your skepticism about medications, Mr. Rowbottom. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. I used to be a bit sensitive to bee stings when I was a boy, but I haven't been stung in years. And I haven't noticed any problems with food. I ate all sorts of things when I was travelling – foreign food, spicy food, everything. I've always had a strong stomach. I think I’m pretty much immune to everything at this point. Honestly, this is exhausting. I just want to get home and have a cup of tea. And make sure I can still go fishing. Is it bad? Tell me straight, doctor. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom, no known allergies. Now, given your history and what you've told me, the blood in your stool, along with the unintentional weight loss, warrants further investigation. It could be something relatively minor, but it’s important to rule out anything more serious. I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check your general health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Poke and prod again? Honestly. I told you, I don't like being touched. But… alright. If you have to. But be gentle, mind you. And don't take too long. I've got things to do. And be quick about telling me if it means I can’t go fishing. That's the important part. What are you looking for exactly? And what does it mean if it's something bad? Don't sugarcoat it, doctor. I'm a tough old bird, remember? I can handle the truth. Just… be quick about it. This is making me anxious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I'm listening to your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. I'll also feel your abdomen to check for any masses or swelling. Does this cause you any discomfort?
PATIENT: Ouch! That’s… a bit tender there, actually. Right there, on the left side. Not terribly painful, just… sensitive. I haven’t noticed it before, but now that you’re pressing on it… yes, that’s a bit uncomfortable. Be careful, mind you. I don't want you poking a hole in anything. What does that mean? Is it serious? It’s probably just indigestion, isn’t it? I had a bit of a dodgy curry last week. That must be it. Honestly, I'm not sure I like this very much. Can we get this over with quickly? The fishing trip is getting closer and closer.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rowbottom. Tenderness on the left side of your abdomen. That, combined with the blood in your stool and unintentional weight loss, does raise some concern. It could be something as simple as diverticulitis—inflammation of small pouches in the colon—but we need to investigate further to be sure. I’m listening to your bowel sounds now. They sound normal. I'm also checking your pulse and blood pressure, which are a little elevated, but not critically high. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order a blood test, including a complete blood count and a test to check for inflammation. I also recommend a stool test to check for blood and any signs of infection. And, given your weight loss, I think a colonoscopy would be the most thorough way to investigate the source of the bleeding. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests, stool tests, colonoscopy? Good heavens, doctor, what are you trying to do to me? It sounds… invasive. And expensive, I bet. Is it absolutely necessary? I told you, I'm an old man. Everything aches and rattles. Maybe it's just my age. Can't we just… ignore it? Take some pills to settle my stomach? Colonoscopy… I've heard stories about those. Dreadful stories. I don’t think I can do that. Honestly. And expensive! I'm on a fixed income, you know. Are you sure you can't just… tell me if it’s serious? Without all this poking and prodding? I just want to go fishing. That’s all I want. Is it bad enough that I can’t go fishing? Tell me straight, doctor. Don’t beat around the bush. Is it going to kill me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your concerns and your reluctance to undergo further testing. It’s completely valid to feel anxious about these procedures, and the cost is a legitimate concern. To answer your question directly, I cannot tell you definitively whether it’s something serious without further investigation. The blood in your stool and weight loss are red flags that need to be addressed. While it could be something minor, it's equally important to rule out more serious conditions like colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. A colonoscopy is the most accurate way to examine the colon and identify the source of the bleeding. While it does have some preparation involved and carries a small risk of complications, it's a very safe procedure when performed by an experienced doctor. I wouldn’t recommend it if I didn’t think it was necessary. We can discuss options for financial assistance to help with the cost. However, if you absolutely refuse the colonoscopy, we can proceed with the blood and stool tests. But please understand that these tests are less definitive, and we may need to repeat them or consider other investigations later. Regardless, given your weight loss, I recommend a referral to a gastroenterologist – a specialist in digestive health – for a more detailed consultation. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A gastroenterologist… More doctors. Honestly. It’s a conspiracy, I tell you. They just want to make money. Alright. Fine. Do the blood tests and the stool tests. But that’s it. No colonoscopy. And no referral to a specialist until we see what those tests say. I'm not letting anyone poke around inside me unless absolutely necessary. And if the tests come back normal, then I'm going fishing. Do you understand? Fishing. And you better make sure those tests are covered by my insurance. I'm not paying for all this nonsense myself. I'm a tough old bird, but I’m not made of money. Now, let’s get this over with. Tell me where to go for the tests. And try not to poke too much. I'm starting to feel very faint. Honestly, this is exhausting.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand. We’ll proceed with the blood and stool tests. I’ll write you a requisition for both. The blood test can be done at the clinic lab, right next door. They’re open from 8 am to 5 pm, Monday to Friday. The stool test kit will be given to you at reception, and instructions on how to collect the sample will be included. You'll need to drop that sample off at the lab as well within 24 hours of collection. I'll also have the reception staff check your insurance coverage for both tests. And if there are any issues with coverage, they’ll assist you with exploring options for financial assistance. It will likely take a few days to get the results back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. For now, I would recommend staying hydrated, eating a healthy diet, and avoiding any foods that seem to worsen your symptoms. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable. Just get it over with. And hurry up with those results. I’ve got a fishing trip to plan, you know. And tell the reception staff to be quick about the insurance. I don’t want to be chasing them around. Look, I'm an old man. I don't have a lot of time. So just get it done quickly and efficiently. And if I don't hear anything back soon, I'm coming back to see you. And I won't be happy. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go lie down. All this fuss has exhausted me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. We’ll do everything we can to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. The reception staff has been informed of your concerns and will prioritize your insurance verification. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take it easy and get some rest. Wishing you all the best, and hopefully, we'll get you back to fishing soon.
