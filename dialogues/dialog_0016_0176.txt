DOCTOR: Hello Ivette, welcome! It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's these hiccups. They just… won’t stop. Been going on for two days now, at least. It’s quite irritating, really.
DOCTOR: Two days, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, since Monday, I think. August 1st, definitely. I keep trying all sorts of things people tell you – holding your breath, drinking water upside down… nothing seems to work. It’s just… hic… constant. It’s exhausting, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant hiccups for two days. That is frustrating. Can you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Well, they come pretty often, maybe every few minutes. They aren't painful, exactly, just… startling. And annoying! They don’t seem to be connected to anything specific. I eat, I hic… drink, I sit, I stand… they just happen. I haven't changed anything in my diet or routine, not that I can think of.
DOCTOR: Alright, so frequent hiccups, not related to any specific activity or diet change. Have you noticed anything that makes them worse or better, even if it’s just a little bit?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… I think maybe when I get excited, they come on faster? Like if someone tells a funny story. But it’s hard to say for sure, because I'm getting frustrated hic… so everything seems to trigger them now. And lying down doesn’t really change anything, either way.
DOCTOR: Okay, so possibly triggered by excitement, and lying down doesn't affect them. Any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing alongside the hiccups?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven’t felt sick or anything. No heartburn, no stomach pain, no trouble breathing… just the hic… hiccups. I’m a little tired, maybe, but that's probably just from not sleeping well with them keeping me awake. Honestly, Doctor, it's just so disruptive. I manage a small entertainment venue, and it's hard to talk to people when you keep interrupting yourself!
DOCTOR: Okay, no other associated symptoms, just the hiccups and some sleep disruption. You manage an entertainment venue, that sounds busy! Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, not much, thankfully. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, that’s about it. And I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, measles, chickenpox… nothing major. I haven't been hospitalized since the appendix, and I don't really take any medications regularly. Just over-the-counter things for headaches sometimes. I hic… used to smoke, but I quit about fifteen years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal as a teenager, childhood illnesses, and quit smoking fifteen years ago – that’s good to know. Any family history of medical problems – heart disease, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure, and my father had some trouble with his digestion. He always complained of heartburn. And my sister has arthritis, but that's about it, really. Nothing too serious on either side of the family, as far as I know. I hic… don’t think anyone ever had hiccups this long, though! It’s a bit embarrassing to admit.
DOCTOR: Alright, family history of high blood pressure, digestive issues, and arthritis. Okay. Now, just to get a complete picture, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat anything, no food allergies, no reactions to insect bites… I hic… honestly, I'm a pretty healthy person, usually. That’s why this is so strange. It feels like my body is just… malfunctioning!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. It sounds like you generally have good health, which makes these persistent hiccups even more puzzling. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your throat and abdomen, if that's alright. Just to rule out anything obvious. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate. I hic… just want them to stop! I'm starting to feel quite silly. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Just breathe normally. Okay, everything sounds good there. Now I’m just going to take a look at your throat… say "ahhh" for me. And now I'm just going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Everything feels normal there as well. No tenderness.
PATIENT: Okay. That didn't feel too bad. So… what does that mean? Are you finding anything wrong? I hic… feel a bit relieved that it’s not something serious, but also frustrated that we haven’t figured out what is causing them!
DOCTOR: Well, that’s good news, that everything feels normal. The physical exam didn't reveal any obvious cause for the hiccups. Persistent hiccups, like yours, can be tricky. Sometimes they happen spontaneously, with no clear reason. Other times, they can be related to things like stress, anxiety, or even certain medications, though you mentioned you don’t take anything regularly. Given your history and the exam findings, it sounds like we’re dealing with what's called idiopathic persistent hiccups – meaning hiccups with no identifiable cause. It's often benign and will resolve on its own, but it can be quite bothersome. I'd like to order a basic blood test just to rule out any underlying metabolic issues or electrolyte imbalances. Nothing major, just a routine check. It might also be helpful to monitor your symptoms for a week and see if anything specific seems to trigger them. If they continue beyond a week, we can discuss some potential medications that can help. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Idiopathic… so just… happening for no reason. hic… That's frustrating, but at least it's not something serious. A blood test sounds fine, and I’m happy to monitor them. I’ll try to really pay attention to what I’m doing when they start. So, no medication right now? Just wait and see? And… are there any home remedies you recommend? Besides holding my breath and drinking water upside down, which clearly aren't working.
DOCTOR: Exactly. No medication right now, just wait and see, and monitor your symptoms. It’s good you’re already trying some home remedies, though it sounds like they haven’t been very effective. As for other things you can try… Some people find relief with a spoonful of sugar, or sucking on a lemon. A slow, deep breathing exercise can sometimes help calm the diaphragm. You can also try drinking ice water slowly. Honestly, there’s no guaranteed fix, it’s often a matter of trial and error. I'm going to write you a lab order for the blood test. It’s just a standard CBC and a basic metabolic panel. The nurse will draw it for you before you leave. And I’ll give you a symptom diary to track when the hiccups occur and what you were doing at the time. We can review it at your follow-up appointment, which I’m scheduling for one week from today, August 9th. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, August 9th is fine. A spoonful of sugar… I suppose it's worth a try! hic I’m willing to try anything at this point. A symptom diary sounds good too. That might actually help me figure out if there’s a pattern I haven't noticed yet. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything. I'm still annoyed by these hiccups, but I feel a little better knowing we're doing something to figure it out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ivette. I understand your frustration, and I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. Don’t hesitate to call the office if the hiccups become severe or if you develop any other symptoms. The nurse will be right in to draw your blood and give you the symptom diary. In the meantime, try not to stress too much, and hopefully, those hiccups will resolve on their own soon. Do you have any other questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor Maskal. I'll see you on August 9th.
