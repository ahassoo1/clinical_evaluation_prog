DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Pithan. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it's this cough. It just won’t quit. And I'm always tired, even when I get some sleep. Seems like I'm always fighting off a sinus thing too. It's been going on for a while now, and frankly, it's wearing me down.
DOCTOR: A cough, fatigue, and recurrent sinus issues… “a while now” is rather vague, Mr. Pithan. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think... I guess it really started getting bad last fall, maybe October or November. But I think I had a little bit of a cough on and off before that, too. It's just been consistently worse since then, and the sinus stuff keeps coming back every few weeks, it feels like. Does that make more sense? I don't really keep track of dates, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “Not really keeping track of dates” is unhelpful, Mr. Pithan. Nevertheless. And this cough… is it productive?
PATIENT: Productive? You mean… do I cough stuff up? Yeah, I do. It’s usually… greenish-yellow. Sometimes clear, but mostly that color. Sorry, I don't know medical words, doc. I just tell you what happens. Is that what you meant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that clarifies. Greenish-yellow sputum indicates… well, it indicates something. Have you had a fever associated with this?
PATIENT: Not a high one, not really. Sometimes I feel warm, a little achy, but I don’t usually bother taking my temperature. I just try to rest. I haven’t felt sick sick, just… worn out and this cough. I don't know if that helps. Is it important to know the exact temperature?
DOCTOR: It is always helpful to have precise measurements, Mr. Pithan. Now, any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get winded sometimes, but I’m not a young man anymore, you know? I do some work at the processing plant, lifting and moving things, and that gets me breathing harder. But it's not like I'm struggling to breathe just sitting here. I haven’t had any trouble sleeping because of it, either.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never touched a cigarette in my life. My grandmother, she always said it was a waste of good money. And my mother... well, she wouldn't have approved. No, never smoked. I don't even like being around people who do.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. I don’t know that I have any, really. I mean, I get itchy eyes sometimes in the spring, with all the pollen around. But everyone does, don't they? Nothing I ever thought much about. I haven't ever gone to a doctor for allergies. Does that count?
DOCTOR: It clarifies that you’ve not had a formal diagnosis. Let's move on. Any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, doc. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. Had a broken arm when I was a kid, climbed a tree I shouldn't have. But nothing serious, nothing chronic. I've always just tried to tough things out. Is there something I should know about?
DOCTOR: “Toughing things out” is not a medical strategy, Mr. Pithan. Now, past surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been under the knife, thankfully. Like I said, pretty lucky. I try to be careful at work, but accidents happen. So far, so good. Nothing they've had to cut open, stitch up, or anything like that. I don't like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Understandable. What about your family?
PATIENT: Family history? My mother... she had some trouble with her heart later in life. And my father… he always had a bad back from working on the reservation. That’s about all I know, really. We didn’t talk much about health problems. Just… dealt with them as they came. My brother is fine, as far as I know. We don't see each other much anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? You mean... what do I do for fun? I live alone, mostly. I like to listen to the radio, Lakota music. Sometimes I go fishing, when I have the time. I don't drink much, and I don't do any drugs. I work. That’s about it, doc. A quiet life. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Adequate, I suppose. Now, let’s conduct a brief physical exam. Please step onto the scale.
PATIENT: Alright. Whatever you need to do, doc. Hurry it up, if you could. I have things to get back to.
DOCTOR: Your weight is 132 pounds. And your height is recorded as 181 centimeters. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. Please take a deep breath. Decreased breath sounds bilaterally. Some wheezing present. Rhonchi are also audible. I will now check your sinuses. Tenderness to palpation over the maxillary sinuses. Your throat is clear, no obvious signs of infection. I'm also going to check your heart rate and blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 80. This is… not ideal.
PATIENT: Not ideal? What does that mean? Is something seriously wrong, doc? I just thought it was a bad cough and some sinus trouble. You’re making me nervous now.
DOCTOR: Mr. Pithan, your presentation suggests a possible chronic lower respiratory issue, exacerbated by a sinus infection. Your blood pressure is also elevated. While not immediately life-threatening, these findings warrant further investigation. I am ordering a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. We will also monitor your blood pressure over the next few weeks. I will also prescribe you an expectorant for the cough and a nasal decongestant for the sinus congestion. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had any trouble with any medicines before. But like I said, I don't really take much. What does this chest X-ray show, doc? Is it something bad? And what about my blood pressure? Should I be worried about that too? I'm starting to feel a little lightheaded just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Pithan, I understand your anxiety. The X-ray will help determine the cause of the decreased breath sounds and wheezing. As for your blood pressure, it is slightly elevated, and we need to monitor it to see if it's a persistent issue. I will write you a prescription for the medications now. Please take them as directed, and schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review the test results and reassess your condition. Here are your prescriptions. And please, attempt to reduce stress. It is impacting your health. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, I understand. X-ray, blood tests, medicine. Stress… easier said than done, doc. I just want to feel normal again. Thank you. Is there anything else I need to know before I go? And how much will all this cost? I’m on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: The cost will depend on your insurance coverage, Mr. Pithan. You will need to contact your provider for details. As for anything else… I strongly advise you to quit any potential exposure to irritants. And I cannot stress enough the importance of adhering to the medication schedule. Do you have any questions regarding the medication dosage or potential side effects?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just take them as the instructions say, right? Look, I appreciate your time, doc, but I really need to get going. I've got work tomorrow. Thank you again. Is that all? .
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Pithan. You may leave. I expect to see you in two weeks. .
