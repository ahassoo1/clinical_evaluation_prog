DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh, well, my sister… she got sick. Real sick. Cancer. And my mother… she had something bad too, a long time ago. So, I just… want to make sure I’m okay. You know? Just peace of mind.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s wise to be proactive, especially with a family history. We’ll certainly do our best to assess your current health. Now, can you tell me a bit more about your sister's cancer?
PATIENT: She… uh… it was in her chest. Lung cancer, I think the doctors said. She smoked for a long time. She’s… she’s getting treatment now. Chemo, mostly. It makes her really tired. And my mother… it was different. I was just a boy. Something with her stomach, I think. A long time ago. They… took part of it out. I don't really remember much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lung cancer in your sister, and a history of stomach issues in your mother. Both relevant pieces of information. Let’s focus on you for now. Have you been experiencing any specific symptoms yourself?
PATIENT: No… not really. I feel okay. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I’m… old. 73, you know? I get winded walking up hills, but I always have. Nothing new. No pain, no… nothing like that. Just… worried.
DOCTOR: "Just worried" is a valid reason to come in, Mr. Schwer. We’ll do a routine check-up, then. Let's start with a review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The doctor, a long time ago, said my blood pressure was a little high. They gave me pills for it. I took them for a while, then stopped. Didn't really feel much different. And… I had my appendix out when I was a kid. Other than that… I think I've been pretty lucky.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Not right now. I tried some vitamins a while back, but I forgot to take them. I don't really like taking pills if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had a problem with anything. I eat everything. I've never had a rash or… trouble breathing after eating anything. Nope, no allergies.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let's talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My sister… she always said I was too stubborn to get addicted to anything.
DOCTOR: And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: I… sometimes have a beer with dinner. Maybe three, four times a week. Nothing more than that. Just one or two. I don't drink much, really. Never liked it much. It makes me sleepy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your diet and exercise habits?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. My wife… she always made sure we had good food. Lots of vegetables. Now… it's mostly simple things. Soup, sandwiches. I walk a little, when the weather’s nice. Not much exercise, I guess. I used to work outside a lot, when I was younger, but now I mostly sit.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam, then. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your abdomen. Just routine. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please take a deep breath for me. Breath sounds are clear bilaterally, though a little diminished overall. Heart rate is regular, a bit of a murmur present, likely benign age-related change. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. 148 over 88. A little elevated. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpable. Overall, physical exam is unremarkable, though blood pressure is slightly high.
PATIENT: Okay. Is that… bad? The blood pressure, I mean. Should I be worried about that? I don’t want to take pills, but… I don’t want to get sick like my sister, either.
DOCTOR: It's not immediately alarming, Mr. Schwer, but it is something we need to address. Uncontrolled hypertension can lead to complications over time. And given your family history, it’s prudent to be proactive. We could try some lifestyle modifications first - diet, exercise, stress reduction - and see if that brings it down. If that doesn't suffice, medication may be necessary. We’ll discuss all your options, of course. Now, do you have any concerns about your weight?
PATIENT: My weight? Well… I used to be bigger. Lost a lot when my wife… passed. Haven't really put it back on. I'm… skinny, I guess. My clothes are always a little loose. I don't eat much these days.
DOCTOR: You mentioned losing weight after your wife passed. How long ago was that?
PATIENT: Oh… about five years now. It feels like yesterday sometimes. She… she took care of everything. The cooking, the cleaning… everything. I miss her a lot. After she… after she was gone, I just… didn't have much appetite.
DOCTOR: I understand. Grief can significantly impact appetite and overall health. We should also check a basic metabolic panel to assess your nutritional status and rule out any underlying causes for the weight loss. That will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Would you be agreeable to some blood work?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, I suppose so. If it will help. I just want to know I'm okay. And… I don't want to worry my daughter. She’s been through a lot, with her mother… and now her aunt. Just do what you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer. We’ll get those labs ordered right away. I'll also give you a referral to a nutritionist. It might be helpful to have someone guide you through re-establishing healthy eating habits. And… if you are struggling with grief, there are resources available to help with that as well. I can provide you with some information. In the meantime, let’s focus on getting these blood tests done. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… thank you. For listening. And for not making me feel like I’m crazy for worrying. My daughter thinks I'm just getting old. But… you understand.
DOCTOR: You're not crazy at all, Mr. Schwer. It's perfectly reasonable to be concerned about your health, especially given your family history and recent life changes. We'll work through this together. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I’ll review the results as soon as they come in, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to call the office. Now, let’s get you those lab orders.
