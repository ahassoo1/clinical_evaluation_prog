DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I'm Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Huh? Oh. Doctor, right. Well, it’s… the breathin’. Gets kinda hard, you know? And my mouth… feels like a desert. Eyes too. Like sand. Don’t remember when it started, exactly. Just… been gettin’ worse, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, shortness of breath and a dry mouth and eyes… and you said this has been developing gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually… yeah, that sounds right. Not like somethin’ sudden. Just… always feelin’ a little more tired tryin’ to catch my breath. And I gotta sip water all the time. Used to not need nothin’ but coffee, you know? Strong Cuban coffee. Now… water. Lots of it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when you say shortness of breath, is it with activity, or even at rest?
PATIENT: Hm. Both, I think. Walkin' up the stairs… always used to be nothin’. Now? Gotta stop halfway, catch my breath. And even sittin’ here… feel a little tight, if I think about it too much. It’s… annoyin’, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any chest pain, coughing, or fever along with this shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no. Not really. Maybe a little… ache sometimes, but nothin’ bad. Coughin’? Not much. Just… a tickle now and then. Fever… I don't know. Haven’t taken my temperature. Don’t bother with that stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look at your medical history. I see you have Medicare, and the clinic location is urban… Okay, I see a note here about hypertension, diagnosed about ten years ago. Are you currently taking anything for that?
PATIENT: High… what? Oh, the blood pressure thing. Yeah, the doctor gave me some pills for that. Little white ones. Take ‘em every mornin’, I think. Sometimes I forget. Hard to remember all these things, you know? Old age.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. And do you remember the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Name…? No. No, I don’t. Just… little white pills. Bottle says “take one daily.” That’s all I know. They didn't tell me nothin’ fancy. Used to have a good doctor, but he… retired, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Nope. Never had any problems with nothin’. I eat anything. Everything. Cuban food, mostly. Good stuff. Strong flavors. Don’t think I’m allergic to anythin’.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family… hm. My mother, she… lived a long time. Ninety-something. But she always complained about her knees. Father… he smoked too much. Always coughin’. That’s about all I remember. Not a healthy man, my father.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you currently smoke or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke…? No! Never touched the stuff. Nasty habit. My father did, like I said. Made him cough all the time. I always stayed away from it. Bad for you, you know? Real bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Alright, Mr. Guilds, I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart, and then I’d like to check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Sure. Whatever you gotta do, Doctor. Sounds good. Just gettin’ a little tired sittin’ here, that’s all. Hurry it up a little, if you could? No offense.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale… again… good. Lungs sound a little diminished bilaterally, with some mild wheezing in the bases. Heart sounds regular, but slightly distant. Okay, your oxygen saturation is 92%. That’s a little low, but not critically so. Blood pressure is 150/90. A little elevated. No swelling noted. Now, let's take a look at your mouth. Your mucous membranes are quite dry.
PATIENT: Dry… yeah, I told you. Like sandpaper. Everything’s dry. You hearin’ me, Doctor? I’m tellin’ ya, dry! What does it mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, I hear you, Mr. Guilds. I am listening. The dryness, along with the shortness of breath, low oxygen, and elevated blood pressure, could be a few things. One possibility is that you’re dehydrated, which can make your breathing harder. It could also be related to your hypertension medication, or potentially something else going on. I want to order a CBC, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray to get a better picture of what’s happening. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Always tests. What good will that do? Look, I just want somethin’ to make me breathe easier and stop my mouth from feelin’ like the Sahara. What kind of pills are we talkin’ about here?
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, the tests will help me understand why you're feeling this way, so I can give you the right treatment. It’s not just about giving you a pill. I understand your frustration, but we need information before we can proceed. In the meantime, to help with the dryness, I’m going to recommend you increase your fluid intake significantly – at least 8 glasses of water a day. And I can prescribe you some artificial saliva to help with the mouth dryness. As for the breathing, we need to wait for the test results to determine if you need something more. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Water… eight glasses. That’s a lot of water. But… alright. Fine. Water and… what did you call it? Artificial… spittle? Okay. But if I don't feel better soon, I’m comin’ back here and I want somethin’ stronger. You hear me, Doctor? Don't want to be breathin’ like this for long.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Guilds, I understand. I’ll write you a prescription for the artificial saliva. And I'll put in the orders for the blood work and chest X-ray right away. The lab should be able to take the blood today, and we’ll schedule the X-ray for tomorrow. We will review the results as soon as they come in and discuss a plan then. I’m also going to give you a written list of instructions about increasing your fluid intake and what to watch out for – such as worsening shortness of breath or chest pain. Here, is a work note excusing you from work for the day to get these tests done. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Questions… no, I think I got it. Water, pills, tests. Sounds like a whole lotta trouble. Just… don't keep me waitin' too long. And make sure they take the blood gently. I don't like needles. .
