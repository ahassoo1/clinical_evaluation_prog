DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s my blood pressure. It’s been a little high lately, and my neighbour – she's a nurse – told me I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, good idea of your neighbour to suggest that. “A little high” can mean a lot of things. When did you first notice it being higher than usual?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was probably… around April, maybe? I started feeling a bit more tired than normal, and I noticed my head was pounding a couple times a week. That’s when I decided to take it at the pharmacy, and it was up a bit then.
DOCTOR: Alright, April… and you’ve noticed headaches along with the fatigue. Has anything changed since then?
PATIENT: Not really, to be honest. I've been eating pretty much the same, maybe a little more takeout because it's been so hot. And I'm working the same hours. Oh! Actually, my sister came to visit for a couple weeks in June, and I was doing a bit more running around then, getting things ready for her. Could that have something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Possibly. Stress and extra activity can raise your blood pressure temporarily. But we need to figure out if this is a sustained issue. Do you know what your blood pressure was at the pharmacy, roughly?
PATIENT: I think the pharmacist said it was around 140 over 90, maybe a little higher one day. She wasn’t too worried, just told me to keep an eye on it. But I figured I should get a doctor to take a look, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Okay, 140/90 is definitely something we should investigate. And it’s good you're being proactive. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Not really, no. No blurry vision, no chest pain… nothing like that. Just the tiredness and the headaches. Sometimes my fingers feel a little numb, but I thought that was just from working on my computer too much. I do a lot of data entry for a company, so I'm on it all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get some more information. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing major. I had the flu really bad one winter, and I had my wisdom teeth taken out when I was younger, but that’s about it. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that in my family either, as far as I know. My mom and dad were pretty healthy, both lived into their 80s.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, none that I'm aware of. I can take pretty much anything without a problem. I've had a couple of antibiotics over the years for colds, and never had a reaction.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning with breakfast. Nothing else. I try to eat healthy, but you know, you gotta have a little help sometimes!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure again. Then, I'll feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything sounds and feels normal so far, but your blood pressure is elevated, confirming what you’ve noticed. Heart rate is a little quick, but not alarmingly so. Pulse is good and reflexes are normal. I'm going to order some blood work, a basic metabolic panel and a lipid panel, just to get a better picture of your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. This will include checking your kidney function, electrolytes, and cholesterol levels. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work is fine. Whatever you think is best to figure things out. Hopefully, it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'll get the orders sent to the lab right now. They'll likely want a urine sample as well, just standard procedure. Once the results are back – usually a few days – we'll review them and discuss a plan. In the meantime, I want you to try to reduce your stress as much as possible, and try to get at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week, if you're able. Also, watch your sodium intake – try to avoid processed foods and salty snacks. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds okay. I can definitely try to cut back on the salt, and I do enjoy a walk now and then. Stress is the hard part, but I'll do my best. And 30 minutes of walking, that's not too bad. So, just wait for the results, then we talk again?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Just wait for the results, and the lab will let you know when they're available. We can schedule a follow-up appointment then, or we can talk over the phone, whichever you prefer. We’ll discuss the results and determine if we need to start any medication or make other changes. Do you have any questions for me right now before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You've explained everything really clearly. Just trying not to worry too much 'til I get the results. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mykeisha. I understand your concern, and we'll get to the bottom of this together. Remember, it's always better to be proactive. The lab will be in touch about the results. Take care, and try to relax. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, like severe headaches, chest pain, or shortness of breath, please don't hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, I'll see you soon. Have a good day.
