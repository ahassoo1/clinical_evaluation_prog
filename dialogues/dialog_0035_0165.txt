DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. Please have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just call me Clide. It's this fever. Keeps comin' back, you know? It's… annoying, to say the least. I just want to get rid of it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide. A recurring fever. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, it started… let me think… about three weeks ago, I guess. Started kinda slow, just felt warm, then it went up pretty quick. Lasted about two days, then went away. Thought I was good, but then it came back last week. Same thing, couple of days, then gone. And now it’s back again this morning. It's not super high, usually around 101, 102. Not a bad one, but it just won't stay gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks on and off. Around 101-102. And it seems to be coming back each time after a couple of days. Have you been checking your temperature regularly, or just when you feel warm?
PATIENT: Just when I feel warm, mostly. My wife, Elena, she's the one who gets the thermometer. She worries. I don’t bother with it unless I feel kinda bad, ya know? I figure if I feel alright, no need to stress about a number. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Clide. It's good Elena is keeping an eye on things. Besides the fever, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I've been a little tired, maybe. But I'm 65, ya know? I'm always a little tired. No cough, no aches, no… nothin' really. Just the fever. And the tiredness, but that could be anything. No chills or sweats, either, not that I've noticed. It just… feels like a regular fever, but it just won't quit.
DOCTOR: Okay, so primarily the fever, with some fatigue, but nothing else significant. Have you traveled anywhere recently, or been around anyone who’s been sick?
PATIENT: Nope. Haven't left Puerto Rico in years. And no, nobody around here's been sick that I know of. Elena and I mostly keep to ourselves. We go to church, see our grandkids sometimes, but nobody's been coughin' or sneezin' when I've seen 'em. I'd remember that, ya know? I'm pretty observant.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about any medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago. That was no fun, but I recovered okay. Other than that… I've got a little arthritis in my hands, but it’s not too bad. I see a chiropractor for that, actually. That's why I know you're Dr. Alzoubi, I looked you up to see if you worked with chiropractors! And… I guess that’s about it. High blood pressure, but I don’t take anything for it, doctor says to watch my salt.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal ten years ago, some arthritis, and high blood pressure monitored with diet. No medications currently. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had a problem with allergies. Elena's the one with the allergies, pollen mostly. I can eat anything, take anything. Never had a reaction to a pill or nothin’. She always checks for me, just in case, but I’m usually good. She's very careful.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any vitamins, supplements, or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, the one for older folks. Elena makes sure I take it. Says it’s good for my bones. Other than that, no. I don't really believe in all that herbal stuff, to be honest. Just the multivitamin. I think that’s all, Doctor. Really. I’m a pretty simple guy. I just want this fever to go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin. Let's do a quick physical exam to see if we can get a better idea of what's going on. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your throat, and feel your lymph nodes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. Just…try to be quick, if you don't mind. I've got a few appointments later today. Not important, but still… I like to keep busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds regular, lungs are clear. Your throat looks a little red, but no significant swelling or white patches. Your lymph nodes are slightly enlarged, but not dramatically so. I don’t feel any significant tenderness. Temperature is 101.8 Fahrenheit right now. I'm going to document these findings.
PATIENT: Alright. So, what does that mean? Is it somethin' serious? Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know if I need to worry. I don't want a long list of tests if it's just a little somethin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, Clide. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it's difficult to say definitively what's causing the recurring fever. The slightly enlarged lymph nodes and the redness in your throat could suggest a mild infection, potentially viral. However, the fact that it keeps coming back is a bit concerning. Given your age and the persistence of the fever, I'd like to order some basic blood work. It will help us rule out anything more serious and give us a clearer picture. We'll check your white blood cell count, electrolytes, and do a basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Ugh. I really didn't want that. But… I guess if you think it's necessary. Look, Doctor, I don't have insurance, so I'm a little worried about the cost. How much is this gonna set me back? Elena’s gonna kill me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Clide. I'll see if the lab has any options for a discounted rate, or if there are any programs available to help with the cost. It shouldn't be excessively expensive for these basic tests, but I'll get you the exact pricing information before we proceed. We can discuss options if it's going to be a significant financial burden. I want to make sure you get the care you need, and we can work within your means. Let me just quickly look up the lab's pricing… It looks like the basic panel will be around $120 - $150. We can see if they offer a self-pay discount, or if we can order just the most essential tests to keep the cost down. How does that sound?
PATIENT: $150? That's… rough. Elena's gonna have my hide. Look, is there anything else we could try first? Maybe just… watch it for another week? I feel okay, mostly. I can handle a little fever. I just want it to go away, you know? I really don't want to spend money on tests if it's just gonna be a little bug.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Clide. Given your concerns about the cost, we could try a "wait and see" approach for another week. However, I want to be very clear: if the fever persists or worsens, or if you develop any new symptoms – like a cough, shortness of breath, severe headache, or body aches – you need to seek medical attention immediately. We don’t want to delay treatment if something more serious is going on. We can also discuss over-the-counter medications to help manage the fever and discomfort in the meantime – acetaminophen or ibuprofen would be appropriate, as long as you don’t have any contraindications. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Okay. Okay, yeah. Watch it for another week. Acetaminophen, got it. Elena keeps some. If it gets worse, I’ll come back. But please, Doctor, I hope it doesn't. I really don’t want to spend that money. I just want to be able to go to church without feeling like I’m gonna pass out. Is that everything? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Clide. That’s everything for today. Just remember to monitor the fever, take acetaminophen as needed, and seek medical attention promptly if anything changes. I’m documenting our discussion, and I'll give you a summary to take home. Here's a paper with the recommendations, and the number to call if things get worse. And I wish you all the best – I hope you feel better soon, and can get back to church. Yes, you can go now.
