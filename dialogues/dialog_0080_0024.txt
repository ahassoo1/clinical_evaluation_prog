DOCTOR: Hi Kiante, welcome! I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. I need a letter, actually. To confirm I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but my travel insurance company requires it. They want a doctor's note saying I'm fit to travel by plane.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fit-to-fly letter. No problem, we can definitely get that sorted for you. To do that properly, I'll need to ask you a few questions, just to be thorough. It’s standard procedure, especially with travel insurance involved. First, have you been experiencing any health issues lately?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I was… very sad for a while, after my husband passed last year, but that’s… well, it’s getting better. Physically, I’m fine. No coughs, no pain, nothing like that. Just… trying to get back to normal, you know? I had a check-up with my primary care doctor about six months ago, and everything was good then.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. It takes a lot of strength to navigate something like that, and it’s good to hear you're on the path to getting back to normal. It's completely understandable that things would take time to settle. Just to be clear for my records, when you say “sad,” were you receiving any treatment for that, like medication or therapy?
PATIENT: Yes, I was. For a few months, I saw a therapist, and I was on some medication for anxiety. It helped a lot, honestly. I stopped both about three months ago, though. My doctor and I agreed it was time, and I've been doing okay without it. I don’t have any issues with it now, I promise. It was just… a rough patch. I don't need anything for it anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, you were on medication for anxiety, stopped three months ago, and haven't needed to restart it. And you're currently not seeing a therapist?
PATIENT: That’s right. No therapy currently. I'm managing things on my own now. It was… helpful to talk it through for a while, but I feel strong enough to handle things myself. I do still sometimes… get a little down, but nothing major. Just normal grief, I think. It’s been a year, after all.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to cover all bases, do you have any other medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've always been pretty healthy, actually. My primary care doctor did a full blood panel at my last check-up – the one six months ago – and everything was normal. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, no asthma. I don’t take any regular medications, other than a multivitamin sometimes. Really, I’m very… straightforward, medically speaking. I’m not complicated.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Kiante. It’s good to hear. Just one more quick section of questions, then we'll do a quick physical exam to be completely sure. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. And… no hospitalizations. Nothing like that. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but it wasn’t serious enough to be hospitalized. Just a cast for six weeks, that was it. Everything else… I’ve been very lucky, really. I’ve always been careful. I haven’t had any major illnesses or anything like that. I think that’s everything, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s fantastic. So, no surgeries, no hospitalizations, and a broken arm as a child. Now, just to be thorough for the fit-to-fly letter, I'd like to quickly check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs. It'll just take a few minutes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Absolutely. Whatever you need to do. I understand it’s important for the letter. Please, go ahead. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’m just going to take your blood pressure first. 120/80, that’s excellent. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Sounds good, nice and regular. Lungs are clear. Everything sounds perfectly normal. Just so I can document everything properly, can you tell me your height and weight?
PATIENT: Oh, of course. I'm 176 centimeters tall, and I weigh 131 pounds. I… I know those numbers because I was trying to be healthier, and I check them every couple of weeks. It’s been… hard to keep up with it, but I try.
DOCTOR: Okay, 176 centimeters and 131 pounds. That’s good information. Alright, Kiante. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam I just did, you appear to be in excellent health. There are no contraindications to air travel that I can identify. I'm happy to write you the fit-to-fly letter. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should note on the letter?
PATIENT: No, I don't. No allergies at all, thankfully. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. You don’t need to put anything about allergies on the letter. Just… confirm I'm okay to fly, please. That would be wonderful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies noted. Here you go. This letter states that, based on my examination today, you are medically fit to travel by air. It also confirms you have no known allergies. Please keep this with you when you travel, just in case. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, perfect! Thank you so much, Doctor Rosanova. This is… exactly what I needed. It’s a huge weight off my mind. No, that’s everything. I really appreciate your time and your help. You’ve been very kind. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. I'm glad I could help. Have a safe and pleasant trip! And if you have any concerns at all while you're traveling, don't hesitate to seek medical attention. Take care.
