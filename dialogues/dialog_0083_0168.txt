DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pandolfi. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… satisfactory to meet you as well. I suppose you could say I’m seeking… guidance. I’ve recently begun seeing someone, and I want to ensure everything is… appropriate, health-wise. One doesn’t want unpleasant surprises, you understand. It’s a new development, and I believe a professional assessment is… prudent.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Pandolfi. That's very thoughtful of you to consider your health in this new development. We want to make sure you're well-protected and have all the information you need. So, to clarify, you're interested in a general health checkup with a focus on sexually transmitted infections and contraception options, is that correct?
PATIENT: Contraception? Oh, no. Absolutely not. My husband and I have… established methods. No, I simply wish to be certain he isn't… carrying anything undesirable. It's a matter of… discretion, you see. And frankly, one can never be too careful with… certain types of people. It’s more of a… screening, really. For his benefit, as much as mine, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Pandolfi. A screening to assess your partner’s health status. That is perfectly reasonable. To start, could you tell me a little about your partner?
PATIENT: Well. He's… older. Considerably so. And… a bit of a free spirit, shall we say? He travels frequently for… business. Important business. He's… charming, quite charming, and very insistent on maintaining his… privacy. That’s why I’m here, of course. One doesn't pry, but one does have a responsibility to oneself. He’s… European. That's probably all that's relevant, wouldn't you agree? It's not as if I need a full dossier, merely confirmation of good health.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that information, Ms. Pandolfi. Knowing his travel history is helpful. To get a better understanding of what tests would be most appropriate, could you tell me a little about your own sexual history?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? Is that truly necessary? I’ve been married for twenty-five years. A respectable marriage. I find the implication rather… forward. I’m not here to discuss my entire life story, merely to ascertain if this… gentleman is a potential risk. Surely my marital status is sufficient information. I would have thought a clinic like this would uphold a certain level of… decorum.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to question that, Ms. Pandolfi. I apologize – that was a lapse in my judgment and an unnecessary question. Your long and stable marriage is relevant, and I should have phrased my inquiry differently. I am simply trying to gather enough information to recommend the most appropriate screening tests for both of you, given potential exposure risks. I apologize for making you uncomfortable. Would you be comfortable if we focus on the tests we can offer to assess your partner's health, and discuss any specific concerns you have about his travel history or lifestyle?
PATIENT: That is… acceptable. Focusing on him is the sensible approach. I trust you have a comprehensive panel available? I want to be certain we cover everything. And frankly, I expect discreet handling of the results. I wouldn’t want this matter… unnecessarily publicized. A small town… reputations are easily tarnished, you understand. Do you offer a… confidential service? I wouldn't want anyone asking questions.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Pandolfi. We take patient confidentiality very seriously. All testing and results are handled with the utmost discretion, in accordance with HIPAA regulations. We have a comprehensive STI panel that tests for common infections, including chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HIV, and hepatitis. We can also add tests for herpes simplex virus if you'd like. All results are shared directly with you, and we can discuss them privately. No information will be released to anyone without your express consent. Would you like me to proceed with ordering that panel for your partner?
PATIENT: Yes, please do. The full panel. And the herpes test, as well. One can never be too cautious. Now, how does this… process work? Does he need to come here himself? Because, as I mentioned, he is… rather private. And I'm certain he wouldn’t appreciate any… intrusions. Perhaps a home testing kit? Is that an option?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Ms. Pandolfi. While at-home testing kits are available, they are not always as accurate as laboratory testing, and may not detect all infections. Furthermore, some tests require a blood sample, which would require a professional to draw. Given his privacy concerns, we can offer a few options. We can schedule an appointment at a less busy time, perhaps early in the morning or late in the afternoon, to minimize contact with other patients. Alternatively, if he is willing, a mobile phlebotomist can come to your home to draw the blood sample. However, this may incur an additional fee. For the most accurate results, I would recommend a visit to the clinic, but I understand his reluctance. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: A mobile phlebotomist… that seems the most… civilized option. Yes, I believe that would be acceptable. As long as they are… discreet and professional. And I trust they are properly certified? I wouldn’t want anyone unqualified handling the sample. What is the cost associated with this… convenience? And how long will it take to receive the results? I’d prefer a prompt turnaround time. One doesn’t want to be left in suspense indefinitely.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. The cost for the full STI panel with mobile phlebotomy is $450. That includes the lab fees and the travel charge for the phlebotomist. The phlebotomist is fully certified and adheres to strict confidentiality protocols. Typically, we receive the results within 3-5 business days. I will personally call you as soon as they are available to schedule a private consultation to discuss them. Would you like me to schedule the phlebotomist appointment now?
PATIENT: Yes, please do. But… I have a request. Could you ensure it’s a female phlebotomist? I would… prefer a woman handling the sample. It’s simply a matter of… personal comfort. And please, schedule it for a weekday afternoon. I have… commitments in the mornings. Thursday, perhaps? If that’s convenient. And… is there anything I need to do to prepare? Any specific instructions for my… companion?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Pandolfi. I can absolutely arrange for a female phlebotomist. Let me see… Thursday afternoon is available. How does 2:00 PM sound?
PATIENT: 2:00 PM will have to do. It’s not ideal, but… acceptable. As for instructions, perhaps a simple reminder to… refrain from any… strenuous activity beforehand? And to hydrate. Is that sufficient? I wouldn’t want to… complicate matters unnecessarily. Now, what paperwork is involved? Do I need to fill out any forms? I trust this won’t be a lengthy process. I have a rather busy schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: That's perfect, Ms. Pandolfi. 2:00 PM on Thursday it is. As for preparation, simply advising him to stay hydrated and refrain from strenuous activity the day of the appointment is sufficient. There is a consent form and a brief medical history questionnaire that I’d like you to complete. It shouldn’t take more than 15 minutes. I have copies here. I’ll also need a copy of his insurance card, if he has one, though that’s not required. Here are the forms. Please let me know if you have any questions as you fill them out. I'll leave you to it for a few moments.
PATIENT: Very well. I suppose I can manage that. Insurance… he prefers to keep those matters private. I doubt he’ll provide a card. But I’ll do my best. Hopefully, this won’t be too… involved. Thank you, Doctor.
