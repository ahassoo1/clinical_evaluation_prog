DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s about getting surgery. Weight loss surgery, that is. My wife helped me set up the appointment. Honestly, I don't really remember all the details about why exactly, just that we talked about it a lot and decided this was the best way forward.
DOCTOR: Okay, weight loss surgery. I see. It's not uncommon to feel a little overwhelmed with all the information involved, and it sounds like your wife has been very supportive. To get started, and to see if you're a good candidate, could you tell me a little bit about your weight history?
PATIENT: My weight history? That’s… a tough one. I’ve always been… bigger, I guess. I don’t really remember a time when I wasn’t trying to lose weight. Lots of diets over the years. Some worked for a little while, but I always ended up gaining it back. It's been… a long time of this, you know? I can’t really give you numbers or dates, I'm sorry. It just… happened slowly, over the years.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. It’s common for people to have difficulty recalling specific details over a long period of time. The important thing is you've recognized this has been a long-term struggle. Do you happen to know approximately what your highest weight was, even a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Hmm… highest weight. I think… maybe around 280? It could be a little more, a little less. I weighed myself a while back, but I don't really keep track now. It was definitely over 250, though. And right now… probably somewhere around 260, give or take. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, thank you. And what is your current height?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, my height. That’s another thing I don’t really… remember being told recently. I’m… not very tall. Five foot… maybe five foot one? Something like that. I always felt shorter than everyone else. It’s around there, I think. Does it need to be exact?
DOCTOR: It’s okay if it’s not exact, Mr. Kochubey. We can measure it here if you’d like. Five foot one sounds reasonable. Alright, so around 260 currently, a highest weight of approximately 280, and about five foot one. Now, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Let me think. My wife handles most of the doctor stuff, to be honest. I know I have… high cholesterol, I think. And… my blood pressure was a little high at one point, but I don’t know if it still is. I don't think I have diabetes. No, definitely not diabetes. I haven’t been told that. I do snore… really loudly, my wife says. Does that count as something?
DOCTOR: Snoring can sometimes be related to sleep apnea, which is something we’d want to investigate further if you are considering weight loss surgery. Okay, so high cholesterol, possible high blood pressure, and significant snoring. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And… I think I had a hernia fixed maybe ten years ago? Something like that. It was… a small one. Nothing major. That’s all I can really think of right now. My wife might remember more details, she always does.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsils out as a child and a hernia repair approximately ten years ago. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just a cholesterol pill. One a day. And… sometimes, if my back is really bothering me, I’ll take ibuprofen. But that’s it, really. Nothing else regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a cholesterol medication daily and ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always asks me that question and I always say no. I eat everything, pretty much. No allergies that I’m aware of. Nothing I need to worry about there.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Never have. My wife doesn’t like smoking, so I never started. I’ve never been a smoker. Thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good. And how much alcohol do you typically drink in a week?
PATIENT: Alcohol… Not a lot, really. Maybe a couple of beers on the weekend, sometimes. If we’re watching a game or something. It’s not a regular thing, though. My wife and I don’t drink very often. Probably not enough to worry about, honestly. A couple on Saturday, if that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of beers on the weekend, occasionally. Now, what is your typical activity level like?
PATIENT: Activity level… Not great, to be honest. I work in retail, so I'm on my feet a bit during the day, but it's not like I'm running around. I mostly just… stand and help customers. I don’t really exercise. I used to walk a little more, but… not so much lately. I try to help around the house, but it's not much of a workout. Mostly just standing and walking, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. Standing and walking at work, some light activity around the house. Alright, Mr. Kochubey, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could please have a seat here, we’ll start with your height and weight to confirm what you’ve told me, and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam. Okay, so height is five foot one inch and weight is 262 pounds. Now, if you could please remove your shirt and bra, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any masses or tenderness. Blood pressure is 158/92. Your blood pressure is a little elevated. We'll want to monitor that closely. Overall, everything seems reasonably stable, but the elevated blood pressure and your weight are factors we’ll need to consider.
PATIENT: Okay. Elevated blood pressure… that’s not good, is it? My wife always tells me I need to watch my salt intake. I guess she was right. What does this mean for the surgery? Is it still possible?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you’re aware of your blood pressure and your wife is encouraging you to be mindful of your salt intake. It is something we need to address before considering surgery, Mr. Kochubey, as it increases the risk of complications. However, it doesn’t necessarily mean surgery is off the table. We would need to get it under better control first. That could involve lifestyle changes – diet, exercise, stress management – and potentially medication. Before we proceed further, I'd like to order some blood work to get a more comprehensive picture of your health, including cholesterol levels, kidney function, and blood sugar. I’d also recommend an EKG to evaluate your heart function. Do you have any objections to these tests?
PATIENT: No, no objections at all. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood work, EKG… sounds good. I just want to get healthy, you know? And if that means tests and medication, then so be it. My wife will be happy to hear we're taking it seriously. Where do we go from here?
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Mr. Kochubey. It's good to have a supportive partner, and your willingness to address these concerns is a positive step. I’ll have my assistant draw the blood work for you today. We’ll also schedule an EKG appointment. Once we have those results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan for managing your blood pressure and overall health. In the meantime, I'd recommend focusing on making small, sustainable changes to your diet – reducing your salt intake, as your wife suggests, and incorporating more fruits and vegetables – and trying to increase your activity level gradually. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything really clearly, Doctor. I think… I think I'm just relieved we're getting started. It's been a long time coming. Thank you. Where do I go to get the blood work done?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I understand it’s been a long journey, and I’m glad we’re finally taking steps forward. My assistant, Sarah, will escort you to the lab just down the hall. She'll handle all the paperwork. Once you’ve had your blood drawn, you can return to the waiting room, and we’ll get the scheduling for the EKG taken care of. Here’s a summary sheet of today's discussion and the tests we ordered, for your records. Please don't hesitate to reach out to my office if you have any questions or concerns before our follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Okay, great. Thank you so much, Doctor Beinborn. And thank you to Sarah, too. I appreciate everything.
