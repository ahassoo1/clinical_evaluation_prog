DOCTOR: Hi Philipp, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… my heart. It feels… fast sometimes. Not always, but it happens. Like it’s flapping. My wife, she says I should come see someone.
DOCTOR: Okay, “fast” and “flapping” – I understand. That sounds concerning, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out, especially if your wife is worried. To get a better idea of what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about when this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not when I’m doing hard work. Like… at the factory, everything okay. It’s more… when I’m resting. Maybe watching TV. Or before I sleep. Sometimes it wakes me up. It doesn’t hurt, just… fast. And weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it happens mostly at rest, or when you’re trying to relax, and sometimes even wakes you up. That’s helpful. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Maybe… three months? I don’t remember exactly. It started slow. Just a few times. Now it’s… more often. Maybe two or three times a week? Hard to say for sure. I don’t write these things down, you know?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, don’t worry about writing things down. Three months, and increasing to two or three times a week… okay. And when this happens, how long does the fast heartbeat last?
PATIENT: Usually… not long. Maybe a few minutes? Sometimes it stops quick. Other times… maybe ten, fifteen minutes. I try to take deep breaths. That helps sometimes. But not always. It makes me nervous, you know?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense that it would make you nervous. Okay, a few minutes to fifteen minutes, and deep breaths sometimes help. Have you noticed anything else happen when this fast heartbeat starts?
PATIENT: Umm… sometimes I feel a little… dizzy. Not falling down dizzy, just… light. And maybe a little short of breath. Like I can’t get enough air. But it goes away when the heart stops flapping.
DOCTOR: Okay, dizziness and shortness of breath along with the fast heartbeats. That’s good information. Have you had anything like this happen before, or is this completely new?
PATIENT: No. Never before. I’ve always been… okay. No problems with my heart. I eat good, mostly. And I don’t smoke. My father… he had some trouble with his legs when he was old, but nothing with his heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, this is new for you, and no family history of heart problems that you’re aware of. Let's talk about any other medical conditions you might have, or medications you’re taking. Have you been diagnosed with anything else, like high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t take any pills. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache. But not often. I try to drink water. I go to the doctor only when I really need to. This heart thing… it's new. I don't like taking pills if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other medical conditions and no regular medications. Good to know. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My wife gives me some medicine when I get a cold, and I never had a problem. I eat everything. Spicy food, everything. I'm Yemeni, you know? We like our food strong. No problems with allergies. Never.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. It'll help me get a better idea of what's going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s okay. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. My wife says you’re a good doctor. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just lie back on the examination table, that would be perfect. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Just breathe normally. Okay, your heart rate is currently 88 beats per minute, which is within the normal range. I do hear a slight irregularity, though. It’s not major, but I want to document it. Lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 130/80, also within the normal range. Pulse is regular, but a little weak. Okay, and I’m going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Okay. What are you looking for? Is something wrong? You said “irregularity”... is that bad? I don’t understand “irregularity”.
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking questions. "Irregularity" just means the rhythm of your heartbeat isn't perfectly even. It can be perfectly normal, or it can sometimes indicate a problem. That’s why I want to rule things out. Your reflexes are normal. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a simple EKG – an electrocardiogram. It’s a painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It’ll help us see if there’s anything causing the irregularity, like an extra beat, or a fast rhythm. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: EKG… is that like… needles? I don't like needles. I don’t like hospitals, either. My wife, she had to go to the hospital once, and it was… not good. Is there anything else we can do? Can’t you just… tell me what’s wrong?
DOCTOR: No needles at all! It's completely painless. We just attach small stickers – electrodes – to your chest, arms, and legs. They read the electrical signals from your heart. It takes only a few minutes. I understand your concerns about hospitals, and I completely respect that. This is something we can do right here in the clinic. It won’t take long at all, and it will give me much more information so I can accurately tell you what’s going on. It's best to be sure, rather than guessing, wouldn't you agree?
PATIENT: Okay. No needles… that’s good. Stickers… okay. If it’s quick, and I don’t have to go to the hospital… okay. But you tell me what’s wrong after the stickers, okay? I don’t want to wait. My wife will worry if I take too long. What are you thinking it is? You must have some idea.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll do the EKG right away, and I'll explain the results to you immediately afterward. I promise. As for what it could be… it’s hard to say for sure without the test. It could be a benign arrhythmia – just a harmless irregular heartbeat. Sometimes it’s caused by stress, caffeine, or dehydration. Less commonly, it could be something more serious, which is why we need to rule things out. It’s important not to jump to conclusions, though. The EKG will help us narrow it down. Let's get this done, and we’ll have a better understanding of what's going on. Do you have any questions before we start?
PATIENT: No, I think… no. Just… quick, okay? My wife is making dinner. She makes good lamb. I don’t want to miss it. Where do the stickers go? Are they cold? I don't like cold things on my skin.
DOCTOR: They aren’t cold at all, they're room temperature. I’ll make sure they’re comfortable. We just need to make sure they have good contact with your skin. Okay, just breathe normally. We're all set. This will take just a few minutes. Just relax and breathe.
PATIENT: Okay... it feels… funny. Like a little tickle. Is this normal? It’s making me a little nervous again. What are you looking at? What does it mean when the line goes up and down? My wife says I worry too much. Is it bad if the line is… jagged?
DOCTOR: The little tickle is perfectly normal, it's just the machine sensing your heart's electrical activity. And it is okay to be a little nervous, I understand. The line going up and down represents the different parts of your heartbeat. The peaks and valleys show how your heart muscle contracts and relaxes. A smooth line is what we usually like to see. Sometimes, small variations are normal. What I'm looking at now is the overall rhythm and looking for any unusual patterns. The machine is giving me a lot of information! Okay, the test is almost finished... just a few more seconds. Let me just take a look at the printout now.
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Is it bad? You’re looking… serious. My wife said I should have gone to the doctor sooner. What did it show? Just tell me. Don't make me wait. Is it my heart? Is it broken?
DOCTOR: Okay, Philipp. The EKG shows that you have what we call Premature Atrial Contractions, or PACs. That means your heart is occasionally beating a little bit early. It's causing the irregular rhythm we detected. You see these little extra blips here?
PATIENT: Blips? I don’t understand… are those… bad? Is it serious? Do I need… surgery? My wife will be so worried. I just want to feel normal again. What do I do? Tell me what happens now. Is there a pill? I don’t want to be sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths. It's good you're asking questions. The good news is, PACs are very common and, in most cases, they are not serious. They often happen in healthy people and don't require any treatment. Think of it like a little stumble in your heartbeat. It’s not usually dangerous. Now, that being said, we want to rule out anything that could be causing them. Since you're experiencing symptoms – the palpitations, the dizziness – and they're becoming more frequent, I'd like to order a few blood tests to check your electrolyte levels, thyroid function, and rule out any other underlying causes. We also might consider a Holter monitor – that’s a small device you wear for 24-48 hours that records your heart rhythm continuously. It will give us a better idea of how often these PACs are happening, and if there are any patterns. As for medication, we typically don't treat PACs with pills unless they are very frequent and causing significant symptoms. We'll see what the blood tests and Holter monitor show first. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Holter… like a hotel? You want me to wear a hotel? And blood tests… lots of needles? I don’t like needles. My wife says I’m a baby when it comes to needles. But… if it will make me feel normal again… okay. But no surgery, right? I don’t want surgery. And is it… dangerous to just ignore it? Could I just… try to relax more? I’ll drink less coffee. What happens if I just… wait and see?
DOCTOR: No, a Holter monitor isn't a hotel! It’s a small, portable device – about the size of a pager – that you wear on your chest. It records your heart rhythm continuously for a day or two. It's painless, and you can go about your normal activities. And yes, I understand your concern about needles. We only need a small amount of blood for the tests. We’ll try to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. Now, to answer your question about ignoring it, while most PACs are harmless, it’s good to investigate why they're happening, especially since you're experiencing symptoms. We want to rule out anything underlying, like thyroid problems or electrolyte imbalances. Trying to relax more and reducing coffee is a great idea, and it might help. But we also want to be thorough and get some objective data with the blood tests and Holter monitor. Surgery is not on the table at all. We’re nowhere near needing surgery. So, let’s start with the blood tests and the Holter monitor. We’ll get those results back, and then we can discuss the next steps. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Okay. Blood tests… and the… Holter thing. No surgery. That’s good. And you promise to tell me everything? No secrets? My wife… she worries a lot. She’ll want to know everything. And… how long do I have to wear the Holter thing? Can I still go to work? And what if… what if it finds something bad? You promise to tell me everything?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I promise to tell you everything. No secrets, I understand how important it is that you and your wife are fully informed. We’ll discuss the results of every test in detail, and we’ll go over all your options. I’ll explain everything in a way that’s easy to understand. As for the Holter monitor, you’ll wear it for 24-48 hours. You can go to work as usual, you can exercise, you can sleep – just avoid swimming or taking a shower while it’s on. Now, regarding finding something bad… it’s unlikely, but it’s always good to be prepared. If we do find anything concerning, we’ll discuss it thoroughly, explain all your options, and make a plan together. We’ll consider a referral to a cardiologist – a heart specialist – if needed. But let’s not worry about that right now. We’re just gathering information. Let’s start with the blood tests and Holter monitor. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood work, and I’ll get you set up with the Holter monitor. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Okay… a plan. Blood tests and the Holter… thing. No needles, or just a little? And I can still go to work. And you’ll tell me everything? And… if it’s bad, you’ll send me to a heart doctor? Okay. That sounds… okay. Write the thing. And then… can I go home and tell my wife? She's making lamb. I don't want to miss the lamb.
DOCTOR: Yes, just a little bit of blood for the tests. We’ll try to make it as quick and painless as possible. And yes, you can absolutely go home and tell your wife. Enjoy your lamb! It's important to enjoy your meals and take care of yourself. Here you go. The blood tests can be done at [Local Lab Name]. Just bring this requisition with you. The instructions explain everything you need to know about the Holter monitor. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. I’m glad we had this conversation, Philipp. We’re going to get to the bottom of this. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Take care, and enjoy your lamb!
PATIENT: Okay… thank you, Doctor. You’re very… kind. I hope the lamb is good. And… I’ll call if I have questions.
