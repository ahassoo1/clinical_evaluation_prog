DOCTOR: Hi Nani, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, thank you for seeing me. It’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I’ve just not been myself lately. Feeling very low, you understand? I suppose that’s why I’m here. I haven’t the energy for… well, for much of anything, really. And truthfully, I’d like to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Not yourself” and low energy… that’s a good starting point. And I certainly want to be as efficient as possible. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about when you started feeling this way?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It didn’t happen overnight, you see. Perhaps… six months ago? Around November, I think. Yes, November. After my grandson moved to Canada. It's been… quiet since then. Not that I don’t want him to pursue his dreams, of course, but… it’s just different now. Everything feels a little… muted.
DOCTOR: Okay, November… so about nine months now. And it seems to have coincided with your grandson moving. That’s important information. Has this feeling been constant since November, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes, Doctor. But mostly… mostly it is there. Some days are better than others, of course. But even on the “good” days, there’s a weight, you understand? Like a cloud hanging over everything. It’s not a crippling sadness, not exactly. More… a persistent dullness. And it's been getting… longer, these periods of feeling low. Shorter and shorter the bright spells, if you follow me.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do follow you. A persistent dullness that’s increasing in frequency… Okay. And has this been interfering with your daily life at all?
PATIENT: Interfering… yes, I suppose it has. I used to be very active, you see. Lifeguarding in the summers, ski patrol in the winter. Kept me young, it did. But… I’ve found myself making excuses. Saying I’m tired, or the weather’s not good. I still go sometimes, but… I don't enjoy it as much. And even simple things, like keeping the house tidy… it feels like too much effort. I’ve always been a very independent woman, Doctor. This… this is frustrating, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a decrease in activities you used to enjoy, and difficulty with even routine tasks. That's helpful to know. Now, let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… yes, that’s been a bother too. I don’t sleep badly, exactly. But it’s… restless. I wake up several times during the night. And even when I’m asleep, it doesn’t feel… restorative. I used to wake up feeling refreshed. Now? Just tired. And I sometimes find myself getting up earlier than usual, unable to get back to sleep. It’s not a regular thing, but it happens often enough to be… annoying. Is that the right word?
DOCTOR: “Annoying” is perfectly fine. Restless sleep, waking up feeling unrefreshed… Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes. I used to have quite the appetite, enjoyed my food. Nigerian cuisine, you know, very flavorful. But lately… it’s just not the same. I don’t feel hungry as often. And when I do eat, it doesn’t give me the same satisfaction. I've lost a little weight, I think, though I haven’t bothered to check. It’s not a dramatic change, but… I’m noticing it. I mostly eat because I know I should, not because I want to.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and weight loss. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness, or have you had any thoughts of harming yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Absolutely not. Harm myself? Never. I’m a woman of faith, you see. And I’ve lived a long life. I have my family, my memories… I’m not sad, exactly. Just… tired of feeling this way. Hopeless? No. Discouraged, perhaps. But not hopeless. I want to feel like myself again, that's all. I just… I don't want this to be my new normal. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I absolutely understand. That’s very reassuring to hear. Okay, let's move on to some other areas. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I have high blood pressure, Doctor. Been managing it with medication for years now. And my knees… well, they’re not what they used to be. A bit of arthritis, from all the skiing and swimming. Nothing major, though. I see my GP regularly, he monitors everything. I haven't been to him recently, though, maybe six months ago now for a check-up. Other than that… I'm generally quite healthy, for my age. I believe a good constitution is a gift from God.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, and some arthritis in the knees. And you see your GP regularly. That's good. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, yes! I take a vitamin D supplement. The doctor recommended it, said it was good for the bones. And occasionally, when my knees are acting up, I take some over-the-counter ibuprofen. But that’s only when needed, not every day. And that's about it, I think. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin D supplement and ibuprofen as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. None that I know of. I've always been very careful about what I eat and what I take. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My mother always said a strong stomach is a blessing. So, no allergies. That's one less thing to worry about, isn't it? I just want to get to the bottom of this feeling, and get back to enjoying my life. This is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: It is, and we will. Okay, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any instances of depression, anxiety, or other mental health conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a difficult question, Doctor. We don't really talk about those things in my family, you understand? It wasn't considered… proper. But now that you mention it, my aunt – my mother’s sister – she was… a bit fragile. She spent a lot of time indoors, and never really recovered after my uncle passed away. People said she was “sensitive”. Whether that was depression, I don’t know. But she certainly wasn’t herself for many years. And my cousin, on my father’s side, he had a drinking problem… which I always suspected was a way of coping with something. But beyond that… not that I know of. It wasn’t something discussed openly. Is that helpful? It's a bit vague, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, actually. It gives me something to consider. Okay, one last area to cover before the physical exam. Could you tell me a little bit about your social life?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not what it used to be, Doctor. My husband passed away ten years ago, and… things haven’t been the same since. I have my children, of course, and my grandchildren. But they all have their own lives, you understand? My son lives in Lagos, and my daughter is busy with her job and her family. I see them when I can, but it’s not the same as having someone around every day. I used to have a close group of friends at the church, but… many of them have passed away, or moved away. I attend services regularly, but… it's more of a solitary thing now. I find myself spending a lot of time alone, at home. It’s quiet. Too quiet, perhaps. If you understand me, Doctor? I miss the company. I truly do. I’m not complaining, mind you. Just stating facts.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. That sounds… lonely. Okay, Nani, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It gives me a much clearer picture of what’s going on. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Let’s get it over with, shall we? The sooner we figure this out, the better. I appreciate you listening to me. I really do. Just… please be quick, if you would be so kind. I have some errands to run this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breaths in… and out… Good. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Anything feel uncomfortable?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that doesn’t bother me at all. Perfectly comfortable. Just… a little cold, perhaps. But that's the weather for you, isn’t it? Always unpredictable. Continue, please. Let’s get this done. I’m not one for lingering, you understand. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. That's a little… sensitive. Not painful, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. I haven’t been eating properly, as I mentioned. Perhaps that’s it? Indigestion, or something. It comes and goes, though. Not constant. But yes, that spot… a little tender. But please, don’t worry about it too much. I suspect it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, noted. Let’s check your reflexes… Just relax your arm… Good. And the other one… Good. They seem normal. Your ears and throat look clear. Blood pressure is 140/90, which is a bit elevated, but not unexpected given your history. The nurse tells me you are 180 centimeters and 78 kilograms. Okay. And finally, let’s just do a quick neurological assessment. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can follow your finger. Perfectly well, I might add. I have excellent eyesight, for my age. Continue, please. I’m quite capable, you know. I've never had any problems with my vision. I do hope this won't take much longer. This is getting rather tedious, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Can you squeeze my hands as tight as you can?
PATIENT: There you are, Doctor. As strong as I can manage. I used to be quite the swimmer, you know. Strong arms and legs. Though they’re not what they used to be, of course. But perfectly adequate. Continue, please. I’m starting to feel a little… restless. Are we almost done?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And finally, can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There. As you can see, perfectly steady on my feet. Though my knees might disagree with me later. But that’s to be expected. Now, can we please discuss what this all means? I’m not one for unnecessary examinations, you understand. Let's get to the root of the problem, shall we?
DOCTOR: Okay, Nani, thank you. That was very helpful. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, I suspect you’re experiencing symptoms of depression. It’s very common, especially after significant life changes, like the loss of your husband and your grandson moving away. The low energy, loss of appetite, sleep disturbances, and feelings of sadness or dullness… they all fit. The tenderness in your abdomen could be related to stress or changes in your eating habits. It’s important to remember that depression is a treatable condition. It’s not a sign of weakness, and you’re not alone in this. It's understandable to feel this way. Do you have any questions about what I’ve said?
PATIENT: Depression, you say? Hmm. Well, I suppose that’s… possible. I never thought of it that way, to be honest. Just thought I was… getting old. Losing my zest, as they say. But it’s… unsettling to hear it called a “condition.” It sounds rather serious. And frankly, Doctor, I'm not one for taking pills. Are there… other options? I've always believed in a strong mind and a positive outlook. Surely, that counts for something. And how long will this… “condition” last? I have errands to run, you understand. I can’t be spending weeks wallowing in sadness. Can you be concise, please? I appreciate your compassion, but I'm a practical woman. What can be done?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re practical, and you want to know what can be done. Medication is often very effective, but it’s not the only option. We can explore other treatments, like talk therapy, also known as psychotherapy. It can help you process your feelings and develop coping strategies. There are also lifestyle changes that can help, like regular exercise, a healthy diet, and social activities. It's important to remember that this isn't about “wallowing in sadness.” It’s about addressing an imbalance in your brain chemistry and finding ways to feel like yourself again. The duration varies from person to person. Some people feel better within a few weeks, while others may need several months of treatment. But we can start with a plan and see how you respond. I'm going to write a referral for a therapist. It's a good idea to schedule a consultation to discuss your options. In the meantime, I'll also order some blood work to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms, like thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Therapy… hmm. I suppose talking might help, though I’m not sure. I’ve always been a private person. But very well, a consultation. And the blood work… yes, that sounds sensible. Rule out the obvious, as they say. But please, Doctor, no long-term commitments. I have a busy life, you understand. I can’t be spending hours on this. And I’m not keen on discussing my personal life with strangers. Just a quick assessment, if possible. And could you recommend someone who is… efficient? I don’t want to waste time. I appreciate you being practical, Doctor. Now, about the referral… do they take private insurance? I have good coverage, you see. And how long will it take to get an appointment? I need to schedule this quickly. This is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns. I'll recommend Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s highly respected, very efficient, and accepts your private insurance. Here's the referral form with her contact information. Her office is about fifteen minutes from here, and they typically have appointments available within a week. The blood work can be done at the lab next door. They take walk-ins, so you shouldn’t have to wait long. Here’s the lab order. It’s a standard panel, shouldn’t take more than fifteen minutes. As for the therapy, it’s completely up to you how much you share, and how long you continue. Dr. Sharma will work with you to develop a plan that’s comfortable for you. I want to emphasize that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. And I'm here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions, or concerns?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you. Dr. Sharma sounds… acceptable. And the lab next door is convenient. Fifteen minutes… that’s reasonable. I suppose I can spare fifteen minutes. This is… satisfactory. No, I don’t think I have any further questions at this time. You've been… efficient, I’ll give you that. I appreciate your professionalism, Doctor. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have errands to run. I trust this will be the end of it? I sincerely hope so. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Nani. I’ll make a note to follow up with you in a week to see how you're doing. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon. .
