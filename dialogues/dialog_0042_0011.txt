DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Look, I ain’t got all day, so let’s just get this over with. I need… a paper. A paper sayin’ I’m okay for somethin’. A… a fixin’ thing. A cosmetic… procedure. That’s what the young lady on the phone called it. Don't rightly recall all the details. I just need the okay so I can… proceed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop, I understand. You need a medical clearance for a cosmetic procedure. No problem at all, we can certainly get that sorted out for you. To do that properly, though, I’ll need to ask you some questions just to make sure it's safe for you to proceed. It's standard procedure, even for something like this. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I been workin’ with towers and radios my whole life. Climbin’ and fixin’. That’s what I do. I ain't been sittin' in no doctor’s office. I don't have medical conditions. I’m… robust. Sturdy, even. I can’t recall anythin’ specific. Maybe a little… ache here and there, from the climb, but nothin’ a little liniment can’t fix. What kinda procedures are we talkin’ about, anyway? Is this gonna be a long thing?
DOCTOR: I understand you're healthy and active, Mr. Honcoop, and that's wonderful. It's good you’re sturdy. And I apologize if I'm asking a lot of questions – it's just important to cover all the bases. The procedure you mentioned on the phone was a cosmetic procedure, and I understand it involves some skin resurfacing. But, to ensure it’s safe, I need to understand your overall health a bit better. Even if you haven't been formally diagnosed with anything, have you ever been treated for any health problems in the past?
PATIENT: Skin resurfacing? That's what they called it. I just want to look a little… fresher. I ain’t lookin’ to climb mountains, just get a little somethin' done. Treated for… well, there was that time in ‘88… stuck my hand in a live panel. Burned it pretty good. They wrapped it up at the emergency room, gave me some ointment. Don't rightly remember the name of it. And… somethin’ with my knee a few years back, but that was just a sprain. Worked it off. I told ya, I’m sturdy. Are we almost done here? This is takin’ too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful, Mr. Honcoop. A burn in ‘88, treated at the emergency room, and a knee sprain. It's good to know about both of those. Do you recall if you had any complications from either of those injuries?
PATIENT: Complications? No. I wrapped the burn myself after they let me go. Didn’t want to pay for no fancy aftercare. And the knee... just limped for a bit. Put some ice on it. No complications. Look, Doctor, I’m a practical man. I fix things. I don't go to doctors unless absolutely necessary. I need this paper, I get the paper, and we part ways. Is this askin’ too much?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Honcoop, it's not asking too much at all. I understand your practicality and respect your desire to get this done quickly. Just a few more questions to make sure everything is safe, and then we’ll get to the clearance. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No! Never been hospitalized. Surgeries? No. I fix things, I don’t need fixin’. Look, are you writing all this down? This feels like a waste of my time. I swear, if I have to sit here all day recountin’ my entire life… I just want a paper sayin’ I’m good to go. You got that? Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Honcoop, it's not too much to ask at all. I apologize if this feels intrusive. I am writing everything down, as it’s important for medical documentation and to ensure your safety. We’re almost through the history portion, I promise. Now, regarding medications – are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, I told you, I fix things. I don't need medications. Maybe some aspirin now and then for a headache. That’s it. Vitamins? No. Supplements? Absolutely not. I get all the nourishment I need from a good meal and hard work. Honestly, I'm startin' to question why I even came here. This is ridiculous. Do you need a list of the things I have fixed? Because I can provide one. A very long one.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. I understand your frustration, and I appreciate your patience. It seems you're generally very healthy and take good care of yourself. Just to be thorough, I need to ask about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, latex, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had allergies. I work outside, I climb towers, I'm exposed to all sorts of things. If I had allergies, I'd know about it. Honestly, Doctor, is this really necessary? I’m startin' to feel like I’m being interrogated. I just need a signature on a piece of paper. That's all. Can we please just get to the paperwork? I got things to do. This is a complete waste of my valuable time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. I understand your frustration. It sounds like you are indeed a very healthy and robust individual. Given your medical history – or lack thereof – and the information you’ve provided, I can proceed with a brief physical examination. It’ll just be a quick look at your skin, a listen to your heart and lungs, and a check of your blood pressure. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… make it quick. I really don’t have time for a lot of poking and prodding. I got work to do. Just… get it over with. And then give me the paper. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll be as quick and efficient as possible. Please have a seat on the examination table. First, let's take a look at your skin where you’ll be having the procedure done. Can you point to the area?
PATIENT: Up here. Right across the top. It's just… gettin' a little… worn. Needs a little touch-up. Not a big deal. Just a little somethin’ to make me look… presentable. Now, are we done soon? This table isn't exactly comfortable. And I really don't like doctors poking around. It makes me nervous. Honestly, I haven't been this irritated since that time the tower in '92… never mind. Just… hurry it up, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see a few fine lines and some mild sun damage, which is quite common given your line of work. Skin feels relatively normal, good elasticity. No signs of any concerning lesions or growths. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Pulse is 78 and steady. Blood pressure is 130/80. Within normal limits. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. Everything appears to be within normal limits. Given your history and the results of the exam, I don't see any medical contraindications to proceeding with the cosmetic procedure.
PATIENT: So… can I get the paper now? Finally? I really need to get goin’. I got a tower to climb. And honestly, I don’t want to be stuck in another doctor’s office anytime soon. This has been… less than enjoyable. So, please, just hand over the signature, and we’ll call it a day. I appreciate it. And I promise, I won’t come back unless absolutely necessary. Which, thankfully, rarely happens.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Honcoop. Here you are. This form states that you are medically cleared for the cosmetic procedure you discussed. Now, I do want to emphasize a few things. If you experience any unusual pain, swelling, redness, or signs of infection after the procedure, please contact the practitioner immediately. And remember, I’m always here if you have any concerns, even if it's just a quick question. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Honcoop, and I wish you all the best with your procedure. And please, be careful on that tower. Safety first.
PATIENT: Right. Safety first. Always. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. And don’t worry, I am careful. Been climbin’ towers for decades. Wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t. Well, I best be goin'. Got work to do. Thank you again, Doctor. And… goodbye.
