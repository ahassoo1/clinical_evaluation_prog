DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Dudney, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Look, I got stuff to do, so can we just… get this over with? It’s blood pressure, right? The machine said it was high.
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse flagged a slightly elevated reading. We need to understand why. “Getting it over with” isn’t really how medicine works, but we’ll try to be efficient. Tell me, have you been experiencing any symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what kinda symptoms? I feel… normal. Tired, maybe. But everyone’s tired, right? I work a lot. Out in the field, mostly. Building stuff. Not sitting around all day. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: "Building stuff"...could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: It’s…civil engineering. I’m a technician. Roads, pipelines, sometimes buildings. It's hot out there, lots of sun. And yeah, it’s physical. Carrying things, checking levels, making sure everything’s right. Doesn’t everyone know what that is? Look, I’m not a doctor, okay? I just have high blood pressure according to your machine. What does that even mean?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "high blood pressure," or hypertension, simply means your heart is working harder than it should to pump blood through your arteries. It can be caused by many things. Your work is relevant, actually. It's strenuous. Do you have any family history of high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history… my grandma, on my mom’s side, she… well, she wasn’t healthy towards the end. Lots of problems. I don’t know what problems, exactly. Just…old age stuff, I guess. My dad’s side… they mostly just drank a lot. I doubt that has anything to do with it. Honestly, I don't keep up with all that family stuff. Is this going to take much longer? I have a site inspection at two.
DOCTOR: We’ll try to be brief. It can be genetic, yes, but lifestyle factors are significant. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Seriously? Do I look like someone who smokes? I'm out in the sun all day, building things, not sitting in a dark room coughing up a lung. That's a ridiculous question. Is this standard procedure? Asking people if they have bad habits? I'm here because a machine beeped, not because I live some unhealthy lifestyle.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s just do a quick examination, then. Blood pressure fluctuates. We need a baseline. Please extend your arm. And try to relax, it will help the reading.
PATIENT: Fine. But don't take too long. And please be gentle. I need this arm to, you know, build things. Honestly, this whole thing is a waste of time. I probably just had too much coffee this morning. Is that even a possibility?
DOCTOR: Yes, caffeine can temporarily elevate blood pressure. 148 over 92 on the right, 152 over 94 on the left. Consistently elevated, even accounting for situational factors. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a complete picture.
PATIENT: Fine. But if anything feels weird, you’re gonna know about it. I don’t do “weird.” And honestly, I still think it’s the coffee. Or maybe it was the burrito I had for lunch. It was a little spicy. Seriously, is that even a factor? All this worrying over a few numbers. It’s… ridiculous. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. I'm going to order some basic blood work and a urinalysis, just to rule out any underlying causes. It’s standard procedure. Also, an EKG. Given the consistently elevated readings, we need to assess your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: More tests? Seriously? Blood work, pee tests…now an EKG? What exactly are you looking for? I feel perfectly fine! This is wasting my time and costing me money, I bet. I have insurance, but still. Can't you just give me something for it? A pill or something? I need to get back to work. I have deadlines. What if it’s stress, huh? Building things is stressful! Is that a diagnosis you can give me? "Work-related high blood pressure?" Just… get me a prescription. Please. This is absurd. .
DOCTOR: I will not prescribe medication based on a single elevated reading and your insistence. That would be irresponsible. The lab work will help determine if there’s an underlying medical issue contributing to your hypertension. I understand you have deadlines, but your health is paramount. Take this to the lab on the second floor. Fasting blood work, so nothing to eat or drink for eight hours beforehand. Urinalysis can be done anytime. I’ll have the nurse schedule you for an EKG tomorrow. And I strongly advise you to adopt a healthier lifestyle, including a balanced diet and regular exercise. This is not just about a “pill.” .
