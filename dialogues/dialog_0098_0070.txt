DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Bombara, you say? Yes, yes. New here, you know. Just moved. Social thing, I think? Doctor said I needed… a check. Old doctor, back home. Everything okay, mostly. Just… new place.
DOCTOR: Welcome to the area, then. A general check-up is always a good idea when establishing with a new physician. So, you said “mostly” okay?
PATIENT: Mostly. Back… aches a little. Old injury. Stage work, you know? Lots of lifting, holding things. Not bad, really. Just… there. And sometimes… I forget things. Small things. Like… names. Not important names, usually. Just… fades. It's the age, I think. Is that what you check for? Old age?
DOCTOR: We certainly check for a lot of things, Mr. Szmyd. Both to maintain wellness and to investigate any concerns you may have. Back pain and memory changes are both things we can definitely explore. Regarding the back pain, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Explore… yes. Good. It’s… lower back. Dull ache, mostly. When I bend. Or… lift. Not lifting much now, thank goodness. Used to move sets, you know? Big things. Now… just small things. Grocery bags. That sort of thing. Hurts for a bit, then… goes away. It's nothing, really. Old man things.
DOCTOR: I understand. Even “old man things” deserve a look. When did you first start noticing the back pain?
PATIENT: Noticing… hmm. Long time ago. Years. When I was… working. Lifting the sets, like I said. I think it was a bad lift. Twisted something. Someone helped me. Put some… cream on it. Then it got better. Then worse again. Just comes and goes. I don’t pay it much mind, honestly. It’s always something, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. And you mentioned the forgetting things… how long have you been noticing that, and can you give me a specific example of something you’ve forgotten recently?
PATIENT: Recently… hmm. Let me think. Yesterday, I went to the store. For… milk. Yes, milk. And… something else. I knew what it was. Standing in the aisle… gone. Just… vanished. Had to go back. Twice. Stupid, yes? And… names. I meet people… friendly faces… names are gone. Not their faces, just… the names. It’s frustrating, more than anything.
DOCTOR: It is frustrating, Mr. Szmyd. And it’s good you’re bringing this to my attention. Now, let’s talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? Not really. I had… something with my stomach, years ago. They gave me pills. Fixed it. And… my blood pressure. They said it was high. More pills. Taking those now. That’s it, I think. Oh! My knee. Bad knee. From the stage. Falls happen, you know. But I can walk. Mostly. It clicks sometimes. Annoying. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, some past stomach issues, and a knee that clicks. That's helpful. And you're currently taking medication for the blood pressure, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Little white pills. Every morning. Doctor back home gave them to me. Said keep taking them. I do. Don’t want trouble with the… the heart, you know? Is that what the pills are for? The heart?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right. They help to protect your heart and keep your blood pressure at a healthy level. Do you happen to know the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Name… hmm. No. Not really. Little white pills. That’s all I know. They come in a… a bottle. Orange bottle, I think. With a label. Lots of writing. I don’t bother with the writing. My wife used to handle all that. She… she’s gone now. That was a long time ago. Doesn’t matter now, anyway. Just take the pills.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s alright if you don’t remember the name. We can look it up. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, not really. Maybe… dust. Makes me sneeze. But that’s everyone, right? And… shellfish, I think. Had a bad time once. But a long time ago. Maybe it wasn’t the shellfish. Maybe something else. Can’t remember. Nothing serious. I eat most things.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known serious allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. Back home… lots of people. Hard to keep track. My mother… she had… something with her heart. I think. She died young. My father… strong man. Lived a long time. Worked hard. No… no real sicknesses. Brothers and sisters… lots of them. Can't remember what they had. Old country, you know? People died of… everything. Not much help, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s alright. Now, just a couple more questions. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. Bad for you, you know? My wife… she didn't like it. Always said it smelled terrible. And… bad for the stage. Lights and smoke… no good. Never touched a cigarette.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… sometimes. A little glass of vodka. With dinner. Sometimes. Not every night. Mostly… special occasions. Holidays. To celebrate. My wife liked a little glass too. Not much, though. Never got drunk. No problems with that. Just… a little glass now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I think it would be helpful if I did a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Exam? Yes, yes. Okay. Whatever you need. Just… be gentle. Old man, you know? Things… creak. Go ahead. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are… regular, but a bit faint. Lungs are clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Now, I’ll check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated. Let's check your reflexes. And finally, let's take a look at your knees. There’s some crepitus and tenderness in both knees. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems… within normal limits for your age, but we'll need to investigate the elevated blood pressure and the memory changes a little further.
PATIENT: Investigate… yes. Good. I knew something was wrong. Old age, you know? Always something. What do we do? More pills?
DOCTOR: Not necessarily more pills right away. I would like to order some blood work to get a better picture of your overall health, and to rule out any underlying causes for the memory changes. We'll also want to monitor your blood pressure over the next few weeks. We can do that either here at the clinic, or you can monitor it at home with a blood pressure cuff. Would you prefer to monitor it here or at home?
PATIENT: Home… yes. Better. I have a… a quiet place. Clinic is… busy. Too many people. Home is good. Can I get the cuff here? And… show me how to use it? I’m not very good with… machines.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can absolutely provide you with a blood pressure cuff and I will have the nurse show you how to use it properly before you leave. It's very straightforward, but it's always good to have someone demonstrate. In the meantime, I'm going to write up an order for the blood work. We'll need a sample of your blood, and it will take a few days to get the results back. Once we have those, we can discuss them and formulate a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood… yes. Okay. Always blood. My wife… she hated needles. I don't mind so much. Just… quick, please. And… what about the memory? Will the blood tell me about that?
DOCTOR: The blood work can help rule out some potential causes of memory loss, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. It won't give us a definitive answer, but it's a good starting point. If the blood work doesn't reveal anything significant, we may need to consider further testing, such as a neurological evaluation. For now, let's focus on getting the blood work done. The nurse will come in shortly to draw the sample. Do you have any questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you. For listening. It's good to have someone… check things. My wife… she always took care of everything. I’m getting old.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. That’s what I’m here for. And it's completely normal to need a little extra support as we get older. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns along the way. The nurse will be with you shortly. I'll also have her give you some written instructions about monitoring your blood pressure at home. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very… kind. I will… try to remember everything you said. Hopefully. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don’t worry about remembering everything – that’s what we have notes for! Take care, and we’ll see you soon.
