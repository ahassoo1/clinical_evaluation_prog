DOCTOR: Hi Tammie, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for…a little while now, I suppose. Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. It’s just…uncomfortable. I need this sorted quickly, if you don’t mind. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you want to get this sorted out efficiently. “A little while now” is helpful, but can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Honestly, Doctor, I don't do specific. Maybe…a week? Two? It all blurs together, you understand. It started…after that cold went around. The one everyone had. It’s not a bad pain, just…persistent. Is that good enough? I really don’t have time for a detailed medical history.
DOCTOR: Alright, a week or two, after a cold. Persistent, not severe. Okay. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Fever? I haven’t taken my temperature. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t believe in fussing over every little ache and pain. And chills? It’s August! It's warm. Body aches…well, I'm a woman of a certain age. Things ache. Is that what you want to know? Really, Doctor, are these important questions?
DOCTOR: They are, Tammie, they help me figure out what might be going on. We want to rule out anything serious. No fever that you’ve noticed, okay. And aside from the general aches you mentioned, has this been different than your usual discomfort?
PATIENT: Different? Doctor, you ask a lot of questions. It's a sore throat. It feels…sore. It's scratchy. I have to clear my throat a lot. It’s just…annoying. More annoying than anything, to be honest. I don’t understand why you need to know so much. It feels like you’re questioning my judgment.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I seem to be asking a lot of questions, Tammie. I’m not questioning your judgment at all. I just want to be thorough. Okay, scratchy, constant, and makes you clear your throat frequently. Has it been difficult to swallow?
PATIENT: Difficult? No. Not really. A little uncomfortable, perhaps, when I eat something dry. Like crackers. But I avoid crackers. I don't need them. It's not like it's stopping me from eating. Doctor, honestly, is this going to take much longer? I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant difficulty swallowing, just a little uncomfortable with dry foods. Alright. Have you noticed any white patches or redness in the back of your throat when you look?
PATIENT: Look in my throat? Doctor, are you suggesting I perform a self-examination? That’s…impertinent. I haven't been poking around in there. I don't have the tools, or the inclination. It just…hurts when I swallow, sometimes. I told you that. Honestly, this is becoming ridiculous. Do you even need me here, or are you just enjoying asking questions?
DOCTOR: I apologize, Tammie. I didn’t mean to suggest a self-examination. I just want to get a clear picture. Alright. Let’s do this. I’m going to take a quick look at your throat. Can you open wide and say “ah”?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. I haven't got all day. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see some mild redness in the back of your throat, and your tonsils are a little swollen, but no white patches or pus. Your uvula also appears normal. No significant swelling of the lymph nodes in your neck that I can feel at this moment. It doesn’t appear to be anything terribly serious, Tammie. It looks like a typical viral pharyngitis, likely lingering from that cold you mentioned.
PATIENT: Pharyngi…what-itis? Is that bad? And "lingering"? You mean I've been walking around with something all this time? Honestly, Doctor, you’re not filling me with confidence. What does this mean? And what do I do about it? I don’t want to be sick longer. Is there a pill I can take? A strong one?
DOCTOR: Pharyngitis just means inflammation of the throat – it’s what we commonly call a sore throat. And you likely just carried some inflammation over from your recent cold. It’s not serious, and it’s not something to be overly worried about. It’s likely self-limiting, meaning it will get better on its own. Because it appears viral, antibiotics won’t help. The best thing you can do is supportive care: plenty of fluids, rest, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen for discomfort. Lozenges can also help soothe your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Supportive care? Fluids and…lozenges? That’s it? No magic pill? Honestly, Doctor, I was hoping for something…more. Well, I suppose it’s better than nothing. But if it doesn't improve in a few days, I expect you to see me again, and I expect a real solution. Fine. I’ll try your…supportive care. Now, can I go? I have errands, you know. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Tammie. If it doesn’t improve in 5-7 days, or if you develop a fever, difficulty breathing, or severe pain, please come back immediately. I’ll make a note of that in your chart. Here’s some information on managing your symptoms at home. Have a good day, and get some rest. .
