DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, it’s probably nothing, honestly. My mother… she had some things. Heart problems, mostly. And her sister… well, it wasn’t good. I just… I want to make sure I’m okay. You know, preventative stuff. Don’t want to end up like them.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Theriot. It’s very wise to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of heart problems. We’ll certainly do our best to assess your current health and address any potential risks. To get started, could you tell me a bit more about your mother and aunt's heart problems?
PATIENT: Right. Well, my mother… she had high blood pressure for years. Didn’t really take care of herself, to be frank. Lots of salt, not much exercise. Eventually, she had a stroke. That was… unpleasant. And her sister, my aunt… she had something called angina, I think? Chest pain. It kept getting worse and worse until… well, it was a heart attack. Pretty quick, from what I understand. They both… didn’t make it to seventy. I’m twenty-four. Obviously, I'm a bit worried about it, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Mr. Theriot. Knowing that family history certainly warrants a thorough evaluation. High blood pressure and heart disease can be serious, but early detection and management can make a significant difference. To get a better understanding of your current health status, let’s go through some questions. First, have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been pretty healthy, honestly. I mean, I get the occasional cold, but that’s about it. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, whatever. But nothing major. Never been to the hospital for anything serious. I try to eat okay… mostly. And I walk sometimes. It’s not like I'm a marathon runner, but I’m not completely sedentary, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Theriot. A healthy baseline is a great starting point. And walking is excellent! Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing I know of. I’ve eaten all sorts of weird things, travelling and all, and never had a reaction. My ex-wife… she was allergic to peanuts. That was… a whole thing. But I’m fine. Pretty much everything agrees with me. I haven’t even had a bad reaction to penicillin, and I’ve had that a few times when I was sick.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And just to confirm, you’re not currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing. I don’t really… believe in all that stuff, honestly. Maybe a pain reliever if I get a really bad headache, but that’s it. And even then, it’s rare. I prefer to just… deal with it. Don’t go in for all those pills and powders, you know? Seems like everyone’s trying to sell you something.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Mr. Theriot. Many people feel that way. However, sometimes a simple intervention can be very beneficial. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? Like… do I read a lot? I work, mostly. I teach engineering at the community college. It’s… stressful. Lots of students who aren't really trying, you know? Keeps me busy. I live alone now, after the divorce. I eat when I can, try to get enough sleep, but it’s not always easy. I don’t drink much, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I definitely don’t smoke. Is that what you mean? It’s not like I have a ton of hobbies or anything. It’s… practical, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Theriot. The stress from your job is something we should definitely consider. And it’s good to hear you don't smoke and only drink occasionally. Before we move on, can you tell me about any significant medical events in your family, besides your mother and aunt?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. My grandfather, on my father’s side… he had diabetes. Type 2, I think. He lost a foot to it, eventually. It was… unpleasant. And my grandmother… she had arthritis, really bad. Couldn't move without help towards the end. Other than that… I don't really know much about my relatives. My father wasn't very close to his family, and I didn’t really keep in touch with them much either. It’s not like we were a close-knit family, if you get my meaning. So, it's mostly just the three I already mentioned, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Theriot. That provides a good overview of your family history. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just get it over with, if you don't mind. I have a class to prepare for this afternoon. And I really should be getting back to grade papers. I’m not one for sitting around doctors’ offices, honestly. Just… quick and efficient, if possible.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Theriot. I will be as efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is 128/82, your heart rate is 72 beats per minute, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit – all within normal limits. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and range of motion is full in all extremities. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. However, given your family history, I’d like to order a few blood tests just to get a baseline and assess your risk factors. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever it takes, I guess. Just… please don’t make me come back a dozen times. I’m a busy man. What kind of tests are we talking about? Cholesterol? Something for diabetes? Just… explain it to me quickly, please. I need to know if it's going to take a whole afternoon and a mountain of paperwork. And who pays for all this? Medicare still covers everything, right?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Theriot. I understand your concern about time and paperwork. I’d like to order a complete blood count to check your overall health, a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels, and a comprehensive metabolic panel to evaluate your kidney function, liver function, and blood sugar levels. This will give us a good overview of your current health status and help us assess your risk for heart disease and diabetes. These tests are typically covered by Medicare, but it’s always best to verify with your insurance provider to be certain. We have staff who can assist you with that if needed. The blood draw itself should only take about 15-20 minutes, and the results will usually be available within a few days. Would you like me to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results, or can we arrange for you to receive them through the patient portal?
PATIENT: The patient portal sounds… easier. Less sitting around, hopefully. Just send me the results electronically. I can probably figure it out. And if it’s anything concerning, I guess you can call me. But honestly, I'd prefer to just hear it straight. No beating around the bush. If there’s a problem, just tell me. I’m a practical man, remember? No need for delicate language or… sugarcoating. And make sure the lab knows my Medicare information. I don’t want a surprise bill showing up in the mail. Is there anything I need to do? Fasting or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Theriot. I understand and respect your direct approach. We will send the results to your patient portal as soon as they are available and I will ensure they are clearly explained. I will also call you directly if anything concerning is identified. For the lipid panel, we do require a 12-hour fast beforehand. Please refrain from eating or drinking anything other than water for 12 hours prior to your blood draw. The lab will remind you of this when you schedule your appointment. I will write an order for the lab tests and give you a slip to take with you. We will also send the order electronically to the lab. You can schedule your appointment directly with the lab. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just… send those results as soon as possible. And make sure they're easy to understand. I'm not a doctor, you know? I don't speak medical jargon. Okay, I guess that’s it. Thanks for… not wasting my time too much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Theriot. I understand your concerns and will ensure the results are clear and easy to understand. We appreciate your trust. Have a good day and please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. .
