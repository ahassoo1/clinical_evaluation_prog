DOCTOR: Hi Teretha, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this… tingling. In my hands, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s just… annoying, you know? I carry the mail, so I need my hands to work properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in your hands. And you said it’s been going on for a little while?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks, maybe a month? It comes and goes. Some days it’s worse than others. It’s not painful, exactly, just… numb and prickly. Like when your foot falls asleep, but in my fingers. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely does. Numb and prickly, like a foot falling asleep – that’s a good way to describe it. And it’s mostly in your fingers?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. Sometimes it goes up my arms a little, but it’s worse in the fingers. Especially my thumbs and pointer fingers. It's hard to hold onto things sometimes, you know? All those letters… I don't want to drop them!
DOCTOR: Okay, so tingling and numbness primarily in your thumbs and pointer fingers, sometimes extending up your arms. It’s affecting your grip a bit. And you mentioned it comes and goes. Are there any specific activities that seem to make it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, carrying a heavy bag of mail definitely makes it worse. And cold weather! When it’s cold, it gets much worse. Warmer gloves help a little, but not always. I haven’t noticed anything that makes it better, really, just… avoiding carrying too much at once.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy lifting and cold weather seem to be triggers. Have you noticed any weakness in your hands, besides the difficulty with grip?
PATIENT: Weakness… not really. It’s not like I can’t hold things, just… harder. And I have to concentrate more, I guess. Like, if I try to pick up something small, like a penny, it’s a little clumsy. I drop things more than usual, but I don’t feel weak, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That makes sense. Okay, so no significant weakness, just increased clumsiness and difficulty with fine motor tasks, especially when it’s cold or you've been carrying a heavy load. Now, have you experienced any pain anywhere else – your neck, shoulders, back – or any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: No pain in my neck or shoulders, no. My back sometimes aches, but that’s just from carrying the mail, I think. I'm 63, things ache! And no changes in my vision, no. Everything looks normal. I just want this tingling to stop. It's distracting when I'm trying to do my job.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No neck or shoulder pain, a little back ache from work, and vision is normal. Let's talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of, like diabetes or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, well… not really. I had high blood pressure years ago, but it’s been under control for a long time. I don't take anything for it anymore, the doctor said I didn’t need to. And I had a little trouble with my knees a while back, but that’s mostly just getting old, I think. No diabetes, no arthritis. Just… tired sometimes, you know? Being a mail carrier is hard work.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of controlled high blood pressure, some knee trouble, but no diabetes or arthritis. Just generally tired from work. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. I've been lucky, I guess. Just the usual things… broken bones when I was a kid, but those healed up fine. Nothing major. I just want to know what's causing this tingling, and if there's something I can do about it. I really need my hands for my job.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. Let's talk about your family history. Do any of your family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any medical conditions, like nerve problems, arthritis, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother had arthritis in her hands, bad arthritis. She couldn’t knit anymore towards the end. And my father… he had some kind of heart trouble, I think. He died when I was young, so I don't remember much about it. My sister is fine, as far as I know. She lives in Ukraine, so we don't talk very often. Nothing else, really. Mostly just… old age things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of arthritis and heart trouble. Now, just to finish up with some general questions, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I don't smoke, never have. And I don't drink, either. Not a fan. And definitely no… recreational drugs. I'm a postal worker! I need to keep a clear head. I have a good reputation to uphold.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I haven’t had to take much medication over the years, thankfully. I had a reaction to penicillin when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. I haven’t had any problems with any other medicines since then. I really don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, penicillin allergy in the past, but no other known allergies. Alright, Teretha, that gives me a good picture of your overall health. Let’s do a quick physical exam, and then we can talk about what might be going on and what we can do about it. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this sorted out. I'm ready when you are. Is there anything I need to do to prepare?
DOCTOR: No, nothing special. Just relax. I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and arms. I'll also take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs just to get a baseline. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90, but not drastically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs… everything sounds clear there. Okay, let’s look at your hands. Do you feel any tingling right now?
PATIENT: No, not right at this moment. It comes and goes, like I said. Sometimes it’s worse in the morning, sometimes after a long shift… It’s hard to predict. I’m feeling a little nervous, maybe that’s why it’s not happening now? I do feel a little warmer, though, now that I'm inside. It's always cold when I’m delivering the mail. Go ahead, Doctor. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, your muscle strength seems good, no significant weakness. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not alarming. Now, I’m going to check your sensation. Close your eyes for me, and tell me when I touch your fingers. Okay… and how about this?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, I feel that… that’s my thumb. And… yes, that’s my pointer finger… a little bit numb, though. It’s… harder to feel it in these two fingers. Not completely gone, just… not as sharp. The others feel fine. Is that what you were expecting? It’s definitely worse in the thumb and pointer finger, like I said. I’m a little worried now… is something seriously wrong?
DOCTOR: Okay, diminished sensation in your thumb and pointer finger, consistent with what you’ve described. It sounds like you may have some mild carpal tunnel syndrome, or possibly ulnar nerve entrapment. It's not necessarily something serious, but it can be quite bothersome. The tingling and numbness you're experiencing is often caused by compression of the nerves in your wrist or elbow. The diminished reflexes also support this, although we need to rule out other possibilities. Do you feel any pain or numbness in your elbows or forearms?
PATIENT: No, no pain in my elbows or forearms. Just… the tingling in my hands. It's not a sharp pain, just… a funny feeling. Like pins and needles. And sometimes, like now, it's just numb. So… carpal tunnel syndrome? What does that mean? Is it something I can fix? I really need my hands for my job, like I told you. I can’t afford to take time off.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain in your elbows or forearms. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition where one of the nerves in your wrist gets compressed, leading to numbness, tingling, and weakness in your hand. It's common, especially in people who do repetitive hand movements, like gripping and lifting. The good news is it’s often treatable without surgery. Before we jump to conclusions, I'd like to order a nerve conduction study. This is a simple test that measures the electrical activity in your nerves and can help us confirm the diagnosis and determine the severity. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: A nerve… conduction study? What does that involve? Is it painful? I don’t like needles, Doctor. And I’m a little worried about the cost, to be honest. I don’t have insurance, and I’m on a fixed income. I appreciate you trying to figure out what’s wrong, but I don’t want to get stuck with a big bill.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, and I completely understand. The nerve conduction study involves placing small electrodes on your skin – it doesn’t involve any needles. It might feel a little uncomfortable, like a mild electrical tingle, but it’s generally not painful. It takes about 30-60 minutes. As for the cost… I know you don’t have insurance, and that’s something we need to address. Our clinic does offer a discount for patients without insurance, and we can also explore options for financial assistance programs in the area. I’ll have my staff look into that for you. In the meantime, we can try some conservative treatments to see if they help. I recommend wearing a wrist splint at night to keep your wrist in a neutral position. You could also try taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen, and avoiding activities that aggravate your symptoms. Would you be willing to try those things while we wait to schedule the nerve conduction study and look into the cost?
PATIENT: A wrist splint… and ibuprofen… yes, I can try that. I have some ibuprofen at home, I think. And a splint doesn't sound too bad. It's better than nothing. I'm just worried about it getting worse. I need my hands for my job! Okay, so wrist splint at night, ibuprofen, and avoid… what exactly? I deliver the mail, Doctor. That’s what I do. I can’t just stop lifting things. Maybe I can try carrying a smaller bag… and being more careful. Is that enough? I really appreciate you explaining everything to me. It's just… scary when you don’t know what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Teretha. I understand your concerns, and you’re right, it is scary when you don’t know what’s going on. Carrying a smaller bag and being more careful are good first steps. Try to avoid prolonged gripping or repetitive movements as much as possible. If you’re able to rotate tasks throughout the day, that could help too. We’re aiming to reduce the stress on the nerves in your wrist. I'm going to give you a handout with some exercises you can do to strengthen your hands and wrists, and some information about carpal tunnel syndrome. I’ll also write a prescription for a wrist splint. Let’s see how you do with those things for a couple of weeks. If your symptoms don’t improve, or if they get worse, we'll go ahead and schedule the nerve conduction study. And, as promised, my staff will look into the cost and any financial assistance options available to you. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor Ranjan. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain things so clearly. I'll try everything you suggested and see how it goes. Hopefully, it will get better. One thing… is this something that will get worse over time? Like, will I eventually not be able to do my job at all? That’s what I’m really afraid of.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, and I understand why you’re worried about that. It's difficult to say for certain, as everyone is different. However, with early intervention – like the treatments we've discussed – many people are able to manage their symptoms and continue to do the activities they enjoy, including your job. If we catch it early and address the underlying cause, it’s less likely to progress to the point where it interferes significantly with your ability to work. That’s why it’s important to monitor your symptoms closely and let me know if anything changes. We'll work together to find a solution that works for you. And remember, if the conservative treatments aren’t enough, we always have other options available, like the nerve conduction study and other more advanced interventions. Here are those handouts and the prescription. If you have any questions at all, please don’t hesitate to call the office. And please, take care of yourself.
