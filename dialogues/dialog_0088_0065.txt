DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m Dr. Piet. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I’ve been… well, I’ve been gaining weight, and I don’t understand why. It’s rather unsettling, to be frank. I haven't changed anything in my diet or exercise routine.
DOCTOR: Okay. Weight gain, and it’s been happening despite no changes to your diet or activity level. That is unsettling. Can you tell me about how long this has been going on, and roughly how much weight have you gained?
PATIENT: It’s been… let me think. It started, I believe, in late February, so roughly five months now. As for the amount… I weighed myself in February, and it was 78 kilograms. Now… now it’s 83. Perhaps a little more, to be honest. I don’t weigh myself constantly, you understand. It’s not a healthy obsession, thankfully. But yes, about five kilograms, give or take.
DOCTOR: Okay, about five kilograms over five months. That's a noticeable change. And you haven't experienced any other symptoms alongside the weight gain?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. No fatigue, no changes in appetite… everything feels… normal, except for the number on the scale. I sleep well, I have my usual energy… it's just… perplexing. My husband hasn't noticed anything different about me either, thankfully. He's quite observant, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright. No other symptoms, and your husband hasn’t noticed any changes. Let’s go through a quick review of systems, just to be thorough. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? No, not really. Everything is… regular, if you’ll excuse my bluntness. Perhaps a little less frequent than usual, but nothing alarming. I have always been…particular about that sort of thing, if you understand. I haven't had any… difficulty, shall we say.
DOCTOR: Okay, regular, maybe slightly less frequent, no difficulty. Good. Any changes in your skin – any rashes, dryness, or new moles?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My skin has been… well, my skin. A little dry in the winter, as always, but nothing new or concerning. I use a good lotion, you see. My grandmother always said dry skin was a sign of a poor constitution, so I take precautions. No rashes, no new moles. I check regularly, just in case.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your periods?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, Doctor, I… I am past menopause. It’s been… fifteen years now, perhaps a little more. So, that is not a factor, thankfully. Is that… sufficient information? I find discussing such things… a little indelicate.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is perfectly sufficient. Thank you. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a bout of bronchitis when I was younger, but that was many years ago, and I recovered fully. My blood pressure has always been a little on the high side, my family doctor said, but nothing requiring medication. Otherwise, I’ve been quite fortunate with my health, thankfully. I’ve always believed in a good, sensible life. Not too much indulgence, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major medical conditions, a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, and a bout of bronchitis long ago. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always avoided them if possible. My mother had a rather unpleasant experience with a gallbladder removal, and it instilled in me a certain… aversion. I prefer to let nature take its course, if you understand. I believe the body is remarkably resilient, when given the chance. No surgeries, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother… she passed away ten years ago, from heart failure. My father was a strong, healthy man, lived to be 85. He did have diabetes in his later years, but it was well-managed. As for siblings… I have a brother, living in Vilnius, but we don’t speak often. He’s… a complicated man. He has high cholesterol, I believe. Nothing else particularly relevant, to my knowledge.
DOCTOR: Okay. Mother passed from heart failure, father had diabetes, brother has high cholesterol. And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I work as an orderly at the local hospital. It's quite physical work, lifting and moving patients, so I get a fair amount of exercise on the job. Otherwise, I enjoy gardening. I grow my own vegetables, mostly. It's very therapeutic. And I cook… I cook all my meals from scratch. I believe in knowing exactly what I’m putting into my body, you see. No fast food, no processed meals. It’s a simple life, but a good one. I don't smoke, I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion.
DOCTOR: Alright. Active job, gardening, healthy cooking, no smoking, minimal alcohol. And do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, I do not. As I mentioned, I prefer to avoid them if possible. I take a multivitamin occasionally, during the winter months, but that is all. No regular medications, thankfully. I believe in preventative care, you see. Good diet, regular exercise… that is my medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay. No medications. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your abdomen. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. I am quite prepared. It is best to be thorough, I suppose. Although I do hope it's nothing serious. It’s unsettling to feel one’s body changing without a clear explanation.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Everything feels within normal limits during the physical exam, though your blood pressure is a bit high. Let's check your weight again, just to be certain.
PATIENT: Very well. I do hope it hasn't increased further. It's… disheartening to see the numbers climb, even if I don't fully understand why. It is as you said, Doctor. It is… 84 kilograms now. Another kilogram. It is most unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, 84 kilograms. That is a one kilogram increase since our last measurement. Given your symptoms – weight gain despite no changes in diet or activity, normal physical exam findings besides slightly elevated blood pressure – and your family history of diabetes and high cholesterol, I’d like to order some blood work. We’ll check your thyroid function, a complete metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the weight gain, such as hypothyroidism, diabetes, or high cholesterol. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Thorough. I appreciate you taking this seriously, Doctor. I do worry about diabetes, given my father’s history. If that is what it is, I would rather know and address it promptly. Yes, please, order the blood work. Whatever is necessary to find out what is happening. And… what does that entail, exactly? I haven't had blood work done in many years. Is it… painful? I’m rather squeamish, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s not painful, Ms. Selbitschka, just a quick pinch. A phlebotomist will draw a small amount of blood from your vein, usually in your arm. It takes just a few minutes. You may feel a slight prick, and there might be a small bruise afterward, but it usually disappears within a few days. I’ll give you a requisition form to take to the lab. The lab is just down the hall, and they’re very good there. Once the results are back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. A small pinch, you say? I suppose I can endure that. And a bruise that disappears quickly… that is reassuring. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience with my… anxieties. I suppose it’s foolish to be afraid of a little blood work, but… one worries, doesn't one? Especially when one's body is behaving in such a peculiar manner. Very well. I shall go to the lab now. Should I inform you when I have completed the blood work, or will you simply expect the results to arrive?
DOCTOR: You don't need to inform me; the lab will send the results directly to my office. I’ll review them as soon as they arrive, and my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. That’s usually within a week, but it depends on their workload. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’re just gathering information at this stage. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have been most thorough and reassuring. I shall simply await the results and your call. Thank you again for your time and attention. I appreciate your kindness. I will see you again soon, then. .
