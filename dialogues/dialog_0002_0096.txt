DOCTOR: Hi Arbin, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Ranjan, nice to meet you too. Well, it's about my eyes, I think. They’ve been really bothering me when I go outside. Like, super sensitive to the sun, even with sunglasses on. It's been happening for a few weeks now, and it's getting a bit annoying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Sensitivity to the sun, even with sunglasses, for a few weeks… that’s good information. Just to clarify, is it more of a pain, a burning sensation, blurry vision, or something else when you’re exposed to sunlight?
PATIENT: Hmm, it’s not really pain, exactly. More like…everything gets really bright, almost white, and it makes me squint a lot. It’s hard to describe. And it's not blurry, just…uncomfortable. Like a strong glare that doesn’t go away, even with the shades on. It makes my eyes feel tired afterwards, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, "really bright, almost white," a glare that doesn't go away with sunglasses, and then eye fatigue afterward... That helps me narrow things down a bit. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all – redness, discharge, any changes in your vision besides the glare, or even headaches?
PATIENT: No redness or anything coming out of my eyes, no. Vision’s…normal, I guess. I mean, when I'm not in the sun, everything seems fine. No headaches either. Just the brightness and the tiredness after being outside. It's just…weird. It’s never really happened before.
DOCTOR: Alright, so normal vision when not in the sun, no redness, no discharge, no headaches… that’s good. And it’s a new thing, never happened before. Have you changed anything recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I can think of. Same soaps, same lotions… I did start taking a new vitamin a few months back, a multivitamin, but I’ve been on it for a while now. Oh! And I did go on a trip to visit family back in Ghana in May. Spent a lot of time outdoors there, but the sun felt pretty normal then.
DOCTOR: Okay, new multivitamin a few months ago, and a trip to Ghana in May… Both good things to mention. Let’s talk about the multivitamin first. Do you happen to know the brand or if it contains any specific high doses of anything, like Vitamin A or Riboflavin?
PATIENT: Let me see… It’s called… VitaBoost Daily. And uh… Okay, it says here it has a pretty high dose of Vitamin A, yeah. And… Riboflavin, you said? Let me see… yeah, a good amount. It's got a lot of stuff in it, honestly. I just thought it was good to get all my vitamins in one go.
DOCTOR: Okay, VitaBoost Daily with a high dose of Vitamin A and Riboflavin… that's potentially relevant. High doses of some vitamins can sometimes cause sensitivity to light. But let’s not jump to conclusions just yet. Now, regarding your trip to Ghana in May, did you spend significantly more time in direct sunlight than you usually do?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely. I was helping my aunt with her farm, so a lot of the day was outside. It wasn't crazy intense, but… more than I’m used to, for sure. I did wear a hat and sunglasses most of the time, but I guess I wasn’t always as careful as I should have been. It was pretty hot there too, I remember that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased sun exposure in Ghana, even with some protection, combined with the new multivitamin… That gives us a few things to consider. I’d like to do a quick eye exam to check your pupils and the overall health of your eyes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, absolutely. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doc. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I’m a bit worried it might be something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly understandable. It's always good to be proactive. If you could sit in the chair for me, and we'll start with checking your visual acuity. Then I'll take a look at your pupils and the front of your eyes with a special light. It won't hurt at all. First, let’s just read the letters on this chart, starting with this line. Cover one eye, please, and tell me what you see.
PATIENT: Okay, no problem. Alright, let's see… um, that looks like an… F? Is that right? It’s a little blurry, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct, an F. Okay. Now, we’ll move closer to the chart and try to read a smaller line. Just tell me the first letter you can clearly make out. And don’t worry if it’s difficult, we’re just getting a baseline.
PATIENT: Okay… uh… let me see… it’s… kinda hard. I think… it’s a P? But it’s really faint. I’m straining to see it.
DOCTOR: Okay, P. That’s helpful. Now, let's try with the other eye covered. Same thing, just read the first letter you can clearly make out.
PATIENT: Okay… let me see… Um… I think that's an L? It's not super clear, but I'm pretty sure it’s an L. It's a little easier than the other eye, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, an L. So, slightly better vision with your right eye compared to your left, but both are a bit reduced. That’s something we’ll need to investigate further. Now, I’m going to use a light to look closely at the front of your eyes. I’ll just shine it in each eye, and I’ll be looking for any abnormalities. It might be a little bright, so try to relax and look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Relax and look straight ahead… I can do that. Let me know if it’s too bright, yeah?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Everything looks… relatively normal, no obvious signs of inflammation or damage. Now, the right eye. Hmm… I do see some very mild superficial punctate erosions on the cornea of your right eye. They're quite small, but they could be contributing to your symptoms.
PATIENT: Punctate… erosions? What does that mean, Doc? Is it serious? I’m getting a little worried now.
DOCTOR: Okay, it's understandable to be worried, but let’s not jump to conclusions. Punctate erosions are tiny scratches on the surface of your cornea – that's the clear front part of your eye. They're often caused by dryness, irritation, or sometimes, exposure to something like UV light. Think of it like a very minor scrape on your skin. In your case, they’re mild, and given your history of increased sun exposure and the new multivitamin, it's likely those are the cause. The multivitamin could be contributing to some light sensitivity, and the sun exposure may have exacerbated it. It doesn't seem like anything serious at this point. However, we want to rule out other possibilities, just to be safe. I recommend we do a Schirmer’s test to check your tear production and a fluorescein staining to get a better look at the erosions under a special light. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay…tiny scratches… that sounds… less scary than I thought. Alright. If it helps figure things out, yeah, sure. Let’s do the Schirmer’s test and the… fluorescein staining, you said? Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this sorted out, so I can go back to not worrying every time I step outside.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’m glad to hear that. And you're right, let's get it sorted. It sounds like it's likely to be something fairly manageable. First, I’m going to put a single drop of anesthetic in each eye. It’ll sting for a moment, then it’ll numb them so you won't feel anything during the test. Then, I’ll place a small strip of filter paper under your lower eyelids for a few minutes. This measures how much you’re producing tears. It won't affect your vision. Sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Anesthetic drop and the paper strip… that sounds pretty simple. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doc. It makes me feel a lot better. Let's do it.
DOCTOR: Okay, wonderful. You might feel a slight stinging sensation for a couple of seconds… and there we go. Okay, everything should be numbed now. Now, I'm going to place these small strips of filter paper under your lower eyelids. Just relax and keep your eyes closed for the next five minutes. Try not to blink too much, if possible. I'll let you know when we're done. We'll just sit quietly for a few minutes. Are you comfortable?
PATIENT: Yeah, pretty comfortable, thanks. A little strange feeling, but not uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, interesting. Your tear production is a bit lower than average, especially in your right eye. It’s not drastically low, but it’s enough to explain some of your symptoms. Now, for the fluorescein staining. This is a special dye that highlights any damage or abrasions on the surface of your cornea. It’s completely painless, and it won’t affect your vision. I’m just going to touch the strip to the surface of your eye. Now, I'm going to use a special blue light to view your eyes.
PATIENT: It feels a little weird seeing everything glowing, but not painful. What do you see, Doc? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, yes. I do see some mild superficial punctate erosions, primarily in your right eye, as I suspected. They’re small, but they’re definitely present. The left eye has a few, but significantly less. This confirms that the dryness and irritation are causing these tiny scratches on the surface of your cornea. Okay, so putting everything together – your history of increased sun exposure, the new multivitamin with high doses of Vitamin A and Riboflavin, the lower tear production, and now the confirmation of these punctate erosions – it’s very likely you’re experiencing photokeratitis, a type of sunburn of the cornea, combined with some degree of dry eye. It's not an emergency, but it is causing your symptoms. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, photokeratitis… sunburn of the cornea… that actually makes a lot of sense, when you put it all together. All that sun, and maybe the vitamins made me more sensitive. And the dryness explains the scratches. Okay, yeah, that makes sense. So, what do we do about it? Is there anything I can take? Do I need to wear special glasses? I just want to get it sorted out so I don't have to worry about it anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good. We can definitely get this sorted. Fortunately, photokeratitis usually resolves on its own within 24-72 hours with proper treatment. Here’s what I recommend: First, stop taking the VitaBoost Daily multivitamin for now. It’s likely contributing to your sensitivity. Second, artificial tears. Use preservative-free artificial tears four times a day, or even more frequently if your eyes feel dry or irritated. This will help keep your eyes lubricated and promote healing. I can write you a prescription for a specific brand if you’d like, or you can find one over-the-counter. Third, wear wraparound sunglasses outdoors, even on cloudy days. Make sure they block 100% of UVA and UVB rays. A wide-brimmed hat can also help. Fourth, avoid rubbing your eyes. I’m also going to prescribe a mild topical steroid eye drop for a short course—five days—to help reduce any inflammation. It's important to follow the instructions carefully and not use it for longer than prescribed. I don’t think you need to see a specialist at this time, but if your symptoms worsen or don’t improve within a few days, please come back and see me. Does that sound like a plan you’re comfortable with?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds great, Doc. Stop the vitamins, lots of eye drops, sunglasses… I can definitely do all of that. And the steroid drops for a few days. Sounds manageable. Do I need to worry about any side effects from the drops? And what kind of sunglasses should I get? Like, are there specific brands or types I should look for? I just want to make sure I’m doing everything right.
DOCTOR: Okay, good questions. With the steroid drops, the most common side effect is a temporary stinging or burning sensation after you put them in. It usually goes away within a few seconds. Rarely, they can cause a temporary increase in eye pressure, which is why it’s important to only use them for the prescribed course—five days—and follow my instructions carefully. If you experience any significant pain, blurred vision, or halos around lights, stop using the drops and come see me immediately. As for sunglasses, look for ones that block 100% of both UVA and UVB rays—that's the most important thing. Wraparound style are best because they provide the most coverage and protect your eyes from light coming from the sides. Polarized lenses can also help reduce glare, but that’s not essential. Brand-wise, there are many good options—Ray-Ban, Oakley, Maui Jim are all reputable, but any sunglasses that meet the UV protection criteria will be helpful. The key is coverage and protection, not necessarily the price tag. I’m going to print out a summary of these instructions for you, as well as a prescription for the steroid eye drops. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before I write the prescription?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doc. That’s good. Perfect. A summary and the prescription… that’s really helpful. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly and taking the time to answer all my questions. I feel a lot better now, knowing what’s going on and what I need to do. I think that's everything. Thank you again, Dr. Ranjan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Arbin. I’m glad I could help. Remember to follow the instructions carefully, and if your symptoms worsen or don’t improve within a few days, please don't hesitate to come back and see me. Here’s that summary and your prescription. Have a great day, and try to enjoy the sunshine – but remember those sunglasses!
PATIENT: .
