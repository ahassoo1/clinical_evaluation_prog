DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I am Dr. Eaddy. It says here you’re 45 years of age. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Yes, that’s right, forty-five. I am here because I am planning a cruise, a lovely one around the Mediterranean, and the cruise line requires some… information. Medical information, that is. They sent a form. I thought it best to get it filled out properly by a doctor, rather than attempt it myself. It’s a bit detailed, you see.
DOCTOR: A cruise, you say. Very well. A pre-participation form. Those can be… extensive. I understand your prudence in seeking a professional opinion. Now, let us begin. Do you have any current medical complaints?
PATIENT: Complaints? Well… not exactly complaints. I wouldn’t call them complaints. My knees sometimes ache a bit when the weather changes, you know, a bit of the old arthritis. And I get tired more easily than I used to, but that could be just getting older, I suppose. Nothing that stops me from doing things, mind you. Just a bit… weary sometimes. Is that what you mean by complaints, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Weariness and knee discomfort… acceptable descriptions. We will certainly document those. When did you first notice this fatigue, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s not been sudden, you see. More… gradual. I’d say… maybe six months ago? It started around last winter, I think. It was a particularly cold one, so I initially put it down to that. I just thought I was a bit sluggish, needing more rest. But it hasn't really gone away completely, even with the warmer weather.
DOCTOR: Six months… and it persists. I see. And this knee discomfort – is it in both knees, or just one?
PATIENT: Just one, Doctor. My right knee, mostly. It's not constant, not at all. It’s worse on damp days, like you would expect. And if I’ve been doing a lot of walking. Nothing serious, but it’s… noticeable. I manage it with a bit of liniment, and trying not to overdo things. It hasn’t swollen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Right knee, intermittent discomfort, worse with damp weather and activity. No swelling. Very good. Now, Ms. Squiers, have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. Well, I had my tonsils out when I was a girl, a very long time ago. And I broke my wrist once, falling off a bicycle. That healed perfectly well, though. And… ah, yes. I had a bout of pneumonia about ten years ago, but I recovered fully. Nothing major, you see. Just the usual childhood illnesses, and a few minor bumps and scrapes over the years. I’ve always been quite healthy, generally. Though, my husband… well, he wasn’t so lucky. He had heart trouble. That was… some years ago now, sadly.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, a healed wrist fracture, and pneumonia ten years ago. I note your husband’s history of heart trouble. Was this a significant concern for you in terms of your own health, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: Well, it did worry me, naturally. Heart trouble can run in families, you know. We did have some testing done after he was diagnosed, just to be on the safe side. The doctor said my heart was perfectly sound at the time. That was… oh, about fifteen years ago, I suppose. I haven’t had any tests since then, really. Just the usual check-ups with my general practitioner. He always listened to my heart, and never mentioned anything untoward.
DOCTOR: Husband with history of heart trouble; patient had cardiac evaluation 15 years ago with normal findings. Now, are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all. I don’t take anything regularly. Just over-the-counter pain relief for my knee sometimes, when it’s particularly bad. Paracetamol, that sort of thing. And I take a Vitamin D supplement in the winter months, as the doctor recommended. But that’s it. I try to stay as natural as possible, you see.
DOCTOR: Paracetamol as needed, Vitamin D supplementation. Sensible. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I’m aware. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a problem with insect bites or anything like that. I’m quite lucky in that respect, I think. My sister is terribly allergic to pollen, but I’ve never suffered with hayfever or anything similar.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Very good. Now, Ms. Squiers, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked, for a while, but I always made him smoke outside. I always thought it was a dreadful habit. And I certainly wouldn't start now.
DOCTOR: Non-smoker. Do you consume alcohol, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: Just occasionally, Doctor. A glass of wine with my dinner sometimes, or a sherry if I'm feeling festive. Nothing excessive, you understand. Perhaps once or twice a week. I don't drink spirits, and I certainly wouldn’t drink to excess. I enjoy a little tipple, but I'm very moderate.
DOCTOR: Moderate alcohol consumption. Now, do you engage in regular exercise, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: Well, “regular” is perhaps a strong word, Doctor. I enjoy a good walk, when the weather permits. And I do a bit of gardening. That keeps me active, you see. I used to go swimming more often, but I haven't been for a while now. I find it a bit chilly these days, and the pool is rather busy. So, mostly walking and gardening. It's not strenuous, but it keeps me moving.
DOCTOR: Walking and gardening. And your weight, Ms. Squiers?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking a sensitive question! I… well, I try not to think about it too much. I’m… around ten stone, I suppose. Maybe a little more. It fluctuates, you see. It’s harder to keep it down as you get older. I’m not overweight, but I’m certainly not slim.
DOCTOR: Approximately ten stone. Very well. Now, Ms. Squiers, I'm going to conduct a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, perfectly agreeable. Whatever you need to do. I understand it’s all part of the process. I’m quite happy to cooperate. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Please, if you’ll just lie down on the table. First, I will auscultate your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular. No murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, if you’ll just bend your right knee, I’d like to assess its range of motion. Slight crepitus noted on flexion and extension, but no significant pain or swelling. Range of motion is mildly limited.
PATIENT: Oh. Crepitus, you say? Is that… bad, Doctor? It does feel a bit stiff sometimes, as I mentioned. But I hadn't realised it was anything… significant. I assumed it was just age.
DOCTOR: Crepitus is common, Ms. Squiers, particularly with age and mild osteoarthritis. It’s not necessarily indicative of a serious problem. It simply means there is some roughness to the joint surface. Now, I will palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Everything appears normal on initial examination. Based on this brief examination and your history, it seems you are in generally good health. However, I would recommend a few blood tests to rule out any underlying issues, such as Vitamin D deficiency or mild anemia. Would that be agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. If it puts my mind at rest, I would be happy to have some blood tests. I trust your judgement. What sort of tests are you thinking of, if you don't mind me asking? I like to know these things, you see.
DOCTOR: A standard complete blood count, to assess for anemia and other blood disorders. A Vitamin D level, as you supplement. And a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolyte balance. A thyroid-stimulating hormone test to rule out any thyroid issues, given your fatigue. It’s a fairly routine panel, Ms. Squiers. I will write a requisition form for the lab. You can have those tests done at any accredited laboratory. Once the results are back, we can discuss them further. In the meantime, continue with your regular activities. And if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please do not hesitate to contact me. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've been very thorough. A blood test sounds perfectly reasonable. Thank you for your time and your attention. I appreciate you putting my mind at rest. I shall go and get those done as soon as possible. And I will contact you if anything changes. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a pleasant day, Ms. Squiers. .
