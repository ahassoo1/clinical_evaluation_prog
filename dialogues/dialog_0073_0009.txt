DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… my sight, you see. It’s not what it used to be. Seems to be getting worse, and frankly, I’m not a young man anymore. I suppose things wear out. It’s just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient, yes. Well, many things do, unfortunately. Alright, let’s try to get a bit more specific. When did you first notice this change in your vision?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s hard to say precisely. It’s been… gradual. A few months, perhaps? Longer? I don’t really keep track of these things. It wasn’t a sudden thing, like flipping a switch. More like… the world slowly becoming a bit less sharp. It’s difficult to explain if you haven't experienced it.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to pinpoint. So, a few months… and it's a general blurring, not flashes or spots, or double vision?
PATIENT: No, not flashes or spots. Definitely not double vision. Just… everything seems a bit muted. Like looking through a dirty window, perhaps. Though I keep my windows quite clean, I assure you. It's just… a general lack of clarity. And it seems worse at night, driving. Which is… problematic.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you wear glasses or contacts currently?
PATIENT: No, I do not. Never have. Always had perfectly good vision, right up until… well, recently. I always thought needing glasses was a sign of… weakness, if I'm being frank. A concession to age, and frankly, I resisted it for as long as possible. I suppose I can't resist forever. Though I maintain I have very good genes. My grandfather could read the newspaper at ninety, you know.
DOCTOR: Genes are… a factor, certainly. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Have you noticed any pain with your eyes?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not at all. No discomfort, no itching, no redness. Nothing like that. It's not painful, Doctor. It's just… frustrating. It’s difficult to explain the subtleties, I suppose. It's not a sharp, obvious problem. It's… a decline. A lessening. Honestly, I can’t imagine what good an examination will do. But, well, you're the doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s just go through a few standard questions, and then we’ll do a quick exam, and then we can determine if further investigation is needed. Have you had any other medical problems recently?
PATIENT: Recent? Hmm. Well, my blood pressure has been a bit elevated, I suppose. The nurse at the pharmacy mentioned it when I was getting my flu shot. Nothing serious, I thought. Just… a bit high. And my divorce was finalized last year. A rather… draining experience, if I may say so. But I hardly think that has anything to do with my sight. It was a regrettable situation, truly. Though I am faring quite well now, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Elevated blood pressure… alright. And any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been a very healthy man. Remarkably so, considering… well, everything. A touch of bronchitis when I was a boy, perhaps. But nothing that required a hospital. I’ve always taken pride in my constitution. A strong constitution, you understand. My mother always said I was built like an oak. Not a delicate flower, certainly. Though my ex-wife… she certainly treated me as such. But that’s neither here nor there. No surgeries, no hospitalizations.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother lived to be eighty-seven, though she had… a touch of arthritis in her later years. My father… he passed away when I was quite young, heart attack, I believe. Nothing… remarkable. No one with… eye problems, as far as I know. Though, to be honest, we weren't a terribly close family. I hardly knew my paternal grandparents. My mother didn't speak of them much. It was a… complicated situation. I doubt they had any significant medical conditions. But I couldn't say for certain.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, not at present. I prefer to avoid them if at all possible. All those… side effects. And frankly, I have a rather… sensitive system. I don’t react well to things. I prefer a natural approach, you understand. Diet and exercise. Though, admittedly, my exercise regimen has been… somewhat curtailed lately. But it's all about moderation, isn't it? No medications, Doctor. None.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Let's do a quick examination of your eyes then. It won’t be anything invasive. Just a simple visual acuity test, and I’ll take a look at the back of your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. Do you agree to that?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose I have little choice, do I? If you insist. Though I maintain it’s unlikely to reveal anything useful. But, very well. Proceed. Though I do hope it won't take too long. I have… arrangements to make this afternoon. And I detest waiting rooms. An absolute waste of time, in my opinion. But go ahead. Do what you must.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please stand about ten feet away from the chart and cover your left eye with your hand. Read the smallest line you can see on the chart. And please, try to give me your best effort.
PATIENT: Very well. Ten feet… yes. And cover my left eye… Right. Honestly, I always suspected my right eye was the stronger one. Okay… E… F… P… T… Oh, dear. That's rather small. Let me see… V… Z… Hmm. I can make out… perhaps… some of the letters. It’s rather blurry, you see. Is that a… B? No, perhaps a… P. This is most unsatisfactory. It’s terribly difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, please cover your right eye. We’ll see what your left eye can do. Please sit when you are ready.
PATIENT: Honestly, this is quite undignified. A perfectly respectable man subjected to… eye tests. Well… this isn't much better. Honestly, I'm not even sure what some of those symbols are. It's all just… a blur. A hazy mess. Is that an F? No… perhaps a V. I really can't say with any certainty. It's terribly frustrating. I always prided myself on my sharp eyesight. It’s clearly deteriorating. Though, I suspect it's merely a temporary affliction. A minor inconvenience. But still… most disconcerting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on that, your vision is significantly reduced in both eyes. Now, I'm going to use an ophthalmoscope to look at the back of your eyes. It won’t hurt, but it will be a bright light. Just relax and look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Bright light, you say? Honestly, this is becoming rather unpleasant. I do hope this won’t take long. I have… sensitive eyes, you understand. And I detest bright lights. They give me a headache. Just… be quick, if you please. And try not to shine it directly into my eyes. It’s quite… unsettling. I suppose I must endure it, but I hardly find it a pleasant experience.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ve examined your retinas, and I’m seeing some early signs of cataracts in both eyes. Also, there's a bit of drusen, which is common with age, but something we should monitor. Your optic nerves look healthy, but overall, there's evidence of age-related changes. This explains the blurred vision and difficulty you’re experiencing. It’s not an emergency, but it does require attention.
PATIENT: Cataracts? Drusen? Honestly, Doctor, you’re speaking a language I don’t understand. Age-related changes? Well, I am aware I’m not a young man. But to attribute my perfectly reasonable, albeit slightly diminished, vision to… cataracts? It seems… excessive. Honestly, I suspect a bit of dust in my eyes is a more likely explanation. Or perhaps the glare from the computer screen. But cataracts? It sounds… rather serious. And frankly, I’m not convinced. So, what does this… attention… entail, precisely? And will it involve any… unpleasant procedures? I much prefer natural remedies, you understand. A bit of eye rest, perhaps? Or a change in diet?
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I understand your skepticism. But these aren’t things that can be resolved with “eye rest” or a change in diet. Cataracts are a clouding of the lens of your eye, and drusen are deposits under the retina. They're both very common with age, but they do affect your vision. While we can't reverse them, we can manage them. The best course of action is a referral to an ophthalmologist. They can perform more detailed testing and discuss your options, which may include prescription lenses to improve your vision, or potentially, cataract surgery if it becomes significantly worse. I’m not recommending surgery at this time, but it’s something to consider down the line. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Surgery? Absolutely not. I have no intention of subjecting myself to a surgical procedure for… a bit of blurry vision. It seems… rather drastic. And prescription lenses? Honestly, I’ve always prided myself on my natural eyesight. To rely on artificial aids… it’s… a concession I’m not prepared to make. And a referral? More appointments? More waiting rooms? Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming rather… burdensome. Is there nothing else? No other options? Perhaps a special eye drop? A vitamin supplement? I much prefer a less… invasive approach. And frankly, I’m not convinced I even need to see another doctor. I suspect a bit of rest and a change in lighting would suffice. This is all… rather unsettling, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Mr. Alcorta, I understand your reluctance, but ignoring these changes won’t make them go away. While I can recommend a vitamin supplement with lutein and zeaxanthin – which may slow the progression – it won’t restore your vision. I’m obligated to recommend the best possible care, and that includes a specialist evaluation. I can provide you with a referral to a reputable ophthalmologist in the area. You are not obligated to follow through with any treatment you don't feel comfortable with. But at least get an evaluation. Your blood pressure is also elevated, and that can affect your vision. Ignoring that isn't a good idea, either. I’ve written down the referral information, and a list of optometrists for prescription lenses if you decide to go that route. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Very well. A referral, then. Though I still maintain it’s unnecessary. And my blood pressure… I assure you, it’s perfectly manageable. I simply need to… relax more. I suppose I'll have a look at this list. But I make no promises. And frankly, I doubt any specialist will be able to offer anything I haven't already considered. Very well. I suppose that concludes this… unfortunate affair. Thank you for your time, Doctor. Though I can’t say I’m particularly optimistic about the outcome. I believe I’ll take my leave now. Good day. .
