DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this itching, really. It's all over, pretty much, and it’s been going on for… oh, let me think… about three weeks now, I’d say. Started on my arms, then spread. Not terribly painful, just… really annoying. It keeps me up at night sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks of itching all over, starting on your arms and spreading. And it's disruptive to your sleep, you said. That certainly sounds frustrating. To get a better understanding, could you describe the itching itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to describe it… It’s not like a bee sting, definitely not sharp. More… a deep, nagging kind of itch. Like something is crawling under my skin, but there's nothing there. And it comes and goes, you know? Sometimes it’s really bad, then it calms down for a bit, then flares up again. It’s worse at night, like you said. I scratch, and it feels good for a moment, but then it just comes back. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Ferneding. A deep, nagging itch that feels like something crawling under the skin, coming and going in flares, worse at night, and temporarily relieved by scratching… that's very helpful. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to trigger these flare-ups?
PATIENT: That's a good question... Let me think. I haven’t really noticed anything specific, to be honest. I haven't eaten anything new, I don't think. I haven't started using any new soaps or detergents... Oh! Wait a minute. About a week ago, I helped my neighbor, Mrs. Henderson, with some gardening. We were pulling weeds, and there were a lot of… stinging nettles, I think she called them? I got a few leaves on my arms, but I washed them off right away. Could that be it? I didn't think much of it at the time.
DOCTOR: That's very important information, Mr. Ferneding – helping your neighbor with gardening and potential exposure to stinging nettles. It certainly could be related. Let's talk a little more broadly. Have you had any other symptoms alongside the itching?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. No fever, no chills. No… rashes, really, just the itch. No swelling anywhere. I haven't noticed any changes in my weight, and my appetite's been normal. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but honestly, that could just be getting older! I’m 53, you know. My energy levels aren’t what they used to be. Oh, and… sometimes my skin feels a little dry, but I put lotion on it. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: That's all good information to know, thank you. No fever, chills, weight changes, or other rashes. Increased tiredness is something we’ll keep in mind, and the dry skin is noted. Now, I'm going to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, my blood pressure's a little high, but I take medication for it. Just a small dose. And… I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that was all taken care of. Oh, and… my wife, God rest her soul, passed away two years ago. I’ve been a little… down since then, but I’m managing. Otherwise, I’d say I’m pretty healthy for my age. I get regular checkups with my primary care doctor. He’s a good man. I’m on Medicare, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Ferneding. High blood pressure managed with medication, gallbladder removal ten years ago, and the loss of your wife – I’m very sorry for your loss. And yes, Medicare is important information, thank you. Now, are you currently taking any medications, aside from your blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure medication, lisinopril, 10 milligrams a day. And… sometimes I take an over-the-counter allergy pill, loratadine, if my sinuses are bothering me, but that’s maybe once a month, or less. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking pills as much as possible. I prefer a natural approach, if you know what I mean. I believe in letting my body heal itself, when it can.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril 10mg daily for blood pressure and occasional loratadine for allergies. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I've had seafood, nuts, all sorts of things. My wife was the one with the allergies, always had to be careful about what she ate. I just… never had that problem. So, no, no known allergies. I don't even get mosquito bites very often. It’s strange, really.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. No known allergies. Now, finally, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had eczema when she was a child, but she outgrew it. My father was healthy as a horse, lived to be 88. My sister has arthritis, but that’s about it. Nothing really… serious. No history of skin conditions, really, aside from my mother's childhood eczema. We weren't a particularly sickly family, if that makes sense. I’m a first-generation Russian, by the way. My parents immigrated here when I was a little boy. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Ferneding. That’s very helpful. No significant family history of skin conditions, aside from your mother's childhood eczema. And knowing you are first-generation Russian is useful information as well. Alright, thank you for all of that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a good look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m happy to do whatever you need me to. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I haven't been feeling my best lately, so I'm glad to finally be getting it checked out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Everything sounds clear there. Okay, now let me take a look at your skin. I'm noting some scattered, small papules - little raised bumps - mostly on your arms and a few on your chest. They are slightly red, but not inflamed. There is some mild excoriation - evidence of scratching. I'm also noting some dryness, particularly on your legs. Overall, there's no significant rash pattern, just scattered papules and evidence of scratching. I don’t see any signs of infection. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds… not terrible, I guess? Just a lot of little bumps and scratching. I have been scratching a lot, you're right. It's hard not to, you know? So, what do you think it is, Doctor? Is it something serious? I’m starting to worry a little, to be honest. I don’t want to end up in the hospital.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Ferneding. It's good you're getting it checked out. Based on what you’ve told me – the history of the itching, the exposure to stinging nettles, and the findings of the exam - my working diagnosis is pruritus, likely due to a delayed hypersensitivity reaction, possibly from contact dermatitis related to the stinging nettles. The stinging nettles contain chemicals that can cause a reaction, even after washing. Sometimes, the reaction can be delayed, and the itching can persist for weeks. The small bumps are consistent with that. The scratching, of course, is making things worse. However, to rule out other potential causes – things like eczema, allergic reactions to something else, or even less common skin conditions – I'd like to order a few simple tests. Would you be agreeable to a complete blood count and a skin scraping to look for mites or fungal infection?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Stinging nettles… I guess that could be it. I hadn’t really thought about it. A delayed reaction… that explains why it’s lasted so long. And yes, absolutely. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. A blood test and a skin scraping… sounds perfectly fine. I just want to get this sorted out. I’m tired of itching, and I’m tired of worrying. What does the skin scraping involve, exactly? Just so I know what to expect. And when will I get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The skin scraping is quite simple. I’ll gently scrape a tiny sample of skin from one or two of the affected areas – it will feel a little like a light scratch, but shouldn't be painful. We'll send the sample to the lab, and they'll examine it under a microscope to rule out any mites or fungal infections. The lab results usually take about 2-3 business days. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend a few things to help relieve the itching. First, I want you to continue to avoid scratching as much as possible. It’s easier said than done, I know, but it’s really important. I’m going to prescribe a topical corticosteroid cream – a mild one – to help reduce the inflammation and itching. You’ll apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice a day. I also recommend an oral antihistamine – something like loratadine, which you’ve used before – to help block the histamine response and reduce the itching. You can take one tablet daily as needed. And I want you to continue to use a gentle, fragrance-free moisturizer to keep your skin hydrated. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense. No scratching, corticosteroid cream, antihistamine, and moisturizer. I can definitely do that. I’ll try my best not to scratch, I promise. It's just so tempting sometimes! So, to recap – you think it’s probably the stinging nettles, but the tests will rule out anything else. And the cream and antihistamine should help relieve the itching in the meantime. Is there anything else I should be doing, or anything I should avoid? And what if the itching doesn't get better with the cream and antihistamine?
DOCTOR: Exactly. You’ve got it. And yes, let’s talk about what if it doesn’t improve. If the itching doesn’t start to improve within a week, or if it gets worse despite the treatment, please call the office immediately. We may need to consider other possibilities, like allergic contact dermatitis to something else, or even refer you to a dermatologist for further evaluation. In the meantime, avoid any known irritants – harsh soaps, detergents, fragrances, and anything else that might aggravate your skin. Wear loose-fitting, cotton clothing, and avoid getting overheated. And try to manage your stress levels – stress can also worsen itching. I'm going to give you a written summary of these instructions, including the medication orders, before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That sounds good. No harsh chemicals, loose clothing, manage stress... I can do that. A written summary is great, thank you. Hmm... I think that's all for now. You’ve answered all my questions, and you've put my mind at ease a little bit. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so thoroughly. It's been a long few weeks, and I'm just glad to finally have some answers, or at least a plan to find them. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I'm glad I could help. It's my pleasure. Remember, we're here if you have any concerns or if things don't improve. My nurse will be in shortly to go over the paperwork with you and schedule a follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I hope you start to feel better soon. Here's a little something extra with some helpful tips. Don't hesitate to call if you need anything. .
