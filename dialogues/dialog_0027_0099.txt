DOCTOR: Good morning, Denis. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Fazzina. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. I received some results back from a test… an internal one, I believe they called it – a GI Endo Test – and it seems something wasn’t quite right. I was hoping you could explain what it all means.
DOCTOR: Okay, a GI Endo Test… right. Let me pull those results up now. Just one moment… Ah, yes. I see it here. It does show some… irregularities. Now, to be perfectly honest, my memory isn't what it used to be, and these tests can be… detailed. Could you tell me a little more about why you had the test done?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’ve been having some discomfort… a sort of burning sensation in my stomach, mostly after I eat. And, occasionally, some… well, let's just say things weren’t passing as they should. My previous doctor – Doctor Ramirez – thought it best to investigate further, so she ordered the test. It was a few weeks ago, I believe. She mentioned something about looking for inflammation, but I wasn’t entirely clear on the specifics. It's a bit overwhelming, to be frank.
DOCTOR: Yes, it can be. Burning sensation after eating, and some changes in bowel habits… alright. And Dr. Ramirez suspected inflammation, that’s good. Just to clarify – is the burning sensation constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. It isn’t always there. It tends to be worse after I’ve eaten something… heavier, I suppose. Something with a lot of spice, or perhaps a rich sauce. But it isn’t always related to the food, to be truthful. Sometimes it’s there even on an empty stomach, though milder then. It's rather unpredictable, really.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable, worse with heavier foods, especially spice… alright. And what about the changes in bowel habits?
PATIENT: Well, sometimes things are… slower than usual. Other times… not as solid as they should be. It varies, just like the stomach discomfort. It’s not a consistent issue, thankfully. It's been going on for a few months now, perhaps four or five. It hasn't been debilitating, but it's certainly… concerning enough to warrant a visit, as you can imagine. I do try to eat a balanced diet, mostly fruits and vegetables, but one does enjoy a good mole sometimes!
DOCTOR: Of course, a good mole! I understand. Four to five months… alright. Let me quickly review your chart here… I see you haven’t had a recent colonoscopy… and no significant past medical history noted. Do you have any allergies to medications that you know of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not have any known allergies to medications. I’ve rarely needed to take anything, thankfully. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, and those have always been fine. I am not currently taking any regular medications at all. And no, I haven't had a colonoscopy. I wasn't aware it was necessary, until perhaps now. Is that what you were going to suggest?
DOCTOR: It’s a possibility we should consider. Based on what you’ve told me, and the results of the GI Endo Test – which does indicate some inflammation in the lower digestive tract – we need to investigate further to determine the cause. There are several possibilities. It could be something relatively minor, like gastritis, or something more serious. To rule things out, and get a clearer picture, I would recommend a colonoscopy. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… well, it doesn't sound particularly pleasant, but if it will help determine what is going on, then yes, I suppose so. I trust your judgement, Doctor. What does it involve, exactly? And is there anything I need to do to prepare for it? I’ve heard stories, and some of them aren’t very… comforting.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension. It isn’t the most enjoyable procedure, you're right, but it’s very important for diagnosis. Essentially, a small camera is gently inserted into the rectum to visualize the entire colon. It allows us to look for any abnormalities, such as polyps, inflammation, or other issues. The preparation is the least pleasant part, I won't lie. You’ll need to follow a special diet for a day or two beforehand, and take a strong laxative to completely clear your bowels. It's essential for a clear view. We’ll give you detailed instructions, and there are different types of preparations available. We can discuss which one would be best for you. I'll also be honest - because you're uninsured, this will be an out-of-pocket expense. I can provide you with an estimated cost, and we can discuss payment options. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable, although a bit concerning regarding the cost. I hadn’t fully considered that aspect. Perhaps we can discuss payment options later, then. For now, let’s focus on the procedure itself. You mentioned different types of preparations… are some easier than others? I am not a particularly strong person, so I worry about… complications, shall we say. And how long does the procedure take? Is it done under sedation? I am a little anxious, Doctor, as you can imagine.
DOCTOR: Perfectly understandable. Anxiety is very common before a colonoscopy. Yes, the procedure is typically done under sedation – usually a mild sedative to help you relax and minimize discomfort. You won't be completely unconscious, but you’ll be very drowsy and won't remember much of it. Regarding the preparation, there are several options. Some involve drinking a large volume of liquid over a short period, which can be difficult for some people. Others are split doses, taken over a longer period, which can be easier to tolerate. There are also pill-based preparations now, though those aren't suitable for everyone. We can talk through the pros and cons of each one, and I'll recommend the one that I think would be best for you, given your concerns. The procedure itself usually takes about 30 to 60 minutes. Afterwards, you'll be monitored for a short time until the sedation wears off. You’ll need someone to drive you home, as you won’t be able to drive yourself. I want to assure you, we take every precaution to ensure your safety and comfort. Do you have any other concerns that I can address right now?
PATIENT: That sounds… much better knowing there’s sedation involved. And the pill-based option sounds appealing, if suitable. Perhaps we should explore that one first. And yes, I do have someone who can drive me. My granddaughter, Elena, is very reliable. I suppose my biggest worry is… what if something serious is found? I am an older woman, and… well, I’ve lived a good life. I don't want to undergo any treatments that would cause more harm than good. Is that a reasonable concern, Doctor? I don't want to be put through anything unnecessary. And, if something is found, what are the typical next steps?
DOCTOR: That is an extremely reasonable concern, Denis. It's very important to have realistic expectations and to make informed decisions about your care. We’ll only recommend treatments that are appropriate for your age, overall health, and preferences. The pill-based preparation is a good place to start, and we can see if you’re a suitable candidate. If something is found – let’s say a polyp, for example – the next steps depend on the size and type of polyp. Small polyps can often be removed during the colonoscopy itself. Larger or more concerning polyps may require further investigation with a biopsy, and potentially surgery. We’ll discuss all your options in detail, and you’ll have the final say in any treatment decisions. I want to emphasize that finding a polyp doesn’t automatically mean you have cancer. Many polyps are benign, and early detection and removal significantly reduces the risk of cancer. We’ll tailor our approach to your individual needs and circumstances. For now, let's focus on scheduling the colonoscopy and determining if the pill preparation is right for you. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Let's proceed with scheduling the colonoscopy, then. And please, do assess whether I am a good candidate for the pill preparation. That would put my mind at ease considerably. What days are you available? I am fairly flexible, though Tuesdays are best. And is there any paperwork I need to complete beforehand? I am afraid my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, so I may need assistance with that as well.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's see… Tuesdays are good. I have an opening on August 13th, or August 20th. Would either of those dates work for you?
PATIENT: August 13th would be preferable, if that is available. Yes, that will work nicely. And regarding the paperwork… is there anything I can do to prepare for that, besides bringing my glasses? I believe Elena can assist me with reading the smaller print, but I’d like to be as prepared as possible. Perhaps if there’s a form I can review online beforehand, that would be helpful.
DOCTOR: August 13th it is. I’ve scheduled you for a colonoscopy on August 13th. You’ll need to arrive at the clinic at 8:00 AM to allow time for preparation. Regarding the paperwork, there is a patient history form and a consent form. Unfortunately, they aren’t available online at this time, but they’re fairly straightforward. We can have Elena assist you with reading them when you arrive, or I can have my nurse, Maria, go through them with you. She’s very patient and helpful. We’ll also review everything verbally before the procedure. I’ll also give you detailed written instructions about the bowel preparation, and a list of medications to avoid before the colonoscopy. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything for now. You have been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience with my concerns. I’ll have Elena accompany me on August 13th, and we’ll arrive promptly at 8:00 AM. Thank you again for your kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Denis. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions before your appointment. We look forward to seeing you on August 13th. Now, where was I…?
