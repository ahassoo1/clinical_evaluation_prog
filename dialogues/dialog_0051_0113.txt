DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Glazewski, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s this… business with the, uh… going to the little boy’s room. Too much, see? Too often. It’s a bother, mostly. Not a big deal, but my wife keeps saying I need to get it checked. Women… always fussin’ over somethin’.
DOCTOR: I understand. Frequent urination can certainly be disruptive, and it’s good that your wife is encouraging you to get it looked at. It's always wise to investigate these things, even if it feels like a small issue. Just to be clear, when you say "too often," could you give me a rough estimate of how many times you're going to the bathroom during the day, and also at night?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. Numbers… I’m not good with numbers. Let me think… During the day? More than usual, I guess. Used to be, I could go a good… four, five hours without thinkin’ about it. Now? Every couple of hours, maybe. At night… that’s the worst part. I get up… oh, at least twice. Sometimes three times. Wakes my wife up, and then she really gets goin’ about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a better idea. So, a noticeable increase in frequency both day and night, with getting up multiple times at night being particularly bothersome. Now, besides the increased frequency, have you noticed any other changes or symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Well, no… not really. I don’t hurt. And it comes out… normal. You know. Not strained or nothin’. Just… more of it, more often. I think I’m drinkin’ the usual amount of water. Maybe a little less, now that I’m always watchin’ for when I need to go. It’s just… inconvenient, mostly. Old man problems, I reckon.
DOCTOR: I understand. No pain, normal stream, and you haven’t significantly changed your fluid intake. That’s good information. Let's talk a little about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, boy. History… That was a long time ago. Let me see… High blood pressure, yeah, the doctor told me somethin’ about that years back. I take a little pill for it, a white one. Can’t remember the name. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. I had a touch of pneumonia when I was a young man, workin’ the farm, but that was… goodness, sixty years ago? My wife handles most of the doctor stuff now, to be honest. She remembers all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication. That’s helpful to know. It's not uncommon for medications to sometimes have side effects, so we'll keep that in mind. And it's wonderful that you have a supportive wife who helps with your healthcare. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else besides the pneumonia?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me think… Oh! My appendix. When I was maybe… twenty? Something like that. Took it out. And… no, I don’t think so. Nothing else comes to mind. I’ve always been a strong fella. Worked hard on the farm my whole life. Didn’t have much time for gettin’ sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy when you were younger. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or prostate issues?
PATIENT: Prostate… Now there’s a word I hear a lot on the TV. My brother, bless his soul, he had somethin’ with his prostate. Years back. Had to… well, he had some procedures. Not pleasant, I recall. My father, he was a strong man. Lived to be eighty-five. Never saw a doctor in his life. Just… tough as nails. My mother… she had the usual woman troubles, I suppose. But nothin’ I ever paid much attention to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a brother with prostate issues, and a father who was generally healthy. That’s helpful information. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife would have killed me if I did. She always said it was a filthy habit. I drink… a little wine with dinner sometimes. A glass or two. Nothing crazy. Helps me relax, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking and just a glass or two of wine with dinner. That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, I just want to ask about any allergies you may have, to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Let me think… No, I don’t think so. Never been allergic to nothin’. Maybe a little hay fever when I was a boy, runnin’ around in the fields. But that wasn’t a real allergy, just a bit of a sniffle. Nothing serious. My wife says I’m too tough to be allergic to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's good. Now, Mr. Segretto, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a simple prostate exam. It'll just take a few minutes and can help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A prostate exam, you say? Oh, boy. Well… I suppose so. As long as it’s quick. Not lookin’ forward to that, to be honest. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… try to be gentle, alright? I’m an old man.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We'll take it slow, and I'll explain everything as we go. It won’t take long. If you could just lie down on the examination table, we can get started.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Here goes nothin’. This ain't as easy as it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope first. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Now, for the prostate exam. I'm going to apply a small amount of lubricant and gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. This allows me to feel the size and texture of your prostate. It may be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just try to relax. Are you comfortable with me proceeding?
PATIENT: Well, you’ve already got one hand in the cookie jar, haven’t you? Might as well finish it, I suppose. Just… be quick about it, alright? And warn me before you… start. Old man pride, you know. Don't want to make a scene.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. I completely understand. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible, and I’ll let you know exactly what I’m doing before I do it. Alright, Mr. Segretto, I'm just going to insert my finger gently now. Take a deep breath. Prostate is enlarged, smooth, and firm. No nodules palpated. Alright, that’s all done. Everything went smoothly, Mr. Segretto. Thank you for your cooperation. I'll just be a moment while I review my findings and discuss some possible next steps with you.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn't as bad as I expected, thankfully. Still not a pleasant experience, mind you. So, what does it all mean, Doctor? Is it somethin’ serious? My wife's gonna want to know everything, you see. And she won't let me off easy if I don’t have answers.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Segretto, and I appreciate your wife’s attentiveness to your health. Based on the physical exam – the enlarged prostate – and your symptoms of frequent urination, it’s most likely you have benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. This is a very common condition in men as they get older. It means your prostate gland has grown larger, which can press on your urethra and make it difficult to empty your bladder completely. It’s not cancer, and it’s not usually serious, but it can be bothersome and affect your quality of life. The fact that your prostate feels smooth suggests it’s not something more concerning at this time. To get a clearer picture and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few tests. Specifically, a PSA blood test to check for prostate-specific antigen, and a urinalysis to look for infection or other problems. We can also do a urine flow study to measure how quickly your bladder empties. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… More tests. Seems like all I do is go to the doctor and get tests these days. Still, better safe than sorry, I reckon. And my wife would skin me alive if I refused. So, these tests… what do they involve? Needles? I hate needles. And how long will it take to get the results? She'll be all over me if I can’t tell her somethin’ concrete.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your reluctance, Mr. Segretto. We'll try to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. The PSA test is just a simple blood draw, so yes, it involves a needle, but it’s usually very quick and doesn't take long. We’ll draw a small amount of blood from your arm. The urinalysis is just a urine sample – you’ll simply provide a cup of urine. The urine flow study is done in the bathroom – you’ll empty your bladder as normal while we measure the flow rate. The lab usually takes a few days to process the results – typically 3-5 business days. Once we have them, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and create a treatment plan if necessary. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink a normal amount of fluids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bedtime, and trying to urinate regularly throughout the day. Does that sound manageable, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Manageable… I suppose so. Caffeine and alcohol before bed… that’s not gonna be easy, mind you. But I can try. My wife will be pleased to hear I'm willing to cooperate. So, these tests... can we get them done today? I'd like to get this over with, to be honest. Less worryin', you see. And maybe I can finally get a decent night's sleep.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. We can certainly get the tests ordered today and get you scheduled for them. Our phlebotomist is available this afternoon, and we can arrange for you to provide a urine sample before you leave. Let me just print out the lab requisitions and instructions for the urine flow study. Here you are. This requisition form is for the PSA blood test, and this one is for the urinalysis. The instructions for the urine flow study are on this sheet. Please try to collect a sample when you can get a full bladder. Do you have any questions about any of these forms?
PATIENT: Hmm… Lots of tiny print. Don’t think I can read all this without my magnifyin’ glass. But… I think I understand. Blood test, urine sample… and somethin’ about measurin’ how fast it comes out. No, I don't think I have any questions right now. Just… try to make the needle quick, alright? And tell your nurse to be gentle. Old man problems, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. I'll make a note on your chart to let the phlebotomist know to be as gentle and quick as possible. And our nurses are all very compassionate and experienced. Once you've had the tests done, our lab will notify us when the results are available. We'll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden pain, fever, or difficulty urinating, please don’t hesitate to call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just… thank you. For explainin’ everything so clearly. And for bein’ patient with an old man. My wife's gonna be relieved I finally got this checked out. I reckon I’ll go get these tests done and hope for the best. Hopefully, it’s nothin’ too serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Segretto. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Wishing you all the best, and I hope you have a pleasant afternoon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. And… tell your nurses to be gentle with the needle, alright? .
