DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Kalinski. Is good to meet you too. Um… I have… a problem with my sinuses, I think. It’s been… bothering me. It’s hard to explain, really. It feels…full, and sometimes it hurts a little. I don't remember exactly when it started, but it's been a little while now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sinus issues can certainly be bothersome. “A little while now” is helpful, but could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe… two or three months? Maybe longer. It’s… everything feels very fast these days, Doctor. I am sorry, I don't remember well. Is just a…pressure, mostly. And sometimes, when I bend over, it feels worse. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Boham. Don’t apologize; it’s perfectly normal to have difficulty recalling exact timelines. Two or three months gives us a good starting point. And the pressure being worse when you bend over is a useful detail. Now, is this pressure constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Um… it comes and goes. Mostly it’s there, a little bit, all the time. But some days it's… much worse. Like, I had a bad day last week, with a really bad headache too. And then, other days it's… okay. Not good, but… bearable. Does that help? I don’t know all the… words.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Ms. Boham. You're describing it perfectly. A fluctuating pressure with worse days and a headache last week – that gives us a clearer picture. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pressure and headache?
PATIENT: Hmm… Sometimes… my nose feels a little stuffy. Not always, but often. And… I think I have been… more tired lately. Not just from work, but… just feeling… worn out. And maybe a little cough? Not a bad cough, but… little. Does that sound right? It’s hard to say, really.
DOCTOR: That all sounds quite plausible, Ms. Boham. A stuffy nose, increased fatigue, and a mild cough—these often accompany sinus issues. Now, regarding the cough, is there any discharge when you cough?
PATIENT: Discharge…? I… I think so? Sometimes. Not much. It's… clear, I think. Or maybe a little white? It’s hard to tell, Doctor. I don't pay close attention to… those things. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful to know, Ms. Boham. It is important. Clear or whitish discharge is consistent with what we're discussing. Now, have you had a fever or chills with any of this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. And no chills. I… I don’t think so. I have been feeling warm sometimes, but I think is from the weather. Is very hot lately, yes? I don't feel sick, just… uncomfortable. And tired.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No fever or chills is helpful. Alright, Ms. Boham, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies…? I don’t know. I don’t think so. I’ve always been… pretty healthy. I mean, I get a cold sometimes, like everyone, but… no doctor ever told me I had allergies. I work outside a lot, with dust and… things. But I never thought about… allergies. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not bad at all, Ms. Boham. It’s perfectly fine not to have a formal allergy diagnosis. Exposure to dust and outdoor elements can certainly contribute to symptoms. Now, have you had any previous sinus infections or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. I don't think so. I've had… the usual things. Colds, maybe the flu once or twice. But nothing… serious. Nothing that needed… a doctor, really. I’ve always been strong, you see. I work hard, and I don't get sick easily. But this… this is different. It just won't go away.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do any of your family members—parents, siblings—have allergies, asthma, or chronic sinus problems?
PATIENT: Um… my mother… she used to cough a lot, when she was older. Not sure what it was. And my brother… he has… problems breathing sometimes, but I don’t know what kind. Is not asthma, I think. He doesn't like to talk about it. And… that's all I can remember, Doctor. We don't talk about… health things much.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Boham. Family medical history can be difficult to recall. Knowing your mother had a chronic cough and your brother experiences breathing difficulties is helpful, nonetheless. Now, I'd like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, or are you exposed to secondhand smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor! No smoking. Never. And I stay away from people who smoke. Is very bad for you. My husband doesn’t smoke either. We are careful.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Ms. Boham. Now, do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much and how often?
PATIENT: Sometimes, Doctor. A little wine, maybe. With dinner. Not every day. Maybe… two or three times a week? Just one glass. My husband drinks a little beer sometimes too. But we don’t drink very much. We are not big drinkers.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Boham. Now, finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take any medications. Just… sometimes, when my head hurts a lot, I take… something for the pain. But not often. Is just… something you buy at the store. I don't remember the name. And… that's all. I like to be natural, you see? I don't like to take too many pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Boham. Thank you for providing me with all of this information. Now, I would like to conduct a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I will listen to your lungs, check your sinuses for tenderness, and take a look at your throat. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s good. Whatever you need to do. Is fine with me. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start by listening to your lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… very good. Again… deep breath in… and out… Okay. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your sinuses to check for any tenderness. I’ll start here… Does that feel tender?
PATIENT: Ooh… a little bit. Yes, here… it’s a little sore. Not bad, but… I feel it. It’s been like that for… a long time now. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, yes, there is some tenderness here, and also a little bit on this side. And a slight tenderness here as well. Now, let's take a look at your throat. Please open your mouth for me… Ah… Your throat looks slightly red, but there are no obvious signs of infection. Based on what you've told me and my preliminary examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing sinusitis, potentially chronic sinusitis given the duration of your symptoms. However, to be certain, I’d like to order a few tests. Would you be amenable to a complete blood count to rule out any infection, and potentially a CT scan of your sinuses to get a better look at the structures and assess the extent of inflammation?
PATIENT: Tests…? A CT scan…? Is that… safe, Doctor? I don't like… too many tests. Is it expensive? I don't have insurance, you see. I just want to feel better… Is there anything else we can do? Maybe… medicine?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Boham. It's perfectly reasonable to be hesitant about tests, especially without insurance. Let me explain. A CT scan uses X-rays, and while there is minimal radiation exposure, the benefits of accurately diagnosing the issue and guiding treatment often outweigh the risks. It's the best way to see what's going on inside your sinuses and determine if there's a blockage or infection that needs specific attention. Regarding cost, I'll have my staff check with the hospital and see if we can explore options for financial assistance or a lower-cost imaging center. We can also discuss a trial of medication first, if you prefer, and see if that provides some relief. A common approach for sinusitis is a nasal saline rinse, over-the-counter decongestants, and possibly a short course of an oral steroid to reduce inflammation. We can start with those and see how you respond. If your symptoms don't improve within a week or worsen, then we can revisit the possibility of the CT scan. How does that sound to you?
PATIENT: That… sounds better, Doctor. Starting with medicine is good. I don't like the idea of those… X-rays right now. And checking about the cost is very kind of you. Nasal rinse… I think I’ve heard of that. Is easy to do? And what kind of medicine should I take? Do I need a prescription? I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Boham, a nasal rinse is very easy to do. You can purchase a saline rinse kit at most pharmacies. It involves using a special bottle or container to flush your nasal passages with a saltwater solution. It helps to clear congestion and reduce inflammation. I can give you a handout with instructions, and my nurse can demonstrate the proper technique before you leave. Regarding medication, I recommend starting with over-the-counter pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine decongestant, following the package directions carefully. These can help to relieve your stuffy nose. I’ll also write you a prescription for a short course of prednisone, a steroid, to reduce the inflammation in your sinuses. It's important to take the full course of medication, even if you start feeling better, to prevent the symptoms from returning. I'll also recommend staying well-hydrated and avoiding irritants like smoke and dust. We'll monitor your progress closely. If your symptoms don't improve within a week, or if you develop a fever, severe headache, or facial pain, please contact the office immediately. And we can then consider the CT scan and referral to an ENT specialist if needed. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That makes sense. Saline rinse, medicine… and stay away from smoke. And call if I get worse. Thank you, Doctor Kalinski. You are very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I hope this helps me feel better soon. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Boham. I'm happy to help. Remember, we're here for you. My nurse will review the instructions and prescriptions before you leave. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you a speedy recovery. Please take care of yourself, and feel free to schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to assess your progress. It was a pleasure meeting you.
