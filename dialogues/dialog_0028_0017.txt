DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I’m Dr. Memmolo. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Uh… well, it's about this… team. A sports team. I think. A tryout, yes. For my… health. It’s a physical, I was told. A check-up before I… play. Something like that. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. A young man said I needed this.
DOCTOR: Right. A physical. For… a team. Hmm. And you’re here to fulfill requirements for participation. Very well. Let’s get this over with. Do you have any specific concerns you want to address today, or should we just proceed with the standard examination?
PATIENT: Concerns? Well, I don’t think so. Not that I recall. I feel… alright. Old, maybe, but alright. Standard seems… good. Just get it done, yes? I don't want to waste anyone’s time. Though, I do hope this won’t be too… strenuous. My knees, they sometimes… complain. Not a big deal, usually.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We'll keep it brief. Just to clarify – these knee complaints, are they constant, or do they flare up with activity?
PATIENT: Flare up, yes. When I… move too much. Or too fast. Sitting is good. Standing… less good. Not bad, mind you. Just… present. It’s been like this for… a while. Years, I think. It’s not new. I’ve learned to… manage. Mostly by not doing too much.
DOCTOR: Years of intermittent knee pain… Manageable with activity modification. Fine. Alright. Let’s start with some basic vitals. Blood pressure, pulse, temperature… and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please, sit still. And try not to talk while I’m listening, it makes things… difficult.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Quiet. I can be quiet. I’m a quiet man, generally. Though, I do enjoy a good story… Never mind. Just… do your thing, Doctor. I’ll sit. Very still. Is that cuff… tight?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Bartok. Necessary. Blood pressure is… elevated. 148 over 92. Pulse is 78, regular. Temperature is normal. Okay. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me. And another.
PATIENT: Elevated? Is that… bad? I don’t… drink much. Maybe it’s the heat. It’s been hot, yes? I get… nervous at the doctor’s office. Always have. Is that alright? I can try to breathe deeper, if you need.
DOCTOR: It’s… not ideal. We’ll monitor it. Just breathe normally. Now, I need to examine your reflexes. Please, extend your arms. And relax your legs. I'll tap on your tendons.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Arms extended. Legs… relaxed. Though, it's hard to relax when someone's about to… hit me with something. Not really hit, I know. Just… tap. Is that… necessary? It feels a bit… undignified.
DOCTOR: It’s a neurological assessment, Mr. Bartok. Standard. Reflexes are… present, but diminished. Not a cause for immediate alarm, but we’ll note it. Now, let’s move on to a quick range of motion assessment. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Touch my toes? Doctor, with all due respect… I haven’t been able to touch my toes in… a very long time. It’s… not a pretty sight. But I can try. Just… don't expect miracles. See? Told you.
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion in the lumbar spine. As expected. We’ll note that. Now, I need to palpate your abdomen. Just lie flat, and tell me if anything feels… tender.
PATIENT: Palpate? Like… feel around? Alright. Flat I can do. Tender… well, everything's a little tender these days. Getting old, you know. But if something is particularly tender… I'll let you know. Is that… normal? It feels a bit… strange.
DOCTOR: It's… acceptable. No acute abnormalities detected. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs again. Take a deep breath. And another. Still no murmurs or adventitious sounds. Hmm. Let’s review your medical history. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Let me think… I don't think so. Not to anything serious, anyway. Dust bothers me a little, sometimes. And… bees. I don’t like bees. They sting. That’s an allergy, right? To pain? Is that on the form? "Allergic to bees."
DOCTOR: Mild seasonal allergies, aversion to bee stings. Noted. Do you have any current medications you’re taking?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see… oh! I take a little something for my… waterworks. Makes things… easier. And sometimes, a little something for my… stomach. When it acts up. But that's it, I think. Just the water and the stomach pills. Do I need to give you names? I don't recall them. My daughter usually handles that.
DOCTOR: Names would be… helpful, Mr. Bartok. Do you know the dosages, at least?
PATIENT: Dosages? No, Doctor. I just… take them. When I need them. Small pills. White ones and… blue ones, I think. My daughter fills the little plastic containers. She tells me what to take and when. I don't bother with the names or the numbers. Too much fuss. I just want to… feel better. Is this… a problem?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Based on this… limited information, and the preliminary examination, it appears you're generally stable. However, the lack of detail regarding your medications is concerning. I recommend a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician to obtain a comprehensive medication list. And, frankly, a more detailed medical history. I'm also going to suggest monitoring your blood pressure regularly. .
