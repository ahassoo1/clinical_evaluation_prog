DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well now, Doctor... Trestrail, is it? Yes. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's get this over with. I need a... a paper. A permission slip, you might say. For somethin' I wanna do. It's about… appearances.
DOCTOR: "A paper" for "appearances"?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. A… a fixin'. A little touch-up. And I need your say-so to do it. It ain't complicated. Folks been askin' why I look so… tired. And frankly, it's none of their business, but they keep askin'. Now, what do you need from me to get this done? I got appointments, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I'm a family medicine physician. I treat illnesses and injuries, I don't provide documentation for elective cosmetic procedures. Are you experiencing a medical problem that is causing you concern about your appearance?
PATIENT: Elective? Now see here... it's important. And no, I ain't sick. Just... old. Weary. And frankly, a little run-down. Folks expect a certain… presentation. You understand. It's business. And I need this paper, or I won’t be able to… conduct business. What kind of doctor are you anyway? This is a simple thing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand you're feeling pressure to maintain a certain image, but providing documentation for a cosmetic procedure when there is no underlying medical need is not within the scope of my practice, nor is it ethically sound. I’m concerned about why you feel this pressure and whether it’s affecting your overall health. Before we discuss any further, let’s review your medical history. Have you been seen by a primary care physician regularly?
PATIENT: Medical history? Goodness. That was… a long time ago. Honestly, I don’t recall. Doctors are for when you're sick. I ain’t sick. I just want a signature, Doctor. Is that so much to ask? This is really wasting my time. And frankly, your time too. You should be helpin' people with real problems. Now, can you just write the paper or not? I don’t need a life story, just… a permission slip.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, with all due respect, I am obligated to assess your health before providing any documentation. Even if you don't feel sick, there could be underlying issues contributing to your concerns. Let’s start with the basics. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Land sakes. I eat everything. Dust, pollen... I ain't bothered by nothin'. I've been around a long time, Doctor. I've built things, fixed things... I ain't got time for allergies. Look, are you gonna help me, or should I find somebody who will? This is gettin' ridiculous. I’m a busy man.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you currently take any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications… Now that you mention it… There was somethin'… for my… joints. A little while back. But I stopped takin' it. Didn’t seem to do much good. Mostly just upset my stomach. I can’t recall the name, though. Old age, you understand. Things… slip your mind. Now, can we please move this along? I’ve got towers to climb.
DOCTOR: Okay. And can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? Doctor, I barely remember my family, let alone their medical problems! That was… a long time ago. And frankly, it’s not relevant. I’m standin’ here, perfectly capable, just wantin’ a signature. This is a waste of my precious time. Really, is there no way you can just… write the paper? I don't have all day to dig through ancient history.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, but I’m still unable to fulfill your request. My ethical obligation is to provide appropriate medical care. Providing documentation for a cosmetic procedure without a proper medical assessment, especially given your reluctance to share any information about your health history, would be irresponsible. It sounds like you're feeling a significant amount of pressure about your appearance. Perhaps, instead of pursuing this documentation, we could discuss some resources for stress management or mental health support?
PATIENT: Now see here! Are you tryin' to tell me somethin'? I am perfectly fine! I've built this business with my own two hands. I don’t need your... your therapy! I came here for a simple piece of paper, and you're spoutin' nonsense! I will find another doctor. Another competent doctor! You are a waste of my time, and frankly, a little insulting! .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I wish you the best. However, I must reiterate, I cannot provide documentation without a proper assessment. Please consider prioritizing your health and seeking medical attention if you experience any concerning symptoms. .
