DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. Good morning. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, it's about a life insurance thing. They sent me for this exam, you know, to check if I'm… healthy enough. That's all. I just want to get it over with, if we can.
DOCTOR: Life insurance, eh?
PATIENT: Yeah. My… ex-wife’s lawyer asked for it. Part of the divorce settlement. Honestly, it’s a whole thing. Can we just do the exam? I got things to do today.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, even for life insurance, we still need to get a proper history, Mr. Putney. Can’t just… wave a magic wand and say you’re fit as a fiddle. It's standard procedure, and frankly, important for your benefit as well. Now, do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Existing… hmm. Not really. I had high blood pressure a few years back, the doctor put me on pills for it, but I stopped taking them after a while. Felt kinda… weird. I haven't been to a doctor regularly since then, to be honest. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Stopped taking your medication, did you?
PATIENT: Well, yeah. I felt better, and they were making me tired all the time. I figured if I was feeling okay, I didn't need them. It was a while ago though, like… five years maybe? Look, I’m not a doctor, alright? I just stopped taking the pills. Is that a problem for the insurance?
DOCTOR: A problem for the insurance?
PATIENT: Well, yeah! That’s why I’m here, isn’t it? They want to know if I'm a good risk, and stopping my pills… doesn't sound good, does it? I just want to get this done so I can move on with things. It’s a long story, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We'll get through it. Let’s start with some basic vitals, and then we'll do a quick physical exam. It’s best to have a full picture before we jump to conclusions. Roll up your sleeve, please. And just so I have a clear idea, do you have any other health problems – any aches, pains, shortness of breath, anything at all?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. My knees bother me sometimes, especially when it's cold. And I get winded pretty easy if I walk up a lot of stairs. Nothing major, though. Just old age, I guess. I’m 49, you know. It happens.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. Tried it once when I was a kid, didn’t like it. My mom would’ve killed me if she found out anyway. She was a real health nut. Can we hurry this up a little? I got a fishing trip planned for tomorrow.
DOCTOR: A fishing trip is hardly an emergency, Mr. Putney. Now, any family history of heart disease, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Heart disease… uh, my grandfather, on my mom’s side, he had something with his heart. I don't remember exactly what. Diabetes… maybe my aunt? Honestly, I wasn't paying much attention back then. We didn’t talk about that stuff much. It was a different time. Look, is this really gonna take much longer?
DOCTOR: We're getting there, Mr. Putney. But it's important to be thorough. Now, let’s talk about your weight. Have you noticed any recent weight gain or loss?
PATIENT: A little weight gain, yeah. Probably ten, fifteen pounds in the last couple years. It's hard not to, you know? I work a desk job, and I don't get much exercise. Plus, there's been a lot going on, and comfort food helps. Can we please get to the actual exam now? I feel like I'm being interrogated.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. Fine. Let's get the exam over with. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your reflexes. Please lie back on the examination table. And try to relax, if you can.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Just… hurry, alright? I got things to do. And please don’t use that cold stethoscope. It always makes me jump.
DOCTOR: Breathing deeply, Mr. Putney. I'm listening for any unusual sounds. Lungs are clear, though a little diminished capacity. Heart sounds... somewhat muffled. Now, let's check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Just do it quickly, alright? It always feels weird. And don’t hit me too hard. Seriously.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are a bit sluggish, but within normal limits. Blood pressure is elevated, as is your weight. Now, have you had any recent blood work done?
PATIENT: No. Like I said, haven’t been to a doctor in years. I feel fine, mostly. A little tired sometimes, and my knees ache, but… that’s just getting old, right? Look, is this enough? Can I go now? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. Based on the limited information and this brief exam, it appears you have several risk factors for cardiovascular disease: elevated blood pressure, obesity, and a family history of heart problems. The sluggish reflexes are concerning, but could be related to several factors. I'm going to order some blood work to get a clearer picture of your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. And I strongly recommend you schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss these results and develop a plan to manage your blood pressure and weight. Ignoring these issues could have serious consequences, Mr. Putney. I’ll also write you a referral to a cardiologist for further evaluation. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A cardiologist?! Look, I just need this exam for the insurance, alright? I don’t want a cardiologist. I feel fine! I just… I don’t want to deal with all this. Is the insurance gonna cover it if I don't go? Can I just… skip the blood work and the cardiologist? What do they even need blood for? Honestly, this is just a whole mess. I just want to fish.
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, the insurance company requires a certain level of due diligence. They're not going to approve coverage without some assessment of your health. And frankly, regardless of the insurance, it's my professional responsibility to ensure you receive appropriate care. As for what the blood work is for: it helps us determine your risk of heart attack and stroke. It assesses your cholesterol levels, checks for diabetes, and evaluates your kidney function. All vital information. Skipping these tests is not an option, Mr. Putney. It's irresponsible and potentially dangerous. I can write a letter explaining the need for these tests to the insurance company, but ultimately, they have the final say. Now, are you willing to at least schedule the blood work?
PATIENT: Fine. Okay. Just… schedule the blood work. But I’m not promising I’m gonna go to a cardiologist. And if the insurance doesn’t cover it, I’m not paying for it. Is that clear? I just want this over with so I can go fishing. What time and where? Just… get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ve scheduled you for blood work at the Rural Community Clinic tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. You’ll need to fast for 12 hours beforehand – no food or drinks except water. Here's the requisition form for the blood work and the referral to Dr. Akana, the cardiologist. His office will contact you to schedule an appointment. I’ll also send these results to the insurance company. Look, Mr. Putney, I understand your reluctance. But taking care of your health is important. Even if you feel fine now, these tests can help identify potential problems before they become serious. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No. I think… I think that’s all. Just… let me know if they need anything else from me. And if the insurance rejects this, don’t bother calling me. I’m going fishing. Thanks… I guess.
DOCTOR: Some people… Honestly. .
