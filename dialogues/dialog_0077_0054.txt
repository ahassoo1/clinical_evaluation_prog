DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. I... cough a lot. Been coughing for a long time. And I get… tired. Really tired. And my nose… always blocked, feels like. Gets bad sometimes. I dunno... just feel not good.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for sharing that, Mr. Tati. “Coughing for a long time, tiredness, and a blocked nose.” I understand. Let's try to get a bit more detail about this cough. When did it start – roughly, if you don’t recall the exact date?
PATIENT: Hmm… Date… hard to say. Maybe… last year? Or maybe the year before? It started slow, just a little tickle. Then got worse when the weather got cold. I work outside a lot, changing tires… maybe from that? I dunno, Doctor. Sorry, I’m not good with remembering dates.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Tati. Don’t apologize at all. “Started slowly, worsened with cold weather, outdoor work changing tires…” That’s helpful. Does the cough produce any mucus?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. Not all the time. When it’s bad, yeah. It’s… kinda yellow. Sometimes clear. Depends. Sorry, is that… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important, thank you. Yellow mucus can tell us a bit more. And is there anything that makes the cough worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. When I lie down, it’s bad. And when it’s dusty, like at work. Changing tires… a lot of dirt flying around. Makes me cough a lot more. And… sometimes at night.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, lying down, dust, and at night. And you mentioned tiredness. Can you describe that tiredness?
PATIENT: Just… always tired. Even after sleep. Wake up still feel like I didn't sleep. Can't really do much after work. Just want to sit. Wife… she says I’m lazy, but I just… no energy. It’s… hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Tati. It sounds quite debilitating. Okay. And have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats with this?
PATIENT: Fever… not really. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but not like… sick warm. Chills… no. Night sweats… I dunno. I sleep hot, always have. So, I can't tell. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Tati. It's difficult to recall those details. Let's move on to other symptoms. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, or pain in your chest?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Sometimes… a little hard to breathe when I walk up the hill to work. But I’m not very fit, so I think that's just… being out of shape. I don’t know about shortness of breath. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Tati. Okay. Now, I’m going to ask about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. Never been told I have any. I get bitten by mosquitoes a lot, but that's everyone, right? Never had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don’t really like taking pills. Only if really, really bad headache. But I try to just rest.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. Now, do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… diagnosed… I think… maybe high blood pressure, a few years ago? Doctor told me to eat less salt. But I forgot to go back for follow-up. Work was busy. Sorry. I'm not good with remembering these things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Tati. We can look that up. And, have any close family members – parents, siblings – had any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: My father… he had problems with his heart. A long time ago. He had to have… surgery. But he’s okay now. My mother… she’s still healthy. I don't really know about other problems. We don't talk much about health.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never. Bad for you. My wife would kill me.
DOCTOR: Good. Alright, Mr. Tati. Thank you for answering all my questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will involve listening to your lungs, checking your heart rate and blood pressure, and taking your temperature. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here, we’ll get started. First, let’s listen to your lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me… and again. Your breathing sounds a little wheezy. I also hear some crackles in the lower parts of your lungs. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. Temperature is normal at 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart rate is regular, but slightly fast at 90 beats per minute. Alright, Mr. Tati. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work to help determine the cause of your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? Blood work? Is… is it bad? I don't like needles. And… is there something seriously wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s alright to be concerned, Mr. Tati. An X-ray and blood work are just to help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. The X-ray will help us see if there's any infection or fluid in your lungs. The blood work will check for signs of infection and assess your overall health. It’s not necessarily a sign of something seriously wrong, it’s just standard procedure to rule things out. And I understand you don’t like needles – we’ll try to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it could be bronchitis, pneumonia, or even asthma. It's important to determine the exact cause so we can get you the right treatment. I will write you a referral for the X-ray and blood work. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them and create a treatment plan. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay… bronchitis… asthma… I don’t know anything about these things. How long will it take to get the results? And… what if it's something bad? Will I have to go to the hospital?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to be worried, Mr. Tati. The lab results usually take 24 to 48 hours to come back. I will contact you as soon as I have them. As for your question about the hospital, it’s unlikely you’ll need to be admitted. Bronchitis and asthma are usually treated with medication, either inhalers or antibiotics, and can be managed at home. However, if your symptoms worsen significantly – such as severe shortness of breath or high fever – we may need to consider further evaluation. To help you feel better while we wait for the results, I will prescribe you an inhaler to help ease your breathing and a cough suppressant to reduce the coughing. I will also recommend that you drink plenty of fluids, rest as much as possible, and avoid irritants like smoke and dust. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… inhaler… cough suppressant… That sounds… good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. One more thing… how much will all this cost? I don’t have insurance.
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Mr. Tati. I understand not having insurance can be a significant worry. Let me look into the cost for you. The X-ray will be approximately $250, and the blood work around $150. The medication should be relatively inexpensive, around $30. I can also see if we have any patient assistance programs available at the clinic that could help reduce the costs. There may also be options for a payment plan. We don’t want the financial burden to prevent you from getting the care you need. I will have my staff member discuss these options with you before you leave. Do you have any other questions for me right now, Mr. Tati?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor Pirl. You’ve been very helpful. I feel a little better now. I will wait for the results and talk to your staff about the costs.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tati. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your results come back. My staff will be happy to assist you. Get some rest, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Bye bye.
