DOCTOR: Hi Carmaleta, it’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t really have time for this, to be honest. I just… I want to get pregnant. And I want it to be easy. My husband… well, he passed, and I don’t want any… complications. Is that enough information? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you're hoping to conceive and want to make sure everything goes smoothly, especially given your recent loss. It’s completely understandable you're feeling pressed for time and want to be efficient. To get a better understanding of what “easy” means for you, and to help ensure a healthy pregnancy, could you tell me a little bit more about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… honestly? I don’t really remember much of anything. I went to the doctor when I had to, you know, regular check-ups, vaccinations… the usual. Nothing serious. My husband always handled all the paperwork. I'm… generally healthy, I suppose. Is there a form I can just fill out? This is taking too long.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It's common to feel that way, especially after a loss. We can definitely fill out a form – it might jog your memory a little. But even a general sense is helpful to start. While you’re doing that, perhaps I can ask a few quick questions?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry up, please. What do you need to know? But I’m warning you, if it’s anything complicated, I probably won't be able to tell you. And don’t ask about dates – I’m terrible with those.
DOCTOR: Of course, no problem at all. We'll keep it as simple as possible. Let’s start with allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Never had a problem. I eat everything. Maybe shellfish once made me feel a bit… off, but that was years ago. Is that important? Honestly, I think it was just bad shellfish.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, that’s good to know. And that one-time shellfish issue doesn’t sound like a true allergy. Next, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. The standard one, you know, for women. And sometimes, when I feel a cold coming on, I’ll take some vitamin C. That’s it. Don’t make this more complicated than it needs to be. I’m not one of those people who takes a million pills.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a multivitamin and vitamin C when you feel a cold coming on. That’s very straightforward. Now, thinking about your medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, my husband handled all of that. I went to the doctor when he told me to. I’m perfectly healthy, as far as I know. I don’t feel sick. I never have. Honestly, I think you're asking me too many questions about things I don’t even remember. Can we just get this over with? I need to be going. Is there a test I can take?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I’m asking a lot of questions. I’m just trying to gather as much information as possible to ensure a healthy pregnancy for you. Even things you don’t remember can be important. But we can definitely move towards some testing. Before we do that, just a few quick questions about your past pregnancies, if you don’t mind. Have you been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Yes. Obviously. I was married. We… we had a child. One. That’s all. Look, it was a normal pregnancy, a normal birth. Everything was fine. I don't need to relive it, okay? It’s… done. And I don’t want to talk about it. Can we just focus on now? I want another baby. Is that so hard to understand?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. And I apologize if I’m upsetting you. It’s certainly not my intention. Okay, let’s focus on now. To start, I’d like to do a basic physical exam. Just to check your overall health. And then we can discuss some initial blood tests to assess your hormone levels and check for any potential issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. The quicker this is done, the better. I have a lunch meeting. I really don't have time for this. Do whatever you need to do. Just… be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’ll be as efficient as possible. First, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Finally, I’d like to do a quick abdominal exam. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Just… hurry. I really need to be going soon. Whatever you do, don't make me lie down. I don't have time for a full exam. Quick and simple, please. That's all I ask.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is 128 over 78, pulse is 72. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Ears and throat look normal. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. No masses palpated. Everything seems normal on initial assessment. We’ll need some blood work to get a more detailed picture. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood work. Just… tell me where to go. And how long it will take. I need to know if I’ll be late for my meeting. Honestly, this whole thing is taking too long. Just give me the paperwork. I’ll go do it myself. I don’t need to be bothered with any more questions. And can I get a copy of the results? I trust my own judgment.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here are the forms for the blood work. The lab is just down the hall, and it usually takes about 15-20 minutes. You can expect the results back in about 2-3 business days. We can discuss them during a follow-up appointment, or you can access them through the patient portal if you prefer. Do you have any questions about the lab work or the portal before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… let me go. I have a life. Honestly, I’m starting to regret even coming here. I’ll just… see what the results say. Don't bother calling me unless there's something serious.
