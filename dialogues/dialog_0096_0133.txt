DOCTOR: Right. Well, Melvenia, good morning. Or afternoon, I suppose. Now, you're 76, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. 76. And it is the afternoon, isn’t it? Time just flies. I just need these forms signed, if you could help me with that. I have an appointment with Social Security next week and they need everything notarized.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, the paperwork. Always paperwork. Honestly, the things they ask people to fill out these days… alright, let’s get this over with. But before we do that, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, well, it’s not really a “see you” visit, you see. I don't need to see a doctor, not exactly. I just need someone to sign these health forms for the Social Security office. They require a notary, and my regular one wasn't available. A friend suggested coming here. Is that okay? I just want to make sure everything is official, that's all.
DOCTOR: So, you’re asking me to essentially…rubber-stamp some forms for Social Security?
PATIENT: Well, not rubber-stamp. I filled them out honestly, to the best of my knowledge. It's just that they need a signature from a medical professional to verify…well, I guess verify I’m who I say I am and that the information is correct. I thought doctors did things like that sometimes. It’s just a quick signature, really. I don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Look, Melvenia, I am a doctor. I went to medical school for a very long time. I don’t simply sign forms. I assess patients. I provide medical care. This sounds…rather unusual. And frankly, a little inappropriate. I’m not sure I can do this.
PATIENT: Oh dear. I…I didn't realize it was such a problem. I just thought, since you're a doctor, and it’s a health form… I’m so sorry to bother you. I didn’t mean to ask you to do anything you weren’t comfortable with. I just don’t know where else to turn. My friend said this clinic was very helpful. Is there someone else here who might be able to help? Perhaps a nurse?
DOCTOR: Well, I suppose… I could take a quick look at the forms. Just to see what they’re asking you to certify. But don’t get your hopes up. I’m still not promising anything. Let me see them. And quickly, please. I have actual patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, thank you so much! That's very kind of you. Here they are. It’s mostly just confirming my address and that I haven’t been hospitalized recently. It’s mostly just Social Security stuff, you see. I’m trying to get my benefits sorted out.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, well. This is…rather extensive for simply confirming your address. “History of medical conditions”?
PATIENT: Oh, that part… I think it’s just a standard thing they ask. I put down my arthritis, and the time I had pneumonia a few years back. Nothing serious, really. It was a long time ago. I just wanted to be thorough. It asks about medications too, and I listed the pills I take for my joints. Is that alright? I didn’t want to leave anything out, in case they thought I was hiding something.
DOCTOR: "Pills for your joints," you say?
PATIENT: Yes. My doctor prescribed them, Dr. Ramirez. He’s a good man. They help with the pain, you see. It gets pretty bad sometimes, especially in the mornings. It's just a common arthritis medication, nothing fancy. I have the bottles at home if you need to see them. I wasn’t sure if you needed that level of detail for just a signature.
DOCTOR: And what exactly is in these “pills,” Melvenia?
PATIENT: Oh! Well, I…I don’t know the exact name, to be honest. It’s a little white pill. Dr. Ramirez just told me to take two every morning and one at night. I have a prescription, of course. I can show you the label if that helps? I’m so sorry, I’m not very good with medical things. I just take what the doctor gives me, you know? It helps me walk, mostly. It’s been a lifesaver, really.
DOCTOR: You’re taking medication you cannot name?
PATIENT: Well, no, I mean…I know of the medication. It’s… it’s called Celecoxib. That’s it! Celecoxib. I wrote it down somewhere, I just… I’m a bit disorganized, you see. I have so many appointments and pills to keep track of. Here it is! See? Celecoxib, 200mg. I take it for osteoarthritis. Is that better? I’m really sorry for all the trouble. I just didn’t think it was such a big deal.
DOCTOR: Celecoxib. An NSAID. And how long have you been taking this Celecoxib, Melvenia?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It must be… almost two years now. Dr. Ramirez started me on it when my arthritis got really bad. It helped a lot at first, but sometimes it doesn't seem to work as well anymore. He checks my blood pressure regularly, though. I have to get it checked every six months. He’s very careful. He knows all about my health history. He's a good doctor, really. Is this still a problem? I just want to get these forms signed and be on my way.
DOCTOR: Two years of Celecoxib… without any follow-up regarding potential cardiovascular risks?
PATIENT: Oh, well, he does check my blood pressure! And he asks me if I'm feeling alright. He always asks about any side effects. I haven't told him about any, though, because I haven't really had any. Just a little heartburn sometimes, but I take something for that. Is Celecoxib something I shouldn't be taking? Should I call Dr. Ramirez? I'm getting a bit worried now. I just wanted a simple signature, not a whole medical examination.
DOCTOR: Look, Melvenia, I am not going to simply sign these forms. You've been on a medication for two years without a proper assessment of its long-term effects. This is… irresponsible. I will not be a party to that. I strongly recommend you schedule an appointment with Dr. Ramirez – and bring a list of all your medications and concerns. And frankly, I suggest you find a doctor who is more thorough in their care. I am not comfortable signing anything until I have confirmation from a healthcare professional that you are being appropriately monitored.
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. I… I understand. I guess I just didn't realize it was such a big deal. I just wanted to get my benefits sorted out. Thank you for… for letting me know. I’ll call Dr. Ramirez right away. I’m sorry for wasting your time. .
DOCTOR: Good day.
