DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Honestly, I don’t have time for pleasantries. It’s my ear. Completely gone, on one side. And my face…feels a bit droopy, if you must know. It started yesterday, and it’s not getting better. I need to know what’s going on, quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. "Completely gone" – you mean you have no hearing in one ear?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. No hearing at all. It’s like someone flipped a switch. And, as I said, the side of my face feels…weak. It’s hard to explain. Things just don’t move the same when I smile, or try to close my eye. It's very unsettling. Is this something serious? Because frankly, I have a lot on my plate.
DOCTOR: Yes, it does sound concerning, Stephane. Sudden hearing loss with facial weakness is something we need to investigate promptly. To get a clearer picture, can you tell me exactly when you first noticed the hearing loss?
PATIENT: Yesterday morning, I believe. I was getting ready for work, and I just…didn't hear the news on the radio. I thought it was the volume at first, but then I realized it wasn’t the radio. It was…nothing. Complete silence on the left side. And the face thing…I noticed it a few hours later, when I was brushing my teeth. It’s not a huge difference, but it’s noticeable. I don’t understand why it’s taking so long to get to the point. What could it be?
DOCTOR: Okay, so hearing loss first, then facial weakness developed later in the day. That’s helpful. To clarify, is the facial weakness on the same side as the hearing loss – your left side?
PATIENT: Yes, the left side. Everything is on the left side. Honestly, is this…a stroke? I’ve read things. I don't have time for a long recovery. I have responsibilities. Is that what this is? You need to tell me straight.
DOCTOR: It could be, Stephane, and that’s why we need to act quickly to determine the cause. While it could be a stroke, there are other possibilities. We need to do a quick neurological exam and likely get some imaging done. I want to assure you, we're going to figure this out. Before we proceed, have you experienced any other symptoms – dizziness, headache, difficulty speaking, or any weakness in other parts of your body?
PATIENT: No dizziness, no headache. I can speak perfectly fine, as you can hear. And no, no other weakness. Just the ear and the face. I really don’t understand why this is happening. I’m a radiologist, for goodness sake. I see these things all the time, but when it happens to you…It’s very frustrating. Just get on with it, please. What kind of imaging? And how long will this take? I have patients waiting.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration completely, Stephane. We'll move as quickly as possible. I’d like to start with a quick neurological exam – just checking your reflexes, strength, and sensation. Then, the most helpful imaging would be an MRI of the brain, with and without contrast. It's the best way to visualize the nerves and rule out any serious issues. The exam itself will only take a few minutes. The MRI will take about 30-45 minutes, and we'll need to coordinate with the radiology department to get you scheduled as soon as possible. First, let's start with the exam. Can you follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It’s not exactly symmetrical, is it? As you can see. This is ridiculous. I diagnose people all day; I don’t need to be examined like some…ordinary patient. Just tell me what it is, and what needs to be done.
DOCTOR: Okay, and can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Both hands are perfectly fine. Are we almost finished? I really don’t have time for this. This is a waste of my valuable time. What’s the next step? I need to get back to work. And I need to know what we’re dealing with here. Is it serious? Be direct.
DOCTOR: Okay, Stephane. Based on the exam, you have sudden onset hearing loss in your left ear accompanied by weakness on the left side of your face. You have full strength in your arms and legs, and your reflexes are normal. The most likely diagnosis at this point is Bell’s palsy. It’s a condition that causes sudden weakness in the facial muscles, often accompanied by hearing loss. It’s often caused by inflammation of the facial nerve. However, because of the sudden onset and the hearing loss, we need to rule out other, more serious causes, such as a stroke or a tumor. Therefore, I’m ordering an MRI of the brain with and without contrast, as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a short course of prednisone, a steroid medication, which can help reduce inflammation and improve your chances of a full recovery. It is crucial to begin this medication today, as the earlier it's started, the better the outcome. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Prednisone…I’ve heard of it. Side effects, aren’t there? And allergies? No, I don’t have any allergies. Just get the MRI done. And how long will that take? I need to know when I can get back to work. This is incredibly inconvenient. Is it contagious? I have patients waiting.
DOCTOR: Yes, Prednisone can have some side effects, but they are usually mild and temporary. They can include increased appetite, difficulty sleeping, and mood changes. We will discuss these in more detail. It is not contagious. The radiology department is very busy, but I’ve put in an urgent request. They said they’ll try to fit you in within the next two hours. I'll call as soon as they have a definitive time. In the meantime, avoid getting water in your left ear, and try to keep the left side of your face covered to protect it from the cold. Do you have any questions about the medication or the MRI?
PATIENT: Two hours! That’s unacceptable. Fine. No, I don’t have any questions. Just…get it done quickly. And call me as soon as you have a time. I have a practice to run, you know. This is really…disruptive. .
DOCTOR: Alright. I will let you know as soon as I have a time for the MRI. Please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms. .
