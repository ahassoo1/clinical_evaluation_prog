DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Knabenshue. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Rayshun Knabenshue, though I believe your chart has that information. I am here today regarding a matter with my place of employment and the requirements for masks and other protective gear. I’m hoping to discuss the possibility of an exemption, if that is possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see that. And I understand you’re hoping to discuss a possible exemption related to workplace mask requirements. Okay. To start, can you tell me a little more about why you’re seeking an exemption?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. It is… difficult to explain. It isn’t a matter of disagreeing with the need for protection, you understand. I work with vulnerable people, and their safety is paramount. However, I have… sensitivities. When I wear a mask for extended periods, it causes me a great deal of discomfort. It makes it hard to breathe, and I become very anxious. It’s… a feeling of being restricted, like I’m not getting enough air. It’s not a medical condition I’ve had formally diagnosed, if that makes a difference. I just know my body does not react well to having my face covered for long.
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate you explaining that. So, it sounds like you experience physical discomfort – difficulty breathing, anxiety – when wearing a mask for extended periods. And you haven’t had this formally evaluated by a doctor, correct?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. I haven’t sought a formal diagnosis. I’ve tried different types of masks, different fits, everything I could think of on my own. Nothing seems to alleviate the discomfort. I suppose I hoped it was something I could manage myself, but the requirements at work are becoming stricter, and it’s making it… increasingly difficult. I didn't want to bother the medical professionals unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, it's good you're addressing it now. To get a better understanding, and to determine the best course of action, I'm going to ask you a few questions. This is just to rule out any underlying medical issues that could be contributing to your discomfort. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I want to be thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to investigate this properly. Please, ask away. I will answer to the best of my ability.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like asthma, COPD, heart problems, anxiety disorder, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any formally diagnosed medical conditions. I have always been relatively healthy, thankfully. I’ve never been diagnosed with asthma, COPD, or heart problems. As I mentioned before, I’ve never been formally diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, though I can certainly understand how the mask situation causes anxiety. But it isn’t a pre-existing condition, if you understand my meaning. I do have Medicare, and I’ve had regular check-ups, and nothing like that has ever been indicated.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And have you had any recent illnesses – like a cold, the flu, or COVID-19 – in the past few months?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I haven’t been ill with anything recently. I was very careful throughout the worst of the pandemic, and I’ve continued to practice good hygiene. I haven’t had a cold, the flu, or COVID-19 in the last several months, and I haven’t been around anyone who has been ill, to my knowledge. I try to be very mindful of protecting myself and others.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am not currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter. I don’t take any supplements either. I prefer to avoid medication if possible, and I generally manage any minor ailments with rest and hydration. I believe in letting the body heal itself when it can.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not have any known allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, food, or environmental substance. I can eat pretty much anything without issue, and I haven’t had any allergic reactions to things like pollen or dust, as far as I’m aware. I’ve always been fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your lungs and check your breathing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly alright. I understand the need for a thorough examination, and I am happy to cooperate in any way that will help determine the cause of my discomfort. Please, proceed when you are ready. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could please sit up on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Here I am. Please let me know if there’s anything specific I should do or if you’d like me to adjust my position. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… deep breath in… and out… Your lung sounds are clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackling. Your breathing rate is normal at rest – about 16 breaths per minute. Pulse is 72 and blood pressure is 130/80. Everything seems within normal limits so far. Now, could you open your mouth and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: Ah. Is there anything specific you are looking for, Doctor? I want to be sure I am cooperating fully. I'm happy to answer any questions or perform any other tests you deem necessary. I just want to understand what is causing this discomfort.
DOCTOR: Everything looks normal back there as well. No signs of infection or inflammation. Okay. Given your medical history, the clear lung sounds, and the normal physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing a form of anxiety or claustrophobia related to wearing a mask. It’s not uncommon. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a simple chest X-ray, just as a precaution. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. If that is your professional recommendation, I am happy to undergo a chest X-ray as a precaution. I trust your judgment, and I want to be thorough in ruling out any potential underlying issues. Please, let me know what I need to do and where I need to go to schedule it. I would appreciate any guidance you can provide.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here is a referral for a chest X-ray at the clinic across the street. They should be able to get you in today. Once they have the results, they will send them directly to me. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a note explaining your sensitivities, which you can take to your employer. It won’t be a full exemption, but it will detail your discomfort and recommend accommodations, like working from home when possible, or wearing a face shield instead of a mask if feasible. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds absolutely acceptable. I am very grateful for your thoroughness and willingness to help. A note explaining my situation to my employer will be incredibly helpful, and I appreciate you recommending accommodations. I will schedule the X-ray right away. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me and for providing me with such thoughtful guidance. I feel much better knowing that we are taking steps to address this issue.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Knabenshue. Once I have the X-ray results, I'll give you a call to discuss them and we can determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new concerns, please don't hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not have any further questions at this time. You have addressed all of my concerns and provided me with a clear plan of action. I am very grateful for your time and expertise. Thank you again for your kindness and understanding. I will schedule the X-ray as soon as possible and will be sure to contact you if anything changes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, I wish you all the best, Mr. Knabenshue. Take care. .
