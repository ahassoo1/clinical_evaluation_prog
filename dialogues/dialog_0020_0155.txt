DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Beinborn, is it? Yes, well… it’s this shaking. It’s mostly in my hands, I think. It’s a bother, really. Makes things… difficult. I don’t remember exactly when it started, to be honest. A while back, surely.
DOCTOR: Okay, shaking in your hands… and you said it's been going on for a while. It’s understandable that it’s difficult when it interferes with things. Do you notice it all the time, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, I believe. Worse when I… try to do something precise. Like… holding a cup, or… I used to tinker with things, small engines mostly. Can’t do that so well anymore. It’s… frustrating. Not constant, though. Sometimes it's barely noticeable. Mostly just when I need my hands steady.
DOCTOR: So it's more noticeable when you're trying to do detailed tasks, like holding something steady or working with your hands. That's helpful to know. And you mentioned you used to work on small engines... is that something you still attempt at all?
PATIENT: Attempt? No, no, not really. It’s… too shaky. I tried once, a little lawnmower engine. Nearly dropped the whole thing. My daughter… she told me to stop. Said it wasn’t safe. She’s a good girl, my daughter. Keeps me out of trouble mostly. I haven't touched an engine since. It’s been… years now, I suppose. Everything’s a bit hazy these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it’s significantly impacting your ability to do things you enjoy, and it’s good your daughter is looking out for you. When you say “hazy,” are you referring to your memory in general, or specifically recalling when the shaking started?
PATIENT: Oh, both, really. Memory's not what it used to be. Dates… names… sometimes even faces. The shaking... that's hazy too. I feel like it crept up on me, slowly. Didn’t happen overnight. But pinpointing when… that’s difficult. A few years, maybe? More? Honestly, I’d have to think on it. Don’t bother me with specifics, alright? Just… the shaking is the problem.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Jezik. We’ll focus on the shaking. It’s perfectly alright that specific dates are difficult to recall. Let’s talk a little more about the shaking itself. Does anything make it better or worse, besides the precise tasks you mentioned?
PATIENT: Hmm… good question. Let me think. Coffee… makes it worse, I think. Definitely worse. And… being tired. If I haven’t slept well, it’s much more pronounced. I used to be able to handle a good strong cup in the morning, but not anymore. And… stress, perhaps? When I get… agitated, it’s worse too. But honestly, Doctor, it’s just… there a lot of the time. Hard to say what really helps. Nothing seems to completely stop it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so coffee and fatigue definitely seem to worsen it, and stress might play a role. That’s very helpful information. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me see… … No, not that I recall. Sometimes… a little stiffness in my hands, maybe? But that could just be old age. I haven’t been feeling… sick, or anything like that. No dizziness, no problems with… walking. Just the shaking, really. And the frustration. That’s a symptom, I suppose. A very annoying symptom.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the shaking and occasional stiffness, no other symptoms. And the frustration – I completely understand that. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… … Oh, goodness. That's a long list, probably. I had… pneumonia, a long time ago. And… high blood pressure, I think. The doctor put me on pills for that, for a while. Stopped taking them, eventually. Didn't seem to be doing much good. And… I had a bad knee, years ago, but it’s mostly healed now. Honestly, Doctor, I don't remember everything. It was a long time ago, and… I don’t keep track of these things. My daughter handles most of that. She has all the paperwork, I'm sure.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Jezik. Don’t worry about recalling everything perfectly. Pneumonia, high blood pressure… and a bad knee. We can look through your daughter’s paperwork if she’s available. Do you recall any surgeries you’ve had?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm… let me think. Yes, I had my appendix out, when I was young. And… … I think I had a hernia operation, at some point. But it was a long time ago. I don't remember much about either one. Honestly, Doctor, my memory’s just… gone to pot. Is this… important? We’re back to talking about old things, aren't we? I just want to know what's causing the shaking.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Jezik, but we’ll get back to the shaking, I promise. Knowing your medical history helps us understand what might be going on. Appendix and hernia repair… good. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… … My father… he had problems with his heart, I believe. And my mother… she suffered from arthritis, badly, in her later years. Very painful, it was. And… my sister, she had… well, I can’t quite recall. Something with her nerves, I think. But honestly, Doctor, I wasn't very close to my family. It was a long time ago. I mostly kept to myself. This is… getting a bit depressing, isn't it? Let’s talk about the shaking again.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Mr. Jezik. We can definitely focus on the shaking. It sounds like there’s a family history of heart problems and arthritis, and possibly some nerve issues. Now, let’s talk about your current medications. Are you taking anything at all right now, even over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… … No, not really. I haven’t been taking anything regularly for… years, I suppose. I take an aspirin occasionally, if I have a headache. And… sometimes I take something for my stomach, if I’ve eaten something bad. But that’s it. I try to avoid pills as much as possible. Don’t like taking them. They never seemed to do much good, anyway. Just give me a stomach ache. I’d rather just… tough it out. This… this is enough questions, isn’t it? Can we get to… the examining, or whatever you do? I'm tired now.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Jezik, we can move on to a physical exam. Just a few quick checks. I’d like to check your reflexes, coordination, and look at your hands a bit more closely. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Sounds… alright. Just get it over with, then. The sooner I know what's wrong, the better. I'm ready when you are. Don't expect much, though. I'm not a very good patient. And… be gentle, alright? My hands are… sensitive. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. We’ll be as gentle as possible. First, could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
