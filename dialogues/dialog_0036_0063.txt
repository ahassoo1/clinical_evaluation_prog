DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My back… it’s been really bad. Worse than usual. It’s hard to explain… it just hurts. Been hurting for maybe… three days now? It’s not like a new pain, though. It’s the same back that… well, you probably know. The cancer back.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see your history here. It’s good you reminded me. So, this is pain in the same area as your previous cancer diagnosis?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Same spot. Lower back, kinda wraps around to the side a little. And it’s… it’s not just a dull ache this time. It feels… sharp sometimes. Especially when I try to stand up straight. Or bend over. Anything, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, sharp pain with movement, localized to the lower back, radiating around the side a little. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what number would you give your pain right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… right now? It’s… maybe a seven? Sometimes it goes up to an eight when I move. But mostly a seven. It’s just… constant. Even when I’m trying to rest, I can feel it. It’s hard to get comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, a constant seven, spiking to an eight with movement. And it's interfering with your ability to get comfortable even at rest. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I tried lying down with a warm towel, like I usually do, but it didn’t help much this time. Maybe a little, for a few minutes, but then it comes right back. And… I tried taking some of the pills the doctor gave me before, the ones for the pain, but they don’t seem to be working as well now.
DOCTOR: Okay, the usual pain management isn't providing the same relief. And just to clarify, which medication were you referring to when you said the pills the doctor gave you before?
PATIENT: Oh… um… let me think. It’s a white pill… small, round… with a little line across it. I think it’s… Oxy… something? Oxy…codone? I think that’s right. I get them from the pharmacy, and I take two when it hurts. But like I said, they aren’t helping like they used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, Oxycodone. Thank you for clarifying. And you’ve been taking two pills as needed, but they aren’t providing the same level of relief as before. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the back pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the pain. No… like, no fever, no numbness, no… trouble going to the bathroom. Nothing like that. Just… back pain. It’s just stronger now. And it scares me, you know? It feels different than before.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Meigs. It’s good you’re paying attention to changes in your pain. And it’s definitely important to investigate what’s causing it. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your range of motion, feel along your spine, and do some neurological tests to see if there's any new irritation. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best. I just… I want to know what’s going on. I don’t want it to be… worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on your back for me, that would be great. I'm going to start by just feeling along your spine to check for any tenderness. Okay, I'm feeling some tenderness right here, around the L4-L5 vertebrae. It's not severe, but it's definitely present. Now, could you bend forward at the waist and touch your toes, if you're able?
PATIENT: Okay… here we go. Ouch… that hurts. I can’t go much further. It’s… really tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. Limited range of motion and pain with forward flexion. Now, could you try lying on your side and bringing your knees up towards your chest, like you’re making a cannonball?
PATIENT: It’s… hard. And it hurts when I do that too. Not as bad as bending over, but still… uncomfortable. It feels like something is… stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when I gently press on this area here, on your lower back… does that cause any pain?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, that hurts. Right there. It’s… a sharp pain. Not just a dull ache. It’s like… something is pressing on a nerve.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. I can walk… it’s just… uncomfortable. And it hurts more when I walk for a long time. But I can still move my legs and wiggle my toes. Everything feels… normal there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder function?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Everything is… normal there too. Sorry if that’s… a weird question.
DOCTOR: It's not a weird question at all, Ms. Meigs. It’s an important part of the exam to rule out any serious issues. Okay, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing a flare-up of your lower back pain, possibly related to some nerve irritation. The pain is different than before, and that's why you came in today. To get a clearer picture of what's going on, I'd like to order an MRI of your lower back. This will help us to see if there's any compression of the nerves or other changes in the spine. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: An MRI… okay. Yes, that’s okay. If it will help figure out what’s going on, then yes. I just… how long will it take to get the results? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The MRI itself doesn’t hurt at all. You’ll lie on a table, and a large machine will take pictures of your spine. It’s a bit noisy, and you’ll need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes. We'll give you earplugs to help with the noise. As for the results, it usually takes a few days for the radiologist to read the images and send us a report. Once I have the report, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I can prescribe you a stronger pain medication to help manage your pain. It’s different from the Oxycodone, with fewer side effects. And I recommend continuing to rest, applying ice or heat to your back, and avoiding any activities that make your pain worse. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Okay… stronger pain medicine sounds good. And resting… I can do that. I don’t have much to do anyway. So… just rest and wait for the MRI results? And you’ll call me when they’re ready?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Rest, avoid strenuous activities, and take the new pain medication as directed. I’ll call you as soon as I have the MRI results, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I’m also going to give you a referral to a physical therapist. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your back muscles and improve your range of motion. It’s not something you need to start right away, but it can be very helpful in the long run. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… okay. That sounds… good too. Maybe it will help. Um… will the MRI show… if the cancer has spread? Is that what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Ms. Meigs. The MRI will give us a detailed look at your spine, and it can help us to see if there are any signs of cancer spread. However, it’s important to remember that it’s not always definitive. Sometimes, changes on the MRI can be caused by other things, like inflammation or arthritis. We'll discuss the results together, and if we do see anything concerning, we'll order further tests to confirm it. But right now, let’s focus on getting a clear picture of what’s causing your current pain. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… that makes sense. Okay. So… rest, new medicine, physical therapy later, and wait for the MRI. And you’ll call. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I’m here to help. I'll have the nurse come in and give you the prescriptions and the referral information. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and I’ll be in touch soon. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again. .
