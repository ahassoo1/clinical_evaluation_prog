DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Putney. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Life insurance exam, Doctor. They sent me over here. I just… want to get it done, if that’s okay. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Life insurance… right. So, they just need a basic physical to verify you’re… insurable, essentially?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s it. Just a check-up. Blood pressure, weight, all that stuff, I guess. Is it gonna take long? I’m trying to make a boat payment this week.
DOCTOR: Well, a basic check-up is one thing, but they usually want a little more than just blood pressure and weight for life insurance. We'll need to go through some questions, a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and likely some blood work. It's standard procedure. Honestly, I need to get a complete picture, even for a life insurance exam. Don’t want any surprises for anyone. First, let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – anything at all – like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… High blood pressure, yeah, the doctor told me a few years back it was a little high, but I’ve been… watching my salt, you know? Other than that… not really. I had a bad knee for a while playing soccer, but that’s fixed now. I don’t really go to the doctor much. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: “Watching your salt” isn’t quite the same as treating high blood pressure, Mr. Putney. And avoiding the doctor isn't ideal, frankly. We need to know what we’re dealing with. Alright, so high blood pressure in the past. Do you know what your blood pressure readings were, or what medication you were prescribed, if any?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I don’t remember the numbers. It was a long time ago. And I didn't take any pills or anything. The doctor just said to cut back on salt and exercise more. I tried to. Look, I don't really like talking about this stuff. It gives me a headache. Can we just get the exam over with? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, with all due respect, I can't just perform an exam without knowing your medical history. It's irresponsible. Life insurance companies aren’t just handing out policies to anyone. They need accurate information. Let's try this. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Hmm. When I was a kid, maybe? I broke my arm falling out of a tree. But that was… a long, long time ago. Like, before I came to the States. Other than that… no. No hospital stays. Definitely not as an adult. I’m pretty healthy, honestly. I work hard, you know? Lodging management. It keeps you on your feet. Can we please just… move this along? I have a boat payment.
DOCTOR: Lodging management, alright. Physical labor. Okay. And no hospitalizations as an adult, you say. What about surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had one. Look, I’m telling you, I’m a pretty simple case. I just need this form signed so I can get my insurance and pay my bill. I don't understand why we're going over all this. It feels like a regular check-up, not an insurance thing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, you came to me for a medical assessment required for a life insurance policy. They don't send perfectly healthy people for assessments, they send people they need to evaluate. I have to do my due diligence. It's my professional responsibility, and frankly, it’s in your best interest. Okay, one last attempt to get a complete picture. Any family history of serious illness?
PATIENT: Family history… uh… My mom, she had… diabetes, I think. And my dad, he had… heart trouble. But they were older. They lived back on the islands. It’s probably nothing. I mean, it's not like I inherited anything. Can we please just do the exam now? This is giving me a headache, and I'm wasting time. I really need to go. .
DOCTOR: “Probably nothing”?
