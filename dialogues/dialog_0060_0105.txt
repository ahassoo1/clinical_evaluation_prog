DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi, good to meet you too. Well, it’s about… the surgery. The weight loss surgery. My wife helped me set up the appointment. Honestly, I don’t really remember all the details about why we’re doing this now, just that we talked about it for a long time. I think it’s… to help me feel better? It's been getting harder to do things.
DOCTOR: Okay, weight loss surgery. Right. It sounds like your wife was instrumental in getting this scheduled, which is good. It’s helpful to have support. And you're right, feeling better is a perfectly valid reason. Now, to clarify, is this a follow-up appointment after surgery, or are we still in the planning stages before surgery?
PATIENT: Oh, definitely before. Before, yeah. We haven’t… I haven’t had the surgery yet. I think… I think this is to make sure I can have it? I’m a little fuzzy on all the steps, to be honest. My wife usually handles all this stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, pre-operative evaluation. That makes much more sense. It’s common to feel overwhelmed with all the details, and it’s good you have your wife assisting. We need to go through everything thoroughly to ensure you're a good candidate and to minimize any risks. Let’s start with a little bit of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I get a little tired sometimes, but I just figured that was from… well, everything. I haven't been to a doctor in a while, so I wouldn't really know for sure. My wife might know better, actually. I don't remember ever being told I had anything serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I think. A long time ago. And… maybe a wisdom tooth pulled? But that was… ages ago too. Nothing recent, definitely. Does that count? I don’t really remember much about either one.
DOCTOR: Tonsils and wisdom teeth – that’s good to know. Now, what about medications?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not really. I don’t take anything regularly. Sometimes I take something for a headache, like ibuprofen, but that’s it. Just when I need it. Nothing the doctor prescribed, though. Just over-the-counter stuff. I try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Good. And any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… I don’t think so. I mean, I get a little sniffly sometimes during pollen season, but I wouldn’t call that an allergy, really. Nothing serious. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I don't think so, anyway. Should I be worried about something?
DOCTOR: No, no need to be worried. Just covering all the bases. Okay. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had conditions like diabetes, heart disease, cancer, or obesity?
PATIENT: Oh, family… that's a tough one. My family is… back in Iraq, mostly. I haven’t seen them in a long time. I know my dad had… something with his heart, I think. But I don’t remember the details. And my mom… she was healthy, I think. Just… old. It’s hard to say, really. We didn't talk about health stuff much. I’m not very close with my family here, either.
DOCTOR: Alright, some history of heart issues with your father, that's good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I don't smoke. My wife doesn't like smoking, and… it just never appealed to me. Never have, never will. I do drink sometimes, though. Just a beer or a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. Nothing too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol use, that's helpful. And how about exercise?
PATIENT: Well… not much. To be honest, it's been hard to get around lately. I used to walk more, but… things just got harder. I mostly just… sit. I know I should exercise, but I haven't been very motivated. My wife tries to get me to, but… it's tough.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll talk about that later. Now, let’s talk about your weight. When did you start noticing weight gain?
PATIENT: Oh, man… it's been a long time. It started… after I came to the US, I think. It was gradual, you know? Just a little bit each year. I used to be… thinner. But after a while, it just kept going up. It's been getting worse and worse lately, which is why we’re here, I guess. It's hard to say exactly when it started, but definitely… over ten years ago. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. And what prompted you to consider weight loss surgery now?
PATIENT: It's… it's getting harder to do things. Just everyday things. Walking, climbing stairs, even getting out of a chair. And… I want to be able to play with my grandkids when they visit. I can't keep up with them now. My wife says it's affecting my health, too. I get tired easily, and… I just want to feel better. I want to live longer, you know? And enjoy my life. I don't want to be a burden to my wife. That’s what it comes down to, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey, thank you for sharing that with me. Now, before we proceed further, I need to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline, and to make sure there aren’t any immediate concerns. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get this sorted out. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out. Heart sounds are regular, but a slightly elevated rate. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 145/90. Pulse is 88. Slightly elevated, but not critically high. And finally, I’m just going to quickly palpate your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, but there’s some noted obesity. No signs of acute tenderness. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. It seems generally unremarkable, but we'll need some blood work to get a more detailed picture of your overall health. I also want to repeat some basic lab tests and get a Lipid Panel. Would you be able to do that today?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Blood work… yeah, I can do that. Today is okay. Just tell me where to go. I'm just glad we're getting somewhere. Hopefully, everything is okay. What kind of results are you looking for? I don't know much about this stuff, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. Here’s a requisition form for the lab. They’re just down the hall to your left. We’re looking for a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, a thyroid panel, and a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels. It's standard procedure before weight loss surgery, to ensure you’re a good candidate and to rule out any underlying health issues. Once you’ve had the blood work done, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss the results. We can then proceed with further evaluation, if necessary, and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Uh… wow, that’s a lot of things. I don't think so. Not right now. I'm just trying to keep up. I guess I’ll go get the blood work done. Thank you. Should I tell them you sent me? And… how long will the results take to come back? Maybe my wife should come with me to the next appointment. She's better at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Just tell them I sent you. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. And it's a very good idea to have your wife with you at the follow-up appointment. Having someone there for support and to help remember details is always helpful. Here's my card with the clinic's number, if you have any questions before then. You can schedule your follow-up appointment by calling the number on the card, or you can ask the receptionist on your way out. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you very much, Dr. Nooruddin. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I really hope this works out. I just want to feel better, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. You take care, Mr. Kochubey. We’ll see you soon. .
