DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Way. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Well, it’s this pain I’ve been having. It’s been… bothering me for a little while now. It's mostly in my back, lower back to be exact.
DOCTOR: “A little while” is rather vague, Mr. Way. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, right, sorry. Uh… maybe about three weeks now? It started kinda slow, just a little ache after I’d been standing for a long time. Now it’s… well, it’s more constant. Not all the time, but pretty often. Especially if I try to lift anything.
DOCTOR: Lifting, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, you know, normal things. Groceries, helping my wife with things around the house… nothing too heavy, really. I used to be able to do more, but… well, I’m not as young as I used to be. It just feels… strained, like something’s pulling when I bend over or twist.
DOCTOR: And is this pain radiating anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiating? Hmm… let me think. Sometimes it feels like it goes down my leg a little, on my right side. Not like a sharp shooting pain, more like… a dull ache that spreads. It doesn't go all the way down to my foot though, just kind of in the upper part of my leg. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Way. Though “kind of” and “a little” are not particularly helpful descriptors. Has anything specific triggered this pain, aside from lifting?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… I did spend a whole afternoon helping my son-in-law with some gardening a couple of weeks ago. Lots of bending and digging. That’s when it really started acting up. I thought it was just muscle soreness at first, you know? But it didn't really go away after a couple of days.
DOCTOR: And have you tried anything to alleviate the discomfort?
PATIENT: Yeah, my wife gave me some of that… ointment, you know, the kind you rub on? And I’ve been trying to take it easy, not do too much. I took some ibuprofen a couple of times, but it didn't seem to do a whole lot, to be honest. I’m not really a fan of taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: I see. And just to clarify, Mr. Way, you said you’ve had this for three weeks. Have you experienced any numbness or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or weakness, thankfully. Just the pain. Like I said, it's mostly in my lower back, and sometimes it goes down my right leg a bit. It's just… uncomfortable, and it’s starting to make it hard to sleep sometimes. I’ve been tossing and turning a lot. I’m just hoping it’s not something serious.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Way, many things can cause lower back pain. It’s a remarkably common ailment. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical examination, if you don't mind. We’ll need to assess your range of motion, reflexes, and some nerve function tests. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Yeah, let’s do that. Range of motion, right. Here we go… a little slow is best, I think.
DOCTOR: Indeed. Please lie flat on your back, arms at your sides. I’ll start with palpation – just feeling for tenderness. Let me know immediately if anything is particularly uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay. There we go… Alright, go ahead. Just let me know if you poke something that really hurts, yeah? I’ll try to be still.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Way. Tell me when this feels tender… or sharp. Does that feel particularly sensitive?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah. That spot… yeah, that’s definitely tender. Not like a shooting pain, more like a… dull ache when you press on it. It kind of radiates out a little when you push hard. That's probably the spot that bothers me the most, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to ask you to bring your right knee up towards your chest. Just as far as you comfortably can. And then we’ll repeat that with the left leg. Tell me if you experience any pain during this movement.
PATIENT: Okay. There we go… It’s a little stiff, Doctor. Not terrible, but… yeah, it’s not as easy as it used to be. And it hurts a little when I pull it up that high, mostly in my lower back, like a stretching feeling.
DOCTOR: And now the left leg, please.
PATIENT: Okay. That one’s a little easier, actually. Still a little stiff, but not as much pain as the other one. Just a bit of a stretching sensation, mostly. Feels like I’m getting old, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Way. Now, I’m going to test your reflexes. Relax your legs completely. This might feel a little strange.
PATIENT: Okay, relax… Ow! That tickles… and kind of makes my leg jump. Is that… good? I don’t know anything about reflexes.
DOCTOR: It's… adequate, Mr. Way. Now, the other leg.
PATIENT: Okay. Same thing, I guess. It jumped a little. Is that normal? I’m starting to worry it’s something serious, Doctor. Like a pinched nerve or something. My wife's cousin had a bad one once and had to have surgery.
DOCTOR: Mr. Way, I understand your concerns, but it is unlikely to be anything requiring surgical intervention at this point. Based on my preliminary assessment, you are likely experiencing a muscle strain, potentially exacerbated by your gardening activities. The reflexes are within normal limits, and there is no obvious indication of nerve compression. However… … to rule out other possibilities, I would like to order some basic blood work and an X-ray of your lower back.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… sensible. Blood work and an X-ray. That’s not too bad, right? Will the X-ray show if it’s just a muscle strain, or will it show something more serious? And… how long will it take to get the results? I'd like to know what's going on as soon as possible. I just want to be able to get back to helping my wife around the house.
DOCTOR: Mr. Way, the X-ray will help us identify any structural abnormalities, such as fractures or significant arthritis. It won’t directly show a muscle strain, but it will help us rule out more serious conditions. As for the blood work, that will assess for inflammation and rule out other potential causes of your pain. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours. Once I have them, we will discuss the findings and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest, avoiding strenuous activities, and applying ice to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. We can also discuss some over-the-counter pain relief options, if you wish. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Rest, ice, and wait for the results. I think… I think I understand. Just one thing… will the X-ray be expensive? I don't have insurance, you see… My wife and I, we're on a fixed income. I'm just a little concerned about the cost.
DOCTOR: Mr. Way, I understand your financial concerns. The cost of the X-ray… varies. I can write you a referral to a facility that offers discounted rates for uninsured patients. However, I cannot guarantee a specific price. The facility will be able to provide you with an estimate before proceeding with the procedure. Frankly, delaying diagnosis due to financial concerns is rarely advisable. We need to rule out any serious pathology. Now, I will have my assistant schedule the X-ray and blood work for you. Do you have any other questions before I conclude this examination?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you writing me a referral. Hopefully, it’s just a muscle strain. I'll go wait for my assistant then. .
