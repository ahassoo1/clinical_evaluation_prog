DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you're 31 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, that’s right. Thirty-one. Um… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve been… going to the bathroom a lot. More often than usual, I suppose. It’s just… frequent. I don’t really know why it’s happening.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, you say. And you haven’t noticed any other changes, Ms. MacVittie?
PATIENT: Other changes… hmm. Let me think. Not that I’m aware of, no. I mean, I feel fine, mostly. Just… constantly needing to go. It’s a little disruptive, if I’m honest. I don’t recall anything specific leading to this, either. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Disruptive, yes, I understand. And it has come on gradually, or was it a sudden onset?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. I… honestly, I’m not entirely sure. It feels like it’s been building up, slowly, over the past few weeks maybe? Not like one day I suddenly needed to go all the time. More… a gradual increase. I'm terribly sorry, I wish I could be more precise. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: A gradual onset over the past few weeks. Very well. Now, are you experiencing any pain or burning sensation during urination?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No pain, no burning… it doesn’t hurt to go, which is good, I suppose. It's just… the frequency is what’s bothering me. It's just… inconvenient, really. And a bit worrying, if I'm honest. I haven’t had this happen before.
DOCTOR: No pain or burning. Alright. And do you find yourself needing to urinate more frequently during the day, or is it mostly at night?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. It's… both, actually. Both during the day and at night. I wake up a couple of times to go, which is new. And even when I've just gone, I feel like I need to go again not too long after. It’s… frustrating. Is that normal? I don’t even drink that much water, so it’s really puzzling.
DOCTOR: Frequent daytime and nighttime urination…not drinking excessive fluids. Do you notice any changes in the color or odor of your urine?
PATIENT: Color or odor… hmm. I… I haven’t really paid attention, to be honest. I suppose it looks… normal? A standard yellow color, I think. And I don’t recall any unusual smells. I really haven’t been checking, I'm afraid. I wish I could be more helpful. It's just… not something I usually notice.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, Ms. MacVittie?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Um. I had… strep throat once, when I was a child. And I broke my wrist a few years ago, but that’s it, really. Nothing… serious. I don’t think so, anyway. I was divorced a couple of years ago, if that counts. But no ongoing health issues that I’m aware of. I haven't really been to the doctor much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Strep throat in childhood, broken wrist. No significant medical history. And you said you've not been to the doctor much recently?
PATIENT: No, not recently. Not really. Just for check-ups, when I was younger. It’s… I just haven’t needed to, I suppose. And truthfully, I don't always remember to schedule things like that. It’s silly, I know. But I've been feeling quite well, up until this. Which is why I’m a little worried now. It’s unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no, I don’t think so. Not that I recall, anyway. Definitely no surgeries. Just the wrist, and that didn’t require anything major, just a cast. I’m quite certain I haven’t had any other surgeries. My mother would have mentioned it, I think. She always remembers everything.
DOCTOR: No surgeries. Alright. And are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a difficult question. My grandmother… she had diabetes, I believe. On my mother’s side. And my uncle… he had heart problems. But other than that… I’m not really sure. My family doesn't really talk about health things much. It's a bit awkward, to be honest. So I don't have a lot of details.
DOCTOR: Family history of diabetes and heart problems. Now, Ms. MacVittie, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I've taken antibiotics a couple of times, for colds, and pain relievers for headaches, but never had any problems. I’m pretty sure I’m not allergic to anything, but I can't say with absolute certainty.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, I'm not taking any medications at all. Nothing. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, like I said, but nothing regularly. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. I don't like the idea of putting things into my body if I don't need to. It's probably silly, but that's how I feel.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. MacVittie, I'm going to need to conduct a brief physical examination. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly agreeable. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I'm a little nervous, but I understand it's important.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just follow me to the examination table. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please lie down and take a few deep breaths.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Here we are. Deep breaths… like this?
DOCTOR: Deep breaths, yes, perfectly. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Just let me know if you experience any discomfort.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I will. No discomfort so far. It's a little… strange, feeling that, but not painful. Is that normal? I just don't get examined very often.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Tympanic throughout. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Now, I need to check your vital signs, blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 120/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Everything appears within normal limits.
PATIENT: Oh, good. That's… reassuring, to hear. Everything normal. But if everything is normal, why am I going to the bathroom so much? I suppose that’s what we’re trying to figure out, isn’t it? Is there anything else you need to check?
DOCTOR: That is precisely what we're trying to determine, Ms. MacVittie. Now, I would like to order a urinalysis to rule out any infection. And a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A urinalysis and a… basic metabolic panel. I haven’t had those done before. Will they be painful? I really don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: The urinalysis is simply a urine sample, Ms. MacVittie. No needles involved. The basic metabolic panel will require a small blood draw, yes. I understand your apprehension, but it will be quick, and the discomfort is minimal. We'll use the smallest gauge needle possible. It's standard procedure. Do you have any preferences for where the blood draw should be performed?
PATIENT: Oh, a urine sample. That’s… good. That I can do. And a small blood draw… I suppose that’s alright. Minimal discomfort… I’ll trust you, Doctor. As for where… um. I think… my left arm is probably best. I always feel a little less with my left arm. Does that make sense? It's silly, I know.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. MacVittie. We'll use your left arm. Alright. I'll have the nurse draw your blood and collect a urine sample. Once the results are back, we'll discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake slightly, but avoid caffeine and alcohol. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Increasing fluids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol… I can do that. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious. It's just… unsettling, to feel like something isn’t right. But thank you, Doctor. For taking the time to listen and for running these tests. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. MacVittie. We'll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly to collect your samples. Please don't hesitate to call if you experience any worsening symptoms. Have a good day, Ms. MacVittie.
