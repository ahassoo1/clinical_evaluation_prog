DOCTOR: Alright, Mykeisha, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hi Dr. Nooruddin. It's the blood pressure, really. It’s been a bit high lately, and my sister, she kept on at me to get it checked out. She's always looking out for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, your sister sounds sensible. “A bit high”... can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I don’t really know numbers, if you get me. I bought one of those machines for home, you know, the one that goes on your arm? And it’s showed some numbers that looked… red. Like, not good red. And sometimes I get a headache, kinda at the back of my head, but I don’t know if that’s related. It’s just… I’d rather be safe than sorry, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, understandable. Those home machines can be a bit alarming if you're not used to them. And headaches can be related, yes. When did you first notice these higher readings on the machine?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it was probably… around the end of June, I’d say. Maybe the first week of July. I wasn’t really paying attention at first, just taking it now and then. But then it kept being… higher. And that’s when my sister really started on me! She’s a nurse, so she knows all this stuff.
DOCTOR: A nurse, good. She’s probably right to encourage you to get it checked. And how often have you been taking your blood pressure since then, roughly?
PATIENT: Well, after my sister… encouraged me, I started taking it every morning. And then, sometimes in the evening too, if I was feeling stressed. So, maybe most days, twice a day? It’s been pretty consistent, I think. I’ve been trying to write down the numbers, but honestly, it’s a bit of a mess. I’m not very organized.
DOCTOR: Alright. Don't worry about being organized, we can sort through it. Do you feel any symptoms when your blood pressure is high?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I mean, sometimes I feel a little bit… tired. But I always feel a bit tired, to be honest! And like I said, the headache sometimes. It’s not a terrible headache, just… annoying. Nothing that a little lie-down doesn't fix. I don’t feel dizzy or anything like that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision? Not that I’ve noticed, no. Everything looks pretty much the same as always, I think. I had my eyes checked last year, and they said I just needed glasses for reading, which is what I have. But nothing different with how I see, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. I had the flu a few times, like everyone does. And I had a bad back a couple years ago, but that cleared up with physiotherapy. Oh, and the doctor told me a while back my cholesterol was a little high, but he just said to eat better, so I try to. Nothing serious, though. And no big surgeries or anything like that. I'm pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: "Eat better"... do you know what your cholesterol levels were, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I don’t really remember numbers. He just said it was a little high, and to cut back on fried foods and stuff like that. I try to, but it’s hard! Especially with all the good cooking around. My neighbor, she makes the best macaroni pie. Honestly, I think I mostly just remember what he said, not the actual numbers. I’m not good with all that medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she had high blood pressure too. She was on medication for it for years. And my father, he had… something with his heart, I think. He passed away a few years back. And my sister, she's healthy as a horse, thankfully. She’s always telling me what I should be doing, though! She's very health-conscious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I don’t like smoking at all. It smells terrible! And my mother always said it was bad for you, so I never started. I do enjoy a little rum punch now and then, especially on a Saturday, but that's about it. Nothing too strong, mind you.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just the glasses, like I said. And sometimes I take something for a headache, like ibuprofen, but not very often. Just when it's really bad. That’s it, really. Nothing regular. No pills for anything else. I'm not a big fan of taking medication if I can avoid it, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's take your blood pressure now and then I'll want to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. And perhaps we can get a quick look at your reflexes. It's standard procedure.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Nooruddin. I just want to make sure everything is alright. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is… elevated. 158 over 92. That's why your sister was concerned. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal. Given your blood pressure reading, and your family history, it’s important we investigate this further. I’m going to order some blood work - a complete metabolic panel and a lipid panel. That will give us a better picture of your overall health.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… serious. Blood work, huh? I don’t really like needles, but if it’s important, I’ll do it. What does it all mean, though? Is it really bad? And what about the headaches? Could that be connected? I just want to understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: It means we need information, Mykeisha. Your blood pressure is consistently high, and that puts extra strain on your heart and blood vessels. The blood work will help us understand why. It could be a number of things - diet, lifestyle, or something else entirely. And yes, the headaches could be connected, although they could also be unrelated. It's best to rule everything out. As for being "bad", it's not an emergency right now, but untreated high blood pressure can lead to more serious problems down the line – heart attack, stroke, kidney problems. That's why we're being proactive. I’ll write you a lab order. You can go to the lab across the street. They take walk-ins. Once we have the results, we can discuss a plan. In the meantime, try to reduce your salt intake and get some regular, moderate exercise. And perhaps limit the rum punch for a bit. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Okay, that… that sounds a bit scary, actually. Heart attack, stroke… I hadn’t really thought about it like that. Salt, exercise, rum punch… I can try, I guess. It's just… hard to change habits. Um… what kind of exercise? And how much salt is too much? I don't want to mess it up. And… will the blood work take long? I have a bingo night on Friday, and I don’t want to be feeling sick then.
DOCTOR: Moderate exercise means something that gets your heart rate up a little – brisk walking, gardening, swimming. Thirty minutes, most days of the week. As for salt… avoid processed foods – canned soups, frozen dinners, chips. Don't add extra salt to your cooking. Read the labels. It's common sense, really. And the blood work shouldn’t take long – a few hours, at most. You should have the results by Thursday, giving you plenty of time for your bingo night. Look, Mykeisha, I understand changing habits is difficult, but your health is important. This isn’t about depriving yourself, it's about making sensible choices. And frankly, dwelling on bingo night isn't helping. Let's focus on getting the blood work done and addressing your blood pressure. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay, okay, I get it. No bingo talk. Thirty minutes of walking… I can probably manage that. And I’ll try to read the labels. It's just… it's a lot to take in all at once. Um… will I need medication? Is that what usually happens? And… if I do need it, will it have side effects? My sister told me some pills can make you feel awful.
DOCTOR: We don't know if you'll need medication yet. We need to see the blood work results first. Many people can manage high blood pressure with lifestyle changes alone. If medication is necessary, there are many different types available, and we can find one that’s right for you. Yes, some medications have side effects, but those are usually manageable. We would start with a low dose and monitor your response. It’s not a one-size-fits-all situation, Mykeisha. I understand your concerns, but let's not jump to conclusions. Let's get the blood work done, discuss the results, and then we can create a plan that works for you. Now, here’s the lab order. Do you have any further questions at this point, or can we consider this consultation concluded?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Dr. Nooruddin. I’ll go get the blood work done as soon as I can. And I’ll try to be sensible. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Right. Good. Let’s see who’s next. .
