DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, don't mind the mess, I just... really don't have all day for this. It's this tiredness, see? It’s just getting worse and worse. And… well, it’s embarrassing, but I’ve been eating dirt. Not a lot, just… a little. I don't know why, I just… crave it. It's ridiculous, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds concerning that your tiredness is worsening, and the craving for dirt is definitely something we should explore. It's good you brought it up; there’s no need to feel embarrassed at all. Let's try to understand what's going on. Could you tell me a bit more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, it's just… all the time, really. It doesn’t matter if I sleep eight hours, or ten, I still feel like I haven’t slept a wink. And it's not just feeling sleepy, it's like… everything is harder. Walking up the stairs, doing the dishes… even just thinking straight is a struggle. I work as a physical therapy aide, you know, helping people get energy back, and frankly, I could use a good dose of it myself. It's been going on for…oh, I don't know… months now, getting worse little by little.
DOCTOR: Months, and gradually worsening… that’s helpful to know. And it's affecting your ability to do your job as a physical therapy aide, which takes a lot of energy. So it’s impacting your daily life significantly. When you say it feels harder to think straight, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… just foggy. Like there's cotton in my brain. It's hard to focus, I forget things… not like serious things, just…names, what I was going to say mid-sentence, where I put my glasses… things like that. It’s infuriating. I used to have such a sharp mind. It's… well, it’s just not me. Honestly, it’s probably just old age.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned when you notice changes like that, and it's good you're paying attention to them. It's not necessarily "just old age," though; there are many things that can cause these symptoms, and we want to rule them out. Now, let’s talk a bit more about this craving for dirt. How often are you eating it, and how much at a time?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is just… humiliating. Fine. It started maybe a month or two ago, just a little pinch here and there. Now, it's… a couple of spoonfuls a day. I get it from the garden, mostly. It's… I don’t know why I like it, it just feels… right. It’s embarrassing, I know. Don't tell anyone.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Candis, everything we discuss is confidential. And there’s no need to be embarrassed. Cravings like this can be a sign of something underlying, and it's important that we investigate. A couple of spoonfuls a day… okay. Has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? Goodness, no. I eat the same things I’ve always eaten. Nothing fancy, mind you. Lots of vegetables, some chicken, a little bit of rice. I take a multivitamin, every day. I’ve always been careful about what I put in my body, that’s why this whole dirt thing is so baffling! I’ve never felt a craving like this before in my life.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant changes to your diet, and you regularly take a multivitamin. That's good information. And you've always been mindful of your health, which is excellent. Now, let’s take a quick look at your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was in my fifties, but I recovered just fine. And…oh, my iron was low once, years ago. They gave me some pills for that, and it cleared right up. Other than that? Not much. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. I don’t take any regular medications, just the occasional pain reliever for my arthritis.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia in your fifties, low iron in the past that was treated successfully, and you take pain relievers as needed for arthritis. That’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, allergies. Never had one in my life. I’m quite fortunate, actually. I’ve never been one for sensitivities. Honestly, I just want to know why I’m eating dirt. And if there’s anything I can do to stop. It's…undignified. And I'm sure it's not good for me, no matter what.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and we will definitely try to figure out the cause of this and find a solution. Eating dirt isn’t healthy, and it's good you're concerned. Now, let's move on to your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family has had any medical problems like anemia, or unusual cravings?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… let me think. My mother had high blood pressure, but she lived to be 92, so I suppose she did alright. My sister… she had some problems with her stomach, years ago, but I don’t recall the details. As for unusual cravings? No, not that I know of. We weren't really the type to…discuss such things. It’s just not something we talked about. Frankly, I'm the weird one here.
DOCTOR: Okay, your mother had high blood pressure, your sister had stomach problems, and no known history of unusual cravings in the family. That’s good to know. Now, let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I haven’t had a drink since…well, since my husband passed, and that was a long time ago. Recreational drugs? Heavens no. I’m a church-going woman, you know. And I've always believed in keeping a clean body and a clean mind. This whole dirt business is just…an anomaly.
DOCTOR: That's very good to know, Candis. And I appreciate your honesty. So, no smoking, no alcohol, and no recreational drugs. Now, I would like to do a physical exam if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me to assess your overall health and look for any clues that might explain your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, I suppose so. But please be quick about it, alright? I have things to do. And don't go poking around too much, I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I’ll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat and ears. I'll also gently feel your abdomen and check your skin. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/92. We can monitor that. Now I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, but a little fast. Your lungs sound clear. Your throat looks clear, and your ears are also clear. Now, I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Is there any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, no tenderness. It's just…my stomach is a little bloated, sometimes. But that's probably just from…well, from eating too much. Or not enough. Honestly, I don't know anymore. Just get on with it, alright? I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: Okay. I do notice some mild bloating. Now, I'm going to check your skin. Your skin looks normal, although a little dry. I'm also going to check your nailbeds. Your nails look pale, which could be a sign of anemia. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, I’m concerned about possible iron deficiency anemia, or another nutritional deficiency. The craving for dirt, known as pica, can sometimes be a sign of this. The pale nailbeds support this concern. I would like to order some blood tests to check your iron levels, complete blood count, and other key nutrients. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, great. More tests. Just what I needed. Fine, go ahead. Just…please tell me the results as soon as you can. I don't like waiting around, wondering what's wrong with me. And if it is anemia, can you just give me some pills? I don’t want any complicated procedures, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern and will definitely expedite the results as much as possible. We’ll get those tests ordered right away. If it is anemia, the good news is that it’s often easily treated with iron supplements, as you requested. We’ll start with oral iron pills. We can discuss the appropriate dosage and potential side effects. I also want to rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. We may need to do further testing if the initial results are inconclusive. But let's start with the blood tests first. In the meantime, I would recommend avoiding eating dirt. It’s important to address the underlying cause of the craving, and continuing to eat dirt could worsen any potential nutritional deficiencies. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Just get the tests done, and give me the pills. I really need to get going. Honestly, this has been a waste of my time. I have better things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candis. I apologize for the inconvenience. I’ve ordered the blood tests, and the lab results should be available within a few business days. I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re in. In the meantime, please try to rest and avoid eating dirt. Here's a lab requisition form, and a list of instructions about fasting before the test. I'll see you back here once we have the results. Thank you for coming in today. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: .
