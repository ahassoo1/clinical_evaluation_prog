DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Norval. Well, it’s… funny, really. I just don't seem to be able to eat much these days. I get full so quickly. Used to have a good appetite, you know? Now, just a few bites and I'm stuffed. It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly. Hard to say exactly. Time kind of…blurs when you get to be my age, eh? But definitely over a month. Not getting any less full, that’s for sure. It's just…not very comfortable. And my wife worries, naturally.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. And has this change in appetite been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Well, I've been a little tired, I suppose. But who isn't, at my age? And maybe a bit of…bloating after I do manage to eat something. Not terrible, just…uncomfortable. Can't say much else, really. No pain, no…nothing dramatic.
DOCTOR: Okay. Bloating and fatigue… Alright. And what about weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss… now that’s a good question. I think…I think I’ve lost a little bit. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven't actually weighed myself recently. My wife usually keeps track of things like that…I’ll have to ask her. She’s the organized one. But yeah, probably a bit. Not a lot, mind you. Just enough to notice, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s take a look at your medical history, if you don’t mind. I see you’ve been a patient here before… some notes from Dr. Elmsworth… and you are…uninsured, correct?
PATIENT: That's right, still uninsured. Always have been, really. Never needed much help before, and…well, things are expensive, eh? Dr. Elmsworth, you say? A good doctor. Haven’t seen him in…oh, must be ten years at least. Mostly just came for check-ups back then, nothing serious. I guess things change.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any significant past illnesses or surgeries that you recall?
PATIENT: Let me think… Nothing major, not that I remember. Had my appendix out when I was a boy, of course. And broke my arm once, falling out of a tree. But that was ages ago. I’ve been pretty lucky, all in all. No heart trouble, no diabetes… nothing like that. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting old, I suppose. My wife says I'm getting more creaky every year.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my wife, Elsie, as I mentioned. We’ve been married… goodness, almost sixty years now. Two children, a boy and a girl, both grown up and living in the city. They come to visit when they can, but it's not easy with work and everything. No siblings left, sadly. Lost my brother a few years back, and my sister before that. It's just Elsie and me these days. They were all healthy, as far as I know. No real history of…serious stomach problems or anything like that. Just the usual colds and flu.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single one. Always been one to avoid pills if I can. Elsie keeps telling me I should take something for my arthritis, but I refuse. I’d rather just take it easy. Besides, I'm not sure I'd even remember to take them anyway! Elsie manages all my appointments, so I'm not really in charge of that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Obarr, based on what you've told me – the early satiety, bloating, fatigue, and some unintentional weight loss – it would be prudent to do a quick physical examination. Nothing too extensive, just to get a better understanding of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go ahead whenever you're ready. I haven’t had a proper check-up in a while, so it's probably a good idea.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie down for me. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then palpate your abdomen. It will only take a few moments. Heart sounds are a little quiet, but regular. Lungs are clear. Okay, and your abdomen is…soft, with no obvious masses. A little tenderness in the upper quadrants, but nothing concerning. I'm not feeling any significant distension. A bit of tympany as well. It suggests there's some gas present. So, nothing immediately alarming, but we do need to investigate this further.
PATIENT: That…doesn’t sound too bad, does it? Gas, you say? Well, I have been eating a bit more cabbage lately. Elsie makes a lovely coleslaw. But it’s still worrying that I can't eat much. What sort of investigations are you thinking? More poking and prodding? I'm not a fan of needles, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Obarr. No, not necessarily more poking and prodding right away. I’m thinking we should start with some blood work to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, liver function, and thyroid levels. That will give us a baseline and rule out any obvious issues. And I'd also like to order a stool test to check for any signs of infection or malabsorption. And given your age and symptoms, I think a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis would be worthwhile. It's the best way to get a good look at your organs and identify any potential blockages or growths. I know you don't like needles, and CT scans involve some radiation, but it will give us a much clearer picture. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A CT scan… That sounds…serious. Radiation, you say? Is it…safe? I’ve heard bad things about those scans. And a stool test…well, that’s just embarrassing! I mean, I understand you need to find out what’s wrong, but… Is there really no other way? And what about the cost? I haven’t got a lot of money, you know. My wife…she handles all that. I just don’t want to be a burden. Is this covered by anything?
DOCTOR: Mr. Obarr, I understand your concerns completely. You're right to ask about the radiation risk with the CT scan. The amount of radiation is small, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis outweigh the risks in your case. We take all necessary precautions to minimize exposure. As for the stool test, it's a routine procedure, and we'll provide you with the necessary materials and instructions to collect the sample privately and comfortably. Regarding the cost, that's a very valid point. Given your lack of insurance, I’ll need to check what the costs are likely to be. We do have some assistance programs available for patients who can’t afford the tests. I can also discuss options for reducing the number of tests if necessary, but that would mean a less accurate diagnosis. Let me see…a basic blood panel would be around $150, the stool test about $75, and the CT scan…closer to $400. That’s the standard rate, though. Perhaps we can start with the blood work and stool test, and then reassess based on the results. It might give us enough information to proceed without the CT scan, if we're lucky. What do you think?
PATIENT: Blood work and a stool test… okay. That…I can manage, I suppose. $225… Elsie will have to decide if that’s alright. A CT scan… let’s hold off on that for now, if you don’t mind. I’m just worried about all this. I don’t want to be a bother, and I certainly don’t want to spend a fortune finding out I just need to eat less cabbage! So, blood work and the…stool sample. How do I go about getting those done? And how long will it take to get the results? Hopefully, it won't be too long. I'm not good at waiting.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Obarr. Blood work and the stool test it is. We'll start with those, and see what they tell us. I completely understand your concerns, and we’ll move at a pace you’re comfortable with. Here is the requisition form for the blood work. You can go to the lab at the Rural Community Hospital, just down the street. They're open from 8 am to 5 pm, Monday through Friday. And here are the instructions for the stool sample. It's a fairly straightforward process, but please read them carefully. You'll need to collect the sample in the provided container and bring it back to the clinic within 24 hours. The lab results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once we have them, we’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings. Do you have any questions about the procedure, or anything else I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. 3-5 days… alright. The hospital down the street…that’s good, easy enough to get to. I’ll make sure Elsie reads those instructions, though. She’s much better at that sort of thing. Well, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. And thank you for not rushing me. It’s… nice to have someone listen. I'll see you in a few days, then. Hopefully, it’s just the cabbage. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. And yes, let's hope it's just the cabbage! Take care. .
