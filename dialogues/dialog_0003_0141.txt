DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I am Dr. Yackey. So, to begin, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this itching. Everywhere, really. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s driving me absolutely batty. Not like, a rash or anything you can see, just… itchy skin. All over.
DOCTOR: Itching, you say. And how long precisely is “a little while”?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it started, oh, I’d say maybe six weeks ago? Started subtly, just after my wife passed, actually. I figured it was just stress, to be honest. But it hasn't gone away, and if anything, it's getting worse. It’s… constant, now.
DOCTOR: Six weeks. And this occurred after the loss of your wife. Very well. Have you noticed any visible changes to your skin besides the itching?
PATIENT: No, not really. That’s what’s so strange. No bumps, no redness, no dryness… nothing you can see. My skin just feels… irritated, all the time. I've tried lotion, different soaps… everything I can think of, really. Nothing seems to help much. It’s just…itchy.
DOCTOR: Lotion is… not typically a solution for generalized pruritus without a dermatological cause. Have you experienced any other symptoms accompanying this itching?
PATIENT: Pruritus? Is that… medical talk for itching? Sorry, I don’t always follow. And no, not really. No fever, no fatigue, no weight loss… nothing like that. I’ve been sleeping okay, eating normally… just… itchy. It’s really the only thing. It’s just… persistently annoying, you know? I wake up itching, I go to bed itching… it’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Exhausting, yes. Well. Let’s review some basic history. Any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never really had any trouble with food or anything. Maybe a little hay fever sometimes in the spring, but that’s it. Nothing serious. I don’t take any medications regularly either, just a multivitamin now and then. Oh! Wait… I did try a new laundry detergent about a month ago. Could that be it? I switched to one with a stronger scent… thinking it might be cleaner, I guess.
DOCTOR: A new detergent… possibly. However, six weeks is a rather prolonged reaction time. Do you have any history of skin conditions – eczema, psoriasis, anything like that – in your family?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. My mother had a little bit of dry skin when she got older, but nothing major. My father… he was pretty healthy, actually. Never really had any skin problems that I remember. We weren’t really a family that talked about… medical things much, to be honest. I just… don't think so. Is this unusual, Doctor? It just feels like my skin is… rebelling.
DOCTOR: "Rebellion" is not a medical term, Mr. Ferneding. Now, let’s proceed with a quick physical examination. I'll need to examine your skin more closely. Please remove your shirt and shoes. I’ll need to look at your entire body.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Okay. That’s… a bit awkward, isn’t it? But if that’s what we need to do… okay. Just let me know if you see anything unusual. I really appreciate you trying to figure this out, Doctor. It's been… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Hmmm. Skin appears normal in color and texture. No visible rash, lesions, or excoriations. I do note some mild pallor, but that could be due to a number of factors. Capillary refill is within normal limits. Lungs are clear. Now, regarding the pallor… have you noticed any increased fatigue, shortness of breath, or dizziness lately?
PATIENT: Pallor? Is that… paleness? No, I haven't noticed being any more tired than usual. I walk a bit, you know, keep active. And no shortness of breath. And definitely no dizziness. I feel… normal, other than this constant itching. It's just… there. Always. I've just been trying to ignore it, to be honest. But it’s getting harder and harder to do that.
DOCTOR: Well, given your history, the lack of dermatological findings, and the reported pallor, I'm considering a possible systemic cause. To rule out any underlying medical conditions, I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. These will give us a clearer picture of your overall health. Do you have any objections to these tests?
PATIENT: No, no objections at all. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to find out what's causing this itching, and if these tests can help, then absolutely. Blood tests, right? I assume I can go about my day normally after that? I have a bit of gardening planned for tomorrow. I just hope it’s not anything serious.
DOCTOR: The tests are routine. The lab is just down the hall; the nurse will draw the blood. You should be able to continue your activities as normal. However, I'd advise against strenuous activity until we have the results. We'll need to rule out anything serious before we can determine a proper course of action. The nurse will contact you with the results in approximately 48-72 hours. In the meantime, I recommend using a hypoallergenic moisturizer and avoiding any harsh soaps or detergents. Do you have any questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds reasonable. Hypoallergenic moisturizer… I can do that. And I'll lay off the heavy gardening for a bit. 48-72 hours… alright. Um… no, I think that covers everything. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, and for running these tests. It’s been… unsettling, not knowing what’s going on. I’ll go find the nurse, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse is through that door. Please follow her instructions. Another vague case…
