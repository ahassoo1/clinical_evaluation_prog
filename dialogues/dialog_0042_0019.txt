DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to get started, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… what bring me? Ah, yes. My wife… she want… baby. We old, you know? She think… maybe need help to make baby. I think so too. We want to plan… make sure everything okay. It is… important for us.
DOCTOR: I see. You and your wife are hoping to start a family, and you’d like to discuss the possibility of assisted reproduction or ensure everything is healthy for a pregnancy. That’s wonderful. It’s very responsible of you both to plan ahead. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about your wife’s current health?
PATIENT: Ah… her health… she is… okay, I think. She go to doctor… regular check-ups. She have… little trouble with her legs sometimes. Old age, you know? But she strong woman. She eat good food, walk every day. She… she take pills for her… water pressure, maybe? I forget the name. She go to the doctor for that. But mostly okay. She is… healthy. I think. It is hard for me to remember all the details.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. It's common to forget details, and that’s what I’m here for. We can look up her records on the computer here in the room. Do you happen to know the name of the doctor she sees regularly, or the name of the hospital or clinic she usually attends?
PATIENT: Hmm… the doctor… a woman, I think. Young woman. She… near the… supermarket? Yes, the supermarket. Big supermarket. Not far from our house. I… I don’t know her name. Sorry. We just go there… for check-ups. And the hospital… oh dear. I forget. It is… far away. A big building… with many rooms. We go there when she… feel very sick. I am not good with names and places, Doctor. My wife is better at remembering. She usually make the appointments.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Mr. Carlotta. We'll figure it out. Let me see… there are a few doctors near the supermarket. Perhaps we can narrow it down. While I search, could you tell me a little about your health?
PATIENT: My health? I am… old man. But I work. I make models. Metal and plastic. Keep my hands busy. I… I have some trouble with my back. From bending over the work. But I take some pills for that. And… I think my eyes are not so good anymore. That is why I wear glasses. Mostly, I am okay. I don’t go to doctor very often. I eat good food, like my wife. We both try to stay healthy. It is important, you know? For… everything.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you both prioritize staying healthy. And it's wonderful that you keep your hands busy with your models. Now, just to be thorough, have either you or your wife been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm… chronic… what does that mean? Like… long time sickness? My wife, she… sometimes her legs hurt. Doctor give her pills for that, like I said. Is that chronic? I think so. She have that for… long time. Me… I don’t think so. No long time sickness. Maybe just old age things. My back hurts, my eyes not so good, but… not sickness. We try to eat healthy. I don't think we have… chronic. Is that bad? I worry about my wife. She is strong, but… she is getting old.
DOCTOR: “Chronic” means a condition that lasts a long time, or keeps coming back. Leg pain that requires ongoing medication definitely falls into that category, and it’s good that your wife is receiving treatment for it. It’s not necessarily bad, it just means we need to be aware of it. And it’s completely understandable to worry about your wife. To get a better understanding of her overall health, and to see if pursuing pregnancy is a safe option, I’d like to review her medical records. Do you have any insurance information I can use to access those records?
PATIENT: Insurance… yes. Medicare. We have Medicare. I think. My wife take care of the paperwork. She is good with those things. I just… I give her the card. It is blue, I think. With a picture of… eagle? Yes, eagle. She keep it in her… wallet. I think. I don’t really know. She handle the insurance. I hope that is okay. I don’t want to cause trouble. I just want to make sure everything is safe for… baby.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Carlotta. Medicare is fine. I'm sure your wife is very capable. Let me just pull up her records here… Ah, here we are. Manuel Carlotta, date of birth… Okay. It looks like she sees Dr. Anya Sharma, as you mentioned, near the supermarket. And she is being treated for chronic leg pain, likely peripheral artery disease. She also has a history of hypertension, which is high blood pressure, and she's on medication for that, as you said. It also looks like she had a cholesterol check a few months ago. Her cholesterol levels are… slightly elevated.
PATIENT: Elevated… is that bad? My wife… she worry about her cholesterol. She tries to eat good food, but she like… sweets sometimes. She says it make her happy. And the leg pain… it trouble her sometimes. She walk, but then she need to sit down. She is strong, but… old age, you know? She is a good woman. We have been married a long time. We want… baby. Is it still possible? Even with… all of this? I worry about her health. I don’t want to make her sick.
DOCTOR: It's wonderful that you and your wife are so devoted to each other, and it's very responsible of you to consider all these factors before pursuing pregnancy. Elevated cholesterol is something we can manage with diet, exercise, and potentially medication, if necessary. And the leg pain, and her history of hypertension, are important to consider. Given her medical history, attempting pregnancy at her age does carry some increased risks. It’s not impossible, but it would require careful planning and monitoring. We’d need to evaluate her overall cardiovascular health, ensure her blood pressure is well-controlled, and discuss the potential impact of pregnancy on her leg pain. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. An EKG to assess her heart function, a blood test to check her kidney function and cholesterol levels, and a vascular ultrasound to evaluate the blood flow in her legs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… yes. Okay. If that is what you think is best. For my wife. If it will make sure she is safe. I trust you, Doctor. You seem… very knowledgeable. And you are kind. She will be happy to do the tests. She wants… baby. But not if it will hurt her. She is strong, but… she is old. I just want her to be safe. And… healthy. Can we… do the tests soon? I want to know… if it is possible. And if it is safe. For both of us.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Carlotta. I completely understand. Your wife's health and safety are my top priority. We can get those tests scheduled right away. I’ll have my nurse draw the blood today, and we can schedule the EKG and vascular ultrasound for early next week. That should give us a good starting point. In the meantime, it’s important that your wife continues to take her medications as prescribed and maintains a healthy diet and exercise routine. I also want to be upfront and say that depending on the results of these tests, we may need to consult with a specialist, such as a cardiologist or vascular surgeon, to ensure her heart and blood vessels are healthy enough to support a pregnancy. Would you be open to that if necessary?
PATIENT: Specialist… yes. If you think it is best. For my wife. I don’t want to cause trouble. But if it will make sure she is safe… then yes. We will do whatever you think is best. She is… strong woman. But she is old. And I worry. I just want her to be safe. And… happy. And if she can have… baby. That would be wonderful. But not if it will hurt her. I trust you, Doctor. You seem… very good. Please… just take care of my wife. That is all I ask.
DOCTOR: You can rest assured, Mr. Carlotta, I will do everything I can to ensure your wife’s health and safety. I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your trust. Okay, let’s get the tests ordered. My nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to draw the blood. She'll explain the process to you. After the tests are completed, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and develop a plan. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. You explained everything very well. I trust you, Doctor. And I thank you for… taking care of my wife. She is… very important to me. I just want her to be safe. And… happy. I will tell her about the tests. And we will… wait for the results. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. It was a pleasure meeting you both. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Sarah will be in shortly. And please, reassure your wife that we’re doing everything we can to explore all options and ensure her well-being. .
