DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. I'm Dr. Soodeen. Welcome to the clinic. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like you said on the phone. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about. My husband keeps telling me to come, but I feel fine.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Ms. Dudney. It's common to feel well even with high blood pressure – that's why it's often called the “silent killer.” However, consistently elevated blood pressure can lead to serious health problems over time, even without noticeable symptoms. That’s why your husband is right to encourage you to get it checked. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask you a few questions about when you first noticed this, if you've had it checked before, and any family history of high blood pressure or heart disease. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, I told the lady on the phone everything. Do you have my file or not? I really don’t have time to repeat myself. I took a half day off work for this.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Dudney, I do have access to the information provided to the phone screener. My apologies; I just want to ensure I have a complete understanding, and sometimes details can be missed or clarified. According to the notes, your husband has been monitoring your blood pressure at home, and it has been consistently above 140/90. Is that correct?
PATIENT: He likes his gadgets. Yeah, that sounds about right. He’s always taking it. Honestly, I think he wants me to be sick so he has an excuse to fuss over me. It's ridiculous. Is that it? Can we just get a prescription or whatever and be done with this?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney. While a home blood pressure monitor is useful, it's important to confirm these readings in a clinical setting. To do that, I'd like to take your blood pressure myself, and also perform a brief physical exam. It will only take a few minutes. After that, we can discuss potential causes and treatment options. It's important to rule out any secondary causes of high blood pressure before starting medication. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have things to do. And please don’t tell me about “lifestyle changes.” I eat perfectly fine and I get enough sleep. Don’t waste my time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Dudney. We’ll focus on gathering the necessary information to understand your blood pressure. If you could please have a seat, I’ll start by checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll ask a few questions about your medical history.
PATIENT: Whatever. Just hurry up. This chair is uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is currently 152/98. That is elevated, and confirms your husband’s readings. I'm also going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a deep breath for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, just a few quick questions. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No. Never. I stay healthy. My husband worries about everything. He says I snore, but that’s it. Honestly, he probably just likes waking me up. He's a bit of a control freak. Can we just skip the questions? This is all just… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney, but even if you generally feel healthy, it's important to gather a complete picture to determine the best course of action. Your husband mentioning the snoring is actually quite relevant, as it could indicate sleep apnea, which can contribute to high blood pressure. But we can certainly move more quickly. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: No. Not ever. And I do not have sleep apnea. My husband watches too much television. He self-diagnoses everything. He thinks he's a doctor because he reads articles online. Just...look, are you going to give me something for this or not? I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudney. According to the file, you’re currently not taking any medications and have no known allergies. Given your blood pressure readings and the absence of any immediately identifiable secondary causes, the most likely diagnosis is essential hypertension – high blood pressure with no known underlying cause. However, it’s important to rule out a few things before starting medication. I would like to order a basic metabolic panel – a blood test to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar – and a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels. We should also consider an EKG to evaluate your heart health, given your blood pressure. Would you be comfortable with these tests?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? What was the point of coming here if you were just going to order a bunch of tests? I swear… This is ridiculous. My husband is going to be so pleased. He always wants me poked and prodded. Fine. Whatever. Just…get it over with. But I’m not coming back.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney. These tests will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and help us determine the safest and most effective treatment plan for you. It's standard procedure, and it will only take a few minutes to draw the blood. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they're available, usually within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend limiting your caffeine intake and reducing your sodium consumption. Once the results are back, we can discuss medication options if necessary, and I can provide you with a referral to a cardiologist for further evaluation, if appropriate. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. Not at all. Just get me out of here. I have better things to do than sit around in a doctor’s office all day. I’m sure my husband will be thrilled to hear all about it. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudney. The lab technician will be with you shortly. Thank you for coming in, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
