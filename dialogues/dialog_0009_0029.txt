DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this…feeling full really fast. Like, I haven't even finished a plate of food and I feel like I should be full, but I haven't eaten much. It’s been going on for a bit now, maybe a month or so. Not sure exactly when it started, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information to start with. Feeling full quickly, even after a small amount of food, for about a month… I understand. Could you describe what that “full” feeling is like?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s not painful, exactly. More like…pressure, I guess? Right here, in my stomach. And it just…stops me. Like my body says “no more” even though I know I haven't had enough. It’s just…uncomfortable, more than anything. It doesn't last long, usually. Just while I’m eating, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, pressure in your stomach, not pain, stopping you from finishing your meal, and it happens during eating. And it’s been going on for about a month. That’s helpful. Now, has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I eat pretty much the same things I always have. Lots of fish, you know, being Haida. Some rice, some vegetables when my wife makes them. Nothing new, and I haven't been eating more of anything, that's for sure. My appetite hasn’t changed, it's just…this feeling happens sooner than it used to.
DOCTOR: Alright, no changes to your diet. And your appetite itself feels the same – you're still hungry, it's just that the fullness comes on quickly. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I've been a little tired lately, but honestly, at my age, who isn't? Nothing major, though. Maybe a bit of…well, my stomach’s been a little gassy sometimes, but I always figured that was just old age catching up with me. It’s hard to say if it’s connected, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, some fatigue and occasional gas. We'll definitely keep those in mind. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a bit of a bad cough a few years back, but the doctor said it was just a bad cold. My wife worries, she always thinks I should go to the doctor for everything. But I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Never had any serious illnesses or anything, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No major medical diagnoses. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been under the knife. Always avoided it if I could. My grandfather used to say it was best to let the body heal itself whenever possible. I’ve always been a bit of that way, too. I’m not a fan of poking around inside, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. No surgeries. Now, thinking about your family…are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had some trouble with her stomach when she got older. Not sure what it was, exactly. Something about indigestion, I think. And my brother, he had heart trouble, but he didn't take care of himself. Smoked too much, drank too much. Not a good example, that one. Otherwise, not that I know of. My family was pretty healthy, mostly. Lived long lives, all of them.
DOCTOR: Okay, some stomach issues in your mother and heart trouble in your brother. Let's move on to social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: Nope. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife doesn’t like the smell, and honestly, I don’t see the point. I used to have a little bit of beer with dinner sometimes, when I was younger, but I gave that up years ago. Doctor said it wasn’t doing me any good. And no, nothing else either. Just good old-fashioned fish and rice, that’s what keeps me going.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, alcohol, or other substances. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife always checks before giving me anything, she's very careful. I think I’m pretty lucky in that regard. She keeps me alive, that woman.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s very helpful, Mr. Obarr. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently examine your abdomen to see if we can get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Hopefully you can figure out what’s going on. It's just…it's getting a little tiring, you know, not being able to enjoy a good meal.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels painful. I note some mild tenderness in the epigastric region, but no guarding or rebound tenderness. Your abdomen is soft, but there is some slight distension. I don't feel any masses. Okay, so based on the exam, your abdomen is a little tender to the touch in the upper part of your stomach, and it's slightly swollen. These findings, combined with your symptoms, could suggest a few possibilities. It could be something relatively minor like gastritis, or it could be something else. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work. It will help us rule out any underlying infections or other issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Blood work is fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get to the bottom of this, you know? It’s hard to enjoy life when your stomach isn’t cooperating. Gastritis…is that serious? I've never heard of that before.
DOCTOR: Gastritis is inflammation of the stomach lining. It's not always serious, and it can often be treated with medication and dietary changes. However, it’s important to find out the cause to ensure we address it properly. The blood work will help us with that. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a test for Helicobacter pylori, which is a bacteria that can sometimes cause gastritis. The lab will call you to schedule an appointment, or we can draw the blood here at the clinic if you prefer. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You explained it pretty clearly. Drawing it here would be easier, I suppose. Less running around. So, we just need to wait for the results then? How long will that take, usually? I have a fishing trip planned next week, and I’m hoping I’ll be able to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, we can draw the blood here. It usually takes about 2-3 business days for the results to come back. I will call you as soon as I have them, and we can discuss the next steps. As for your fishing trip, let’s see what the results say first. If it’s something minor, you should be fine to go. But if it’s something more serious, we might need to postpone it. In the meantime, I recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals, avoiding spicy or acidic foods, and staying hydrated. These things can help alleviate your symptoms. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. Hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. I just want to get back to enjoying my meals and getting out on the water.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. I’m glad I could help. We'll get to the bottom of this, and hopefully, you'll be back to enjoying your fishing trips soon. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Nice to meet you, Doctor. You too. I will. Have a good day as well.
