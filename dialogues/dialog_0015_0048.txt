DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s these… episodes. My wife, she’s the one who really insisted I come. I get confused, you see. Not all the time, but enough to worry her. It’s… unsettling, I suppose. I know what year it is, don't get me wrong. But sometimes… things just don't click.
DOCTOR: “Episodes,” you say. Can you tell me more about these episodes?
PATIENT: More? Well… it’s hard to explain. It’s not like I forget everything. I remember perfectly well what I had for breakfast – fish amok, naturally. And I remember every tile I laid on the Henderson job last month, every single one. But… if someone asks me, say, the name of that actress, you know, the one from the old movies… it’s just gone. Or I’ll be telling a story, and I’ll lose my place mid-sentence. Just… blank. It’s frustrating, mostly. And embarrassing, I won’t lie. My wife says it’s getting worse, but honestly, I think she worries too much.
DOCTOR: So, it sounds like you’re experiencing difficulty recalling specific information – names, details within conversations – while your long-term memory and procedural memory – like the tile work – seem intact. How long has this been going on, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… hard to say exactly. Maybe six months or so? It started gradually, just little things. I’d misplace my glasses – which happens to everyone, right? – or forget where I parked the truck. But it’s definitely been more frequent lately. The wife… she’s been keeping a little calendar, writing down when she notices things. Says it's important to be precise. Honestly, I think she's overreacting. It's just old age, probably. Though, she says it’s not just age, but I've always been good with my memory. I remember things from when I was a boy in Cambodia, clear as day.
DOCTOR: A calendar, you say. That is rather conscientious of her. And it’s good that you can recall things from your childhood so vividly. Let's try to pinpoint the pattern a bit more specifically. Besides names and details in conversations, are there any other types of things you’re finding difficult to remember?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not… dates, really. I know what year it is, like I said. And I can usually remember appointments, as long as I write them down. But… directions, sometimes. I can get to the hardware store just fine, been going there for years. But if I try to take a new route… or go somewhere I haven’t been in a while… that’s trouble. And… oh, and new people’s names. I can remember the names of my old customers for decades, but if I meet someone new, it's just gone a minute later. It’s… infuriating, honestly. I used to be so sharp.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, difficulty with recent memory, specifically new information—names, directions, appointments if not written down—while your ability to recall established memories seems relatively preserved. Have you noticed any changes in your mood or behavior alongside these memory difficulties?
PATIENT: Mood? No, not really. I get a little frustrated, like I said, when I can't remember something. But I'm generally a pretty even-tempered man. I don't go around yelling and screaming, if that's what you mean. My wife… she says I’ve been a bit more withdrawn lately. Spending more time in the workshop, avoiding social gatherings. But honestly, I just don’t enjoy talking to people much anymore. Too much… small talk. And these youngsters these days… they don’t know the value of hard work. I find it easier to just focus on my tiles. It's honest work, you know? Something real.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you experienced any physical symptoms—headaches, dizziness, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking—that have occurred alongside these memory issues?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms… now, let me think. No headaches, not really. Sometimes a little dizzy when I stand up too fast, but that's just old age, probably. Vision's a little blurry, but I’ve been needing new glasses for a while now. Haven't gotten around to it. And… no, no trouble speaking. I can still yell at the wife just fine, if needed. No weakness, no nothing like that. Just… the memory. It's just… unsettling. It feels like something’s… slipping away. And it's making me cross. I’m a practical man, you see? I like things to work. And my brain… it doesn’t seem to be working the way it used to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Before we proceed, could you please tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… hmmm. Let me think. Just the blood pressure pills, the doctor prescribed them a few years back. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes I take Tylenol for my back, when it’s acting up. Other than that… nothing. My wife, she’s always trying to get me to take these vitamins, some sort of herbal supplement, but I don’t believe in that mumbo jumbo. I get everything I need from a good meal and a hard day’s work. Honestly. And maybe a little fish amok, now and then. That’s good for the soul, you know. It certainly isn’t making me forget things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I’m going to perform a brief cognitive assessment and a neurological exam. It will help me assess your memory, attention, and other cognitive functions, as well as check your reflexes, coordination, and balance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Assessment? Exam? Well… I suppose so. But I’m telling you, Doctor, I’m perfectly fine. Just a little forgetful, that's all. But if you insist. Just try not to take up too much of my time, if you could. I have tiles to lay, you know. A man's gotta work.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could follow me to the examination room, we can get started. It won’t take long. First, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions, then check your vital signs, reflexes, and coordination.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Let's just get this over with. But don't expect me to remember any of these silly questions afterwards. It's the principle of the thing, you understand? A perfectly capable tile setter shouldn't have to be tested like a child.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason, I’m going to ask you a few questions now. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today's date… Hmm. Let me see… It’s… August. Definitely August. And… the second? Yes, the second of August. 2025, of course. Though why you’re asking me the date, I couldn't tell you. I have more important things to remember than the calendar.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Where are we? Honestly, Doctor, you think I’ve completely lost my mind? We’re in a doctor’s office, of course. Your office, to be precise. All these medical instruments and… pictures. Not exactly a relaxing atmosphere, if you ask me. I’d rather be laying tiles.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to ask you to repeat three words. Listen carefully. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat them back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. There. Perfectly clear. Is this really necessary, Doctor? It feels rather… patronizing, if I’m being honest. A man knows his fruits and furniture, thank you very much. And coinage.
DOCTOR: Now, let’s try some simple math. If you have ten apples and you give away three, how many apples do you have left?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor… Ten minus three is… seven! Seven apples. Do you think I’ve never handled numbers before? I run a business, you know. I have to keep track of supplies, calculate costs… it's not exactly rocket science.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason, now I'd like you to draw a clock face showing 10 minutes past eleven. Please include all the numbers on the clock. Then, can you write a complete sentence for me?
PATIENT: There. A clock. And… a sentence. "The tiles are strong." Is that good enough? Honestly, Doctor, I'm a tile setter, not an artist or a writer. I work with my hands, not my brain. This is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, can you recall three things I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor… I… I can't remember. Apple… table… something? I knew them a minute ago, I swear. It’s right on the tip of my tongue… But they’ve just… vanished. This is ridiculous. I told you, I'm perfectly fine! A little forgetful, perhaps, but not… incapable. It's probably the stress, you know? Running a business, dealing with customers… It takes a lot out of a man.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Based on my assessment and your reported symptoms, I believe a more comprehensive evaluation is warranted. While it’s possible this is simply age-related memory decline, the pattern and the degree of forgetfulness warrant further investigation to rule out other potential causes. I'm going to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and other relevant markers. I’m also recommending a referral to a neurologist for a more in-depth cognitive evaluation, including imaging of your brain. It’s important to identify the cause of your memory difficulties so we can develop an appropriate management plan. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Blood work? A neurologist? Imaging of my brain? Honestly, Doctor, it’s… overkill. I told you, I’m perfectly fine. It’s just a little forgetfulness, that's all. But… if you insist. I suppose I have no choice, do I? But I want you to know, I still think you're making a mountain out of a molehill. And I expect this won’t find anything. Just… tell me what I need to do. Where do I go for the blood work? And who is this neurologist? I have tiles to lay, you know. I don’t have time for all this nonsense.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Here’s the referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist specializing in memory disorders. Her office is located at 1400 Elm Street, and you can schedule an appointment by calling 555-1234. Here’s the lab order for the blood work; you can have it done at any Quest Diagnostics location. The results will be sent to my office, and I will contact you once I have them. It’s important to follow through with these recommendations, Mr. Lason, so we can get a clear understanding of what’s going on. I understand you have a busy schedule, but your health is a priority. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
