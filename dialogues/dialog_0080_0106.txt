DOCTOR: Hi Louine, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s about my foot. This sore… it just won’t go away. Been trouble for months now, and it's getting worse, not better. I was told to come see someone… a specialist, I think they said. Though, honestly, these young doctors these days… they all seem to know so little.
DOCTOR: Okay, a foot sore that’s been bothering you for months. I understand it’s frustrating when things don't improve, and you’ve been referred to see someone. We’ll figure this out together. Let me just take a quick look at your record here… I see you’ve been seen at the clinic before. Good. Now, can you tell me a little more about the sore?
PATIENT: Oh, they have records now, do they? Fancy. Well, it’s on my left foot, right on the bottom. It started small, just a little red spot, I thought nothing of it. But it got bigger, and now it’s… well, it’s ugly. And painful. Especially when I try to walk. It feels like walking on glass sometimes. And I have… the sugar problem, you know. My husband, God rest his soul, he had it too. That’s probably what this is all about, isn’t it? They always say it's the sugar.
DOCTOR: Okay, left foot, bottom of the foot, started as a small red spot and has gotten bigger and painful with walking. And you have a history of diabetes, which is good to know, and yes, can certainly contribute to foot problems. When you say “ugly,” can you describe it a little more for me?
PATIENT: Ugly as in… it’s not a clean cut. It’s… raw looking. Lots of… moisture. And it smells. I have to wrap it carefully, or the house starts to smell funny. It's not a nice smell, let me tell you. And the skin around it is all red and swollen. It's just… not a foot that anyone would want to look at, that’s for sure. I’ve tried putting creams on it, the ones they gave me at the pharmacy, but they don’t seem to do a thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, raw looking, with moisture, a noticeable odor, redness and swelling around it, and the creams aren’t helping. That gives me a better picture. Louine, I want to take a look at it myself. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Well, of course you need to look at it. That’s what you’re paid to do, isn’t it? Just be gentle, dear. My feet are rather sensitive these days. And please, don't make a face. I can tell when someone is disgusted, you know. Just… look at it and tell me what’s to be done. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'll be as gentle as possible. And I assure you, I’ve seen all sorts of things in my years of practice, so nothing shocks me. Okay… I see the area you’re talking about. It is quite inflamed, and there’s some discharge present. The skin surrounding it is very red and tender to the touch. It looks like there's some breakdown of the tissue, and it's quite deep. There’s also a concerning odor. Louine, this doesn't look like a simple sore. I’m concerned about the possibility of an infection, and given your history of diabetes, that's something we need to address promptly. I want to order some lab tests to confirm that suspicion. We'll need to do a culture to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection, and I’ll also check your blood sugar levels.
PATIENT: Infection, you say? Well, I knew it was something serious. I told those other doctors something wasn’t right, but they just kept giving me creams! Honestly, a culture? Blood tests? All this fuss for a little sore. My husband never had to go through all this, and he had it much worse than me, I’ll tell you that. Still… if you think it’s necessary. Just get it over with quickly, dear. I have a bridge game this afternoon. And please, be careful. I don't want a mess.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. It’s always best to be thorough, especially with diabetes, as it can affect healing and make infections more complicated. Your husband’s experience is valuable, but everyone is different. The culture involves taking a small sample of the fluid from the sore with a sterile swab. It shouldn’t be painful, just a little pinch. The blood test will just require a small sample from your arm. I’ll send both samples to the lab right away, and the results should be back within a couple of days. While we’re waiting for the results, I’m going to thoroughly clean and dress the sore. I’ll also prescribe an oral antibiotic to start fighting the infection right away. I also want to strongly recommend offloading pressure from your foot. Are you wearing supportive shoes?
PATIENT: Antibiotics, fine. Just get it done. Supportive shoes? Well, I wear slippers mostly. My feet are always swollen, you see. Shoes hurt. And I don’t go out much anymore. Except for bridge, of course. Agnes would never forgive me if I missed bridge! But slippers are all I can manage, dear. Honestly, you young doctors and your rules. Back in my day, we didn’t need all this fuss. A little iodine and a bandage was all we needed. But… do what you must. Just be quick about it. I don’t like having my feet fussed with.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like the swelling is making it difficult to wear shoes. Slippers aren't ideal, but we can work around that for now. I’m going to recommend a specific type of dressing to help absorb moisture and reduce pressure on the sore. I’ll also give you instructions on how to care for it at home, including keeping it clean and dry. Okay… all done. This dressing should help protect the sore and promote healing. Remember to change it daily, or more often if it becomes wet or soiled. And please, try to elevate your foot as much as possible. I’ll call you as soon as the lab results are back, which should be within 48 hours. In the meantime, if you notice any signs of worsening infection – increased pain, redness, swelling, fever, or chills – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions? Well… how long will I be on these pills? I don’t like taking medicine, you know. It always makes me feel sick. And… will I be able to play bridge? Agnes would be furious if I had to miss another game. Honestly, all this trouble for a little sore. I just want it to go away. But… I suppose you're the doctor. Just tell me, will I be able to play bridge? That's all I really care about. And… is this going to be expensive? Medicare doesn’t cover everything, you know.
DOCTOR: Those are all very good questions, Louine. Let’s take them one at a time. The duration of the antibiotic course will depend on the lab results. Typically, it’s a 7-10 day course, but we’ll adjust that based on the severity of the infection and how you’re responding to treatment. We’ll start with a 10-day course. Regarding bridge… that’s a little harder to answer right now. It depends on how quickly the infection clears up and how much pain you're in. I would advise against playing bridge until we have the lab results and I’ve had a chance to assess your progress. Playing bridge will put pressure on your foot and could potentially worsen the infection. We need to give it a chance to heal. Finally, regarding cost… Medicare should cover the majority of the cost of the office visit, the lab tests, and the antibiotic. There may be a small co-pay or deductible, but I’ll have the billing department verify your coverage and provide you with an estimate. I’ll make a note to have them call you with that information. I know this is frustrating, Louine, but we’re going to do everything we can to get you back on your feet and back to playing bridge as soon as possible. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose that’s all for now. Just… don’t keep me waiting too long for the results. And tell the billing people to be clear about the costs. I don't like surprises. Honestly, I’ve lived a long life, seen a lot of things. A little sore shouldn’t be causing all this fuss. But… thank you, dear. You seem like a nice young woman. Just… get me back to bridge. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Louine. I understand your frustration, and I promise I'll do my best to get you back to bridge as quickly and safely as possible. I'll personally follow up with the lab to expedite the results, and I'll make sure the billing department provides you with a clear and accurate estimate. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And rest assured, we’ll get you back to your bridge game soon. .
