DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. My name is Dr. Glowka. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is… a pleasure to meet you as well. Hmm. What brings me… yes. Well, it’s this… trouble with the words. It’s difficult to explain. They don’t… come so easily now. It’s been happening for some time, I think. Not a new thing, but… more noticeable lately. I apologize if I sound confused.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Mr. Gyamfi. It’s perfectly alright if it’s difficult to explain. We’ll take our time. So, you’re experiencing some difficulty finding the right words, and it’s been gradually worsening?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… correct. Gradually. Like… a fog, perhaps. Not all the time, you understand. Sometimes they come, clear as a bell. But then… other times, I search, and search, and the word… it is just gone. It’s frustrating, mostly. And… concerning. My wife… she always knew what I meant, even when I stumbled. But… she is gone now.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Gyamfi. That must be incredibly difficult. It’s understandable that this experience is concerning, especially given everything else. To help me understand this better, could you describe when you notice this difficulty most?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It… it is still hard, after all this time. When… hmm. Let me think. It seems… worse when I am tired, certainly. And… when I try to explain something complicated. If someone asks me a simple question, like… what I had for breakfast, that’s usually no problem. But if I try to… describe a process at work, or… something I read, then the words… they hide. It’s not always the same words, either. It’s… random, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So it’s more pronounced with fatigue and when you’re attempting more complex communication. And it seems to be unpredictable which words are affected. Have you noticed any changes in your understanding of what people are saying to you?
PATIENT: Ah… that is a good question. Let me think carefully. No… not really. I can still understand perfectly well what people say to me, thankfully. It’s not that. I hear the words, and I know what they mean. It’s… saying the words back, that’s the difficulty. Sometimes, I find myself… rephrasing, trying to find another way to say it. Or… just stopping mid-sentence. It’s embarrassing, honestly.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful to know, Mr. Gyamfi. It sounds like your comprehension is intact, and the difficulty lies primarily with expression. That helps narrow down the possibilities. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this trouble with words?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see. I… I have been a bit more tired lately, yes. More so than usual. But I attributed that to… well, getting older, mostly. And… sometimes my hands feel a little shaky. Not constantly, but… occasionally. Nothing too serious, I don't think. Oh! And… I seem to have lost interest in my hobbies. I used to enjoy woodworking, but… I haven't touched my tools in months. I just… don’t feel like it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased fatigue, occasional hand tremors, and a loss of interest in your hobbies. These are all important pieces of information. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… yes. Well, I… I had my appendix removed when I was a young man. And… high blood pressure, for many years. It was well-controlled with medication, but… the doctor took me off of it a few years ago. Said my numbers were good enough. And… I broke my arm skiing, about ten years ago. Nothing major, I don’t think. Other than that… I’ve been quite healthy, all my life. I used to be very active, very strong.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy, history of hypertension that was previously controlled with medication, and a broken arm. And you say you were generally very active and healthy before this started?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Very active. I used to walk for miles every day. And… I enjoyed gardening, building things in the workshop… things like that. Now… I mostly sit. It’s… not good, I know. I feel… weaker. And… I worry. Not about myself, necessarily. But… about forgetting things. Not just words, but… names, dates… things that are important.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, especially with the memory concerns you're describing. We'll certainly address those. Now, do you have any family history of neurological conditions like dementia or Parkinson’s disease?
PATIENT: Neurological conditions… hmm. That is… a difficult question. My mother… she had some memory problems in her later years, yes. But it was attributed to old age, mostly. The doctor said it was just… normal aging. And… my uncle, on my father’s side, he… he shook a lot, in his hands. But I don’t know what it was. Nobody talked about it much. It was… a long time ago. I don’t believe anyone was ever officially diagnosed with anything, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Mr. Gyamfi. Knowing about the family history of memory issues and tremors, even without a formal diagnosis, is important. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it. And… occasionally, I take ibuprofen for my knees. They bother me sometimes, especially when the weather is cold. Other than that… no. I try to avoid medication as much as possible. I prefer… natural remedies, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin D supplement and occasional ibuprofen. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to be stung by a bee, many times, when I was a boy, but… I was fine. Just a little pain. No swelling, no difficulty breathing. Nothing like that. I… I don't believe I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for providing all of that information, Mr. Gyamfi. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to perform a brief neurological examination and check some basic reflexes, coordination, and strength. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I… I just want to know what’s going on. And… if there’s anything I can do about it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll start by checking your reflexes in your arms and legs. Then, I'll ask you to perform a few simple coordination tests, like touching your nose with your finger. And finally, I’ll check your strength by asking you to resist my gentle pressure. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. First, let’s start with your reflexes. Could you please relax your arm, and I'll gently tap your knee with this small hammer?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Relax my arm… here?
DOCTOR: Okay… and now the other side. Good. Both reflexes are present and equal. Now, let's check your strength. I'm going to ask you to resist my pressure as I try to push your arm down. Please push back as hard as you can. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, ready. Push back… as hard as I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And now the other arm. Now, I’m going to ask you to touch your nose with your finger, and then touch my finger. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can try.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let’s try a few simple mental tasks. I’m going to say three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me immediately. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, ready. Say the words.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: table, penny, orange. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Hmm… table… penny… and… oh dear. Table, penny… I… I can’t seem to remember the last one. It’s on the tip of my tongue…
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Gyamfi. No need to worry. It can be challenging to recall things immediately. Based on the history you’ve provided and the findings of this brief examination—specifically, the difficulty recalling the third word—I suspect we need to investigate this further. The symptoms you describe, including the difficulty finding words, fatigue, and memory concerns, could be indicative of several different conditions. We should consider cognitive testing and possibly some imaging of the brain. Would you be comfortable with those next steps?
PATIENT: Cognitive testing… and imaging? Imaging… does that involve… radiation? And what does cognitive testing involve? Will it be… difficult?
DOCTOR: Those are very valid questions, Mr. Gyamfi. Let me address each one. The imaging we would consider would most likely be an MRI of the brain, which does not involve radiation. It uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images. As for cognitive testing, it's a series of simple questions and tasks designed to assess your memory, attention, language skills, and problem-solving abilities. It's not a pass or fail test, and it won't be painful or difficult. It simply helps us get a clearer picture of your cognitive function and identify any areas that may need further attention. It's important to remember that these tests are simply tools to help us understand what's going on. They don't necessarily indicate a specific diagnosis, but they can guide us in the right direction. Would you like me to explain the potential causes we might be investigating with these tests?
PATIENT: An MRI… no radiation, that’s… reassuring. And the cognitive tests… simple questions, you say. That sounds… less daunting. Potential causes… yes, please. If you wouldn’t mind explaining. I… I would like to know what we are looking for. It’s… frightening not knowing.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gyamfi. It’s completely understandable to be anxious, and I want to be as transparent as possible. The symptoms you're experiencing can be associated with several conditions. One possibility is mild cognitive impairment, which is a slight decline in cognitive function that doesn't significantly interfere with daily life, but can sometimes progress. Another possibility is early-stage dementia, although we’ll need further testing to determine if that’s the case. There are different types of dementia, each with its own characteristics. Other potential causes could include vitamin deficiencies, medication side effects , or even stress and anxiety. It’s also important to rule out any other underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. To be clear, I’m not saying you have any of these conditions. These are simply possibilities that we need to investigate. The tests will help us narrow down the options and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Mild cognitive impairment… dementia… Yes, that makes… some sense. It’s… a lot to take in. So, the tests will help rule things out, and hopefully, find a cause? And then… what happens if it is something serious? Is there… anything that can be done?
DOCTOR: That’s exactly right, Mr. Gyamfi. The tests will help us rule things out and, hopefully, identify a cause. As for what happens if it is something serious, it depends on the diagnosis. For mild cognitive impairment, there are strategies to help manage the symptoms and slow down the progression, such as cognitive training exercises, lifestyle modifications, and regular check-ups. If it were to be a type of dementia, there are medications that can help improve cognitive function and manage some of the behavioral symptoms. There are also supportive therapies, such as occupational therapy, speech therapy, and counseling, that can help you and your family cope with the challenges of the condition. And importantly, there’s a growing body of research on new treatments for dementia, so we would continue to monitor your condition and explore all available options. I want to assure you that you wouldn’t be alone in this. We have a team of specialists who can provide ongoing support and care. Would you like me to schedule those tests for you today?
PATIENT: A team of specialists… that’s… good to know. Not alone… yes, that’s important. Yes, please. If you could schedule the tests. I… I would like to get this sorted out. The sooner, the better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let me see… we can schedule an MRI for next Tuesday morning. And I’ll have the cognitive testing arranged for Thursday afternoon with one of our neuropsychologists. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday and Thursday… yes, that works perfectly. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gyamfi. I’m glad I could help. I’ll have my assistant, Sarah, send over the paperwork for the MRI and cognitive testing, along with some instructions on how to prepare. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. I’ll see you next Tuesday for the MRI. And please, try not to worry too much. We’ll take things one step at a time. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will try.
