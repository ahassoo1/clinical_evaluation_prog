DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepbro. I am Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pipkorn. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been having some pain… down there. In… the, um, groin area. It's been on and off for a few weeks now, I think. It’s hard to say exactly when it started. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: “Down there,” you say. Right. Well, we’ll try to get to the bottom of it. A few weeks, on and off… that’s not terribly specific, unfortunately. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More… a dull ache, sometimes. And a heaviness, too. Like… something is bruised, perhaps? It’s hard to explain. It doesn’t hurt constantly, but it’s uncomfortable when I… when I move around a lot. Or if I stand for too long. Does that make any sense? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: It’s… adequate. A dull ache and heaviness, worse with movement and prolonged standing. We need more precision, Ms. Stepbro. Is it on one side, or both?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. I… I hadn’t really thought about which side. Let me… pause, shifts uncomfortably in the chair… I think it’s more on the left side, yes. Though, sometimes it feels… spread out. It’s difficult to pinpoint, truly. I'm so sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. Is it normal to not know these things?
DOCTOR: “Normal” is a rather subjective term, Ms. Stepbro. It's helpful to be specific when describing your symptoms. Alright. Left side, sometimes spreading. Now, does this pain radiate anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiate…? frowns, touching her lower abdomen gently I… I don’t know what that means, Doctor. Does that mean… does it go somewhere else? If it does, it’s very faint. Maybe… a little bit in my lower stomach? But it’s hard to tell if that’s the pain, or just… normal discomfort. I do have a bit of trouble with my digestion sometimes.
DOCTOR: Radiate means does the pain travel to other areas. It sounds like it may be a mild referral to your lower abdomen. And, yes, digestive issues can certainly contribute to abdominal discomfort. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? pauses, thinking hard, tapping a finger against her chin Let me see… Well, I’ve been feeling a bit more tired than usual, but I assumed that was just getting older. And… maybe a little bit of swelling, down there. But it’s hard to say. I haven’t really… examined myself closely, if you understand. It’s a bit embarrassing. I don’t think there’s been any… fever, or nausea, or anything like that. Just the pain and the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Tiredness and possible swelling. Right. I'm going to need to conduct a physical exam, Ms. Stepbro. It’s necessary to properly assess your condition. Please lie down on the examination table when you are ready. We’ll start with an abdominal exam, and then I'll need to perform a pelvic exam. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. blinks, looking slightly flustered A… a pelvic exam? hesitates, fidgeting with her hands Well… I suppose so, Doctor. If it’s necessary. It’s just… a bit unnerving, to be honest. I haven’t had one of those in… a very long time. Is it going to be… painful? I apologize for all the questions. I just get… anxious easily.
DOCTOR: It is a standard procedure, Ms. Stepbro. And while it may be slightly uncomfortable, it shouldn't be painful. I will explain everything as I go, and you are free to stop me at any time if you feel distressed. Now, if you would please disrobe from the waist down and lie on the table. I'll need you to place your feet in the stirrups when you are ready. I will step out to allow you some privacy.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. looks down at her lap, then slowly begins to unbutton her skirt This is… a bit awkward. pause I do hope it doesn’t take too long. mumbles quietly I haven’t been this undressed in front of anyone in… goodness, a long time. pause I’ll… I’ll call out when I’m ready. pause Please, do come back soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepbro, I’m back. Let me know when you’re ready, and we’ll begin.
PATIENT: Clears throat quietly from behind the privacy screen I… I think I'm ready now, Doctor. Please, come in when you're ready. I’m a bit nervous, but I’ll try to cooperate. Just… please be gentle. pause And explain everything, as you said.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to start with a visual inspection of the external genitalia. Then, I will gently insert the speculum to examine the vagina and cervix. Please relax your muscles as much as possible. It will make the procedure easier, and less uncomfortable. Now, I'm going to gently separate the labia… I’m noting some mild redness of the labia, but no obvious lesions. Now, I will insert the speculum. There will be some pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. Hmm. The cervix appears slightly inflamed. There is some mild tenderness upon manipulation. No obvious masses or signs of infection. I'm going to take a sample for a Pap smear and a possible STI screening, given the inflammation. Alright, that’s all for the pelvic exam. I'm going to remove the speculum now. Now, I will perform an abdominal exam to assess for any tenderness or masses. Please lie flat on your back and let me know if anything feels painful. There is some mild tenderness in the lower left quadrant, consistent with your reported pain. No palpable masses. Your abdomen is otherwise soft and non-distended. Alright. That concludes the physical exam. I will send the samples to the lab for analysis. It will take a few days to get the results.
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That was… a bit more involved than I expected. adjusts herself on the examination table A few days, you say? What exactly are we looking for? And what does this inflammation mean? Is it… serious? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I just get so anxious when I don’t understand what’s happening. frowns, looking worried Is it something I should be concerned about?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to be anxious, Ms. Stepbro, but I assure you, there is no need for immediate alarm. The inflammation of the cervix could be due to a number of factors – a minor irritation, a mild infection, or even hormonal changes. The Pap smear will help us rule out any precancerous or cancerous cells. The STI screening will determine if there is any sexually transmitted infection causing the inflammation. We'll be looking for abnormal cells, signs of infection, and any other irregularities. It's a standard procedure, Ms. Stepbro. However, given your report of tenderness and the inflammation, I'm going to order a pelvic ultrasound to rule out any other potential causes, such as fibroids or ovarian cysts. It's a precautionary measure, to be thorough. We need to rule out anything serious. I also recommend a complete blood count to assess for any signs of infection. It’s important to have a complete picture before making any definitive diagnosis. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Nods slowly, looking overwhelmed Ultrasound… and a blood count… frowns, clutching the examination table Oh, goodness. It sounds… complicated. And a bit frightening, to be honest. pause What if it is something serious? What if it’s… cancer? I haven’t been feeling well lately, and now… shakes head, looking distressed I don't even know what fibroids or ovarian cysts are. voice trembling I wish I understood all of this. pause Are you… are you sure it’s not just… something minor? looks at the doctor pleadingly Is there anything I should be doing right now? fidgets with her hands, looking anxious
DOCTOR: Ms. Stepbro, please. It is far too early to jump to conclusions. The vast majority of cervical inflammation is not cancerous. And fibroids and ovarian cysts are often benign – non-cancerous growths that are quite common. We are simply being thorough to rule out all possibilities. Right now, there is absolutely no need to panic. We will have the results of the blood work within 24-48 hours, and the ultrasound can be scheduled for as early as tomorrow. Until then, I recommend you avoid sexual intercourse. I also want you to try to relax. Stress can worsen your symptoms. If you are experiencing any significant pain, you can take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. I understand you are anxious, but focusing on worst-case scenarios will only exacerbate your worries. We will address this one step at a time. Once we have the results of the tests, we can discuss the appropriate course of action. Do you have any specific questions about the tests themselves, or would you like me to schedule the ultrasound?
PATIENT: Takes a deep breath, trying to calm herself The ultrasound… yes, please. Schedule the ultrasound. And… what exactly does it show? pause What will they be looking for specifically? frowns, looking worried And… is there anything I should do to prepare for it? Do I need to drink a lot of water, or… anything like that? clutches her hands tightly I just… I wish I knew what was going on. voice trembling It’s just… everything is so confusing. And frightening. looks at the doctor pleadingly Is there any chance it could be… something else entirely? Something not… down there? Something… with my stomach, perhaps? fidgets with her hands, looking anxious
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepbro. Let’s address your concerns systematically. The ultrasound uses sound waves to create images of your pelvic organs – your uterus, ovaries, and cervix. It’s a non-invasive procedure. We’ll be looking for any abnormalities in size, shape, or structure. Specifically, we want to rule out fibroids, ovarian cysts, or any other masses. We'll also assess the thickness of the uterine lining. Regarding preparation, yes, you will need to drink approximately 32 ounces of water two hours prior to the ultrasound. A full bladder helps create a clearer image. You do not need to make any other special preparations. As for your question about your stomach, it’s possible that your symptoms are unrelated to your pelvic organs. However, given your reported pain and tenderness in the lower abdomen, it’s important to rule out any potential issues in your pelvis first. If the ultrasound is inconclusive, we may consider ordering additional tests, such as a CT scan of your abdomen, to assess your stomach and other organs. Right now, let's focus on getting the ultrasound scheduled. I will have my nurse arrange it for tomorrow morning. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any significant pain, fever, or vaginal bleeding, please contact the office immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Nods slowly, looking slightly less anxious Yes… I understand. Tomorrow morning… and drink 32 ounces of water. pause And a follow-up appointment next week. frowns, thinking hard What if… what if they do find something? What if it’s… serious? clutches her hands tightly Will I need surgery? Or… something else? voice trembling I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. I just… I’m so worried. looks at the doctor pleadingly Is there anything I can do right now to… prepare myself? Anything I can do to… make it better? fidgets with her hands, looking anxious Or… is there someone I can talk to? Someone who can help me with all of this? looks at the doctor hopefully
DOCTOR: Ms. Stepbro, I understand your anxiety, but at this point, speculating about potential outcomes is simply unproductive. We haven't even performed the ultrasound yet. It's crucial to gather information before jumping to conclusions. If the ultrasound reveals any abnormalities, we will discuss the appropriate course of action at your follow-up appointment. This may include further testing, medication, or, in some cases, surgery. However, it’s far too early to discuss these options at this stage. Regarding support, I can provide you with a referral to a counselor or therapist if you feel you need additional emotional support. However, I want to assure you that many of these concerns resolve themselves with minimal intervention. For now, I recommend focusing on relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation. Avoid unnecessary stress, and ensure you are getting adequate rest. Also, I will write you a prescription for a mild anti-anxiety medication to help you manage your symptoms until your follow-up appointment. My nurse will schedule you for the ultrasound and provide you with the necessary instructions. She will also give you the prescription for the anti-anxiety medication. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: Nods slowly, looking slightly relieved Anti-anxiety medication… yes, that would be helpful, thank you. pause And a referral to a counselor… yes, please. frowns, thinking hard I suppose… I suppose you’re right. It’s just… hard not to worry. clutches her hands tightly Is there anything… anything I should be doing to help my body heal? voice trembling Should I be eating anything special, or… taking any vitamins? looks at the doctor hopefully I just… I want to do everything I can to be prepared. clutches her hands tightly And… thank you, Doctor. For everything. looks at the doctor gratefully I really appreciate it. pause I think… I think that’s all. For now. looks at the doctor gratefully
DOCTOR: You are welcome, Ms. Stepbro. It’s important to remember that a healthy lifestyle can contribute to overall well-being. I recommend maintaining a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Ensuring adequate hydration is also crucial. Regarding vitamins, I recommend taking a daily multivitamin and a Vitamin D supplement. These can help support your immune system and overall health. However, there is no evidence to suggest that any specific diet or vitamin can directly “heal” your body. The most important thing you can do is to focus on managing your stress levels, getting adequate rest, and following my recommendations. My nurse will provide you with a list of resources, including information on local counseling services and healthy eating habits. She will also schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results of the ultrasound. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Shakes head slowly, looking slightly calmer No… I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor Pipkorn. You’ve been very helpful. pause I appreciate your patience. frowns, thinking hard I’ll… I’ll try to relax. And I’ll drink plenty of water. clutches her hands tightly And I’ll see my nurse. pause Thank you again. looks at the doctor gratefully <stage>Stands up slowly, looking slightly relieved. I think… I think I’m ready to go now. pause .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please let my nurse know if you have any further questions. Have a good day, Ms. Stepbro.
