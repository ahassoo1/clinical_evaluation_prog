DOCTOR: Alright, Kiante, good morning. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. I need a letter, actually. Just confirming that I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit of a long story, but I’m traveling soon and they need it for insurance reasons.
DOCTOR: A letter confirming you’re able to fly… Right. Well, insurance companies are getting more… particular these days. Still, I need to actually examine you before I can write such a letter, dear. I can’t just sign off on something without knowing what’s going on with your health. It's a liability, you understand. Tell me, have you been seeing anyone else for medical care recently?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely, I understand completely. No, not recently. Just… regular check-ups with my primary care doctor, Dr. Lee, a couple of times a year. Nothing major. I have Medicare, so they keep pretty close track of things. But it’s been… well, it's been a while since anything needed needing attention, you know? Mostly just routine stuff.
DOCTOR: "Routine stuff" can still be important, Kiante. Medicare does keep track, as you say, but I need to know what that "routine stuff" is. Any chronic conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing chronic. Honestly. Just… the usual. Blood pressure’s been a little high sometimes, but Dr. Lee said it's stress-related. And… well, my husband passed away last year. It's been difficult, and I think that’s contributing to it. Nothing they’ve put me on any medication for, though. I really don't have any ongoing health issues. I just want to make sure I can get this letter so I can go on this trip. It’s… important.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no chronic conditions, blood pressure occasionally elevated – attributed to stress, and a recent bereavement. I understand the trip is important, dear. But even with a clean history, I need to do a basic exam, just to be thorough. Let’s start with your blood pressure, just to get a baseline. And I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I appreciate you being thorough. Go ahead, please. It’s… it’s a bit silly, worrying about this, but the airline is being very strict.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm for me… And breathe normally. Okay… 142 over 90. A bit elevated, as you said, but not terribly concerning given your recent loss and the stress. Heart sounds are… regular, a little fast perhaps, but no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or swelling in your legs?
PATIENT: No chest pain at all. And no shortness of breath. Sometimes I feel a little dizzy when I stand up too quickly, but that’s been happening for years, honestly. And… no swelling in my legs. I walk a lot, I think that helps. I try to stay active. Just a little lightheaded sometimes, that's all.
DOCTOR: Lightheadedness… could be postural hypotension, as you say. Walking helps, good. Any history of blood clots, or varicose veins?
PATIENT: No, no history of blood clots. And no varicose veins, thankfully. My mother had them, so I’m always a little careful, but I haven’t had any problems myself. I try to avoid sitting for long periods. I mostly just want this letter so I can get on with the trip. It's… a trip to see my sister. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Very well. Look, I'm not trying to be difficult, Kiante. But a letter confirming fitness to fly is a serious matter. It’s not just about signing a piece of paper. It’s about ensuring your safety. Given your blood pressure, even if it is stress-related, and the occasional lightheadedness, I'm going to need a simple EKG, just to rule out anything concerning. It's a quick procedure, and it will give me peace of mind before I write that letter. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly sensible. If it will give you peace of mind, I’m happy to do it. I understand completely. Just… how long will it take? I have a flight to catch in a few days, and I’d like to get this sorted as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: Good. It will only take a few minutes. The technician is just down the hall, room 3. I'll review the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: I'm not taking any medications at all, Doctor. Not even over-the-counter things regularly. Sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, but that’s it. Really. Nothing prescribed, nothing for blood pressure, nothing at all. Just… vitamins occasionally.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. Very well. The technician will be with you shortly to perform the EKG. Once that's done, I'll take a look at the results and we'll discuss next steps. Try to relax, and don't worry too much. It's likely just stress. Room 3, as I said.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. I’ll go down to room 3 now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me know when you're finished with the EKG. People and their letters…
PATIENT: .
