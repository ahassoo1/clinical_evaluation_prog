DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time for chatting. It's this…stomach thing. Food comes back up, you know? Reflux, the wife calls it. It's bothersome, that’s all. Just want something to make it stop.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I understand you’re experiencing some discomfort with food coming back up, what your wife refers to as reflux. We’ll certainly try to get to the bottom of this and find a solution. To help me understand the situation better, could you describe this “stomach thing” in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? What detail do you need? I eat, sometimes it bubbles up. It tastes…bad. Like the food, only…worse. Happens after I eat, usually. Not every time, mind you. And it’s worse when I lie down. Is that enough detail for you? Honestly, I'm a busy man.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Altine, that is helpful. Thank you for clarifying. The fact that it’s worse when you lie down is particularly relevant. When you say “bubbles up,” is this a sudden, forceful event, or more of a slow, gradual rising sensation?
PATIENT: Forceful? Gradual? What am I, a scientist? It…comes up. Sometimes it's quicker, sometimes it takes a bit. It’s not pleasant either way, believe me. Look, I eat a normal diet, mostly. Steak, potatoes, things a grown man eats. I don’t go eating spicy food or anything fancy. It just…happens. Do you need me to draw you a picture?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Altine, a picture isn't necessary. I apologize if my questions seem overly detailed; I'm simply trying to gather as much information as possible to understand what’s going on. Could you tell me approximately how often this happens?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. How often? A couple times a week, maybe? Sometimes more if I’ve had a big meal. It’s unpredictable, alright? Look, it’s not constant. It’s just annoying. I don’t need a detailed log of every bite I take, Doctor. Just tell me what pill to take to make it stop. My wife keeps telling me to come, but I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. It sounds quite disruptive to your routine. Before recommending any medication, I do need to ask a few more questions to ensure we’re addressing the correct issue and to rule out anything more serious. It's important to be thorough. Have you noticed any other symptoms associated with this, such as difficulty swallowing, chest pain, unintentional weight loss, or a persistent cough?
PATIENT: Persistent cough? What are you implying? I’m a perfectly healthy man for my age! A little indigestion doesn’t mean I’m falling apart, you know. No, no cough, no weight loss, and I can swallow just fine, thank you very much. Look, I'm a big guy. Always have been. I eat well. This is just…a thing that’s started happening recently. A nuisance, really. Are we getting anywhere, or are we just going to keep asking questions all day?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Altine. You mentioned this started recently. Approximately how long ago did you first notice this occurring?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… three months? Around the time the garden started really taking off, actually. Lots of tomatoes that year. Maybe it was the acidity? My wife said something about that. But honestly, I don't recall exactly. Three months-ish. Is that specific enough for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Altine, that is helpful. About three months. Now, have you tried anything yourself to alleviate the symptoms?
PATIENT: Alleviate? What do you mean? I… I sit up straight after I eat, if that's what you're asking. My wife says that helps. And I try not to eat right before bed. That's about it. I'm not one for taking a lot of pills, you know. Always preferred a good, strong cup of coffee to fix things. Though that doesn't exactly help with the stomach thing, does it? Honestly, I'm a practical man. I don't believe in fussing over every little ache and pain.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your practicality, Mr. Altine. Given what you’ve described, and the fact it’s been occurring for about three months, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. This will allow me to listen to your abdomen and check for any other potential issues. It’s fairly routine. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I really don't have all day. But don't expect me to be comfortable with a lot of poking and prodding. I'm a big man, remember? And I bruise easily. Do I need to take my shoes off? Honestly, this is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: No shoes off necessary, Mr. Altine. I assure you, it will be a quick and gentle examination. Please lie back on the examination table, and I’ll begin by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. I'm not detecting any significant tenderness or masses. Your bowel sounds are present, though slightly diminished. I’ll also check your throat briefly. Please open your mouth and say “ah.” Your throat appears normal. Given your symptoms and the physical exam, it sounds most likely to be gastroesophageal reflux disease, commonly known as GERD. However, given your age, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a simple blood test to check your hemoglobin levels and rule out any anemia, and a stool test to check for any signs of bleeding. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood test and… stool test? Really? Now you’re just being difficult. Look, I told you I’m perfectly healthy. But fine. If it gets me out of here faster, do your tests. Just… don't expect a parade when the results come back normal. And send the results to my wife’s email. She handles all that paperwork. Her address is… well, she’ll tell you. Just get it done. I have a garden to tend to. Are we finally finished?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Altine, we are getting there. I will have the lab requisition forms prepared for you and will make sure your wife’s email is noted for the results. The lab is located just down the hall. In the meantime, I can offer some initial recommendations for managing your symptoms. I suggest avoiding large meals, especially before bedtime, and elevating the head of your bed by about six inches. Over-the-counter antacids can provide temporary relief. If your symptoms don’t improve with these measures, or if they worsen, we will discuss further treatment options, such as prescription medications. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Elevate the head of the bed…antacids… fine. Anything to avoid more tests. Just…tell me what kind of antacids. And don't give me anything with chalk in it. I hate the taste of chalk. My wife gets the good ones, the fruity flavored ones. I'll let her pick them up. Honestly, I'm a simple man. I don't need a fancy treatment plan. Just something to stop the bubbling. Alright, I think that’s everything. Can I go now? I really need to get back to my tomatoes. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. Any over-the-counter H2 blocker or proton pump inhibitor would be suitable. These generally come in tablet or capsule form. We can discuss specific brands with your wife when she comes in to pick up the results. Here are the lab forms. Please take them to the lab technician down the hall. Thank you for your patience, and I hope you feel better soon. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. .
