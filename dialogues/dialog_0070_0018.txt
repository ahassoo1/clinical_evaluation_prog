DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Please, call me Westly. It’s… a pleasure to meet you too. Let me see… what brings me in… Ah, yes. It’s this… needing to go to the bathroom quite often. More than usual, you understand. It’s a bit bothersome, really. I’m not entirely certain why it’s happening, to be honest. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Westly. “Needing to go to the bathroom quite often, more than usual,” and it started recently. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Recently… hmm. That’s difficult to say precisely. Perhaps… a month or so? It’s all a bit of a blur, I’m afraid. It’s not painful, not at all. Just… frequent. I find myself… preoccupied with it, if you take my meaning. Especially at night. I’ve had to get up a few times, which isn't ideal, you understand.
DOCTOR: A month or so, and it’s frequent, not painful, but causing some disruption, particularly at night. That’s helpful to know, Westly. When you say frequent, could you estimate how often you're needing to go to the bathroom during the day, and how many times overnight?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Estimating… that is difficult. During the day… let me think. Perhaps every two or three hours? It varies, you see. And at night… goodness. Two or three times, I believe. Sometimes more. It’s… hard to keep track. I don't measure these things, Doctor. I simply… notice it. Is that… problematic?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Westly. You don’t need to measure, just your best estimate is fine. So, roughly every two to three hours during the day and two to three times at night. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, smell, or any difficulty starting or stopping the flow?
PATIENT: Ah, good question. Let me see… colour… I suppose it looks normal enough. A pale yellow, as one would expect. Smell… I haven't paid much attention, I must confess. I don’t recall anything unusual, but I wouldn’t be able to say definitively. And difficulty… no, no trouble starting or stopping. It flows as it should. A steady stream, you understand. I’ve not noticed anything amiss in that regard.
DOCTOR: Good. Normal color, no unusual smell, and a steady stream. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with this increased frequency?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me ponder that for a moment. Now, my thirst… I have been rather thirsty lately. More so than usual, perhaps. And I find myself… a little fatigued, if I’m being honest. Not terribly so, but lacking my usual pep, you understand. Nothing dramatic, simply… a bit run down. And… now that I think about it, my appetite hasn’t been quite what it once was. I’m not eating as much, but I assumed that was simply… a summer thing.
DOCTOR: Increased thirst, some fatigue, and a decreased appetite. Thank you, Westly. This is all very helpful. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems, or kidney issues?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh dear. That’s another area where my recollections are… hazy. I believe I’ve always been reasonably healthy, to be frank. I don't think I have diabetes. I haven’t been told, you see. Heart problems… no, never diagnosed. My father had some issues in his later years, but I don't believe I inherited anything. Kidney issues… no, nothing specific comes to mind. I had a bout of something when I was a boy, but it was a long time ago, and I don’t recall the details. I do see a specialist for my blood pressure, occasionally, but it’s well-controlled, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright, reasonably healthy, no known diabetes or heart problems, occasional specialist visits for blood pressure, which is well-controlled. Do you take any medications regularly, other than what you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, the blood pressure medication. A small, white pill, once a day. Let me see… other medications… No, I don’t believe so. Nothing regularly, you understand. I occasionally take something for a bit of indigestion, but that’s as needed, you see. A simple antacid. Nothing more. I prefer to avoid medications whenever possible, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Alright, blood pressure medication daily, and antacids as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Now that you mention it… I seem to recall a slight reaction to penicillin when I was a young man. A rash, I believe. But it was a long time ago, and I’ve never had any trouble with it since. Other than that… No, I don’t have any known allergies. I can eat anything, generally.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy, noted. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. That’s a bit difficult, you see. My parents are both… no longer with us. And I wasn’t terribly close to my extended family, if I’m being honest. My mother had… some sort of arthritis, I believe. And my father… well, as I mentioned earlier, he had some heart trouble in his later years. Other than that… I don’t recall anything specific. We didn’t discuss these things much, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, mother with arthritis, father with heart trouble. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I’ve never been one for smoking, never touched a cigarette in my life. And alcohol… I occasionally enjoy a small glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a week. But that’s it, you understand. Very moderate. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. I’ve never had any interest in such things. A quiet life suits me perfectly well.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, occasional small glass of wine, no recreational drugs. Thank you, Westly. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick abdominal exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Blood pressure, heart and lungs… abdominal exam. Yes, go right ahead. I trust your judgment implicitly. I’m in your capable hands, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, Westly. Your blood pressure is 138 over 82, heart rate is a bit elevated at 88, but your lungs sound clear. Your abdomen feels normal, but your bladder is quite full. I’m going to have you empty your bladder and then we can recheck. After that, I'd like to order a simple urine test to check for infection, sugar, and protein. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Full bladder, you say? Perhaps that explains a few things. I’ll go and empty it now. A urine test, you say? To check for infection, sugar and protein… yes, that sounds prudent. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Alright, Westly, thank you. Now, if you could provide me with a urine sample, we'll get that sent off to the lab. I’ll be right back with a collection cup.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. I’m ready whenever you are. A urine sample… yes, perfectly reasonable. I’ve been trying to drink a bit less fluid in anticipation. Hopefully, there will be enough.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Just a small sample is fine, Westly. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample for the most accurate results. I’ll give you a moment of privacy. Just leave the sample on the counter when you're finished, and I'll send it to the lab.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Mid-stream… yes, I remember that from… somewhere. Privacy appreciated, Doctor. There you are. On the counter, as requested. A mid-stream sample, to the best of my recollection.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Westly. I’ve sent the sample off to the lab. It should take a couple of days to get the results back. While we’re waiting, let's discuss some possibilities. Based on your symptoms – the increased frequency, thirst, fatigue, and elevated heart rate – and pending the lab results, we need to consider a few things. One possibility is diabetes. Another could be a urinary tract infection, although you don’t have any pain or fever, which makes that less likely. It could also be related to your blood pressure medication. We’ll know more once the lab results are back. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to monitor your fluid intake and try to avoid sugary drinks. If you develop any fever, pain, or difficulty urinating, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Diabetes… yes, that’s what my wife always worried about. She was very health-conscious, you understand. A urinary tract infection… well, that doesn’t sound terribly pleasant. And the blood pressure medication… perhaps that is it. It is a relatively new prescription, after all. Monitoring my fluid intake, avoiding sugary drinks… yes, perfectly sensible. And contacting the clinic if I develop a fever or pain… yes, of course. I suppose we simply have to wait for the results now. It's frustrating not knowing, you understand, but I trust your judgment, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Westly. It’s always best to have a clear answer. We'll get to the bottom of this. In the meantime, if you are particularly worried, or if your symptoms worsen significantly, please don't hesitate to call. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from today, once we have the lab results, to discuss the findings and plan accordingly. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: A follow-up appointment in a week… yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I appreciate you being so thorough, Doctor. It puts my mind at ease knowing you’re taking everything so seriously. I suppose there’s not much else to do but wait now, is there? Thank you again for your time and patience. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It's a comfort to have a doctor who takes the time to listen, you understand.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Westly. That’s what I’m here for. I’ll have the receptionist schedule that follow-up appointment for you. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You as well. A good day to you. .
