DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. MinerD. Doyle Pitmon, pleasure. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good morning to you too, I guess. It's… well, my face is kinda puffed up. And my legs. They’re swollen. It’s been going on for a bit now, honestly. Not sure what to make of it. Feels… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Uncomfortable, alright. “A bit now” is… how long exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. Time… slips away, you know? Let's see… maybe a month? Six weeks? Something like that. Hard to say, really. I don’t keep track of these things. My wife used to… handle all that. But she’s gone now. So. Yeah. A while. It just started getting worse this past week, I think. Is it serious? I really don’t have the energy for a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: Right. A month, six weeks… and getting worse this past week. I see. Well, swelling like that can be a number of things. It's good you're noticing it, and good you came in. Before we get to “serious,” let’s try to pinpoint it a bit better. Besides the face and legs, have you noticed any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Hmm… not really. I get a little winded walking up the stairs, but I always have. Old age, I suppose. I haven't been doing much walking lately, to be honest. Mostly just sit around… watch the television. Not like I’m running marathons or anything. I don’t understand what you’re getting at, though. What would shortness of breath mean? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: It could mean a lot of things, Mr. MinerD. Don't get ahead of yourself. Shortness of breath, in this situation, could point to fluid retention – which is why I ask about the swelling. It can be linked to the heart, kidneys, even just… gravity if you've been sitting for long periods. Now, have you noticed any changes in how much you urinate?
PATIENT: Urinate? Well… I go to the bathroom, of course. Like everybody else. I don’t know, maybe a little less than usual? But I drink less coffee now, too. Used to drink a whole pot a day. Doctor told me to cut back. I don’t pay much attention to how much I go. Honestly, I just go when I need to go. Is that… is that a problem? I don't understand why you need to know all this.
DOCTOR: It's helpful, Mr. MinerD. It helps me figure out why you’re swollen. Less urination can mean your kidneys aren’t functioning optimally, which can also cause swelling. Right. Let’s move on. Any chest pain or palpitations – a feeling like your heart is racing or skipping beats?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Not really. A little… discomfort sometimes, a tightness. But I get that when I bend over, too. Old age, probably. And my heart… well, it beats, doesn’t it? I mean, what’s there to say about a heart? It just… beats. Look, I'm telling you, I just feel puffy. My face and legs are swollen, and it's annoying. I'm not a complicated case, am I? I don’t need all these questions. I just want something to make it go away.
DOCTOR: Mr. MinerD, I understand you’re frustrated, but I need to gather information to determine the cause of your swelling. Dismissing symptoms as "old age" isn’t helpful, and it isn’t safe. A racing heart, chest discomfort, changes in urination... these are important clues. Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your legs. It will only take a few minutes. Can I do that?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don’t tell me I have something serious. I don't have the… the stamina for a lot of complications. And don't expect me to remember everything you tell me, alright? My memory’s not what it used to be. Just… listen to your heart and lungs or whatever. Hurry up, though. I have television to watch.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Hmm. A bit muffled. And some… slight crackles in the lungs, particularly on the lower lobes. Pitting edema, as I suspected. Moderate, bilateral. Okay. Now, have you had any recent weight gain?
