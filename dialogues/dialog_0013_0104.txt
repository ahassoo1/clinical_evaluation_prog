DOCTOR: Hi Tammie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Throat. It hurts. Been hurting. I don’t have… time for this, really. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're short on time, and we'll try to be as efficient as possible. But just to get a good picture of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this throat pain?
PATIENT: It’s… scratchy. Like something is stuck. And it makes it hard to… swallow. I don’t remember how long it’s been hurting, exactly. A while. It just… is. Is that helpful? Honestly, I don't keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: That’s okay, we'll figure it out. "A while" is a good start. Has anything made it worse – like drinking something cold, or talking a lot?
PATIENT: Talking, maybe. I have to talk for my job, you know. Lots of shouting. And… dust. It's a dirty job. Everything makes it worse, probably. I told you, I don't pay attention to details. It just… hurts when I use my throat. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: Okay, shouting and dust exposure… that gives me a little more to work with. Any fever, chills, or body aches that you've noticed alongside the throat pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No. I don’t check for fevers. Why would I? I’m a worker, not a… a thermometer. Chills… sometimes I feel a little cold, but that’s just the air conditioning at the factory. Everything is always too cold. Honestly, I feel tired, but that’s just… life. Is this going anywhere? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever or chills. Just the sore throat, scratchiness, difficulty swallowing, worsened by talking and dust, with some fatigue. Have you noticed any cough, runny nose, or postnasal drip at all?
PATIENT: Cough? Sometimes. A little. Not a bad cough. Just… a tickle. And…no. I don't know what 'postnasal drip' even is. Is that something bad? Look, I'm not a doctor, alright? I just feel sick and my throat hurts. Can we just… get this over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant cough or postnasal drip. I understand your frustration, Tammie, and we will get this over with. Just a few more questions, and then we’ll do a quick exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I've taken pills before, never had a problem. And…no. No fancy medical… things. I work. I don't sit around getting diagnosed. My husband… he did all that. And now… well. I just need something for my throat. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or medical conditions. I understand. Let's do a quick exam of your throat, just to take a look and see what’s going on. It will only take a minute. Can you open your mouth for me, please, and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: There. Happy? Can we be done now? This is ridiculous. It just hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some redness and a little swelling. Your tonsils look a bit inflamed. No obvious white patches or pus at this moment. I'm also going to gently feel your neck to check for any swollen lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes are a little tender, but not significantly enlarged. It sounds like you may have some pharyngitis—inflammation of the throat. Most likely, it’s a viral infection, but we should rule out strep throat just to be safe. Would you be okay with a quick strep test?
PATIENT: Strep? What’s… strep? Another thing I have to worry about? Look, I don't have time for tests. I need to get back to work. Can't you just give me something for the pain? A pill? A spray? Anything? I don't need a… a test. It just hurts. And frankly, I don’t trust doctors much anyway. All they do is poke and prod.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Tammie. A strep test is a quick swab of the back of your throat—it tells us if it’s a bacterial infection that needs antibiotics. If it's viral, antibiotics won’t help, and we can focus on managing your symptoms. It will only take a few minutes. However, I respect your wishes. Without knowing if it’s strep, I can’t prescribe antibiotics. We can treat your symptoms with supportive care. I can recommend a throat lozenge for the pain, suggest over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, and advise you to drink plenty of fluids. Are you able to get those things over the counter?
PATIENT: Fine. Pills are okay. I can get pills. I suppose. But if it doesn’t get better… I don't know what I’ll do. My husband always… he always took care of these things. Lozenge, pills… fluids. Alright. Just… tell me what I need and let me leave. I have a shift starting soon. Is there anything else? Please, just tell me.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, I recommend over-the-counter throat lozenges as needed for pain relief. You can also take ibuprofen or acetaminophen, following the directions on the package, for pain and fever, if you develop one. Most importantly, drink plenty of fluids – water, tea, broth. Rest your voice as much as possible. I’m going to write down some instructions for you. If your symptoms worsen – high fever, difficulty breathing, severe pain that doesn’t improve with medication – please seek medical attention immediately. Do you have any questions about this?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… pain, pills, fluids. I got it. Look, thank you. I need to go now. Really. This has taken long enough.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please take care of yourself, Tammie. And don’t hesitate to seek help if things get worse. Have a better day. .
