DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Alanes. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's a bit embarrassing, to be honest, but I've noticed a change in my body odor. It's not…normal for me, and it started a few weeks ago, maybe a month. It's just…different. I can’t really describe it, but I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're addressing this, Kerriann. It's certainly not embarrassing to seek medical attention for something that’s concerning you. Changes in body odor can sometimes indicate an underlying issue, so it's wise to investigate. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit more about this change?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, usually I don’t really have much of an odor at all, if that makes sense? I mean, everyone sweats, of course, but it doesn't usually smell like…anything. Now, it's…stronger, and it's not my usual smell. It’s kind of…sour, I think? And it seems to be more noticeable even after I shower. I've tried different soaps, even those antibacterial ones, but it doesn’t really help. It's happening all over, I guess – under my arms, but also just generally. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Kerriann. A change from your usual body odor, especially one that persists despite hygiene efforts, is definitely worth looking into. You mentioned it’s happening more generally, not just under your arms – could you elaborate on that a bit?
PATIENT: Well, it’s hard to explain exactly. It’s not like a specific spot except my underarms. It's just…when I move around, or after I’ve been working, I can smell it on me. Like, if I lift my arms after laying floor, I notice it more. And my clothes seem to pick it up faster than they used to, even after just one day. It's not a bad smell, exactly, just…different and more noticeable. I’ve been wondering if it's something I’m eating, maybe? I haven’t really changed my diet much, but…you know, things happen.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it's a more generalized odor that seems to be exacerbated with activity, and you've noticed it's becoming more apparent on your clothing. It's good you're considering dietary factors – those can certainly play a role. Let’s go through a bit of your medical history to see if anything might be contributing. Have you had any recent illnesses, fevers, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that recently. I had a little cold back in April, but that was quick, just a few days. No fever or anything. And no night sweats, definitely not. I sleep pretty soundly, actually. I do have a bit of arthritis in my knees, which flares up sometimes, but that’s been pretty stable lately. Oh, and I was divorced about five years ago, if that matters. That was…stressful, but it’s all settled now. I haven’t been sick otherwise, no. Just the arthritis, really. And the divorce, but that’s not a sickness, is it?
DOCTOR: No, divorce isn't a sickness, Kerriann, but significant life stressors can sometimes manifest physically. Thank you for sharing that. Now, in terms of past medical history, have you been diagnosed with any other conditions – diabetes, thyroid problems, kidney issues, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve had the usual check-ups over the years, and everything was always fine. I get my blood pressure checked regularly, and it's usually good. The doctor always said I was healthy, just needed to watch my weight a little. I am on Medicare now, so they keep pretty close track of things, I think. No thyroid issues, no diabetes, nothing like that. I’ve never had any problems with my kidneys, as far as I know. Honestly, I’ve been pretty lucky with my health, until this body odor thing. It’s just…unsettling, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand it’s unsettling, and you’re right to want to get to the bottom of it. It's good to hear you've been generally healthy. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries or hospital stays. Nothing like that. I broke my wrist when I was a kid, maybe eight years old, but it healed up fine, just a cast for a few weeks. That’s it, really. No major medical issues, no procedures, nothing. I’m pretty careful, I guess. I try to stay active with my work, but I don't do anything too risky. Oh! Except when I got my wisdom teeth out when I was eighteen, but that was a long time ago and everything was fine. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That doesn't count as a major surgery, Kerriann. Just routine. It’s good to know you haven’t had any significant medical procedures. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, thyroid problems, or anything else that’s common?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, and she also had arthritis, like me. She passed away a few years ago, but she was pretty healthy overall. My father, he had heart problems, and he had a stroke when he was older. He was a smoker, though, so I always figured that was the main cause. My brother, he's pretty healthy too, as far as I know. No diabetes or thyroid problems on either side of the family, as far as I'm aware. Everyone just gets old, I guess. Nothing really jumps out as being a major concern, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure and heart disease, but nothing else immediately relevant. That's helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never smoked a day in my life. My mother always warned me about it, and I just never started. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, maybe once a week, but that’s it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I'm a floor layer, I need a clear head for that! It’s pretty physical work, and I need to be focused. I don't have time for any of that.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. So, minimal alcohol consumption, no smoking or drug use. Now, are you taking any medications currently, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not taking any regular medications. I take ibuprofen sometimes for my arthritis, when it flares up, but that’s it. Just over-the-counter stuff, nothing prescribed. And no supplements, vitamins, or anything like that. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly, so I don’t really feel the need for anything extra. I just…want this body odor thing to go away. It’s really bothering me.
DOCTOR: I understand. And we will try to get to the bottom of it. Okay, one last question about your allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat whatever I want, no problems. I’ve never had any trouble with pollen or dust or anything like that, either. I'm pretty lucky, really. Except maybe cats. I sneeze a little around cats, but it’s not a serious allergy, just a little sneezing. It doesn’t bother me much, so I don’t even think about it. But no major allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, Kerriann, that’s very helpful. Thank you for providing me with all of that information. It sounds like you’re generally a very healthy individual, which is great. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s causing this, and hopefully get rid of it. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll take a look at your skin, and I’ll do a quick neurological exam. I’ll also take your blood pressure and temperature. Your heart and lungs sound clear, which is good. Now, let me take a look at your skin. Your skin appears normal – no rashes or unusual markings. Blood pressure is 128/78, which is within the normal range. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and coordination. Your reflexes and coordination are also normal. Everything appears to be physically within normal limits. Given your history and the physical exam, it’s unlikely that there’s a serious underlying medical cause for the change in your body odor. However, it’s still important to investigate further. I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying metabolic issues, such as kidney or liver dysfunction. I'll also order a urine analysis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever tests you think are necessary. I’m happy to do them. I just want to get this figured out. Blood tests and a urine analysis, alright. Do you need me to fast beforehand, or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Yes, for the blood tests, I'd like you to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks, except for water. We'll schedule those for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. The urine analysis can be done any time, but it's best to do it first thing in the morning as well. In the meantime, I’d also like you to keep a detailed log of your diet and any activities you do that seem to worsen the odor. Also, please note if you notice any changes in your usual hygiene products, or if you’ve started using any new soaps, detergents, or lotions. It's possible that this is simply a result of a change in your body chemistry, or a reaction to something you're using. But it’s best to rule out any other potential causes. Once we have the results of the blood tests and urine analysis, we can discuss the next steps. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a good plan. Fast for 8-12 hours, log my diet and activities, and note any changes in hygiene products. I can definitely do that. 8:00 AM tomorrow for the blood tests, alright. Thank you, Dr. Alanes. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for running the tests. I just hope we can figure this out. It's a little embarrassing, but I'm glad I came in.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. It's my job to listen, and I understand it can be embarrassing to discuss these things. It's good you came in, and we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of it. I’ll have the lab order printed out for you, and the nurse will give you instructions on how to prepare for the blood tests. I also want you to know that if the odor becomes suddenly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms, such as fever, chills, or weight loss, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just…wait for the test results, log my diet and activities, and call if anything changes. Okay. Thank you again, Dr. Alanes. I feel a little better just knowing we’re looking into it. I’ll see you next week, I guess, after the tests come back?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. I'm glad I could help. Yes, let’s plan to review the results next week. The nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for you before you leave. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good rest of your day, and try not to worry too much. It was nice meeting you.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you too, Dr. Alanes. Thank you for everything. Have a good day!
