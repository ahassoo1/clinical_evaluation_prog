DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. I am Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, my… it’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, it’s… it’s my tummy, really. It’s been giving me quite a bit of trouble, a sharp pain down low. It comes and goes, but when it’s here, it is here, you know? I believe it has something to do with… the condition I have. The one with… the immune system? It's awfully difficult to keep track of everything these days.
DOCTOR: "The condition with the immune system"... I see. And how long has this "tummy trouble," as you call it, been occurring?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. It feels like… a while now. Not constant, certainly. More like… episodes. A few weeks at a time, maybe? It’s hard to say exactly. My memory isn’t what it used to be, I’m afraid. I do remember it was particularly bad around… well, I can’t recall when, precisely. Earlier this year, I think? Though it could have been last year. Everything feels a bit… blurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you describe the pain more precisely?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… It’s… a cramping sort of pain, mostly. A deep ache, really. And it's low down, as I said. Like… right here. It feels… like it’s twisting, almost. And sometimes… it radiates. Goes off to my… back, I suppose. It isn’t… a mild discomfort, Doctor. It truly takes my breath away when it flares up. Do you… need me to be more specific? I apologize if I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No, that’s… adequate for now. Has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s another tricky one. I haven’t noticed anything consistent, no. Sometimes it comes after… exertion, perhaps? Though I try to take it easy. Other times, it seems to just… arrive. I haven't changed my diet, or anything like that. It's really quite baffling, to be honest. I suppose stress could be a factor? Though it’s hard to pinpoint, you understand. Life has its… moments. Is there something I should be looking for, Doctor? Perhaps a certain food or activity?
DOCTOR: I see here you have a history of… lupus. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Lupus, that’s it. The autoimmune… condition. It’s been… a long journey, managing that. A very long journey. It flares up from time to time, and then quiets down. I take… medication, of course. Several things, actually. Though I must admit, I’m not entirely sure what they all do. My doctor – the previous doctor – explained it all very thoroughly, but… well, things slip my mind these days. So yes, lupus. I believe this tummy trouble is… connected to that, somehow. Is it not?
DOCTOR: It could be. Lupus can affect the gastrointestinal system. Now, could you list the medications you are currently taking, if you can recall?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That is a challenge. Let me think… There’s… a white pill, I believe. And a blue capsule. And… something small, orange, that I take in the morning. I’m so sorry, Doctor. It's awfully difficult to keep track. I have a pill organizer, but sometimes… I forget to fill it properly, or I take it at the wrong time. I believe one of them is for the inflammation… and another one is to suppress… something? Honestly, I rely heavily on my daughter to help me manage things. She’s quite good at it. Is there a way to get a list from… the pharmacy, perhaps? That would be much easier, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can certainly obtain a list from the pharmacy. I will have the nurse do that. In the meantime, let’s proceed with a physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I need to palpate your abdomen to assess the source of the pain.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you think that’s best, Doctor. It's a bit high for me, isn't it? But I shall manage. Just let me know if I need assistance, please. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: We have a step stool if that would be helpful, Ms. Glymph. And please, do not hesitate to let me know if you require any assistance at all. Alright, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain, and where, specifically. We'll start here, in the lower right quadrant. Does that cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, that is kind of you to offer the stool! Thank you. Yes… hmm. Oh, yes, that… that is where it hurts. Not terribly, but… a definite discomfort. A cramping sort of ache, spreading outwards. It’s… difficult to pinpoint exactly. It feels… deep, you understand? Not on the surface. Is that… normal? I’m so sorry if I’m being unhelpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s… tender. A bit more so than before, I think. Still a cramping ache, but… sharper. It almost feels like… a pulling sensation. It's difficult to describe, truly. And… oh, goodness, now I'm feeling a bit… lightheaded. Perhaps I should sit up? I haven’t felt quite this… unsteady in a while.
DOCTOR: Yes, let’s sit you up. Your pulse is a little elevated. And you do appear somewhat pale. Ms. Glymph, given your history of lupus, abdominal pain, and current symptoms, I’m concerned about a possible flare-up. It could also indicate something more serious, such as a bowel obstruction or even a perforation. We need to run some tests to determine the cause of your pain. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a C-reactive protein level, and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A CT scan… that sounds rather… serious. A perforation? That doesn’t sound pleasant at all. If you think it's necessary, Doctor, then… then yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just… I do hope it’s not something too dreadful. I’m not feeling very strong, as you can see. The blood tests… are those painful? And how long will this all take? I have a… a book club meeting on Thursday, you see. A small thing, but… I wouldn’t want to disappoint the others.
DOCTOR: The blood tests are minimally invasive, just a small prick of a needle. As for the CT scan, it's a relatively quick procedure – about 20-30 minutes – and doesn’t require any special preparation. It uses X-rays, so there is a small amount of radiation, but it's within acceptable limits. As for your book club meeting, we’ll do our best to get these results back as quickly as possible, but I can't make any promises. Your health is the priority, Ms. Glymph. We need to determine the cause of your pain and get you the appropriate treatment. I’m going to order an IV bag of fluids while we wait for results to rehydrate you as well. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now, and we'll get you scheduled for the CT scan immediately after that. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh, contrast dye… hmm. That’s… another thing I can’t quite recall. I’ve had so many tests over the years, you see. I believe… I might have reacted to something once, years ago. A rash, perhaps? It wasn’t terribly serious, but they had to stop the test. Or perhaps that was something else entirely. My memory is… frustratingly unreliable, Doctor. I truly don’t know. It’s best to err on the side of caution, I suppose. Perhaps my daughter knows? She keeps a rather detailed record of my medical history. She’ll be terribly worried, you know, to hear all this.
DOCTOR: Alright. We will proceed as if you do have an allergy to contrast dye. The radiology department will use a non-contrast CT scan, which is less detailed, but safer. And we’ll have the nurse contact your daughter. Ms. Glymph, while we wait for the results, and as a precaution, I’m going to admit you to the hospital for observation. We can monitor your vital signs closely and provide you with any necessary pain relief. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… admit me? A hospital… it’s been… a long time since I’ve been in the hospital. I prefer to be at home, if possible. I do worry about… everything. Germs, and noise, and… not being comfortable. But… if you think it's necessary, Doctor… then yes, I suppose. If it will help determine what’s wrong… then I shall cooperate. Just… please, let my daughter know immediately. She’ll want to come right away. And… is there any chance this could be a false alarm? Perhaps it's just… indigestion? A bad dream, even? It sounds silly, I know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Glymph, while it's possible this could be something less serious, your symptoms and history warrant a cautious approach. I understand your concerns about being admitted, and we'll do everything we can to make you comfortable. I’ll speak with the nurse immediately about arranging a quiet room, and we can minimize any disruptions. As for a false alarm, we won't know for certain until we have the results of the tests. I want to rule out anything serious, and that requires observation and a thorough workup. The nurse will come in shortly to start an IV, and we'll get the tests underway. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… please, keep my daughter informed. She’s… a very practical woman. She'll know what to ask. And… thank you, Doctor. For your patience, and for taking care of me. It’s… unsettling, being unwell, and not knowing what’s wrong. I suppose… I’ll just wait, then. And hope for the best. It’s all one can do, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be with you shortly. Please do not hesitate to call if you experience any changes in your symptoms. .
