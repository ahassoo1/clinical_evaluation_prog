DOCTOR: Hi Evann, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It is nice to meet you as well. I… believe I’m here to discuss some paperwork, if you will. Something about… planning for the future, should I become unable to make decisions for myself? It was… highly recommended to me. I confess, my memory isn't what it once was, so I don’t recall the precise name of the document. It had to do with… wishes, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re referring to advance care planning – things like a living will or durable power of attorney for healthcare. It’s very responsible of you to think about this now. It's completely normal to feel a little overwhelmed by it, and it’s great you’re getting it sorted. To make sure we cover everything, let’s start with a little bit about your overall health. Have you been seen by a doctor regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly… yes, I suppose so. Though, truthfully, it feels rather… fragmented. I’ve had check-ups, of course. Just… the details escape me. I do have private insurance, if that helps? And I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle… within reason. I’m an etcher, you see – very precise work. Requires a steady hand, and… focus. But I’m afraid my recollections are… hazy, at best. Is there a particular doctor you’d like me to recall? Perhaps if you give me a timeframe…?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, fragmented is understandable. Knowing you have private insurance is helpful, and being an etcher does suggest good hand-eye coordination and focus! We can definitely work with what you do remember. Let's see… do you recall when your last general check-up was?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… difficult. I believe it was… sometime last year? Perhaps early spring? It was before… before the divorce, certainly. Though, honestly, time seems to blend together a little at this point. I do recall a blood test, and a… a weight check. I am rather… tall. 183 centimetres, if that’s of any use. And… quite slim, I suppose. Around 123 pounds. But pinpointing a date… I’m afraid I simply can’t. Is there a record available, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Yes, let me pull up your records… Ah, here we are. Okay, Evann BuoniconTI, born… It looks like you had a check-up on March 15th, 2024. Weight was recorded as 121 pounds, height as 183 centimetres, as you said. Bloodwork was within normal limits at that time. That gives us a good starting point. Besides the divorce, have there been any other significant changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: March… yes, that rings a bell. Thank you for finding that. And… significant changes? Hmm. No, not that I recall. The divorce was… emotionally draining, naturally. But physically… I believe I’ve been relatively stable. Perhaps a little more fatigued than usual, but that could simply be… life. I haven't been ill, if that makes sense. No new diagnoses, no hospital visits. Just… a general feeling of… being worn down. Do you need to know about my occupation in more detail? Perhaps the chemicals I use…?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. It's helpful you haven't experienced any acute illnesses or hospitalizations. And yes, please, tell me a bit more about your occupation. Knowing the chemicals you work with as an etcher is important, as some can have long-term health effects. Even if you use protective gear, it’s good to be aware.
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, the chemicals… I hadn't considered that. I work primarily with ferric chloride, nitric acid… and various resists, of course. I do wear gloves and a respirator, generally. Though, I confess, in my earlier years… perhaps not as diligently as I should have. It’s a rather solitary occupation, you see. Very focused. I rarely discuss these things. I try to maintain a well-ventilated studio, but… it's a small space. I suppose the potential for exposure is… always present. Is this something I should be particularly worried about? I haven’t noticed any… adverse effects, but… perhaps my judgment is clouded?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful information. Ferric chloride and nitric acid exposure can have respiratory and skin effects over time, even with protective gear. It's good you're being proactive about it now. Let's do a quick review of your systems just to get a baseline. Have you noticed any changes in your breathing?
PATIENT: Changes in my breathing… Hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I haven’t been short of breath, or experiencing any… wheezing, or coughing. I do occasionally feel a slight… tightness in my chest, but I attribute that to stress, primarily. I often work long hours, hunched over my etching plate. Posture is… not ideal, I confess. I do try to take breaks, but… it's difficult to step away when inspiration strikes. Should I be experiencing something specific if there was a problem? I worry I might not recognise it, if it developed gradually.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, and it's wise to be aware of subtle changes. Things to watch for with potential respiratory issues would be persistent cough, shortness of breath even with mild activity, wheezing, or chest pain. Now, how about your skin?
PATIENT: My skin… It’s generally quite resilient, I believe. Though, I do occasionally experience… dryness, particularly on my hands. I attribute that to the chemicals, naturally. And the frequent washing. I use a heavy-duty hand cream, but it rarely feels… sufficient. I haven’t noticed any rashes, or unusual moles, or anything concerning. But… I suppose I’m not particularly observant when it comes to my own body. Do you have a system for… checking for things? Perhaps a way to remind me what to look for? My memory, as I’ve mentioned, is… unreliable.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we can certainly help with that. Dryness from chemical exposure is common, and a heavy-duty hand cream is good. We can talk about some specific creams later. Let’s move on. Have you experienced any changes in your weight recently, besides what was recorded at your last check-up?
PATIENT: Weight… no, I don’t believe so. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, to be honest. I maintain a fairly consistent diet – mostly simple, healthy foods. I don’t have much appetite when I’m preoccupied with my work. I’ve perhaps lost a little muscle tone, due to the… solitary nature of my occupation, but I haven’t noticed any significant weight fluctuations. I am rather petite, as you know. 123 pounds… or thereabouts. Do you recommend I start monitoring it more closely? It feels… a little obsessive, to be honest. But I am willing to do whatever is necessary. I simply… forget these things.
DOCTOR: It’s not obsessive to be aware of changes in your body, especially given your work. Keeping track of your weight could be a useful baseline. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No. Not that I recall. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything… chronic. I’ve always been… relatively healthy, thankfully. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, of course – measles, mumps, rubella – but nothing serious. I’ve never been hospitalized for anything other than a broken arm when I was a child. I take no regular medication. No allergies, as far as I’m aware. I… honestly, I’m not a particularly complicated case, Doctor. Perhaps I’m wasting your time with all this… vagueness. I just… I want to be prepared. It's a responsible thing to do, isn't it? To plan for the inevitable? Even if I can't quite recall why it's so important.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely not wasting my time. It’s very responsible of you to be proactive about this, and not everyone prioritizes advance care planning. And no, you’re not a complicated case – it’s helpful to know you haven’t had any significant medical issues in the past. Let’s quickly cover your family history. Are there any major medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, things like that?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… another area where my recollections are… hazy. My parents are both… deceased, unfortunately. They passed away several years ago. From… natural causes, I believe. I don’t recall any specific illnesses that ran in the family. My mother… she was quite frail, towards the end. But I don't recall any specific diagnoses. My father… he was a farmer. A very robust man. He lived a long life. I don't think there was anything… hereditary that I should be aware of. Honestly, I didn’t spend much time inquiring about family medical history. It wasn’t… a priority. Is this something I should have done? I apologize for my… lack of preparation. I simply wasn’t aware.
DOCTOR: It's alright. It's not something everyone thinks about, and it's perfectly okay that you weren’t aware. Okay, let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I do not smoke. I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on occasion, but that’s it. And I certainly do not use any recreational drugs. I find those things… detrimental to my work. Precision is paramount, you see. A steady hand, a clear mind. Those things require discipline and focus. I lead a rather solitary life, generally. I spend most of my time in my studio. I don’t have much of a social life, to be honest. My work is my life. Is that… unusual? I apologize for my… rambling. I simply haven’t spent much time discussing these things with anyone.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly fine. It sounds like you prioritize your health and work, which is admirable. Now, lastly, let’s quickly confirm – do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. I have never experienced an allergic reaction to anything. I can eat anything, as far as I know. I haven’t had any… skin reactions, or breathing difficulties, or anything of that nature. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard. I… honestly, I think I’ve covered everything? Is there anything else I should be aware of? I feel… a little overwhelmed, to be honest. But I’m glad I came. It's reassuring to know that I’m… taking steps. Even if I can’t quite recall why. I apologize for my… vagueness. I simply… forget things.
DOCTOR: You haven’t been vague at all. You’ve given me a very good overview of your health. And no need to apologize, I understand. Okay, given your history, and the fact that you’re generally healthy, the main thing we’re addressing today is advance care planning – the living will and durable power of attorney for healthcare. To start, let's talk about what a living will is and what it allows you to do. Have you ever heard of it before?
PATIENT: A living will… the name rings a bell, yes. But the details… are rather fuzzy. I believe it has something to do with… making decisions, should I become unable to do so myself? Expressing my wishes, perhaps? I recall something about… end-of-life care? But I’m afraid my recollections are… fragmented. I believe someone mentioned it briefly, a few years ago. But I don’t recall the specifics. Is it… a lengthy document? I confess, I don’t have much patience for paperwork. But I am willing to do whatever is necessary, as long as it doesn’t require too much… mental exertion. I simply… forget things easily. Perhaps you could explain it in simpler terms? I apologize for my… vagueness. I simply… want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. A living will – also called an advance directive – is a legal document that allows you to express your wishes for medical treatment if you become unable to make those decisions yourself. It covers things like whether you want life-sustaining treatment, feeding tubes, or pain management. It's about ensuring your values and preferences are respected, even when you can't speak for yourself. It doesn't need to be a lengthy or complicated document. We can keep it simple and focus on your core wishes. Would you be interested in going over a few key questions to help guide us in creating one?
PATIENT: Yes… I believe so. Perhaps. But please, be patient with me. I confess, the thought of making these decisions… it’s rather daunting. And my… memory isn’t what it once was. I’m afraid I might… forget what I’ve said. Or contradict myself. Perhaps it would be easier if I simply… delegate the decisions to someone I trust? Is that an option? I believe someone mentioned a… durable power of attorney? But I’m afraid I don’t recall the specifics. Perhaps you could explain both options, in simpler terms? And perhaps… start with the least… emotionally challenging questions? I apologize for my… vagueness. I simply… want to be prepared. And I want to ensure my wishes are respected, even if I can’t articulate them myself.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You’re right to ask about both options. A durable power of attorney for healthcare – or healthcare proxy – allows you to name someone you trust to make medical decisions on your behalf if you’re unable to. It’s a good option if you’re not comfortable making all the decisions yourself, or if you want someone who knows your values well to advocate for you. A living will and a healthcare proxy often go hand-in-hand. The living will outlines what you want, and the healthcare proxy names who will ensure those wishes are followed. We can definitely start with the least emotionally challenging questions. Perhaps we can start with something simple: In general, do you prefer a more aggressive approach to medical treatment, or a more conservative one, focusing on comfort and quality of life?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s… a difficult question. I believe… I prefer a more conservative approach, generally. I don’t have much appetite for… prolonged suffering. Quality of life is paramount, I think. A peaceful end, if it comes to that. I don’t want to be… kept alive artificially, if there’s no hope of recovery. But… that’s just my initial reaction. I confess, I haven’t thought about this in much detail. Perhaps you could explain the difference between the two approaches, in simpler terms? And perhaps… provide some examples? I apologize for my… vagueness. I simply… want to be prepared. And I want to ensure my wishes are respected, even if I can’t articulate them myself. It’s… a little overwhelming, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It is overwhelming, and you’re doing a great job thinking through this. Okay, let's break it down. An aggressive approach means pursuing all available medical treatments, even if they have significant side effects, with the goal of extending life as long as possible. This might include things like mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes, and aggressive chemotherapy. A conservative approach, on the other hand, prioritizes comfort and quality of life, even if it means forgoing some treatments that might prolong life. This might include focusing on pain management, palliative care, and allowing a natural death. For example, if you were to develop a serious illness with no hope of recovery, an aggressive approach might involve being placed on a ventilator and receiving multiple medications to keep you alive. A conservative approach might involve focusing on making you comfortable and allowing you to die peacefully with your loved ones. Does that distinction make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… that distinction makes sense. I believe… I prefer the latter approach. The conservative one. I don’t want to be… kept alive artificially. I want to be comfortable, and… peaceful. I want to be surrounded by… quiet. And I want to be allowed to… slip away naturally, if it comes to that. I don’t want to be… a burden. I don’t want to be… kept alive for the sake of… keeping me alive. I want to be allowed to… rest. But… that’s just my initial reaction. Perhaps you could ask me some more specific questions? To ensure my wishes are… clear? I apologize for my… vagueness. I simply… want to be prepared. And I want to ensure my wishes are respected, even if I can’t articulate them myself. It’s… a little overwhelming, to be honest. And my… memory isn’t what it once was. Perhaps we should write these things down, as we go? So I can… refer to them later?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, we will write everything down. That's a very good idea. Okay, let’s write down: “Patient prefers a conservative approach to medical treatment, prioritizing comfort and quality of life.” Now, let’s talk about specific treatments. If you were to develop a serious illness that left you unable to breathe on your own, would you want to be placed on a mechanical ventilator?
PATIENT: A… ventilator? No. Absolutely not. I… I don’t want to be… kept alive by machines. I want to be allowed to… slip away naturally. I don’t want to be… suffocated by tubes. I want to be comfortable, and… peaceful. I want to be allowed to… rest. I don’t want to be… a burden. I don’t want to be… kept alive for the sake of… keeping me alive. I want to be allowed to… die with dignity. But… that’s just my initial reaction. Perhaps you could explain the implications of… being on a ventilator? What would that entail? I apologize for my… vagueness. I simply… want to be prepared. And I want to ensure my wishes are respected, even if I can’t articulate them myself. It’s… a little overwhelming, to be honest. And my… memory isn’t what it once was. Perhaps we should write these things down, as we go? So I can… refer to them later?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. "Patient does not want to be placed on a mechanical ventilator." Being on a ventilator means a machine would breathe for you through a tube inserted in your mouth or nose. It can keep you alive in some situations, but it also involves being sedated, being unable to speak or eat, and potentially having a long recovery process. It’s not a comfortable experience. Let's move on. Would you want to receive CPR – cardiopulmonary resuscitation – if your heart were to stop beating?
PATIENT: CPR…? No. I… I don’t want that either. I don’t want to be… jolted back to life. I want to be allowed to… slip away peacefully. I don’t want to be… broken ribs. I don’t want to be… a burden. I want to be allowed to… rest. I want to be allowed to… die with dignity. I don’t want to be… kept alive for the sake of… keeping me alive. I want to be allowed to… slip away peacefully. But… that’s just my initial reaction. Perhaps you could explain the implications of… receiving CPR? What would that entail? I apologize for my… vagueness. I simply… want to be prepared. And I want to ensure my wishes are respected, even if I can’t articulate them myself. It’s… a little overwhelming, to be honest. And my… memory isn’t what it once was. Perhaps we should write these things down, as we go? So I can… refer to them later? This is… difficult. Perhaps we could take a break? I am… feeling a little overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. “Patient does not want to receive CPR.” CPR involves chest compressions and rescue breaths to try to restart your heart. It can be life-saving, but it can also cause broken ribs and other injuries. You are absolutely right, this is difficult. Let’s definitely take a break. I understand this is overwhelming. Would you like a glass of water?
PATIENT: Yes… please. A glass of water would be… very kind. And… perhaps a moment to… collect my thoughts? This is… a lot to process. I apologize for my… vagueness. I simply… want to be prepared. And I want to ensure my wishes are respected, even if I can’t articulate them myself. It’s… a little overwhelming, to be honest. And my… memory isn’t what it once was. I simply… want to be at peace. Perhaps… we could stop here for today? And continue tomorrow? I am… feeling a little overwhelmed. And I’m afraid I might… forget what we’ve discussed.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here you are. And yes, let’s definitely stop here for today. We’ve made a good start, and it’s important to take your time with this. We can absolutely continue tomorrow. I’ll make a copy of everything we’ve discussed so far for you to review. Before we stop, is there anyone you would like to have involved in these discussions?
PATIENT: Anyone…? No. I don't… have anyone. I am… divorced. And my… family is… deceased. I am… alone. But… perhaps you could be… a witness? To ensure my wishes are… respected? I apologize for my… vagueness. I simply… want to be prepared. And I want to ensure my wishes are… respected, even if I can’t articulate them myself. It’s… a little overwhelming, to be honest. And my… memory isn’t what it once was. Perhaps… it’s enough for now? To know that my wishes are… written down? I simply… want to be at peace. Thank you… for your patience. And your kindness.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be happy to be a witness. We can finalize the document tomorrow, and I’ll be here to ensure your wishes are respected. You’ve done a very brave thing today, Evann. It takes courage to think through these difficult decisions. And you are not alone. I am here to help you every step of the way. Let's schedule a time for tomorrow. Would early afternoon work?
PATIENT: Early afternoon would be… fine. Thank you… for your kindness. And your patience. I… appreciate it more than words can say. I simply… want to be at peace. And I want to ensure my wishes are… respected, even if I can’t articulate them myself. I think… that’s enough for today. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Evann. I'll see you tomorrow at the same time, then. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. Take care of yourself.
PATIENT: .
