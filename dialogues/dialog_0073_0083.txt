DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… a little thing. Not a big thing, you understand. Just… I thought a card from the doctor might be nice. A “Get Well” card, or something. You know, for… encouragement. My ex-wife, she always liked a little something nice when she wasn’t feeling her best. It’s the thought that counts, really.
DOCTOR: A card… Right. Well, while I appreciate the… sentiment, this is a medical practice, Mr. Kammer. We focus on actual medical concerns. Perhaps you misunderstood the purpose of a doctor's visit?
PATIENT: Now hold on just a minute. I do understand what a doctor does. I’ve been going to doctors my whole life! It’s just… sometimes a little boost is helpful. And you’re a doctor, aren’t you? You're supposed to help people. A card isn’t going to hurt anyone. I just thought... after everything, a little kindness would be nice. It’s not like I’m asking for a surgery.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, I find this… unusual. I’m a physician, specializing in internal medicine. I treat illnesses, not… emotional distress. If you are experiencing feelings of sadness or loneliness, I can certainly provide you with a list of mental health professionals in the area. But a “get well” card is not within my scope of practice. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms that led you to schedule this appointment, or are we solely focusing on this… request?
PATIENT: Well, now you’re making me feel foolish. I just… I’ve been feeling a little down, alright? It’s a hot summer, things aren’t going my way, and I thought… well, I thought a card from a professional might cheer me up. It’s not like I have anyone else to ask. I don’t have a lot of… support. And no, I don’t have anything wrong wrong, physically. Just… tired, maybe? Old age, you know. Things just ache a little more these days. But a card… it’s a small thing. Surely you can write a small card?
DOCTOR: “Tired” and “aches.” Those are… remarkably vague symptoms, Mr. Kammer. Many things can cause fatigue and muscle soreness. And frankly, requesting a card as a form of medical treatment is… unprecedented. I understand you're feeling low, but I am not equipped to provide emotional support in this manner. However, since you are here, and you mentioned fatigue and aches, let’s at least attempt a basic review of systems. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical causes for these feelings. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills… not really. It gets a little cool at night, but that’s just the air conditioning, probably. Weight loss… well, maybe a little. My appetite hasn’t been the best lately. Everything tastes… bland, you know? Not like it used to. But I wouldn't say I’m losing weight, exactly. Just… not putting any on. Honestly, Doctor, are you sure you can’t just write the card? It would mean a lot.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, we are deviating significantly from standard medical practice. A loss of appetite can be indicative of several underlying issues, and it’s something we should investigate. To reiterate, I am not going to write you a “get well” card. It’s not within my professional boundaries. Now, let’s focus on the fatigue and loss of appetite. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation?
PATIENT: No, no nausea or vomiting. My stomach’s been… alright. Constipation, sometimes. Old age, you know? Things don't move like they used to. But nothing… serious. Just a little trouble, here and there. Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel like I'm wasting your time. If you're too busy to write a little card, just say so!
DOCTOR: It’s not a matter of being “too busy,” Mr. Kammer. It’s a matter of providing appropriate medical care. Constipation can be a symptom of various conditions, including dehydration, medication side effects, or even more serious underlying issues. Let’s try this: Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No! No blood. Absolutely not. Goodness, no. Why would I be telling you that if there was blood? That would be… a serious problem, wouldn’t it? Look, Doctor, I’m just a little tired and sad and thought a nice card might help. I didn’t come here to talk about… that.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, you presented with vague symptoms – fatigue and loss of appetite. As a physician, I am obligated to explore potential causes, even if they are unpleasant to discuss. Excluding the possibility of gastrointestinal bleeding is a necessary step. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I take something for my blood pressure. A little white pill. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it’s really acting up. It’s… yellow, I think. And I used to take something for my heartburn, but I stopped. It wasn’t really helping. And… oh! I take a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said I was low on it. That’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me just verify this… Amlodipine 5mg daily for hypertension, Celecoxib as needed for osteoarthritis, and Vitamin D 2000 IU daily. No recent changes to these medications?
PATIENT: No, no changes. Been taking them for… years, I guess. The blood pressure pill keeps my numbers okay, and the arthritis one helps when my joints are really bothering me. The vitamin D… well, I just take it because the other doctor said to.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you mentioned stopping the heartburn medication. Do you recall the name of that medication, and when you discontinued it?
PATIENT: Um… let me think… It was… a little purple pill. I think it started with an “O”. Oh! Omeprazole, that was it! I stopped taking it… maybe six months ago? It wasn’t really helping, and I didn't want to take more pills than I needed.
DOCTOR: Omeprazole discontinued six months ago. Alright. Now, Mr. Kammer, while I appreciate your willingness to provide this information, I need to be frank. Your symptoms, while vague, combined with the discontinuation of Omeprazole, raise a slight concern for potential gastrointestinal issues. It’s possible there’s underlying inflammation or irritation contributing to your fatigue and loss of appetite. I recommend a basic blood workup, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and inflammatory markers. This will help us rule out any underlying medical causes. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh, goodness. I don’t like needles. But… if it’ll get me a card, I guess I can do it. No, wait! That didn’t come out right. If it’ll help me feel better, then yes. I’ll do the blood work. But you promise you'll consider the card afterward?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I will not promise to write you a card. However, if the blood work reveals a medical issue contributing to your symptoms, I will certainly address it with appropriate treatment. Alright. I’ll have the nurse draw the necessary blood samples. We'll need approximately 10 milliliters. She'll explain the process. After the results are available—which should be in approximately 48-72 hours—we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before the blood draw?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. Just… don’t like needles. And try to be quick, alright? I get a little lightheaded sometimes. But… thank you, Doctor. For… considering everything. Even if there won’t be a card.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'll inform the nurse of your concerns. She will take extra precautions. I'll also have her check your blood pressure before the draw. We’ll proceed as efficiently as possible. Please follow the nurse to the lab. We’ll discuss the results at your follow-up appointment. If you experience any sudden or severe symptoms in the meantime—such as abdominal pain, vomiting, or bloody stools—please seek immediate medical attention. Is there anything else I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. Even though you won’t write the card, I appreciate you listening. And… well, I hope the blood work doesn’t show anything too bad.
DOCTOR: "Patient presented with vague symptoms; requested a ‘get well’ card. Blood work ordered to rule out underlying medical causes. Patient anxiety regarding procedure noted." Some days… .
