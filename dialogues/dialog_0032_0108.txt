DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, Doc, don't bother with the small talk. I'm bleedin' internally, alright? It started a couple days ago. Not pretty. Just...felt it happen, y'know? And it hasn't stopped completely since. It’s… well, it’s a lot of blood.
DOCTOR: "Bleeding internally," you say. I appreciate you being direct, Mr. Gentz, but "a lot of blood" is rather vague for a medical assessment. Can you describe where you're bleeding from, specifically?
PATIENT: Specific? Look, it’s comin’ from… down there. Okay? The… the other end. What more specific do you need? It ain’t like it’s bleedin’ outta my ears, Doc. It’s… it’s where things come from. Happy now? I don’t spend my days inspectin’ my insides. It’s… dark, obviously. And it smells. Need I go on? It's unpleasant. Very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Rectal bleeding, then. I understand it’s unpleasant to discuss, Mr. Gentz, but we need to be precise for accurate diagnosis. Has this happened before?
PATIENT: Precise? Accurate? Doc, I'm tellin' you what’s happenin’ to me. I'm not a doctor. And no, it hasn't happened before. Not like this. I've had… little things, here and there, over the years. But nothin’ like this mess. It started slow, then… then it just got worse. And faster. It's a bad color, too. Not bright red, more… like coffee grounds, I guess. Not that I drink coffee, mind you. Disgusting stuff.
DOCTOR: “Coffee grounds” is a useful description, thank you. It suggests the blood has been partially digested, which is important information. When did you first notice this change – the coffee grounds appearance and the increased amount of bleeding?
PATIENT: Look, I already told ya… a couple days ago. What part of that’s not gettin’ through? It started kinda subtle, see? A little bit of red, then a little more, then… bam. Coffee grounds. It was… Tuesday, I think. Yeah, Tuesday. I was… workin’. Gotta keep the crematories runnin’, you know? People don’t just… disappear. Though, sometimes, I wish they would. It’s a dirty job, alright? And now this. It’s just… perfect.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand this is unsettling, but I need a clear timeline to assess the situation properly. "A couple of days ago" is not sufficient. Was it Tuesday morning, Tuesday evening?
PATIENT: Alright, alright, hold your horses. It was… Tuesday evening. After my shift. I went to the… bathroom, and there it was. Couldn’t miss it, alright? It wasn't a little drip, it was… substantial. And it looked like someone had stirred mud into it. Mud that smells… bad. Honestly, it scared me. I ain’t scared easily, but this… this was different. Cremation's not pretty, but this is a different kinda awful. Does that satisfy your need for “precision” now?
DOCTOR: Tuesday evening, then. And you said it was “substantial” and had a coffee grounds appearance. Have you experienced any dizziness, weakness, or shortness of breath since this began?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, I run on fumes most days. So, am I usually dizzy? Yeah. Weak? Usually. Short of breath? When I gotta haul a body, definitely. It’s a physically demanding job, alright? But… has it been worse since Tuesday? Yeah, maybe a little. I felt kinda lightheaded while… while I was cleanin’ up the… mess. And tired. Extra tired. It's hard to tell what’s just the job and what's this bleedin' business, honestly. It all feels like one big ache these days.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, based on what you've described – the rectal bleeding, the coffee grounds appearance, the dizziness and weakness – it’s important we investigate this thoroughly. While it could be something relatively benign, it could also indicate a more serious issue, such as a gastrointestinal bleed. I need to perform a physical examination, including a rectal exam. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Look, Doc, I appreciate you tellin' me all this fancy talk, but… are you serious right now? You're gonna… poke around down there? After I just told you about bleedin’ internally? That's… that’s a bit much, isn’t it? I didn't exactly come here for a… personal inspection. Is there no other way? Can't you just give me somethin’ to stop the bleedin’ and send me home? I got work to do. People are waitin’. And frankly, I'm not comfortable with this. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your discomfort, and I assure you this is standard procedure. A physical examination is essential to properly assess the source and severity of the bleeding. Without it, I cannot provide an accurate diagnosis or appropriate treatment. We are not simply looking for if there is bleeding, but where it’s coming from and what is causing it. While I appreciate your concerns, proceeding with the exam is in your best medical interest. I will, of course, be as gentle and professional as possible. We can also discuss stool studies to check for blood, but that won’t give us the immediate information we need. Do you have any objections to a gloved and lubricated digital rectal exam at this time?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, you're not listenin’ to me. I don't want a… a poke around down there. I'm a grown man, and I'm tellin’ you what’s happenin’. I'm bleedin' and I feel weak. That's enough for a start, isn't it? Are you sayin' you don't trust me? Are you tryin’ to tell me I'm makin’ this up? This is ridiculous. I came here for help, not an… invasion. And frankly, I’m startin’ to feel insulted. Can I just… can I just talk to another doctor? This is not goin’ well. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I am not implying you are fabricating this. However, a diagnosis cannot be made without proper evaluation. Given your refusal of a physical exam, and the concerning nature of your symptoms, I cannot provide you with treatment at this time. I strongly advise you to seek a second opinion immediately. I will document your refusal of examination in your chart, and advise you that delaying a proper diagnosis could have serious consequences. I can provide you with a list of gastroenterologists in the area. I understand this is frustrating, but my priority is your well-being, and that requires a thorough assessment.
