DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s something the young people keep fussing about. Fatigue, they call it. Makes me awfully tired, you see. And something about my… muscles? My daughter keeps going on about it, but honestly, I don’t remember all the details. She filled out a lot of papers, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: I see. Fatigue and some muscle concerns, brought to your attention by your daughter. That's good of her to help you get this checked out. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's going on. First, can you tell me a little more about this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… tiring. More tiring than usual, I suppose. I’ve always been a bit tired, you know? Working as a diver… that takes it out of you. But this is… different. It feels like I could sleep for a week and still be exhausted. And it’s not like I’m doing anything to be tired! I mostly sit these days, tending to the garden when the weather is nice. It’s just… there. Always there. And it’s been going on… well, a while now. I don't keep track of such things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this fatigue is more persistent and bothersome than your usual tiredness, even with a less active lifestyle. You mentioned it's been going on for a while – would you say weeks, months, or even longer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Months, I think. Maybe longer. Time just… slips away, you know? It’s hard to say exactly. My daughter keeps asking, and I just tell her it feels like forever. It’s not like it came on suddenly. It just… gradually got worse. I used to be able to pull weeds all afternoon, now I have to sit down every five minutes. It’s rather… undignified, to be honest. I was always a strong woman. A commercial diver, remember? Not someone who needs constant resting.
DOCTOR: Yes, a commercial diver – that is impressive. It sounds like this has been a gradual decline in your energy levels, making everyday tasks more difficult. You also mentioned something about your muscles… can you describe what you’ve been experiencing with those?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not a pain, exactly. More like… weakness. Everything feels heavy, like I'm wading through water. Especially my legs. Getting up from a chair is… an effort. And I’ve noticed I stumble a bit more than I used to. It’s not a fall-down kind of stumble, just… unsteady. My daughter keeps fussing about that too, says I should be careful. Honestly, I think she worries too much. But… it is a bit unnerving, I suppose. And it’s not like it was always this way. I used to be steady as a rock. A good diver has to be.
DOCTOR: I see. Weakness and a feeling of heaviness, particularly in your legs, along with some unsteadiness. That’s helpful to know. Have you noticed this weakness affecting your arms or hands at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… yes, a little. It’s harder to… grip things. Opening jars, for example. I used to be able to pop them open no problem, now I have to ask my husband. And… well, I used to enjoy knitting, but my hands get tired so quickly now. The needles feel… heavier than they used to. It’s a small thing, but… yes, my hands aren't as strong as they used to be. It's all rather embarrassing, really. A strong diver shouldn't have trouble with knitting needles.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ardelle. It’s not about what you should be able to do, but about what’s happening now, and we want to figure that out. Now, let's broaden the picture a bit. Besides the fatigue and muscle weakness, have you noticed any other changes in how you’re feeling?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. I’ve been a bit… forgetful lately. More than usual, anyway. My daughter says I repeat myself a lot, which is probably true. I just… can’t seem to recall things as easily. Names, dates… little things, mostly. And… I’ve been feeling a bit… down, I suppose. Not sad, exactly, just… lacking energy, and not much interest in things. I used to enjoy gardening so much, but even that feels like a chore now. It’s all rather… dull. I used to be a very lively woman. A commercial diver doesn't have time to be dull.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we're seeing fatigue, muscle weakness, some unsteadiness, forgetfulness, and a lack of interest in things you used to enjoy. That's a lot of information. Now, I want to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was a long time ago. I had… something with my blood pressure, years ago. High, I think. They gave me some pills, I took them for a while, and then… I don't really remember. It wasn't anything serious, I don't think. And… I broke my wrist once, when I was younger, working on a boat. But that healed just fine. Nothing else… really. I’ve always been a healthy woman, mostly. A commercial diver has to be. We don't have time for illnesses. But my daughter keeps asking about all sorts of things, and I honestly can't recall. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past, and a broken wrist. Thank you. And what about any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. No, I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. Oh, wait… I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was a very long time ago. And… I think I had a small mole removed from my back once, but that was just a quick little thing. Nothing else comes to mind. I've always been lucky, I suppose. A commercial diver can’t afford to be laid up for surgeries. It's a dangerous profession, you know. You're more likely to get a scrape than need an operation.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal as a teenager and a mole removed from your back. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, my daughter makes me take a vitamin D pill every day. Says I don't get enough sunshine. And… I take something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill, but I honestly don't remember the name. She refills it for me, so I just take it. And sometimes, when my arthritis acts up, I take some ibuprofen. But that’s only when it’s really bothering me. Nothing else, really. I try to avoid taking too many pills. A commercial diver doesn't have time for all those fancy medications. We rely on our strength.
DOCTOR: Okay, vitamin D, a blood pressure medication , and ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had any reactions to anything. My daughter asks, but I always tell her no. I've always been a strong woman. A commercial diver can't afford to be allergic to things. It's a dangerous job, you know, and you need to be able to handle whatever comes your way. But… now that I think about it, sometimes I get a bit itchy when I eat shellfish. But it's not a serious reaction, just a bit of an annoyance. Nothing that would keep me from enjoying a good meal. My husband makes a lovely clam chowder, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible mild itchiness with shellfish, but no known serious allergies. Thank you, Ardelle, that's very helpful. I’m going to take a look at your electronic health record now, just to confirm some of this information and see if there are any other relevant details. This will just take a moment. While I’m doing that, would you mind if I listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes and strength?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. I suppose it can’t hurt. My daughter always says I should let the doctors poke and prod. But I’ve always been a healthy woman, mostly. A commercial diver has to be. But… go ahead, if that’s what you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just be gentle, if you would. These old bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Okay, take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. And again… Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit of a murmur. Not concerning at this point, but worth noting. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This is just a little tap on your tendons. It might feel a bit strange. Okay, reflexes are a bit diminished, especially in your legs. Now, I'm going to check your strength. I'm going to ask you to resist me as I try to move your arms and legs. Just push back against me as hard as you can. Strength is reduced in your legs, more so than in your arms. You're able to resist some movement, but it's noticeably weaker than expected. Alright, that gives me a bit more information. I’m seeing some reduced reflexes and decreased strength, particularly in your legs, which is consistent with what you've been describing. Your heart murmur is something we should keep an eye on, but doesn't seem to be an immediate concern. Now, let me review your EHR.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Whatever you think is necessary, Doctor. It’s just… frustrating, you know? Being so tired all the time. I used to be able to do anything. A commercial diver doesn't have time to be weak. It’s just… not like me. I hope you can figure out what’s wrong. My daughter is already making appointments with all sorts of specialists, and honestly, it's all a bit overwhelming. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ardelle. It’s completely valid to feel overwhelmed, and it’s admirable that you’re seeking answers. Let’s take this one step at a time. Okay, reviewing your records… it confirms the high blood pressure from years ago, which is currently managed with a low dose medication. There are some notes about mild arthritis in your knees, and a vitamin D deficiency. There are no other significant medical issues documented. Based on your symptoms, your physical exam, and your medical history, several possibilities come to mind. The fatigue, muscle weakness, and forgetfulness could be related to a number of things, including vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, or even early signs of neuropathy. It's also important to consider the possibility of a medication side effect, though your current medications are generally well-tolerated. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, kidney and liver function, and rule out any underlying infections. I also want to check your blood count to rule out anemia.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Blood tests… more poking and prodding, I suppose. Honestly, I just want this to be over with. It’s just… tiring, dealing with all this. I used to be able to handle anything. A commercial diver doesn't shy away from a challenge. But this… this is just exhausting. Will the blood tests take long? And will they be painful? My daughter keeps fussing about the possibility of all sorts of terrible diseases, and honestly, it's making me even more anxious. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ardelle. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed and worried when facing the unknown. Please know that these tests are a routine part of figuring out what’s going on, and they don't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. The blood draw itself is usually quick – just a few minutes. You might feel a slight pinch, but it shouldn't be painful. The phlebotomist is very skilled at minimizing discomfort. And we’ll get the results back within a few days – usually 2-3 business days. While we’re waiting for the results, I want to assure you that we're taking this seriously. We’ll explore all possibilities and work together to find the best course of action. In the meantime, I'd like to recommend that you continue taking your vitamin D and blood pressure medication as prescribed. Also, try to get as much rest as possible, and eat a healthy diet. It’s important to take care of yourself, both physically and mentally. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. That’s… reassuring, I suppose. Rest… that’s easy enough, I guess. But honestly, I just want to know why I’m so tired all the time. Is it serious? My daughter keeps talking about all sorts of terrible things… and honestly, it’s making me very anxious. And… will the tests be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you know. A commercial diver doesn’t exactly retire with a fortune, and… well, I don’t want to burden my children with a large medical bill. They’ve already done so much for me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ardelle. It’s completely valid to be worried about both your health and the financial aspect of things. Let’s address the health concerns first. It's too early to say definitively what's causing your fatigue and weakness. The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities and determine the underlying cause. It could be something relatively minor, like a vitamin deficiency, or something more complex. But it’s important to remember that many conditions are treatable, and we’ll explore all options. Now, regarding the cost, I can assure you we’ll do everything we can to minimize your financial burden. Medicare usually covers these tests, and we have a billing department that can help you understand your coverage and any potential out-of-pocket expenses. We also have financial assistance programs available if needed. I will have the billing department contact you directly to discuss the estimated costs and your coverage. They can also answer any questions you have about financial assistance. Let’s focus on getting these tests done first. Once we have the results, we’ll have a much clearer picture of what’s going on and can develop a plan to get you feeling like yourself again. Before you leave, I’d like to give you a written order for the blood tests, along with instructions on where to go. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. That’s… a relief, to hear about Medicare. My daughter handles most of that, and honestly, I just try to stay out of it. It’s all so complicated. A written order… yes, that would be helpful. I tend to forget things easily these days, and I don’t want to miss anything. A commercial diver needs to be organized, you know. Even in retirement. And… thank you, Doctor. For being patient with me. I know I’m not the easiest patient, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. It just… frustrating, being so tired all the time. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: You are not difficult at all, Ardelle. It’s my job to listen and provide the best care possible. And I completely understand your frustration. It’s disheartening to feel unwell, especially when it impacts your quality of life. Here is the order. It lists the tests that need to be done and the address of the lab. The lab will bill Medicare directly. I’m also going to write you a note for a referral to physical therapy. While we’re waiting for the blood test results, some gentle exercises might help with your muscle weakness and improve your strength. It’s a low-risk intervention and could provide some relief. This is just a recommendation, of course. You can decide if you want to pursue it. Do you have any other questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Oh… physical therapy… alright. I suppose it can’t hurt. A commercial diver always keeps in shape, even in retirement. But honestly, I just want to know why I’m so tired all the time. No… I don’t think so. I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. For being so patient with me, and for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it more than you know. I hope the tests don’t take too long. And I hope they can figure out what’s wrong. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Ardelle. I understand your desire to feel like yourself again, and I assure you we’ll do everything we can to help. We’ll call you as soon as the test results are available, usually within 2-3 business days. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, and get some rest.
