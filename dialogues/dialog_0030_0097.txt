DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure. Though I must say, finding a clinic out here was… a challenge. I am here because my husband, Jean-Pierre, insists I get one of these… advance directives, is it? He worries excessively, you see. He wants me to have a form stating what should happen… should something… unforeseen occur. It feels rather morbid, frankly, but he’s quite insistent.
DOCTOR: I understand, Marija. It’s very thoughtful of your husband to be so proactive about your wishes, and it’s perfectly reasonable to want to have these conversations, even if they feel difficult. An advance directive – sometimes called a living will or healthcare proxy – essentially outlines your preferences for medical care if you’re unable to speak for yourself. It's not morbid at all, but rather empowering to have a say in your own care. Before we dive into the specifics of that, perhaps you could tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health? Well, I am… generally quite healthy, thank you. I’ve always been fortunate in that regard. I do teach literature at the university, which requires a great deal of mental fortitude, naturally. It’s not a physically demanding job, thankfully. I suppose I’ve been a little more tired lately, but that’s likely due to the summer heat and the… students. I don’t have any major conditions, no. No chronic illnesses, and I haven't been hospitalised in decades. I do take a daily vitamin, if that is relevant. Really, I am quite robust. My husband, however, exaggerates everything. He always has.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Marija. It sounds like you are very healthy, and teaching certainly keeps the mind active! A daily vitamin is good preventative care. Just to be thorough, could you tell me if you've had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Yes, actually. When I was quite young – perhaps ten years old – I had my tonsils removed. It was a very common procedure then, I believe. And… oh, and later, when I was in my twenties, I had a minor procedure to correct a slight irregularity with my vision. Lasik, I believe it was called. That was… quite some time ago now. Nothing since then. Certainly nothing major. My husband always insists I remember every little ailment I ever had, but truthfully, I have a remarkably good memory for literature, not for medical details. Is that… sufficient?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Marija. Tonsillectomy and LASIK – good to know. And it’s perfectly normal to remember details about other things more readily! Now, could you tell me about any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s another area where my husband is quite preoccupied. He comes from a long line of… worriers, primarily. My mother, bless her soul, suffered from high blood pressure in her later years, and her sister had some sort of… arthritis, I believe. Nothing particularly alarming. On my side, my grandfather had diabetes, but I’ve always been very careful with my diet, so I don’t foresee any issues there. My husband insists on regular blood sugar checks, naturally. He thinks everyone in my family is destined for an early grave. Honestly, it's exhausting. Is this… detailed enough for your purposes?
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Marija. High blood pressure, arthritis, and diabetes – we’ll keep those in mind. It’s good that you’re proactive about your health and diet. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides your daily vitamin?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the vitamin. I pride myself on maintaining good health without the need for pharmaceuticals, if you don’t mind my saying so. I believe in a healthy lifestyle – good food, regular exercise, and a stimulating mind. My husband, of course, has a drawer full of various remedies and supplements, but I generally decline his offerings. He means well, but… he fusses too much. Really, I am quite well. Are we getting closer to this… form? I admit, I am somewhat impatient.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are getting closer, Marija. I understand your impatience. I just want to make sure I have a complete picture of your health before we discuss your wishes for an advance directive. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me see. No, nothing significant. I have a mild sensitivity to certain perfumes, but that’s hardly a medical concern. And I once had a rather unpleasant reaction to shellfish, but I haven’t eaten it in decades, so it’s not a current issue. Nothing that requires an EpiPen or anything of that nature, thankfully. I am generally quite robust, as I’ve mentioned. Truly, Doctor, I believe I am a perfectly healthy individual. Can we finally proceed to discussing this… directive? I confess, I’m rather perplexed by the whole idea. It feels rather… defeatist.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Marija. You've given me a very thorough overview of your health, and it sounds like you are indeed in excellent condition. And I understand your feelings about the advance directive. It doesn't feel defeatist; it’s about having control and ensuring your wishes are respected if you ever become unable to communicate them yourself. To start, an advance directive has two main parts: a living will and a healthcare proxy. The living will outlines what medical treatments you would or wouldn't want in certain situations—like if you were on a ventilator or had a serious illness. The healthcare proxy names someone you trust to make medical decisions for you if you can’t. Do you have any initial thoughts on who you might want to name as your healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: Well, that’s… obvious, isn’t it? Jean-Pierre, of course. He’s the one who insisted on all of this, after all. He’s… very involved in everything. Sometimes too involved, if I’m being honest. He’s quite knowledgeable, and he certainly has strong opinions. He’ll want to be certain every detail is… correct. He’s a retired accountant, you see, so he’s very detail-oriented. Though I confess, I worry he’ll overthink everything and make a mountain out of a molehill. But yes, Jean-Pierre. He is my husband. He should be the one. But honestly, Doctor, I’m still unsure about this whole… outlining my wishes. It feels rather morbid to contemplate such things. What sorts of… situations would I be outlining?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Marija. It’s common to feel conflicted. And naming Jean-Pierre as your healthcare proxy makes sense, given his involvement and your relationship. The form will ask you to consider what you would want if you were in a very serious condition, unable to communicate, and there was no reasonable hope of recovery. Things like: Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation : Would you want us to attempt to revive you if your heart stopped?
PATIENT: CPR… Goodness. That sounds… rather drastic. I suppose… if it was a quick recovery, then yes. But if it was… prolonged and painful, with no chance of a meaningful life afterward… then no. I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially. I have always valued quality of life, you see. A stimulating mind and a good conversation are far more important than simply… existing. Though I confess, I don't enjoy thinking about such scenarios. It’s all so… bleak. Jean-Pierre will likely want me to check “yes” to everything, of course. He’s very cautious. Is there a… middle ground? A way to say "try, but not at all costs"?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Marija. There is definitely a middle ground. We can specify "Do Not Resuscitate" if you wish, meaning we wouldn't attempt CPR. Or, as you said, we can specify "full code" – meaning we would try everything – but with conditions. For example, you could state that you only want resuscitation attempted if there's a reasonable chance of recovery. Or, you can stipulate a time limit. We can also discuss other scenarios, such as: Mechanical Ventilation: Would you want to be placed on a breathing machine if you couldn't breathe on your own?
PATIENT: Mechanical ventilation… Oh, dear. That sounds… even more unpleasant than CPR. Honestly, I don't believe so. I would not want to be kept alive by a machine. It feels… undignified. A natural end, when the time comes, is far preferable. Jean-Pierre will likely insist on keeping all options open, of course. He worries about every contingency. He’s a retired accountant, you see; he always has to have a plan B, and a plan C, and a plan D. It’s exhausting. But if I were making the decision… no. No ventilation. I value my independence, and being tethered to a machine is not my idea of a life worth living. Is that… sufficiently clear? And honestly, Doctor, is this form terribly long? I have a book club meeting later this afternoon, and I wouldn't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very clear, Marija. “No ventilation” noted. We can absolutely document your wishes. And you’re right to mention Jean-Pierre’s cautious nature; we can certainly discuss his concerns as well. The form itself isn’t terribly long, perhaps 2-3 pages. It mostly involves checking boxes and answering a few short questions. We can take it at your own pace, and if you get tired, we can always pause and continue later. We'll go through each section together. Next, we can discuss feeding tubes. If you were unable to eat on your own, would you want to receive nutrition through a feeding tube?
PATIENT: A feeding tube… Oh, goodness. That sounds rather… invasive. Honestly, I don't believe so. If I were unable to eat on my own, it means my body is… shutting down, doesn't it? Prolonging the inevitable seems rather pointless. I would rather… allow nature to take its course. Jean-Pierre will likely want to keep that option open as well, of course. He believes in fighting for every possible moment. He’s a retired accountant, you see; he’s always looking for ways to… maximize efficiency, even in matters of life and death. Honestly, it's exhausting. But if I were making the decision… no feeding tube. I value my dignity, and being fed artificially doesn’t sound particularly appealing. Is that… sufficiently clear? And Doctor, is there any chance of completing this form quickly? My book club meeting is at three o'clock, and I haven’t even chosen my outfit yet.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija, that is very clear. "No feeding tube" noted. We are documenting your strong preferences, and that’s what’s most important. It sounds like you’ve given this a great deal of thought, despite finding it difficult to contemplate. The next section concerns pain management. It's important to ensure you receive adequate pain relief if you were unable to communicate your needs. Would you want us to provide whatever pain medication is necessary, even if it might cause some drowsiness?
PATIENT: Pain management… Well, that seems rather sensible, doesn’t it? Of course, I would want to be comfortable. I don’t believe in suffering needlessly. Whatever is necessary to alleviate pain, even if it causes some drowsiness… yes, absolutely. I suppose that’s the one thing I wouldn’t object to. Although Jean-Pierre will likely want to specify the exact dosage and frequency, of course. He’s a retired accountant, you see; he always has to have a precise accounting of everything. Honestly, it’s exhausting. But if I were making the decision… yes, pain management. Whatever it takes to be comfortable. And Doctor, is there a summary page to this form? I confess, I’m beginning to feel a little overwhelmed. And I really must choose my outfit soon. My book club meeting is at three o’clock, and I wouldn’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Yes, Marija. We’ll document your wish for adequate pain management. And yes, there is a summary page that outlines all your preferences. Now, the final section is where you name your healthcare proxy – which, as you mentioned, is Jean-Pierre. We’ll include his contact information and a space for him to sign, acknowledging his willingness to make decisions on your behalf. Do you have any questions about any of these sections before we finalize the form?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I suppose I’ve outlined my wishes as clearly as I can. Though I’m certain Jean-Pierre will have… additional suggestions. He always does. He’s a retired accountant, you see; he always has to have the last word. Honestly, it's exhausting. But if I were making the decision… yes, this is fine. Let’s finalize the form, and I can be on my way. And Doctor, is there a copy for me? I’d like to show it to Jean-Pierre, of course. Though I’m certain he’ll find something to… critique. Honestly, it’s exhausting. Let’s just finalize the form, shall we? My book club meeting is at three o'clock, and I really must choose my outfit soon.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. Here’s the completed form, with a copy for you. Jean-Pierre will need to sign the acknowledgement section at the bottom. I've also noted your husband’s proactive nature. It’s good that he’s involved, and we can certainly discuss any concerns he may have. I’m glad we were able to get this done for you today. If you have any questions or changes down the line, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any final questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe so. You've been very patient with me, and I appreciate it. Though I suspect Jean-Pierre will have… many questions. He always does. He’s a retired accountant, you see; he always has to have everything perfect. Honestly, it's exhausting. But if I were making the decision… yes, this is fine. I think. Thank you, Doctor. I must be going now. My book club meeting is at three o'clock, and I really must choose my outfit. Good afternoon, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Marija. Enjoy your book club meeting! And don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a wonderful afternoon. .
