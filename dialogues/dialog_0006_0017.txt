DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good to meet you too, Doctor… Gorga, right? I think. Well, it’s about this… tryout. For the team. A physical, they said I need. For the team. It’s… baseball. I think. It’s been a while.
DOCTOR: Baseball, right. Okay. And… how long has it been since you last had a physical, roughly?
PATIENT: Physical… Hmm. That's a good question. A long time, I'm sure. Maybe… when my wife… before the divorce. A long, long time ago. I don't really keep track of those things. It was… necessary then. For insurance, probably. Not that I remember much about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, we'll get everything updated today then. Just so I have a clear picture, are you currently experiencing any pain, discomfort, or anything out of the ordinary?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really. My knees, maybe. A little creaky in the mornings. Old age, I suppose. And my back, sometimes after… lifting things. But nothing I can’t walk off. It’s just… being a man, you know? A little aches and pains. Not worth bothering a doctor over.
DOCTOR: Alright. Creaky knees and occasional back pain. We’ll definitely take a look at those. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… You mean like, sick things? No, nothin’ like that. I get a little… winded, maybe, walkin’ up the stairs. But I’m not a young man anymore. I used to be able to run all day… but that was… a long time ago. Before… everything. Is that what you mean by symptoms?
DOCTOR: Okay, some shortness of breath with exertion. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Let me see… … Not that I’ve noticed. They feel… normal. Maybe a little… wide. But that’s just… genetics, probably. My father had big feet. And his father before him. Not swollen, though. Definitely not swollen.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood… pressure? Doctor, I don't really… keep up with all that. My ex-wife, she handled all the doctor stuff. I just… went when she told me to. I think… maybe something about cholesterol? She was always worried about my cholesterol. But I don’t know what that even is. I’ve never had any… big problems, not that I recall. Just the usual aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Okay. We'll need to do some tests to get a better understanding of your current health. Any surgeries or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries…? Hmm. … Now that you mention it, I think I had my tonsils out when I was a kid. A long, long time ago. And… I broke my arm once, playing baseball. That's about it, I think. No big hospital stays, nothin' like that. Just the tonsils and the arm. Maybe a little time in the hospital when my daughter was born, but I wasn't the one in the hospital, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsillectomy as a child, broken arm. We’re getting there. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? … Not that I know of. I eat everything. I’m Puerto Rican, Doctor! We eat everything. Spicy things, sweet things, everything. I don’t think I’ve ever had a reaction to anything. My ex-wife always made sure I didn't eat peanuts, but I don't think I needed to. She just… worried. No allergies. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… … No. Nothing. Not a one. I don’t like taking pills, Doctor. Makes me feel… strange. I tried something for my knees once, a little orange one, but it didn’t do nothin’ and made my stomach upset. So I stopped takin’ it. No. No medications. Just… aches and pains. The usual.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Bartok, it sounds like we have a bit of updating to do. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam…? … Well, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I just… hope it doesn’t take too long. I got things to do, you know? But yeah. Go ahead. Whatever you need. As long as it’s quick. And… not too rough. My knees, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll be gentle. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: There we go. Careful with that arm, Doctor. That's where I used to throw the ball. Back in the day. Still got a pretty good arm, actually. Though it’s not what it used to be. You'll probably feel a squeeze. Is that right? With the cuff?
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated at 142 over 90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, but a little… faint. I’m just listening carefully. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at your knees. Could you please bend them for me?
PATIENT: Ooh… there we go. That's the creaky part. You hear that, Doctor? Like an old door. Been playin’ baseball since I was a little kid. Knees took a beating. Used to be able to slide all day. Not anymore, though. You feel anything strange? It probably just sounds funny. It's the weather, probably. Damp air. Bad for the joints, you know.
DOCTOR: I do hear some crepitus, and there’s mild tenderness on the medial side of both knees. No significant swelling. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are two plus bilaterally. Not bad, not bad at all.
PATIENT: Ooh! That tickles! My reflexes are good, huh? That's what my ex-wife always said. Quick reflexes. Still got 'em, even after all these years. Used to be able to catch a flyin' baseball with my eyes closed. Well, not really with my eyes closed, but almost. You think I'll be able to play? Still got a good swing, you know. A little rusty, maybe. But good.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Bartok, your physical exam shows some expected wear and tear, but nothing immediately concerning. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure and the crepitus in your knees, I’d like to order some blood work – a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a CBC – just to get a better baseline. And an EKG to check your heart. We also need to get a set of x-rays of your knees to see what’s going on beneath the surface.
PATIENT: Blood work…? X-rays…? Doctor, that sounds… serious. Is something wrong? I just want to play baseball. I don’t want to be poked and prodded and… whatever it is you do with those machines. My ex-wife always liked all those tests, but I never really understood them. Is it expensive? I'm on Medicare, you know. Will it cover it? I just want to know if I can play. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, it's not necessarily serious. It’s just standard procedure to get a complete picture of your health, especially before starting any physical activity. It helps us ensure your safety and prevent any potential problems. The tests will give us a better understanding of your blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and the condition of your knees. Medicare should cover most of it, but we'll verify that with your insurance. We’ll also take a look at any limitations you might have with your knees and talk about potential treatments or modifications to help you play safely. Don't worry, it’s a fairly straightforward process. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Straightforward, huh? Well… I suppose so. If it’s for safety, I guess I should do it. I don’t want to pull a muscle or somethin’. My daughter would have my hide. She worries about me, just like my ex-wife. But… how long will it take? And where do I go? I don’t really like hospitals. Or… whatever place you send me to. And… will it hurt? Honestly, Doctor, I just want to play baseball.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. The blood work can be done right here in the clinic, it just takes a few minutes. And we can schedule the x-rays at the imaging center across the street, it’s a very quick and painless process. It shouldn't take more than fifteen minutes or so. As for pain, the blood draw is just a quick pinch, and the x-rays don’t involve any pain at all. We’ll get the results back within a few days, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan for you to play safely. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay. That… doesn’t sound so bad. Right here in the clinic, that’s good. And across the street… I can walk there. Fifteen minutes… I can handle that. As long as it doesn't take all day. And… no pain. Good. Alright, Doctor. Let’s do it. Let’s get this over with so I can play baseball. What do I need to do first? You want the blood now?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, let's start with the blood work. The phlebotomist, Maria, is just down the hall. She'll take care of you. I'll be here to discuss the results when they come back. Just tell her I sent you. Do you have any questions before we get started?
PATIENT: No… I think I’m good. Just… tell Maria to be gentle, okay? And… thanks, Doctor. For explainin’ everything. I just… want to play baseball. Maria, right? Okay. Here I go.
