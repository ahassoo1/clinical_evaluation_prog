DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's… my stomach. It's been, like, really upset for a bit now. Mostly just… a lot of diarrhea. It’s been going on and off, but it's been pretty constant lately, I think. I… honestly, I can't really remember exactly when it started, just that it's been a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. "A lot of diarrhea," and it's been ongoing for some time. That’s helpful to know. When you say "constant lately," could you give me a rough estimate of how many days it’s been happening consistently?
PATIENT: Hmm… consistently… oh, gosh. Maybe… a week? Possibly longer? It's hard to say, really. Things have been a little blurry lately, if I'm honest. I just know it's not going away, and it's… well, it's annoying. I feel like I have to be near a bathroom all the time. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Jase. It sounds very disruptive to your daily life. About a week, consistently… alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Oh, um… sometimes my stomach cramps a bit. Not terrible cramps, just… uncomfortable. And I've been feeling really tired, actually. Just… worn out. I thought it was just from everything, but maybe it’s connected? I don't really know. I haven’t noticed anything else, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and fatigue. Have you noticed any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting accompanying these symptoms?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills, definitely not. And… no, I haven’t been sick, like throwing up or anything. Just the… everything else. It's just been this constant… upset. I feel a little weak sometimes, but I don't think that's a fever. I'm sorry, I'm not very good at explaining things, am I?
DOCTOR: You're explaining perfectly fine, Jase. It's helpful to know what you aren’t experiencing as well. Let’s talk a little bit more broadly. Have you had any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my diet… not really, I don't think? My husband does most of the cooking, and he hasn't changed anything that I've noticed. We usually have… well, normal things. Rice, chicken, vegetables… I mean, nothing different than usual. Sometimes we have spicy food, but I've been eating that for years. Unless he’s been secretly changing things when I’m not looking? I doubt it, though. He’s pretty predictable.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. And have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No, not at all. We haven’t been anywhere. I… I mostly just go to work and come home. I haven't been on a vacation in… a long time. Honestly, I can't even remember the last time. Does that matter? Is that something that would cause this?
DOCTOR: It’s good information to have, Jase. Travel can sometimes be a source of gastrointestinal issues. Okay, let’s move on to some other questions. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don't think so. I mean, I haven't ever had a really bad reaction to anything. I get a little itchy sometimes, but that's probably just the weather. I'm not allergic to any medications that I know of. My husband always double-checks when I get a new prescription, just in case. He’s very careful.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, um… just the regular stuff, I think. For my blood pressure. A little pill every morning. And sometimes I take something for headaches, if they’re really bad. Just… ibuprofen, I think? Nothing else. Oh! And I take a vitamin D supplement, because my husband says I don’t get enough sun. He worries about me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take a medication for your blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed for headaches, and a Vitamin D supplement. Do you know the name of the blood pressure medication you’re taking?
PATIENT: Um… oh gosh. Let me think. It’s a little white pill… and the name… I think it starts with an ‘A’? Amlodipine? Is that right? Or something like that. My husband handles refilling it, so I don’t really pay attention. Sorry, I’m really not good with names.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Amlodipine is a good start. We can always double-check your medication list in our system. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or inflammatory bowel disease?
PATIENT: Um… well, my doctor told me a while ago that my intestines were… inflamed. Something about IBD? Or maybe it was… celiac? I don’t really remember. He did a lot of tests, and he said I needed to watch what I eat. He gave me a list of foods to avoid, but… honestly, I haven’t really followed it that closely. It’s been hard. I’m sorry, I know it’s not very helpful. My memory is just… not great.
DOCTOR: That's okay, Jase. It’s very helpful to know about the potential IBD diagnosis, even if you don't remember all the details. We can review your records to get a clearer picture. Do you know when this was diagnosed, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh… a long time ago. Maybe… five years ago? Possibly longer? It was before we moved here, I think. The doctor… he was really busy, and he didn't explain everything very well. He just gave me a bunch of papers and told me to follow up. I probably should have asked more questions, but I was… overwhelmed. It's all a bit blurry, honestly. I just remember he said something about my stomach not liking certain foods.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s understandable. We will definitely look into your previous records. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never had any surgeries, no. I... I don't really like hospitals, to be honest. My appendix was acting up when I was a kid, but it went away on its own. My mom said it was a miracle. So, no surgeries, definitely not.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease?
PATIENT: Um… well, my grandmother had… something with her stomach. I think it was… ulcers? And my uncle, on my husband’s side, he has diabetes. He has to take shots every day. Oh! And my aunt had cancer, but she… she beat it. It was a scary time. But other than that… not really that I know of. My family doesn’t really talk about health stuff much. It’s a bit of a taboo topic.
DOCTOR: Okay, ulcers in your grandmother, diabetes in your husband’s uncle, and a history of cancer in your aunt. That’s helpful to know. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Um… what do you mean? Do you want to know about my job? Or… my hobbies? I don't really have many hobbies, to be honest. I mostly just work and take care of the house.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that was unclear. By social history, I mean things like your occupation, whether you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs. Also, if you are married or live alone, and your general stress levels. It’s just to get a better understanding of your lifestyle.
PATIENT: Oh! Okay, I understand. Well, I work as a sales representative, mostly doing phone calls. It's… not very stressful, actually. I'm married, and we live in a house together. I don't smoke, and I hardly ever drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. And I definitely don’t do any drugs. I get a little stressed sometimes, with work and everything, but nothing major. My husband is very supportive, so that helps. He does most of the cooking and cleaning. I guess I'm pretty boring!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. So, sales representative, married, no smoking or recreational drugs, and minimal alcohol consumption, with some stress at work. Now, to get a better idea of what's going on, I would like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just… please be gentle? I'm not very good with… medical stuff.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible. I’m going to gently press on your stomach to feel for any tenderness or masses. Let me know if anything feels particularly painful. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now… they’re a little hyperactive. And I'm just going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is 130/80, your pulse is 88, and your temperature is 98.6. Overall, you don’t appear to be in any acute distress. However, your abdomen is slightly tender to palpation in the lower left quadrant. No rebound tenderness or guarding noted. Based on your symptoms and the initial exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing a flare-up of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, potentially complicated by some inflammation. Given your history of possible IBD, we should rule that out. I'd like to order some blood tests to check for inflammation and rule out infection, and a stool sample to check for any parasites or bacteria. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests and a… stool sample? Okay. Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is necessary. I just… I want to feel better. It’s just been going on for so long. Is it going to be a lot of tests? I don’t really like hospitals… or tests. But if it will help… then yes, please. I trust you.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, and we'll try to keep it as minimal as possible. The blood tests are pretty standard, and the stool sample is collected at home, so it shouldn't be too disruptive. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend sticking to a bland diet – things like rice, toast, and bananas – and staying well-hydrated. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods. I’m also going to give you a prescription for an anti-diarrheal medication to help manage the symptoms. And I want you to know that if you experience any severe symptoms – such as high fever, bloody stools, or severe abdominal pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Bland diet, avoid caffeine and spice, and the anti-diarrheal… okay. And go to the emergency room if it gets really bad. Um… will the anti-diarrheal medicine have side effects? And… is there anything I can do to help with the tiredness? It's really draining. And… thank you. For listening. It feels good to finally talk about it.
DOCTOR: Those are both excellent questions, Jase. The anti-diarrheal medication, Loperamide, can sometimes cause constipation or bloating, but those are usually mild side effects. If you experience any severe side effects, like abdominal pain or cramping, stop taking it and contact me. As for the tiredness, that's a common symptom with chronic diarrhea, especially if you're not absorbing nutrients properly. Staying well-hydrated is crucial, and eating small, frequent meals can help keep your energy levels up. We can also check your iron levels with the blood tests, as iron deficiency can contribute to fatigue. If the tiredness persists, we can discuss potential vitamin supplements. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we wrap up for today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve explained everything so well, and I feel… a little bit better, actually. Knowing that we’re going to figure it out. Can I… can I get a copy of the prescription and the instructions for the stool sample? Just so I don't forget anything. And… thank you again, Doctor Reisig. You’ve been very kind. I think I'm ready to go home now.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jase. Here you are. The prescription can be filled at any pharmacy, and the instructions detail everything you need to know for the stool sample. I’m glad I could help, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Take care of yourself, and please follow the recommendations. I’ll see you in one week. Have a good day, Jase. .
