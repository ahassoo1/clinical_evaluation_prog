DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Glowka, you say? Is that… Greek? Never mind. I… moved here. New place. Social visit, they told me to come. Something about… checking things. Old age, probably. They want to poke and prod. Don't remember much else.
DOCTOR: Yes, Glowka is Greek. And it’s perfectly alright if you’re not sure why you’re here today – that’s what I’m for. We’ll go through everything at your pace. “Checking things” sounds like a general check-up, which is a great idea. To start, can you tell me a little more about what’s been going on with you lately?
PATIENT: Lately? Hmm. Not much. Work, you know? Makeup. For the theater. Always work. People need to look good. It's… tiring. Lots of early mornings. And… faces. So many faces. I make them pretty. Or scary, sometimes. Depends on the play. Is this important? I don't feel sick, if that's what you want to know. Just… old. And tired. Very tired.
DOCTOR: That is important, Mr. Szmyd. It sounds like you have a very demanding job – early mornings and focusing on details like makeup artistry for the theater requires a lot of energy and concentration. It’s good you’re acknowledging the fatigue. Just to get a clearer picture, could you describe what the tiredness feels like?
PATIENT: Feels… like weights. On the eyes, mostly. And… the hands. Sometimes hard to hold the brushes steady. It's not… pain. Just… heavy. Like I need a long sleep. A very long sleep. And… things. I forget things, you know? Names. What I was going to say. Small things. It’s annoying. My ex-wife always said I was forgetful. She was… a difficult woman.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weights on your eyes and hands, difficulty with steadiness, and some memory lapses… these are all things we want to explore further. It's not uncommon to experience these symptoms as we get older, but it's important to understand what's causing them. You mentioned it's been bothering you for a while. Has this been gradual, or did it seem to come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. Always busy, you know? Didn't notice. Years and years of work. Always a play, always a face. Maybe… a little worse lately. More forgetting. More heavy. This last play was… stressful. The actress… very demanding. Always wanted it just so. She wore a lot of makeup. Very complicated designs. Maybe that… tired me out.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've been consistently very busy and under pressure for a long time. That can certainly take a toll on the body and mind. The recent play with the demanding actress could have exacerbated things. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask a few questions about your overall health. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Problems… hmm. Old age, mostly. Back trouble, a little. Nothing serious. The doctor… back in Russia, he gave me pills. Helped sometimes. Divorced wife didn't like the pills. Said I was… dependent. She was always complaining. And the knees. They ache when it rains. Other than that… I don't… recall. I had a flu, once. A bad one. But that was… long ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some back trouble, knee pain that flares up with the weather, and a history of the flu. It's good you've seen a doctor before for the back pain. Do you remember what those pills were for?
PATIENT: Pills… no. Small white ones, I think. Or maybe blue? Round ones. I don't… really pay attention to pills. The doctor gave them to me. For the back. He said… muscles. Something about muscles. My ex-wife threw them away. Said they made me… sleepy. And… grumpy. She always had an opinion about everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like we have limited information about those pills, which is okay. We can focus on what’s going on now. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. No. No surgeries. I… broke my arm once, when I was a boy. Fell from a tree. They put it in a cast. But that wasn’t a surgery, was it? Just… a cast. Very uncomfortable. Mother made me soup. Good soup. Everything hurt back then.
DOCTOR: No, a cast isn't a surgery. It sounds like you've been fortunate to avoid any major surgical procedures. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. Mother had… heart trouble, I think. She was always weak. Father… he was strong. But he drank a lot. And smoked. Didn't take care of himself. Brother… he’s in Siberia. Don't see him much. No idea what he's got. They never talked about… health. Not a very… communicative family.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of heart trouble on your mother’s side. It’s not uncommon for families to not discuss health matters. To get a better sense of your current situation, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… what does that mean? I work. Long hours. I eat… whatever’s quick. Sometimes soup. Don't have much time for… fancy things. Live in a small apartment. Very close to the theater. It's convenient. I used to drink, a little. But not anymore. Too much trouble. And… it made my ex-wife angry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. By lifestyle, I meant things like your diet, exercise habits, and whether you smoke or drink alcohol. You've answered those questions already, actually. Long hours at work, quick meals, and you used to drink alcohol but no longer do. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. No medications. I haven't taken anything since… well, since the pills. My ex-wife made me stop. Said they weren’t good for me. She was very… opinionated. I do take… coffee. Lots of coffee. To stay awake for work. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Coffee definitely counts! It’s a stimulant, and we’ll take that into consideration. Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s okay with you. This will just involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Physical… exam? Poke and prod, you said? Fine. Do what you have to do. Long as it doesn’t take too long. I have a play to think about. And… the actress. She expects perfection. Always.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as quick and efficient as possible. And I'll certainly keep the actress in mind – we want to make sure you’re at your best. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Could you please sit here and relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Relax? Hmm. Difficult. Always something to worry about. The play, the actress… and… everything. But… okay. I'll try. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, just stay still for a moment. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. It could be due to anxiety, or simply the fact that you were just talking about a stressful situation. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Take deep breaths for me, please.
PATIENT: Deep breaths… Heart… lungs… always something wrong with someone. My ex-wife was always complaining about her… something. Can’t remember what. Always a drama.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. That’s good. Now, I’m just going to do a quick neurological assessment. I’ll ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then I’ll check your reflexes. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes… yes… I'm following it. Is this important? My ex-wife said I had… good reflexes. She was always looking for something to praise. Or criticize. One or the other.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is important. It helps me assess your nervous system. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. It could be a normal variation, or a sign of mild nerve irritation. Finally, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and cognitive function. Can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today… hmm. August… the second? Or is it the third? No… the second. August the second. 2025, right? I think. I get confused sometimes. My ex-wife always knew the dates. She was very… organized.
DOCTOR: That's correct, August the second, 2025. Okay, Mr. Szmyd. That concludes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me, and the results of the exam, it seems like you’re experiencing some fatigue, memory lapses, and diminished reflexes. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but that could be due to stress. These symptoms could be due to a number of things, including normal aging, stress, or a mild vitamin deficiency. I'd like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. These will check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… more poking? Fine. Whatever you think. Long as it doesn't take too long. I have a play, you know. And… the actress. Always demanding. Is it expensive? My ex-wife would have complained about the cost. She always did.
DOCTOR: The tests are covered by Medicare, so there shouldn't be a significant cost to you. I'll have the lab draw a small sample of blood. It usually takes about 10-15 minutes. In the meantime, I also recommend getting a good night’s sleep, reducing stress if possible, and eating a healthy diet. We can also discuss some strategies for improving your memory, such as keeping a daily planner or using reminder apps. Would you like me to write you a referral for a sleep study, just in case there's an underlying sleep disorder contributing to your fatigue?
PATIENT: Sleep study? More tests? No. No more tests. I'm tired enough as it is. Just… the blood tests. And… tell me when I can go. I really need to get back. The actress… she doesn’t like to be kept waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just the blood tests then. I will write you a lab order and give it to you. The lab is just down the hall, in Suite 203. They're open until 5 PM today. I'll review the results as soon as they come back, and we can discuss the next steps at your follow-up appointment. I'll schedule that for two weeks from today, August 16th at 10 AM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: August the 16th… Yes. That should be alright. As long as it doesn't interfere with rehearsals. Rehearsals are… important. The actress… she has very strong opinions about everything. Just… don't keep me waiting too long.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll make a note of that. I'll see you on August 16th at 10 AM. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as fever, chest pain, or difficulty breathing, please seek immediate medical attention. Here is the lab order, and a summary of our discussion today. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all. Just… the tests. And the date. August the 16th. Thank you. I need to go now. The actress… she won't be happy.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. I understand. I wish you all the best with your play. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
