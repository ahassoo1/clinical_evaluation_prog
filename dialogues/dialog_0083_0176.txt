DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just…won't stop. Started a couple of days ago, and they're still going. More than 48 hours now, I think. It’s really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: I see. Hiccups that have been going on for more than 48 hours. That is quite bothersome. To help me understand what might be going on, could you describe them a little more?
PATIENT: Sure. They’re…normal hiccups, I guess. You know, that little jerk, and then you gulp air? They happen pretty randomly. Sometimes after I eat, sometimes just…sitting. They aren’t painful, exactly, but they’re exhausting. And embarrassing, when I’m with people. I manage a little entertainment venue, so I talk a lot. It’s hard to talk and hiccup at the same time! Do you need to know how many? I haven’t really counted, but it's…a lot. Several times an hour, easily.
DOCTOR: Several times an hour, easily. I understand. And they're not associated with any particular activity, just random. Okay. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them, even a little bit?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. I did have a really big glass of iced tea on Monday – it was very sweet. And I was a little rushed when I drank it. But honestly, I drink iced tea all the time. And I eat pretty normally. Maybe…stress? Things have been a bit hectic at the venue lately. We’re trying to book acts for the fall season, and it’s proving difficult. I don't think that's it, though. I handle stress pretty well. Oh! And I did laugh a lot with my friends on Sunday…does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a large iced tea on Monday, laughing on Sunday, and some stress with venue bookings. That gives me a bit to work with. Now, let's get a bit of your medical history. Have you had hiccups this persistent before?
PATIENT: No, never. I get hiccups sometimes, like anyone, but they always go away after a few minutes. This is…completely different. I mean, I’ve had hiccups for two days now. It’s not normal for me at all. And I haven’t been sick, or anything. No fever, no cough, no stomach problems. Just…hiccups. It’s very strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know – no prior history of prolonged hiccups and no other accompanying symptoms. I’m going to ask some general health questions now, if you don’t mind. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that’s it. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy. I try to eat well, and I walk every morning. My blood pressure is usually okay, although my doctor always tells me to watch my salt intake. But no major conditions, no. And I don’t take any regular medication. Just…the occasional pain reliever for a headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gallbladder removal ten years ago, and occasional pain reliever use. No other medical conditions or regular medications. Good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve eaten everything and been around all sorts of things without a problem. I’m lucky that way. My daughter is allergic to peanuts, so I’m very careful about checking labels when I’m with her, but I don’t have any allergies myself.
DOCTOR: That’s good. No known allergies. Now, just to be thorough, could you tell me about any major surgeries or hospitalizations you've had, besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Let me think…no, not really. The gallbladder was the only surgery I’ve had. I broke my wrist when I was a teenager – that required a cast, but no surgery. And I had tonsillitis as a child, so I was hospitalized for a few days, but that was a long time ago. Nothing major since then. I’ve been very fortunate, health-wise. This hiccup thing is really throwing me for a loop.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just the gallbladder removal and childhood tonsillitis. No other significant surgeries or hospitalizations. And finally, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, my mother had high blood pressure, and my father had diabetes. My sister is healthy, as far as I know. And my daughter is young, so it’s too early to tell about her. Nothing major, like cancer or heart disease, on either side of the family. It’s a pretty healthy bunch, mostly. Does that help? It’s hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. History of high blood pressure and diabetes in your parents. Okay, Ms. Redeye, I'm going to do a quick physical exam now. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take a look at your throat and abdomen. It's unlikely to find anything definitive, but it's important to rule out any obvious causes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Go ahead. Honestly, I'm just hoping you can figure out what’s going on and make them stop! It’s starting to drive me crazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear. Your throat looks normal, no signs of irritation. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. No masses or organomegaly are detected. I don't hear or feel anything concerning, which is good. It does seem, based on the exam, that this is likely not caused by anything structural or immediately dangerous. However, hiccups lasting this long do warrant further investigation to rule out less common causes.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s…reassuring to hear it’s not something serious. But frustrating that you can't find anything! So…what does that mean? What kind of investigation? And what could it be, if everything seems normal? Is it…stress, then? Even if I don't feel particularly stressed?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Redeye. It’s definitely not ideal when we can’t pinpoint the exact cause. While stress can certainly contribute, and it’s possible it's playing a role even if you don't consciously feel overwhelmed, prolonged hiccups can sometimes be related to things like irritation of the phrenic nerve – that’s the nerve that controls the diaphragm – or even less common issues with the central nervous system. To be thorough, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying lung conditions and a basic metabolic panel to check your electrolyte levels. Sometimes, electrolyte imbalances can cause persistent hiccups. We'll also check your thyroid function, as that can sometimes be a factor. Would you be agreeable to those tests?
PATIENT: Okay…tests. That sounds…involved. But if it will help figure out what’s going on, yes, absolutely. I just want these hiccups to stop. A chest X-ray and a blood test…is there anything else? Will I need to fast for the blood test? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Those are the main tests for now, Ms. Redeye. No need for a full fasting period, but please refrain from eating or drinking anything for about two hours before the blood draw to ensure accurate results. The lab usually gets the results back within 24 to 48 hours. Once I have those, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if the hiccups become significantly worse – if they’re interfering with your breathing or causing severe chest pain – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about the tests or the plan so far?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds…reasonable. 24 to 48 hours…I can manage that. No fasting, good. And I'll keep an eye out for anything worse. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to figure this out. I’ll go schedule the tests now. Is there anything I need to bring with me to the lab?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Redeye. I'm glad I could help, and I’m optimistic we can find the cause and get you some relief. Just bring your insurance information, if you have it, and your photo ID. The lab will likely ask for those. Otherwise, you don’t need to bring anything special. If you have any questions or concerns after the tests, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. We're here to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Alanes. You've been very kind. I'll go schedule the tests and call if I have any trouble. Hopefully, this will finally put an end to these wretched hiccups!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Redeye. It was a pleasure meeting you. I hope the tests provide us with some answers. Please do call if you have any issues. Have a good day, and try to relax as much as possible. .
