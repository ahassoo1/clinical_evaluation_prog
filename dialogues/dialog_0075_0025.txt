DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice meet you too. I… want to know ‘bout my people, long time ago. My grandkids, they ask. I think… test, for see where I come from? DNA, they call it?
DOCTOR: Ah, I see. You’re interested in learning about your ancestry, perhaps with a DNA test?
PATIENT: Yes, that right. Like… where my family from, before Marshall Islands? I build boat, small ones, with wood. Always think ‘bout the people who build first boats, you know? Maybe test can tell me? I no so smart with all this new stuff.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It is a lot of new information. A DNA test can potentially give you some insight into your ancestral origins, tracing your lineage back generations. However, it's important to know what the tests can and cannot tell you. Before we discuss testing options, let’s talk a bit about your family history, if you don’t mind. It helps to have a good understanding of what we already know. Do you know where your parents and grandparents were from originally, besides the Marshall Islands?
PATIENT: Hmm… parents, they from Majuro, I think. Grandparents… hard remember. Old man, he fish all time. Grandma… she make mats, very good mats. They no talk much ‘bout before. Just say “Island people.” I no know other islands. Just Majuro. I sorry, Doctor. I wish I remember more for grandkids. They ask ‘bout names, and I… I forget.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. Memories fade, and it's common for stories to be lost over time, especially with oral traditions. “Island people” is a good starting point, though. Majuro is a beautiful atoll. So, to clarify, your parents were both from Majuro, and you don’t have much information about their parents or ancestors beyond that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s right. Majuro side. They no travel much, my parents. Stay close to water. I hear stories 'bout other islands, but… just stories. No names, no places. Maybe test can find something? I hope so. Grandkids… they very curious. Want to know everything.
DOCTOR: A DNA test could be helpful, yes. There are several companies that offer ancestry testing, and they analyze your DNA to estimate your ethnic origins and potentially connect you with relatives. However, it's important to manage expectations. The accuracy varies depending on the company and the populations included in their database. For populations like those from the Marshall Islands, the data may be less comprehensive. Before we proceed with ordering a test, let’s quickly review your medical history. Just to make sure there’s nothing that would contraindicate it. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I no take many medicines. Just for old bones, sometimes. Doctor give me… pills, white ones. That's all. I eat fish, lots of fish. And taro. No trouble with food, no trouble with anything, really. Strong man, for old guy.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear, Mr. Scobie! It sounds like you lead a very healthy lifestyle. And good for you staying active. Just to be precise, can you recall the name of the medication you take for your bones?
PATIENT: Hmm… white pills… I think… Doctor Ito give me. For the ache. No remember name. Small bottle. I give to nurse when I come for check-up. She know. I no good with names, you see. Sorry again, Doctor. Old brain, slow sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. Don’t apologize. We can always check your medication list in our system. We'll confirm it with the nurse. Now, regarding the DNA test… there are a few companies I recommend. 23andMe and AncestryDNA are both popular choices. They both require a saliva sample, which you can collect at home and mail in. The results typically take a few weeks to process. Would you like me to provide you with some information about these companies and their services?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. Information good. I need to tell grandkids what it cost too. And… how hard it is to do. I no so good with computer. Maybe nurse can help me send the spit?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here's some information about both 23andMe and AncestryDNA. You can see the costs and what each test offers. Both are fairly straightforward – they send you a collection kit, you provide a saliva sample, and mail it back. The hardest part is probably creating an account online, but our nurses are happy to assist you with that. They can help you set up an account and submit the sample. 23andMe is generally a little less expensive, around $99, and focuses primarily on ancestry. AncestryDNA is a bit more costly, around $149, but offers more tools for building a family tree. Both provide estimated ethnic origins, but the detail can vary. Do either of those sound appealing?
PATIENT: Hmm… $99 sound better, for start. I no so good with family tree. Just want to know where I come from. Maybe little bit about the people. $99, that okay. Nurse can help me, you say? Good. I trust you, Doctor, and I trust the nurses. They always kind.
DOCTOR: Excellent choice, Mr. Scobie. I'll order the 23andMe kit for you. It should arrive within a week or so. Yes, our nurses are excellent, and they will be happy to help you with the process. They can walk you through the sample collection and account creation. Do you have any other questions for me today, or is that everything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's everything. Thank you very much. You make me feel better, knowing I can find out about my people. And thank you for the nurses. They good people.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. It was my pleasure to help. I hope you enjoy learning about your ancestry. And yes, we’re very fortunate to have such a wonderful nursing staff. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day, and I look forward to hearing about your results.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
