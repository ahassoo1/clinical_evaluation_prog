DOCTOR: Hello, Chelise. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Well, I got a letter from the lab, you see. It said my cholesterol is a little high. Hyper… something. I don’t really understand all those words, to be honest. They just said I should come talk to someone.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. Those lab reports can be confusing. Hyperlipidemia, that's what they likely said – basically, it means your cholesterol is elevated. It’s good you came in to discuss it. Let’s talk a bit about what that means and what we can do. First, do you have any family history of high cholesterol, heart disease, or strokes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! My father, he had… well, not a stroke exactly, but he had some heart problems when he got older. He needed a… a bypass, I think it was. And my mother, she took pills for her cholesterol for years and years. So, yes, it runs in the family, I guess. I always thought I was okay because I’m tall and… well, I’ve always been fairly active, walking and things. But maybe that doesn’t matter so much?
DOCTOR: That’s important information, thank you. Family history definitely plays a role, even with a healthy lifestyle. Being tall and active is wonderful, and those are excellent habits to maintain! It doesn’t guarantee everything, unfortunately. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take anything regularly. Just… sometimes a pain reliever for a headache, if I need it. And no allergies, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I usually just get a little sleepy if I take anything, but that’s all.
DOCTOR: Good to know. No regular medications and no known allergies – that’s helpful. Now, besides the lab results, are you experiencing any symptoms currently?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… not really. I feel fine, actually. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I’m 54, so I figure that’s just getting older! No chest pain, no shortness of breath, nothing like that. I’ve been a little worried about this cholesterol thing, but I feel okay. Does that make sense? I'm not sure what cholesterol feels like, if that's what you mean.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. Often, high cholesterol doesn't have any noticeable symptoms, especially in the early stages. That's why regular check-ups are so important. Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Then we can talk about what the lab results showed in more detail and discuss some options. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. Listening and checking… that sounds sensible. I just want to get this sorted out, you know? I don't want to end up like my father, needing a… a bypass.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll take things one step at a time. And we'll certainly work to prevent anything like your father experienced. If you'd like, you can go ahead and get comfortable on the exam table, and we’ll get started. Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated, 138 over 82. And your heart and lungs sound good – nice and clear. I don’t hear anything concerning at this time. Now, let's take a closer look at those lab results...
PATIENT: Okay, good to hear about the heart and lungs. A little high blood pressure… is that related to the cholesterol, do you think? I try to eat fairly healthy, mostly. Not much fast food, lots of vegetables. Maybe I should cut back on salt a bit? I do like a bit of salt on my tomatoes, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s possible they’re related, yes. High blood pressure and high cholesterol often go hand-in-hand, and share some of the same risk factors – diet, lifestyle, genetics. It doesn’t automatically mean one causes the other, but they often occur together. Your total cholesterol is 240 mg/dL, which is above the desirable level. Your LDL cholesterol – that's the "bad" cholesterol – is 160 mg/dL, also elevated. Your HDL – the “good” cholesterol – is 45 mg/dL, which is a bit on the lower side. And your triglycerides are 150 mg/dL, which is borderline high. Does that all sound like a lot of numbers?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes! That is a lot of numbers. LDL, HDL… it’s all a bit confusing. So, the higher the LDL, the worse? And the lower the HDL… is that bad too? I really wish I’d paid more attention in health class. I mostly just remember learning about… well, other things. Do these numbers mean I need to take pills already? I really don’t like taking pills.
DOCTOR: It is a lot to take in, and you're not alone in feeling overwhelmed. You're right, higher LDL is less desirable – it contributes to plaque buildup in your arteries. And lower HDL is also not ideal, as it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. Think of LDL as “lousy” cholesterol and HDL as “helpful” cholesterol. As for needing pills right away… not necessarily. There are several things we can try first, starting with lifestyle modifications. We can talk about diet, exercise, and weight management. We'll see how you respond to those changes before we consider medication. Before we go any further, do you have any questions about these numbers or what I've said so far?
PATIENT: Okay, “lousy” and “helpful” – that’s a good way to remember it! Lifestyle changes… that sounds good. I can walk more. And maybe I do need to cut back on the cheese. I do love a good piece of cheese with my tomatoes. What kind of exercise is best? Do I need to join a gym? And what about the diet… are there foods I should definitely avoid? I really don’t want to give up tomatoes completely.
DOCTOR: That’s the spirit! And absolutely no need to give up tomatoes completely! They're full of good nutrients. For exercise, anything that gets your heart rate up is beneficial – brisk walking, swimming, cycling, even gardening. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. Joining a gym isn’t necessary, unless you prefer that environment. As for diet, it’s less about completely avoiding foods and more about making healthier choices. Reduce saturated and trans fats – those are found in red meat, processed foods, and fried foods. Increase fiber – fruits, vegetables, whole grains. And limit cholesterol-rich foods – egg yolks, organ meats. This handout has some good guidelines and recipes. We can also discuss it with a registered dietitian if you’d like. They can create a personalized meal plan for you. What do you think about starting with these changes and rechecking your cholesterol in three months?
PATIENT: That sounds… manageable. Three months isn’t so long. And a dietitian… that’s a good idea, actually. Maybe someone to help me figure out the cheese situation. Okay, I can definitely walk more. And try to eat… better. Less cheese, more vegetables. And I’ll see what the dietitian says about the tomatoes. Is there anything else I should be doing? Like… are there any vitamins I should take? Or… anything I should be worrying about? I always worry about everything.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re thinking about all of this, and it’s perfectly normal to worry. For vitamins, a daily multivitamin is generally a good idea, just to ensure you’re getting all the essential nutrients. But don't rely on vitamins as a substitute for a healthy diet. As for things to worry about… the main goal right now is to lower your LDL cholesterol and improve your overall cardiovascular health. With lifestyle changes, we can significantly reduce your risk. It’s also important to be aware of symptoms of heart disease – chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations. But don’t let that worry you unnecessarily. Just be mindful of your body and report any new or concerning symptoms to me right away. Here's the referral for the dietitian. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. We'll recheck your cholesterol in three months. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Three months… and less cheese. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and you’ve made me feel much less worried. I appreciate your patience. I think I can do this.
DOCTOR: You absolutely can, Chelise. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, small changes can make a big difference. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in three months!
