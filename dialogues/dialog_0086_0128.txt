DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Voner, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Mmm, Mrtic, is it? Yes. Well, it’s my joints, mostly. They get so stiff in the mornings. It's… annoying, really. Not terrible, just… old, I guess. It's been happening for a while now. I don't really… keep track of time very well.
DOCTOR: "Old," right. Well, we’ll see about that. “A while now” is a bit vague, though. Could you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a rough estimate… Hmm. Maybe… a year? Or longer? It all sort of blends together, you know? It’s not sudden, it just… gradually got worse. I don’t think I’ve done anything to cause it, if that makes sense. Just… waking up feeling like I need to oil my hinges.
DOCTOR: "Oil your hinges," yes, I understand. Gradual onset is… common. And no specific injury or event that triggered it?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I mostly just… do things. You know, childcare. Little ones are always moving, so I'm up and down a lot. But I’ve been doing that for years, too! It’s… hard to say if that’s got anything to do with it. I don't really remember feeling this bad while I was doing it, if that makes sense. It’s more the mornings, like I said.
DOCTOR: So, the stiffness is primarily a morning thing, and it doesn’t seem to be directly related to activity… or, it wasn’t at first. Is it getting worse with activity now?
PATIENT: Oh… now that you mention it… maybe a little. Not awful, just… after a long day with the children, bending and lifting… it feels a bit more achy. I just thought it was… being tired, you know? But yes, I suppose it is a bit worse after being on my feet all day. It's hard to tell sometimes. Do you… do you think it's something serious?
DOCTOR: Serious is a strong word. It could be a number of things. We need to explore it a bit more to determine the cause. Let’s start with a review of your other health issues. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh… well, not really. I mean, I'm… old! Nothing the doctor ever really did anything about, you know? Just… aches and pains of getting older. My… husband, he used to take me to the doctor when I complained, but… that was a long time ago. He’s… gone now. I don't really have any regular… conditions, I guess. Just… this. And I’m not very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Right. No prior diagnoses. And you're not currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Never really been one for pills. My husband, he took some for his… heart, I think, but I always managed to avoid them. I prefer a bit of… rest, and maybe some warm tea. That sorts most things out. Although, it's not helping the joints much lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years! My mother made me try everything. No… I don't think I have any allergies. Although, I get a bit itchy sometimes when I’m around… cats. But that’s just… a little itch, not a proper allergy. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It’s good to know. We’ll proceed as if it’s not a significant allergy, for now. Okay, Ms. Voner, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check the range of motion in your joints and see if there’s any swelling or tenderness. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I'm not afraid of a little poking and prodding. Just… be gentle, please. My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as gentle as possible. If you feel any sharp pain, please let me know immediately. We’ll start with your hands… Please extend your arms like this. Okay. Some crepitus in both hands with flexion and extension… slight tenderness on the dorsal aspect of both wrists… Range of motion is reduced approximately 20% bilaterally. Now, let’s check your knees. Please bend your knees as far as you comfortably can.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a bit uncomfortable. It clicks a bit. Always has, really. But it’s… tighter now, I suppose. It’s not painful painful, just… stiff. And a little bit achy. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Some crepitus with flexion and extension, as you noted. Minimal effusions bilaterally… slight tenderness along the medial joint line of both knees… Range of motion is reduced approximately 30% bilaterally. Okay. And finally, let’s check your ankles. Just rotate them for me, clockwise and then counter-clockwise.
PATIENT: It's… tricky. They don't move as freely as they used to. It feels… tight, around the bone. It's hard to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, just… restricted. Oh dear… I hope I’m not making a fuss. It's just… getting older, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Decreased range of motion in both ankles with some crepitus… minimal tenderness to palpation. Right. Okay, Ms. Voner. Based on your history and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms consistent with osteoarthritis. It’s a degenerative joint condition, meaning it’s caused by wear and tear on the joints over time. It’s very common, particularly as we get older. However, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order some blood work and X-rays of your hands, knees and ankles. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… osteoarthritis. That sounds… serious. But you said it’s common? So it's not… my fault? Blood work and X-rays… yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Will the X-rays… hurt? And the blood work… I don't like needles very much.
DOCTOR: It's not your fault at all, Ms. Voner. It’s simply a natural process of aging. The X-rays are completely painless – it’s just a brief exposure to radiation. And the blood work… yes, there will be a needle, but it’s a very quick prick. The phlebotomist is very good, and it will be over before you know it. We'll just need a small sample of blood. The blood work will help us rule out other conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory markers. The X-rays will show us the extent of the joint damage. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: Rheumatoid arthritis… that sounds… worse than osteoarthritis. So you're checking to see if it's not that? That's… reassuring, I suppose. Will the X-rays show… how bad it is? I don’t want to know if my bones are terribly damaged. Will it change anything if it's… bad?
DOCTOR: The X-rays will show the extent of the wear and tear on your joints, yes. It will allow us to see if there’s narrowing of the joint space, bone spurs, or other changes consistent with osteoarthritis. Knowing the extent of the damage helps us determine the best course of treatment. It doesn’t necessarily mean we need to do anything drastic, but it allows us to tailor a plan to your specific needs. Treatment options can include physical therapy, pain management, lifestyle modifications, and in some cases, medications. We'll discuss all of these options in detail once we have the results of the tests. I’ll write you a referral for the blood work and X-rays. You can schedule those appointments at your convenience. Do you have any difficulty getting transportation to the lab and imaging center?
PATIENT: Oh… so it’s not a death sentence, is it? Lifestyle modifications… what does that mean? Do I have to… give up tea? Transportation… hmm. No, I think my… a friend, a neighbor, she sometimes helps me out. She drives. Yes, that should be alright. Will the results take long? I don’t want to be waiting for weeks and worrying.
DOCTOR: Certainly not a death sentence, Ms. Voner. Lifestyle modifications simply mean making small changes to help manage your symptoms. And no, you do not have to give up tea! It could mean things like maintaining a healthy weight, staying active, and avoiding activities that aggravate your joints. The results should be back within a week or so. Once I have them, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Here’s the referral. It includes the details of the lab and imaging center, as well as the tests I’m ordering. Do you have any questions about the form itself?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Tea is very important. Hmm… it's… very small writing. The address… yes, I think I recognize that lab. It’s near the bakery, isn’t it? That's convenient. I don't think I have any questions. It all seems… very official. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Voner. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’re here to help. I’ll see you in about a week. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I think I'll go have a cup of tea now.
