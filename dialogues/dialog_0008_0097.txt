DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. I'm Dr. Cumper. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, my husband, Farid, suggested I come. He’s been rather insistent about getting things “in order,” as he puts it. I believe he wants some… paperwork done, regarding what happens if, heaven forbid, something should occur. He mentioned something about a form, an “advance directive,” I think? I confess, I don’t entirely understand what’s involved, but he assures me it's important.
DOCTOR: Alright, Marija. It sounds like Farid is thinking ahead, which is very responsible of him. An advance directive – sometimes called a living will – is a document that outlines your wishes for medical care should you become unable to speak for yourself. It’s about your preferences. We can certainly go through that today, and I'm happy to answer any questions you have. Before we dive into that though, is there anything else bringing you in today?
PATIENT: No, no, that is the only thing. Farid simply worries excessively. Though, I suppose it’s better to be safe. I haven’t been feeling unwell, thankfully. It’s purely this… organizational matter he’s fixated on. Honestly, I find the whole thing rather morbid. But if it will appease him… Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: I understand your feelings completely. It is a difficult topic. We'll go at your pace. First, just to get a baseline, have you had any significant medical issues in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? Well… I had a rather unpleasant bout of food poisoning in Marrakech, oh, fifteen years ago now. It required a visit to the hospital, but nothing serious. Beyond that… I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. A few colds, naturally, but nothing that hasn’t resolved on its own. I do take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor in Rabat recommended it, the sun isn’t quite the same here, you know. Other than that… no. I assure you, Doctor, I am not a frequent visitor to medical facilities.
DOCTOR: Okay, food poisoning fifteen years ago, resolved without complications, and a vitamin D supplement. Good to know. Any surgeries or hospitalizations besides the food poisoning incident?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I’ve never required surgery. Not even to have my tonsils out as a child! My mother always said I had a strong constitution. She was very proud of that, actually. Honestly, the idea of willingly going under the knife… it’s rather barbaric, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother lived to be eighty-seven, a very robust woman. She passed away peacefully in her sleep. My father… he had some heart trouble in his later years, but it wasn't diagnosed until he was well into his seventies. My brother, Ahmed, is perfectly healthy, a bit overweight perhaps, but otherwise fine. There’s no history of anything… serious, if that’s what you mean. No cancers, no neurological conditions… nothing that would be of concern, I should think. We’re a fairly healthy family, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, thank you. Now, just to cover all bases, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, Doctor, I do not. I eat everything. I’ve traveled extensively throughout North Africa and the Middle East, you know. One must be adaptable. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Though, I do find some perfumes rather overpowering, but that’s a matter of preference, not an allergy. Honestly, I consider myself quite fortunate in that regard. It’s a blessing, really.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Excellent. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the vitamin D supplement?
PATIENT: No, just the vitamin D. As I said, I rarely require anything. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. A bit of mint tea, some rest… that usually suffices. I don’t believe in filling one’s body with unnecessary chemicals. It disrupts the natural balance, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: Right. No other medications. Now, before we get into the advance directive itself, let me just quickly check your vital signs. It's standard procedure, even if you're feeling perfectly well. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, must we? Really, Doctor, I assure you, I am perfectly fine. But… … very well. If it’s absolutely necessary. Though I do hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a luncheon engagement later with some… rather important people.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit here for a moment, I’ll quickly take your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Honestly, the fuss. I haven’t been subjected to this level of scrutiny since entering customs in Cairo. Do be quick, please. And try not to poke me too much.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 128 over 78. Pulse is 72 and regular. And your temperature is 98.6. Everything seems within normal limits. Now, as we discussed, we’re here to talk about an advance directive. Essentially, this document allows you to make your wishes known regarding your medical care should you become unable to do so yourself. It’s a very important piece of paperwork…
PATIENT: Yes, yes, my husband explained it all, rather exhaustively, I might add. He’s been reading articles online, you see. It’s all about… ‘end-of-life care,’ isn’t it? I find the whole topic rather morbid, but if it will appease Farid… What exactly does one write in this document? And who decides what constitutes ‘unable to speak for myself?’ Is a slight headache sufficient? Honestly, the ambiguity is rather concerning.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about the ambiguity. It is important to be clear. “Unable to speak for yourself” generally means you’re unable to communicate your wishes due to a medical condition – a coma, severe stroke, advanced dementia, for example. A slight headache wouldn’t qualify. The document allows you to name a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you can't. You also outline your preferences for things like resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes, and pain management. We have a standard form here, which I can walk you through section by section. It's broken down into manageable parts. Do you want to start with the section about naming your healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: Very well. My healthcare proxy, you say? That would be Farid, naturally. He’s rather… assertive in these matters. Though I do hope he’ll listen to reason. He has a tendency to be… overly enthusiastic about aggressive interventions. I wouldn’t want to be kept alive by machines simply because he can’t bear to say goodbye. But yes, Farid. Put him down. And please ensure there’s a clause stating he must consult with a qualified physician before making any… drastic decisions. I don’t want him relying solely on internet articles.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m adding Farid as your healthcare proxy. And I’ll definitely include a clause stating he must consult with a qualified physician before making any decisions. That’s a very sensible request. Now, the next section asks about your preferences for life-sustaining treatment. This covers things like CPR, intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Do you have any thoughts on those treatments?
PATIENT: Life-sustaining treatment… Honestly, the thought of being hooked up to machines is rather appalling. I’ve seen it in hospitals, you know. It’s not a dignified way to go. If my condition is… irreversible, I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially. No CPR, no intubation, no feeding tubes. Let nature take its course, as they say. I’ve lived a full life, I’ve traveled the world, I’ve experienced everything I wanted to. I wouldn’t want to prolong the inevitable simply to satisfy someone else’s grief. Do you understand? I want a ‘do not resuscitate’ order, quite clear. I don't want any heroic measures.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm documenting your wishes for “do not resuscitate” and “do not intubate.” We will also include a statement regarding no artificial nutrition or hydration. Just to be absolutely clear, this means that if you were to experience a cardiac arrest or respiratory failure, medical personnel would focus on providing comfort care rather than attempting to revive you. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Precisely. Comfort care. Dignity. That is all I ask. I don’t want to be a burden, prolonging the suffering for everyone involved. My husband may disagree, he tends towards… optimism, even in the face of adversity, but I have given this considerable thought. I am quite certain this is what I want. And please, ensure the document is legally binding. I wouldn't want any ambiguity or challenges from… well, from anyone.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’m adding a statement regarding legal validity, and the requirement for two witnesses. We’ll ensure the document is properly executed and legally sound. The final section covers pain management. Do you have any preferences regarding pain relief?
PATIENT: Pain management… Naturally, I would want to be kept comfortable. I don’t believe in suffering needlessly. If I am in pain, I want to be medicated. I don’t want to be lucid at the expense of my own comfort. As long as it doesn’t… interfere with my ability to appreciate my surroundings, of course. A little discomfort is tolerable, but I don’t want to be writhing in agony. And please, ensure the medication is administered promptly. I wouldn't want to be pleading for relief. Is that clear?
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm documenting your preferences for adequate pain management, with a focus on comfort. We’ll ensure it’s clearly stated that your comfort is a priority. That completes the main sections of the advance directive. I’m going to print it out now, and we can go through it together, section by section, to make sure everything is accurate and reflects your wishes. Then, you and two witnesses will need to sign it.
PATIENT: Very well. That sounds… thorough. I confess, I’m rather looking forward to being finished with this whole ordeal. It’s been… draining, to say the least. Hopefully, my husband will be satisfied with the results. Though I suspect he’ll have some… opinions. But let’s get it over with. The sooner it’s signed, the sooner I can return to a more peaceful existence.
DOCTOR: Alright, here’s the document. As you can see, it outlines everything we’ve discussed. Please take your time and read through it carefully. If you see anything you want to change or clarify, don’t hesitate to let me know. I’m happy to go through it with you section by section. We’ll need two adult witnesses who are not family members or beneficiaries in your will to sign as well.
PATIENT: Hmm… yes… “Do not resuscitate…” That’s correct. “No intubation…” Good. “Artificial nutrition and hydration declined…” Excellent. This seems… comprehensive, I suppose. Though I must say, the language is rather… clinical. Still, it’s the content that matters, isn’t it? This section regarding pain management… it’s a bit vague, don’t you think? Could we perhaps add a clause specifying the type of medication I would prefer? Something… soothing, rather than overly potent? I wouldn't want to be completely incapacitated.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see what you mean. We can certainly add a clause specifying a preference for a more soothing medication, perhaps with a focus on non-opioid options if possible. We can also add a statement that you want to remain as alert and comfortable as possible. How about this: "Patient prefers non-opioid pain management options whenever possible, with a focus on maintaining alertness and comfort." Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, that’s… satisfactory. “Maintaining alertness and comfort…” That’s precisely what I want. It’s all about dignity, isn't it? Yes, that will do nicely. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’m ready to sign. The sooner this is finished, the better. Hopefully, my husband won’t attempt to renegotiate the terms. He has a tendency to… overthink things.
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. If you could sign here, and then we’ll need two witnesses to sign as well. I have some forms here explaining the witness requirements, just to ensure everything is legally sound. Do you have anyone with you today who could serve as a witness?
PATIENT: Unfortunately, no. Farid insisted on remaining at home to… “prepare the celebratory luncheon,” as he put it. He claims it’s a momentous occasion. I’m afraid I’ll have to find two suitable witnesses elsewhere. Perhaps my neighbor, Mrs. Dubois, and the concierge at my building? They both seem… sensible enough. Honestly, the whole process is rather cumbersome, isn’t it? It’s just a piece of paper, after all. There. Done. Now, let’s hope it’s enough to satisfy everyone.
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. Your signature is here, and we just need the two witnesses. As you said, Mrs. Dubois and the concierge should be fine, as long as they're not family members or beneficiaries in your will. Here are some instructions for them to read, and a place for their signatures and dates. Once you have those signatures, please keep the original document in a safe place where it can be easily accessed in an emergency. Well, Marija, that concludes our discussion. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is all. You have been… patient, despite my… reservations. I confess, I find the whole concept rather morbid, but I suppose it’s better to be prepared for the worst. Thank you for your assistance. And thank you for not judging my… skepticism. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I must return home and prepare for my husband’s celebratory luncheon. I suspect it will be… elaborate.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Marija. I’m glad I could help. And don’t worry about the skepticism – it’s perfectly natural. Have a good day, and enjoy your luncheon.
