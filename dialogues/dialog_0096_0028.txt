DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. I’m Dr. Burlingham. Now, you’re 89 years young, that's wonderful! What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s this cough, you see. It just won’t go away. It's been bothering me for… well, I’d say about three weeks now, maybe a little longer. It’s mostly at night, keeps me up. And I get so breathless sometimes with it.
DOCTOR: Hmm, three weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, three weeks. Though, it’s hard to be exact, you know? Time… it slips away. But definitely over three weeks. It feels worse when I lie down, and I have to sit up to breathe easier. It's tiring, very tiring.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. So, it's a cough, mostly at night, making you breathless, and worse when you lie flat. Any fever, chills, or body aches along with it?
PATIENT: No, no fever that I’ve noticed. And no chills, not really. My bones ache sometimes, but that’s just…old age, I think! It’s not with the cough, you understand? It's a separate sort of ache. Just the usual creaks and groans. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I understand. "Usual creaks and groans." Alright. And what about anything you’ve tried to help it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, I’ve tried a little of everything! My daughter, Esmeralda, she brought over some cough syrup. The cherry kind. Didn't do much. I’ve been drinking warm tea with honey, that soothes for a bit. And I try to stay hydrated, like the nurse always tells me. But nothing seems to really stop it. It just… lingers.
DOCTOR: Cherry syrup, warm tea... good, good. Now, are you bringing up any mucus when you cough?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. It’s… well, it’s clear mostly. Sometimes a little bit white. Not much, though. And it doesn’t bother me much except when I cough it up, of course! It's not like a terrible, thick stuff, if that makes sense. Just… a little dampness.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. Now that you mention it. My feet do feel a little puffy sometimes, especially at the end of the day. And my ankles… they're not as pointy as they used to be! Esmeralda said it could be from the heat, but I hadn't really thought about it. Is that… bad? It doesn’t hurt, but it’s definitely noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Puffy ankles... Alright, let's have a listen to your lungs. Just breathe normally through your mouth, if you don't mind.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, dear. Whatever you need. I’m used to this. Just tell me if I need to do anything different. I always feel a little silly when someone listens to my chest!
DOCTOR: Okay... take a deep breath... and exhale. Hmm. I'm hearing some… wheezing, and some crackles, particularly at the base of your lungs. It doesn't sound terrible, but it is something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Crackles… and wheezing? I remember my husband, Ricardo, he used to wheeze something awful when he had that bad cold. Is it a cold, Doctor? Or is it something else? My heart… it hasn’t been the strongest lately, you know. Is it my heart making the crackles?
DOCTOR: It could be a number of things, Nadene. Your heart is a possibility, yes, and it's good you mention that. The crackles could also be fluid in the lungs. We’ll need to do a chest X-ray to get a better look. And I'd like to order an EKG to check your heart rhythm as well. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, an X-ray and… an EKG? Alright, dear. If that’s what you think is best. I trust your judgement. I’ve always been a bit scared of X-rays, but if it will help find out what's going on… yes, do what you need to do. Will it be very uncomfortable? And how long will it take? I have to get home for Esmeralda, she’s bringing dinner tonight. She makes a wonderful pupusa.
DOCTOR: The X-ray is very quick, Nadene, just a few seconds. You’ll stand up against a plate, and the technician will take a picture. The EKG involves some sticky pads on your chest, it doesn't hurt at all. It will take about fifteen minutes. We’ll get the results relatively quickly, and then we can discuss them. Let’s get those ordered now. A nurse will be in shortly to take you for the X-ray. In the meantime, I'm going to ask you some questions about your medical history, if that's okay. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, that doesn’t sound too bad. Fifteen minutes, I can manage that. And sticky pads, alright. I’ve been in the hospital a few times, yes. Mostly for my heart, like I said. I had a bad episode about ten years ago, they kept me in for a week. And another time, I broke my hip when I fell in the garden. That was a terrible ordeal! Lots of pain, and then physical therapy… It was Esmeralda who took care of me then, too. She’s a good daughter. Is there anything specific you need to know about those hospital stays?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a heart episode ten years ago, and a hip fracture. Was the heart episode diagnosed as anything specific?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the doctor said it was… congestive heart failure. That's what he called it. Something about the heart not being able to pump properly. I’ve been on medication for it ever since, little pills. I take them every day, try to remember. Sometimes I forget, but Esmeralda keeps track. She’s very good at that. They adjusted the dosage a few times over the years. Is that what you need to know? Anything else about the heart failure?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. So, congestive heart failure, managed with medication. And what medications are you currently taking, if you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... There's one for the blood pressure, a little white pill. And a water pill, to get rid of the puffiness. And another one, a pink one, for the heart itself. I think it's called…digoxin? Or something like that. It’s hard to remember all the names! I have a list at home, but I didn’t bring it with me today. Esmeralda usually tells me what to take, but she's not here now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure medication, a diuretic for the swelling, and digoxin for the heart. We'll double-check all of that with your pharmacy records. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to any of the pills. And I don't have any allergies to food, either. I eat everything! Pupusas, tamales, platanos… everything! No problems. My husband, Ricardo, he was allergic to bees, poor man. But me? No, no allergies. Just old age, that's my only problem!
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Good. And, just one last question for now, Nadene. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question, dear. My appetite… it hasn't been what it used to be, no. I used to love a big plate of pupusas, but now… I only manage a few. And I think I've lost a little weight, yes. Not much, but my clothes feel a bit looser. Esmeralda keeps telling me I need to eat more, but it's just… not as appealing anymore. I'm not as hungry as I used to be. Is that a worry?
DOCTOR: Alright, Nadene. Thank you for that information. Based on what you’ve told me, the changes in your appetite and weight, the puffiness in your ankles, the cough, and your history of congestive heart failure, it sounds like your heart failure may be worsening. The X-ray and EKG will give us a clearer picture, but it’s likely we’ll need to adjust your medications. It's important to address this quickly to prevent further complications. A nurse will be in shortly to take you for the tests. Do you have any questions for me before they arrive?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Worsening, you say? That doesn’t sound good at all. I was hoping it was just a little cold. Adjust the medication… will that make me feel better? And will it take long to start working? I don’t want to be stuck in bed all the time. And what kind of complications are we talking about? I get a little worried when you talk about complications. Just… explain it to me in plain language, please. I don’t need all the fancy medical terms.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nadene, let's take it one step at a time. When your heart failure worsens, it means your heart isn't pumping as efficiently as it should. That can cause fluid to build up in your lungs, which is why you're coughing and breathless. It also explains the puffiness in your ankles. Adjusting the medication – we'll likely increase the dose of your current medications, or perhaps add something new – is to help your heart pump better and reduce that fluid build-up. As for how long it will take to work, it varies. You might start to feel a little better within a few days, but it can take a week or two for the full effects. And as for complications… well, if we don’t manage it properly, it can lead to more shortness of breath, fatigue, and, in the long run, it can strain other organs. That’s why we’re doing these tests and making adjustments now. We’re not there yet, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. So, the medication will help get rid of the fluid, and make my heart stronger. And it’s not too serious yet, if we fix it now. That's a relief. Will the tests hurt? And will I have to be in the hospital again? I really don't want to go back to the hospital. It's so boring, and I miss my own bed. And Esmeralda would have to take time off work… Is there anything I can do to help, besides taking the pills? Should I be eating differently, or resting more?
DOCTOR: The tests shouldn’t hurt at all, Nadene. The X-ray is just a quick picture, and the EKG involves some sticky pads. As for the hospital, we’re hoping to avoid that, yes. We’ll see what the tests show, but our goal is to manage this at home, with medication adjustments and a few lifestyle changes. As for what you can do… it’s good you ask. Definitely rest when you need to. Avoid strenuous activity. And it's very important to watch your salt intake. Too much salt can cause your body to retain fluid, which makes your heart work harder. And try to weigh yourself every day, and let me know if you notice any sudden weight gain. That's a sign that fluid is building up. We’ll work together on this, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. No strenuous activity, watch the salt, weigh myself every day. I can do that. Esmeralda can help me with the salt, she’s a good cook and always uses just the right amount. I’ll try to remember to weigh myself first thing in the morning, before I eat anything. I suppose I should be patient now, and wait for the nurse. Are you sure there’s nothing else I need to worry about? And… what if I forget all of this? My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nadene. I understand your concerns. The most important thing to remember is to rest, watch your salt, and weigh yourself daily. We'll have the nurse go over everything again with you before you leave, and we can also provide you with a written list of instructions. And don't worry about forgetting - that's perfectly normal. Esmeralda can help you remember, and if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to call my office. We’ll get through this, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A written list… that would be very helpful. And Esmeralda will remind me, she's always looking after me. Thank you, Doctor. You've put my mind a little bit at ease. I suppose I'll just wait for the nurse now. I hope she doesn't take too long. I’m starting to feel a little tired.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nadene. Don't hesitate to call if anything comes to mind. And don't worry, I'll check with the nurse and see if she can come as soon as possible. Rest now, and try not to worry. I’ll see you after the tests.
