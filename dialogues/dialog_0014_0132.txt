DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Heat intolerance, you say? Honestly, it's about time someone looked into this. It’s ridiculous, really. I can’t even step outside for five minutes these days without feeling like I’m gonna melt. Used to be able to work all day in the sun, building stuff, painting...now? Forget about it. It's the heat, I tell ya. Just the heat.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. "The heat" is a rather broad complaint, Mr. Coby. Lots of things can feel like heat intolerance. When did this start becoming a problem?
PATIENT: Broad complaint? I’m telling you what’s happening to me. But fine, if you must have a date… hmm. Let me think. It started… oh, maybe last summer? No, the summer before that, maybe? It was a particularly hot one, I remember. Lots of ninety-degree days. It just… gradually got worse. I didn’t think much of it at first, just figured I was getting older. But now… now it's a real issue. Can't even mow the lawn without needing a nap.
DOCTOR: Right. So, roughly two years of gradual worsening. And it’s specifically exertion in the heat that brings this on?
PATIENT: Specifically? Yes, specifically! Look, I’m a builder, a painter, a maintenance guy! I work outside. Sitting in an air-conditioned room all day wouldn’t be a problem, would it? It's when I’m doing something – anything – and it’s warm out. Gets my heart racing, makes me sweat like crazy, and I just feel… weak. And dizzy. Not a good combination when you're up on a ladder, let me tell you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the heat intolerance, dizziness, and sweating?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think… well, I get a bit of a headache sometimes. Not a terrible one, just… nagging. And I’ve been thirstier than usual, I suppose. Always keep a bottle of water handy. But honestly, I chalked that up to just being an older guy, needing to stay hydrated. What else… oh! Sometimes my legs feel a little… shaky. Like they might give out. But that only happens when I’m really hot and tired. It’s all connected, I’m telling you. It has to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. Headache, increased thirst, and shakiness with exertion and heat. Have you had any changes in your weight recently, either up or down?
PATIENT: Weight? Now that you mention it… I think I might’ve lost a little. Not a ton, but a few pounds, maybe five or so. Been eating less, to be honest. When it’s hot, I just don’t have much of an appetite. Everything feels so… heavy. Makes you sluggish, you know? But I haven’t been trying to lose weight, if that’s what you’re asking. Just haven’t been as hungry.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Coby?
PATIENT: Medications? No, not really. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I’ve always been a healthy guy. Just a little bit of ibuprofen now and then for aches and pains, but that’s about it. Doctor told me years ago to watch my blood pressure, but it's usually fine. I keep an eye on it at the pharmacy sometimes, just to be sure. But nothing regular. I prefer to handle things myself, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's just take a few measurements, shall we?
PATIENT: Measurements? Fine, go ahead. Though I doubt it'll tell you anything you don't already know. It's the heat, I tell ya. Simple as that. But alright, do your thing. Just don't be surprised if everything checks out normal. It’s the heat… always is.
DOCTOR: Pulse is a little elevated, 88. Heart sounds… regular, no murmurs. Blood pressure is 142/90. That's a little higher than ideal, Mr. Coby. And I'm going to listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: 142/90? Well, that’s not good, is it? I told you I keep an eye on it. It goes up sometimes. Stress, probably. Worrying about this heat, mostly. And, alright, listen to my lungs, go ahead. Just… don't expect anything interesting. I haven't been coughing or anything. Perfectly healthy lungs, I assure you. Used to be a pretty good runner, you know.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Just relax your legs.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Alright, alright. Don't poke too hard, though. I'm an old man, not a punching bag. And, honestly, this is all feeling a bit… unnecessary. It’s the heat! What more do you need to know? You listen to my heart, check my belly, poke my knees… It’s all just confirmation that I’m a perfectly normal person who can’t handle the summer anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, reflexes are normal. No edema in your feet. I'm going to order some blood work, Mr. Coby. Complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function, and a thyroid panel. And also, a urinalysis. Just to rule things out.
PATIENT: Rule things out? What things? You’re starting to make me nervous now. I just want to know why I can’t work in the sun anymore, not have a whole battery of tests done. Look, I appreciate you taking the time, but honestly, this feels a bit… over the top. Just the heat, Doctor. That's all it is. But alright, fine. Do your blood work. But I'm telling you, it's not going to show anything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Coby, I understand your frustration, and I appreciate your patience. However, it's my job to investigate potential causes for your symptoms. While the heat is certainly a contributing factor, we need to rule out underlying medical conditions, such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, thyroid issues, or even something more serious. The blood work and urinalysis will give us a clearer picture. We'll also check your Vitamin D levels. I’m also going to order an EKG just to be safe. It's better to be thorough. I'll have the lab results back in a few days. I’ll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, stay hydrated, avoid strenuous activity during peak heat hours, and try to stay cool. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Vitamin D? An EKG? Honestly, this is ridiculous. It's the heat, Doctor. I keep saying it! But fine, alright. Do your tests. Schedule your appointment. I don't know what you expect to find, but… I’m wasting my time here, frankly. But alright, fine. Just… don’t bother me unless you find something actually wrong. I’ve got work to do – when it isn’t 100 degrees outside, that is. So, no, I don’t have any questions. Just… do your tests.
