DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I am Dr. Jules. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Waste time, you say? Well, the company sent me. Said I have to come. Something about the dust down in the mine. I feel fine, though. Perfectly fine. Been working down there longer than you been alive, I reckon.
DOCTOR: I see. A mandated visit. Very well. Still, a company request doesn’t negate the need for a proper assessment. “Perfectly fine” is subjective, Mr. Bigger. Can you elaborate on any changes you have noticed, however small, since working in the mine?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? I work in a mine. It's dusty! My hands are always dirty. I cough sometimes, always have. Old age, mostly. What are you getting at, Doctor? You think I'm suddenly gonna sprout wings 'cause of a bit of dust?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, please. I am attempting to ascertain if there’s been any new or worsening symptoms. A chronic cough is not the same as a cough that has recently changed in character. Has your cough become more frequent?
PATIENT: Frequent? Well... maybe a little. Used to be just when the weather changed, you know? Now... I suppose it happens more often. But it's nothing! Just old lungs, I tell ya. And the dust. Always the dust. Is this gonna take all day? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: A change in a chronic cough is pertinent, Mr. Bigger. And “things to do” do not supersede a medical evaluation. Have you noticed any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Hmph. Now you're asking silly questions. I walk to work, don't you know? Downhill and uphill! If I was short of breath, I wouldn't be here, would I? It's a strong set of legs I have, thank you very much. Used to play football, you know. Back in Nigeria... a very long time ago. But no, no shortness of breath. Just... tired sometimes. But that's being 86, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Tiredness is, as you say, quite common at your age. Very well. And have you experienced any chest pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Never had chest pain. A little ache sometimes in the mornings, but that’s just my old bones. I work hard, Doctor. Hard work makes you ache. Not some fancy disease. You think I haven't felt pain before? I've lived a long life, you know. A long life.
DOCTOR: Right. And any wheezing or whistling sounds when you breathe?
PATIENT: Wheezing? What does that even sound like? You want me to make noises like a kettle? Look, I breathe. People breathe. It’s what we do. I don’t go around listening to my chest all day, looking for whistles. This is a waste of my time, Doctor. Really. A complete waste. Is there a point to all this, or are you just trying to find something wrong where there isn't anything?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bigger. Since you insist there are no changes, let's conduct a brief auscultation of your lungs. It will take only a moment. Please sit back and try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: A... what-tion? Look, I don't like people poking around. I'm a perfectly healthy man. You listenin' to my lungs? What for? Is this some kind of trick? I don't trust these things. Never did. Just tell me if I'm good to go, and let me leave. I got things to do, remember? .
DOCTOR: Fine. You are, as you claim, perfectly healthy. However, should you experience any changes – a new cough, shortness of breath, chest pain – you are to seek immediate medical attention. I will document your refusal of examination. Now, if you will excuse me, I have other patients to attend to. .
