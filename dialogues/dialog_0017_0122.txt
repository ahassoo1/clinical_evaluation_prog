DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I… it is difficult to explain, but I am noticing… gaps. In my remembering. It is new, and it worries me, as my blood pressure is… not good. I want to be quick, if possible.
DOCTOR: Gaps, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… I will be speaking, and the next thought… it is gone. Or I go to the kitchen, and forget why I went there. Small things, mostly, but more often now. It is… unsettling. I do not like it. And my husband… he passed last year, so there is no one to… remind me, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand the… inconvenience of such things. And my condolences on your loss. Now, let's attempt to be precise. When did you first begin noticing these… "gaps," as you call them?
PATIENT: Perhaps… three months ago? It was very gradual. At first, I thought it was just… being tired. From the… everything. The funeral arrangements, the house… it was a lot. But it has not gotten better. It is… more frequent now, the forgetting. I remember details very well, always have, but connecting them… that is becoming harder.
DOCTOR: Three months. And you attribute this to the stress following your husband’s passing. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this… memory difficulty?
PATIENT: No, not really. No dizziness, no headaches… just… the forgetting. And a little… anxiety, perhaps. Worrying about the forgetting, of course. My thinking is… usually very clear. I manage many properties, you see. It requires much organization. And now… I double-check everything constantly. I do not want to make mistakes.
DOCTOR: Properties, you say. A demanding profession. Now, regarding your blood pressure… do you know your most recent reading?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. My caretaker, Irina, checks it every morning. It was… 150 over 90, I believe. Sometimes higher. I take medication, but… it is not always effective. I do not like the pills. They make me… sluggish. And Irina worries about me being alone.
DOCTOR: Sluggish, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Tired, and… slow. Like my thoughts are moving through water. It is difficult to explain. And… it makes me worry about the memory problems even more. If I am not thinking clearly, how can I be sure I remember correctly? It is… a vicious cycle. I apologize for taking your time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, while I appreciate your thoroughness, we must maintain focus. Now, are you currently experiencing any difficulties with speech?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not with speaking. Or understanding, as you can see. It is just… recalling things. Bringing them to mind. The words are there, usually. It is… like a photograph, almost, but I cannot… reach it quickly enough. It does not happen often, but it is… unsettling, as I said. It frightens me.
DOCTOR: And you are taking medication for your blood pressure, correct?
PATIENT: Yes. Lisinopril, I believe it is called. Every morning. Irina makes sure I take it. She is very good. But it does not always seem to help. And sometimes… I forget if I have taken it. Then Irina worries, and… it is all very stressful. I just want to be sure my brain is working properly.
DOCTOR: Ms. Alvara, with all due respect, stress is a common ailment. Now, have you experienced any recent head trauma?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I have never had a serious injury to my head. I am very careful. And I do not believe my stress is… ordinary stress. It is… a fear of losing myself. Of forgetting who I am, or what I do. It is a very frightening thought, when one relies on their memory for everything. I apologize if I am rambling. I just want you to understand.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed with a basic cognitive assessment. I have Irina here, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. She is in the waiting room. She can assist, if needed. Though… I do not wish to make a spectacle. I just want to find out what is happening, if anything. And, if possible, to… fix it. I do not like this feeling of… uncertainty. It is… very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: It’s a simple test, Ms. Alvara. Bring Irina in. It's far more efficient if she can corroborate your answers. I assure you, it is standard procedure.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you insist. Irina! Please come in, dear. The Doctor wishes to speak with us. I hope it will not take too long. I have appointments this afternoon, you see.
DOCTOR: Let’s expedite this process, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I agree. I value your time. It is just… I do not like feeling this way. The forgetting… it frightens me. I simply want to know what is happening, and what, if anything, can be done about it. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Time is of the essence, Ms. Alvara. Now, let’s begin.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I understand. I am ready, if Irina is here. I will do my best to answer truthfully and… quickly. Please, just tell me what you need me to do.
DOCTOR: .
