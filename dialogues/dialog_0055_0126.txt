DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. I am Dr. Eaddy. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me in your own words what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be frank. I’ve just been terribly thirsty, and hungry, lately. More than usual, and it’s not… it’s not like I’m doing anything strenuous, you understand. Just… constantly needing to drink and eat. It’s quite disruptive, really.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, you say. I understand. And how long has this been going on, this increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s been… probably a little over a month, I’d say. Maybe six weeks? It started gradually, just feeling a bit peckish more often, then needing a drink with every meal. Now… now it feels constant. I find myself thinking about food and drink all the time, if that makes any sense. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Six weeks of gradually increasing thirst and hunger. Yes, that is noteworthy. And has there been any accompanying weight change – either gain or loss – during this period?
PATIENT: Weight change… that’s a good question. I… I hadn’t really noticed, to be honest. I suppose I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. I feel… about the same, if anything. Perhaps a little lighter, but that could just be wishful thinking. I wouldn't say I've gained any weight, certainly. It’s difficult to say, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Understandable. It can be difficult to self-assess. Now, Mr. Erxleben, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the increased thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I’ve been… a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. Just generally feeling a bit run down. And… now that you mention it, I’ve been going to the bathroom more frequently. Both needing to… relieve myself, and just… urinating more often. Is that… is that normal with this? I honestly don’t know.
DOCTOR: Increased frequency of urination, along with fatigue… alright. And have you noticed any changes in your vision, perhaps blurred vision, or any unexplained skin changes, like increased dryness or itching?
PATIENT: Vision… no, not particularly. Everything seems… normal enough. Perhaps a bit strained when reading, but I’ve always needed good light, you see. As for skin… I don't think so. It feels… dry, maybe? But I live in Scotland, Doctor. It's always a bit damp, so my skin is usually a bit dry. Honestly, I'm not sure if that's related, or just the weather. It’s hard to say, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is difficult to say, Mr. Erxleben. We'll need to explore a few possibilities. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, such as diabetes, or have you had any significant illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Diabetes… no, never. Nothing like that, thankfully. As for illnesses… I had the usual childhood things, measles, mumps, that sort of thing. And a rather nasty bout of pneumonia about ten years ago, but I made a full recovery. Otherwise… I’ve been relatively healthy, all things considered. My ex-wife would probably disagree, but… that’s another story. I’ve never been on any long-term medication, either.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My father had… high blood pressure, I believe. And my mother… she had some sort of arthritis, quite debilitating towards the end. As for anything else… not that I’m aware of. My grandmother on my father’s side lived to a very old age, remarkably healthy for her years. But beyond that… I’m not really sure. We weren’t a particularly close family, to be frank. Is that… is that enough information?
DOCTOR: It will suffice for now. Now, Mr. Erxleben, I'm going to need to perform a brief physical examination. Specifically, I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I will also need to check your weight and height, if you don't mind. This will give me a better understanding of your overall condition. Afterwards, I’ll order some routine blood work to further investigate these symptoms. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's perfectly acceptable. I understand. Get it done, the sooner the better, frankly. I'd like to know what's causing all this. Just… please be quick, if you don’t mind. I have… appointments to attend to later.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a seat. And if you would please remove your shoes and socks… We’ll start with your weight and height.
PATIENT: Alright. Here we go, then. I trust this won’t take long? I do have a rather tight schedule.
DOCTOR: 93 kilograms. 170 centimeters. As expected. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, 140/90. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, please remain seated. We'll just need a small sample of blood for some routine tests. This will help us rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. A blood draw, you say? I… I’m not particularly fond of needles, Doctor. Is it… is it going to be painful? And how much blood will you need?
DOCTOR: A standard blood draw, Mr. Erxleben. A small amount of discomfort, at most. A few milliliters, certainly nothing significant. It’s a necessary procedure to determine the cause of your increased thirst and hunger, and to assess your overall health. I assure you, I am quite proficient. Now, please relax your arm. The more tense you are, the more difficult it will become.
PATIENT: Right. Just… just get it over with quickly, please. I’d rather not dwell on it. I… I don't suppose you have any music or… something to distract me? It’s just… needles aren’t my forte.
DOCTOR: There. That wasn't so bad, was it?
PATIENT: Ugh. That… that was rather unpleasant, actually. And you said that wasn’t so bad? It felt… surprisingly sharp. Are you sure you got enough? I don’t want you having to poke me again. Is there a bandage or something?
DOCTOR: Yes, quite sufficient. And it's standard to experience a slight prick. You’re a bit sensitive, perhaps. There. All done. Please keep that bandage on for at least an hour. Now, the lab results should be available within a few days. I’ll contact you as soon as they’re in. In the meantime, I recommend you try to reduce your sugar and salt intake. And drink plenty of water, though I suspect you're already doing that.
PATIENT: Right. Sugar and salt, less of both. Water… well, that's not going to be a problem. Very well, Doctor. I suppose that’s all for now then? I’m… I’m grateful for your assistance. Though, truthfully, I’d be even more grateful if you could tell me what’s wrong with me right away. .
DOCTOR: We must await the results, Mr. Erxleben. Rushing to a diagnosis without proper information would be irresponsible. I will be in touch. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to attend to. .
