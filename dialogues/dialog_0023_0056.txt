DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes, the doctor. Honestly, it’s… well, it’s this job. It's simply dreadful. All these… students. No respect for knowledge these days, none at all. And the paperwork! Mountains of it. I’ve been doing this far too long, you see. Far too long. I suppose that’s what you’re asking? Just… burnt out. That's the term, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Burnt out… I see. While I understand feeling overwhelmed, Mr. Schlatterer, usually when someone comes to see me, it’s related to a specific medical issue. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms – anything at all – that prompted you to schedule an appointment?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Good heavens, no. I’m perfectly… functional. It’s my mind that’s weary. All these… modern teaching methods. They expect us to… entertain them. It’s ridiculous! I used to lecture, you see. Proper lectures. Now it’s group work and… videos. Honestly, it’s an insult to the profession. Unless a headache from sheer frustration counts as a physical symptom, I believe I'm quite alright.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustrations with the changes in your work environment, Mr. Schlatterer. However, it’s important to rule out any underlying medical causes for feelings of fatigue or mental weariness, even if you believe they are stress-related. A headache does count as a symptom, yes. Can you describe this headache?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. It’s… a dull ache, mostly. At the base of the skull. Comes and goes, really. Though it’s been… more frequent lately. Probably from staring at those blasted computer screens all day, inputting grades. It’s not a migraine, if that's what you’re thinking. I had a proper migraine once, years ago. This is just… a nuisance. And it’s certainly not something I need a doctor for, frankly. I have important papers to grade.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your assessment, Mr. Schlatterer, frequent headaches, even those you deem a “nuisance,” warrant investigation. It's possible it's simply tension-related, but we need to rule out other possibilities. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: My medical history? Oh, dear. Where to begin? I suppose I had the usual childhood illnesses. Measles, mumps… nothing serious. A broken arm when I was a boy, climbing a plum tree. And then… well, my wife, God rest her soul, she was the one who handled all the doctor visits. I just… went when she told me to. I haven't really needed a doctor in decades. High blood pressure, perhaps, a few years ago. They put me on a pill. I stopped taking it. It made me feel… sluggish.
DOCTOR: You stopped taking the medication for high blood pressure without consulting a doctor?
PATIENT: Oh, it was years ago! And it wasn't that high. Just a bit elevated, they said. And I felt dreadful on the pills! Constant fatigue. I’m a perfectly active man, you see. I don’t need medication slowing me down. I prefer to manage things myself. A bit of rest, a strong cup of tea… that’s all one needs, really. Honestly, these doctors… always trying to put everyone on pills for everything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, with all due respect, discontinuing a prescribed medication, particularly for a condition like high blood pressure, can be dangerous. It's essential to maintain control of your blood pressure to prevent serious complications. Do you know what your blood pressure was when it was diagnosed, and have you had it checked recently?
PATIENT: Oh, bother. I haven't the faintest idea what it was. It was… a long time ago, as I said. And no, I haven’t had it checked recently. Why would I? I feel perfectly fine! A bit stressed, perhaps, but that’s the job. It doesn’t mean I need… poking and prodding. Look, I came here because my workplace is making my life miserable. I thought you could perhaps write me a note, excusing me from some of these… ridiculous new initiatives? That’s all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, I understand your frustrations with your workplace. However, as a physician, my primary concern is your health. Given your history of high blood pressure, which you discontinued medication for without medical supervision, and your current complaints of headaches, I strongly recommend we conduct some basic tests to assess your overall health. This includes a blood pressure check, a basic blood workup, and a neurological exam. It's vital to rule out any underlying medical issues before addressing other concerns. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. I haven’t time for all this. I have papers to grade, meetings to attend… honestly, this is a complete waste of my time. I came here for a note, not a… a full medical examination! I think I’ll just… manage on my own, thank you very much. You’ve been no help whatsoever.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, I understand your frustration, but I am concerned about your well-being. While I respect your decision, I must advise you that proceeding without addressing these potential health concerns could have serious consequences. I will document our conversation and your refusal of recommended testing. I will, however, write a brief note stating you’ve consulted with a physician. It will be a general statement, and it won’t detail any specific medical findings as no examination was performed. Please consider scheduling a follow-up appointment when you have time for a more thorough evaluation. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Hmmph. Fine. Whatever you say. .
