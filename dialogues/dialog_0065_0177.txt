DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh... it's... down there. Something's... leaking. It's not good. I don’t like it. It's been a few days, maybe? I don’t keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: “Down there,” you say. And it’s been a few days of…leakage. Alright. To clarify, Ms. Genard, are you referring to vaginal discharge?
PATIENT: Vagi-what now? No, not that. It's... him. My son. It's leaking from him. He’s a grown man, you know. I didn't raise no babies! It’s from… well, there. Down there. Between his legs. Is that clear enough? Honestly, this is embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, are you saying your son is experiencing a leakage?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you! Honestly, young people these days… can't explain anything properly. He won't even come to the doctor himself. Says he's "too busy." A grown man, too busy for his own body! It’s… white-ish. And… smelly. Not a good smell. He just sends me to figure things out. It’s ridiculous!
DOCTOR: Alright. It sounds like your son is experiencing some discharge. And you’re concerned about it. To get a better understanding, Ms. Genard, could you describe the discharge a bit more?
PATIENT: Like I said, white-ish. And… watery, maybe? I don’t know! I’m not a doctor! It’s not… chunky, if that makes sense. Just… wet. And the smell... fishy, I think. A bad fishy. He keeps himself very clean, though. Usually. I always made sure he washed properly. It’s just… sudden. He hasn’t complained of anything else. No pain or anything. He just… leaks now. Honestly, I don’t know what’s gotten into him.
DOCTOR: Okay. A sudden onset of watery, white-ish discharge with a fishy odor. Has he had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No! Never. He's always been… regular. Everything has always been… normal. Until now. He's a good boy, you know? Works hard, doesn't cause trouble. That's why this is so strange. I just want to know what’s wrong with him so he can get it fixed. He's probably just embarrassed to come here himself. Men are like that, always stubborn. Honestly, it's probably nothing, just something silly. But I'd feel better if you looked at him.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Genard. It sounds like this is a new development for your son. To properly assess what’s going on, I will need to examine him. Would he be willing to come in for an appointment?
PATIENT: Ugh. That's the problem! He says he’s “too busy.” He has a very important job, you know. Something with computers. He just wants me to tell you what’s wrong. He said if it’s nothing serious, just tell me what to buy at the store. Some kind of cream or powder or something. Honestly, I don’t know what he expects! A grown man sending his mother to the doctor for this... It’s ridiculous! Is there anything you can prescribe just based on what I’ve told you? Something strong?
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, I understand your frustration. However, prescribing medication without a proper examination would be irresponsible and could potentially be harmful. There are several possible causes for this discharge, and each requires a different treatment approach. Without knowing the exact cause, I cannot recommend anything safely. I strongly advise that your son schedule an appointment so I can perform a physical examination. It's the only way to determine what's going on and ensure he receives appropriate care. Perhaps you could explain to him the importance of a professional assessment?
PATIENT: Honestly, you doctors all say the same thing! "Examine this, test that..." It's a waste of time and money! He's a busy man! And I'm sure it's nothing serious. Maybe it's just… sweat? Or something. Look, can't you just give me something? Anything? An ointment? A powder? A strong wash? He’s embarrassed enough as it is. He won't come here. Just help his mother out a little, please. I'll take responsibility. I’m a responsible woman. I always have been.
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, I understand your concern for your son and his reluctance to seek medical attention. However, I cannot ethically provide a treatment without a diagnosis. Providing medication without knowing the cause of the discharge could mask a more serious underlying condition, potentially leading to complications. I recommend over-the-counter antifungal creams if he’s experiencing itching or redness, but if the discharge is persistent, worsening, or accompanied by pain, fever, or other symptoms, he must see a doctor. I can write a referral to a urologist if he’s more comfortable seeing a specialist. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: A… yourologist? What’s that even mean? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. Fine. Write down the name. But I’m telling you, he’s not going. He’ll probably just ignore it and hope it goes away. Men are like that. Stubborn as mules. But… write it down anyway. Just in case. And… is there anything I can do to help him in the meantime? Besides telling him to wash better? Honestly, I've already told him a thousand times. This is such a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Here you go. This is the name and number of Dr. Ramirez, a urologist in the area. In the meantime, you can advise your son to keep the area clean and dry, and to avoid any harsh soaps or lotions. If he experiences any pain, fever, or increased discomfort, please encourage him to seek immediate medical attention. I understand this is frustrating, Ms. Genard, and I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That's it. I've wasted enough time here already. Honestly, doctors these days… no common sense. Just tell people to see another doctor. It’s ridiculous. Thank you… I guess. But don’t expect him to actually go.
DOCTOR: .
