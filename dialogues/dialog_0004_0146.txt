DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s my muscles, mostly. They feel… weak. It’s been going on for a bit now, not sure exactly how long, to be honest. Just kinda gradual, you know? It makes things harder to do, normal stuff.
DOCTOR: “Gradual” isn’t terribly helpful, Mr. McKinnon. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Right, sorry. Specific… okay. Um, let’s see. Lifting things is harder. Like, groceries. Used to be no problem. Now I gotta really concentrate, and even then sometimes things slip. And getting up from a chair… that takes effort now. Not a sharp pain, just… a struggle. It’s mostly in my legs and arms, I guess. Has been getting worse for… maybe the last month or so? Two months? Honestly, time blurs.
DOCTOR: So, primarily legs and arms, difficulty with lifting and rising from a seated position, onset approximately one to two months ago. Any falls?
PATIENT: No, no falls. Not yet, thankfully. Just… wobbly sometimes. Like my legs are gonna give out, but they haven't. It's more a feeling than anything, but it makes me cautious, definitely. I've been trying not to overdo it. Don't want to risk a tumble.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no chills. Not really tired, actually. Appetite’s normal. No numbness or tingling. I haven't noticed any changes in my… well, in how things taste or anything like that. Oh, wait! My hands… they feel a little shaky sometimes. Not constantly, but now that you mention it, yeah. They tremble a bit when I’m trying to do something precise, like buttoning a shirt.
DOCTOR: Shaky hands with fine motor tasks. And you said no numbness or tingling?
PATIENT: That’s right, no numbness or tingling. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. It's just the weakness and the shaky hands. It’s… frustrating, more than anything. I work as an insurance appraiser, you know? Gotta inspect cars, write reports… needs a steady hand. It's making things difficult at work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major. Had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, that kind of thing. No diabetes, no heart problems, no high blood pressure. I've never been hospitalized, haven’t had any surgeries. Just… always been pretty healthy, honestly. This weakness is a new thing.
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… my dad had some trouble with his knees when he got older, arthritis, I think. My mom was healthy as a horse until… well, until she passed. No one else, not that I remember, had anything like this muscle weakness thing. They're all back in Yemen, mostly. Hard to keep track of everything over there.
DOCTOR: Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Never really been one for taking pills unless I absolutely have to. No vitamins, no herbal remedies, nothing. Just… plain old water and trying to eat right, you know? Don’t even take aspirin.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, not even bee stings. I'm pretty lucky that way, I guess. It's just this muscle weakness now, and it’s kind of ruining things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. McKinnon. I’d like to do a brief physical examination. Just to assess your muscle strength, reflexes, and coordination. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Just let me… There. Standing. Let me know what you need. Hopefully, we can figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Please walk normally for me, a few steps back and forth. Squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Strength is… reduced in all extremities, though not completely absent. Reflexes appear normal, but I will test them more thoroughly. “I’m going to check your reflexes now.” "Reflexes are intact."
PATIENT: Okay, walking… feels a little strange, to be honest. I try not to wobble. Here. I’m trying, but it doesn’t feel as strong as it used to be. There. I’m pushing. It feels… harder than it should. I'm trying to be as strong as I can. "Okay… yeah, that's what I figured," I say quietly as she checks my reflexes. Glad those are normal, at least. This whole thing is unsettling. I’m hoping you can tell me what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: Based on the physical exam and your history, Mr. McKinnon, it seems we are dealing with generalized muscle weakness. Now, there are a number of potential causes. It could be something relatively benign, such as a vitamin deficiency, or a more serious neuromuscular issue. I want to run some blood tests to rule out common deficiencies—Vitamin D, B12, electrolytes—and to check your creatine kinase levels, which can indicate muscle damage. We will also need to test your thyroid function. I will also order a complete metabolic panel and a CBC. Please take this to the lab downstairs. They will draw some blood. It will take a few days to get the results back. Once we have those, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I suggest avoiding strenuous activity. Do not lift anything heavy, and be careful when getting up from chairs to avoid falls. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay, blood tests. Sounds… thorough. Vitamin deficiency, muscle damage, thyroid… a lot to consider. "No, I guess not right now. Avoiding strenuous activity… that’s a relief, honestly. I wasn't planning on doing anything crazy anyway. A few days, you said? I can definitely do that." I pause, thinking for a moment. “Will the tests show what is causing it, or just tell you what isn’t wrong?" I just want to know what to expect, you know? This is… worrying. It feels like it's getting worse each day.
DOCTOR: The tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. They won't necessarily give us a definitive diagnosis immediately, but they will help us rule out common causes and guide further investigation if necessary. If the initial blood tests are inconclusive, we may need to consider a neurological consultation and potentially an electromyography study to assess your nerve and muscle function. However, let's not jump to conclusions just yet. We will start with the blood tests and see what they reveal. I’m also going to recommend a follow up appointment in one week to review the results. If your weakness worsens significantly before then, or if you experience any new symptoms—such as difficulty breathing or swallowing—please contact the office immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, narrowing down the possibilities… neurological consultation, EMG… it sounds… complicated. "I understand. Blood tests first, then see what those say. One week for the follow up. And contact you if it gets worse. Got it." I take a deep breath. "Difficulty breathing or swallowing… that’s… reassuringly not happening yet." I pause. “Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly.” I stand up, a little hesitantly. “I’ll go get these tests done.” .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please let the lab know you are here for the tests I ordered. We’ll see what the results show. Have a good day, Mr. McKinnon. .
