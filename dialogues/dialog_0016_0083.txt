DOCTOR: Good morning, Early! Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, well, I was hoping… you see, I just need a little somethin’. A card, you understand? A “Get Well” card. Or maybe just… encouragement. My niece, she thinks I need one. She worries too much, that one.
DOCTOR: Well, that's a very thoughtful niece you have, Early. And it’s lovely of you to come in. While I’m happy to talk and offer support, this clinic is for medical care. Perhaps we can explore why your niece is worried, and see if there’s something medically we can address?
PATIENT: Medically? What do you mean, "medically?" I'm a perfectly healthy man, Doctor. I work hard every day. Boilers don’t run themselves, you know. It’s just… she's been a little… overbearing lately. Always asking if I’m okay, sending me soup. A card is all I need to show her I'm fine!
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’re feeling a bit frustrated with your niece’s concern, and you want reassurance. I’m seeing here you haven’t been in to see a doctor in quite a while, Early. Just to be thorough, and since she is concerned, would you mind if we quickly go over your general health?
PATIENT: Quickly? How quick is quickly, Doctor? I have things to do, you know. I don't have all day. And truthfully, I don't see what my general health has to do with a simple card. My niece just wants to be… nice. A little too nice, maybe.
DOCTOR: Of course, I completely understand your time is valuable. "Quickly" in this case means just a few basic questions – things like any recent changes in your energy levels, appetite, sleep, or any aches and pains. It helps me get a baseline, especially if you haven’t been seen in a while. It’s also good practice to rule out anything that might be causing your niece’s worry, even if it's unlikely. We can absolutely focus on reassuring her afterward. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Aches and pains? Doctor, I’m 56 years old! Of course I have aches and pains. Working with those boilers, it's not easy on the body. But I manage. I always have. And honestly, I don't see the point. I’m not sick. I just want the card. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: You're right to feel frustrated, Early. It sounds like you're very capable and manage your aches and pains just fine. I apologize for pushing when you've already said you're doing okay. Let's reframe this. Since you're here, and I do have your information up now, would it be alright if I quickly review your past medical history just to confirm everything is up-to-date?
PATIENT: Past medical history? What for? I've told you, I’m fine. I’ve never been one for doctors much. I take care of myself. Look, are you going to give me the card or not? My niece is expecting something. She’s a good girl, just a little… anxious.
DOCTOR: Early, I understand your frustration, truly I do. I’m not trying to make you jump through hoops. I want to help reassure your niece and make sure you’re as healthy as you feel. The truth is, as a doctor, I can’t simply provide a “Get Well” card without at least a minimal assessment. It’s part of my responsibility to you. But I promise, I’ll make it quick. Just a few yes/no questions. Have you had any recent changes in your weight?
PATIENT: Weight? Oh, for goodness sake. Now you’re checking my weight? Look, I've lost a little, maybe. It’s the heat, Doctor. Makes you lose your appetite. But it’s nothin’. It’s just… summer.
DOCTOR: Okay, weight loss with the heat... I’m just documenting this, Early. And just to clarify, how much weight would you estimate you've lost?
PATIENT: Estimate? I don't weigh myself! How am I supposed to estimate? A few pounds, maybe five. Ten? It's not important! I'm telling you, Doctor, this is ridiculous. All this over a card! My niece is going to think I'm avoiding her if I don't come home with somethin’.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about your niece, Early. And I apologize for seeming to push. But ten pounds of unintentional weight loss is something we should investigate, even if it is just the heat. It could be a sign of a lot of things, and it's my job to rule those things out. Would you be willing to let me take your weight and check your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Blood pressure? Now you want to poke and prod? Listen, Doctor, I came here for a card, not a check-up! You’re making me feel like I’m a hypochondriac! I just want a piece of paper to show my niece I'm alright. This is… unnecessary. And frankly, a little insulting.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Early. I'm not respecting your wishes, and I apologize. It seems I’m stuck in doctor mode, and not listening to what you want. You're perfectly capable of knowing your own body, and if you feel healthy, that's what matters most. I still feel obligated to mention that unexplained weight loss should be looked into, but I won't push you to undergo any tests today. Here's what I can do. I can write a brief note stating that you were seen today, are alert and oriented, and deny any significant medical complaints. Would that be sufficient for your niece?
PATIENT: ...A note? Just sayin' I came in and I'm… alright? That'll do. Yes, that will do nicely. As long as it says I'm not complainin’ of anything, she’ll be happy. And you won’t ask me about my weight again?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Early. A note stating you were seen today, are alert and oriented, and deny any significant medical complaints. No further questions about your weight, I promise. Just a moment… Okay, here we are. This should reassure your niece. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: That'll do nicely, Doctor. Thank you. And thank you for… puttin’ up with me. Maybe I was a little grumpy. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Early. And no apology needed – I understand. I'm glad we could reach a solution that works for you. Please, take care, and give my best to your niece. .
