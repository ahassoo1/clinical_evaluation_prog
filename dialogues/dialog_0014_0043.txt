DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gibbel. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Osterholm. It’s nice to meet you too. I’ve got this headache… right in the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for a few days now. Not awful, just…constant. Like a dull pressure, you know? It’s mostly on the right side, I think.
DOCTOR: Right. A headache… for a few days. Dull pressure, mostly on the right side. Hmm. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Let me think… Not really. Same routine, pretty much. Wake up, eat breakfast, check the market reports – gotta keep an eye on things, even at my age! – then work with my clients. Oh! My grandson, little Kai, started kindergarten last week. Maybe a little extra worry about him adjusting? He’s a good boy, but still… it’s a big step, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Right. Kindergarten…changes are stressful, even small ones. So, it's been consistent since he started school then?
PATIENT: Pretty much, yes. It wasn't right when he started, it kinda built up over the last few days. Before that, I felt fine. Nothing else different... I haven't bumped my head or anything. No fever, no blurry vision, nothing like that. Just…this headache. And honestly, at my age, everything aches a little, so sometimes it’s hard to tell what’s new pain and what’s just…old. You know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It is hard to sort things out sometimes. No fever, no vision changes… good. Have you tried anything for it yet?
PATIENT: Oh yes, I did. I took some of those over-the-counter pain relievers. You know, the kind you take for a cold, the acetaminophen… Tylenol, I think it's called? It helps a little, takes the edge off, but it doesn’t really go away. And it comes back pretty quick, once the medicine wears off. Maybe an hour or two. I don't like to take too much of it, though. My body doesn't always agree with those things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tylenol helps a little, but it doesn’t last. Right. Well, let’s take a look at you, Mr. Gibbel. I’d like to do a quick exam, just to rule things out. Nothing major, I promise. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels…odd, and I’ll tell you right away. I’m not a complicated case, I hope! Just an old man with a headache.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'll take a look at your eyes and ears, and do a quick neurological exam – check your reflexes and things like that. It shouldn't take long. Please have a seat.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. You know, my wife used to always say I needed to stretch more. She was right, of course. Always was. Go ahead whenever you’re ready, Doctor.
DOCTOR: 148 over 82… Not terrible, but a bit elevated. Pulse is 78, regular. Ears look clear. Pupils are equal, reactive to light… Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Just relax your arms. Two plus bilaterally… Normal. Any numbness or tingling in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No numbness or tingling, no. Everything feels…normal, besides the headache, of course. Arms and legs are workin' just fine. Though, sometimes my hands get a little shaky when I'm workin' on spreadsheets. But that's been happenin' for years, I think. It’s just old age, probably. And too much coffee. My wife…she always said I drank too much coffee.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no new numbness, tingling, just the hand tremors which you’ve had for years. It's good that the headache isn't accompanied by any weakness or other neurological symptoms. Given your age, and the fact that it's relatively new and doesn't seem to be responding well to over-the-counter medication, I think we should get a scan just to be safe. It's likely nothing, but it's best to rule out anything serious. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A scan? Like… an X-ray or something? Well, I don't like the sound of that, Doctor. I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… dangerous? What are we lookin’ for, exactly? I'm not a fan of all that… radiation, you know. I try to stay healthy. And expensive, too, I imagine?
DOCTOR: It's not an X-ray, Mr. Gibbel. It's a CT scan. It uses a bit more technology, but it provides a much clearer picture of your brain. And yes, it does involve a small amount of radiation, but it's a very minimal dose, and the benefits of ruling out something serious far outweigh the risks. We're looking for anything that could be causing the headache – a small bleed, a tumor, anything unusual. It's unlikely to be anything serious, honestly. But given your age and the persistence of the headache, I’d feel much more comfortable having a look. As for cost, well… since you don’t have insurance, we can discuss options with the hospital. There are often financial assistance programs available. Let’s not worry about the money right now. The important thing is to figure out what's causing this headache. Do you agree to the scan?
PATIENT: Well… I don’t like it, but I suppose you’re right. It’s better to be safe than sorry. And I trust your judgment, Doctor. Alright, alright. Let’s do the scan. Just… try to keep the radiation to a minimum, okay? And please, let me know everything you find. I don't like surprises. And yes, please do let me know about those financial assistance programs. My retirement isn't exactly… flush.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’ll order the scan for you right now. It’s a non-contrast CT scan of the brain. We'll need to get approval from the hospital first, but that shouldn't take too long. The hospital will contact you to schedule the appointment. It's usually a pretty quick procedure – about 20-30 minutes. And yes, I’ll explain everything to you thoroughly once we have the results. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take Tylenol as needed for the pain, but don’t exceed the recommended dosage. And if the headache suddenly gets worse, or if you develop any new symptoms – like fever, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Tylenol, but not too much. And emergency room if it gets worse. I think I can remember that. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s… a little scary, but I feel better knowin’ we’re gettin’ it checked out. Just hope it’s nothin’ serious. Is there anything else I should be doin’ or knowin’ right now?
DOCTOR: No, I don't think so. Just try to relax and not worry too much. The vast majority of headaches are not caused by anything serious. We're just being cautious. Once we have the scan results, we'll discuss the next steps. I’ll also have the hospital financial assistance department contact you. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate your time and your patience. I'll… just wait for the hospital to call. Thank you again. Hopefully, it's just a little old age catchin’ up with me.
