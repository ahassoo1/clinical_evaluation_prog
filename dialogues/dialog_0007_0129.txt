DOCTOR: Hi Dawnetta, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Honestly, I don't have time for long stories. It's my… well, my stool. It’s black. Like tar, almost. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for arthritis, all the time. That's all you need to know, really. I just want to make sure it's nothing serious, and I’d like to get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're concerned about the black stool and you're taking pain medication for arthritis. We’ll definitely figure this out. Just to be clear, when did you first notice the change in your stool?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't keep a diary of my bathroom habits, Doctor. Probably a week or so ago? Maybe longer. It all blurs together when you're my age, you know. It wasn’t bright red, if that’s what you're thinking. It was…dark. Like coffee grounds, maybe? Though I don't drink coffee, so I wouldn't really know. Does it matter when exactly?
DOCTOR: It does help to have a timeframe, but don't worry, we can work with “about a week.” Dark, tarry stools are something we need to investigate. The fact that you’re on pain medication is important information, too. It could be related to that, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Before we get into a physical exam, let's quickly go through some other things. Do you have any other symptoms—like stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, or feeling tired more than usual?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tired? Doctor, I’m 73! Of course I'm tired. That's just…old age. As for the rest… my stomach doesn’t bother me any more than usual. I get a little heartburn now and then, but I’ve had that for years. And no, I haven’t been sick to my stomach. Honestly, I just want to know if this is something to worry about or not. Are you going to poke around in me now? Because if so, let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration, and I will be as efficient as possible. The heartburn is good to know, but we're focusing on the stool right now. To be thorough, I do want to listen to your abdomen and do a quick exam. It'll be pretty straightforward. Before that, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I’ve been taking pills my whole life. Penicillin, maybe, when I was a little girl? But that was ages ago. I don't even remember it clearly. Honestly, I'm pretty tough. Don't waste time asking about allergies, Doctor. Just tell me what's wrong. Is it serious? Because my husband is waiting in the car, and he doesn’t do well waiting around.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, that’s helpful. It sounds like you've had a good long life without them! Alright. Let’s listen to your stomach and I’ll palpate it. It's just feeling for any tenderness or masses. This won’t take long. Could you lie back on the examination table for me, please?
PATIENT: Honestly, this table is cold. And hard. Just get it over with. I haven’t got all day. Don’t poke too hard. And be quick about it. I told you, my husband… he’s not a patient man.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening now. Deep breaths, if you can. I’m just feeling around... Everything feels fairly normal so far, no significant tenderness. Do you have any pain when I press here, on your lower right side?
PATIENT: No. Not really. A little uncomfortable, maybe, but I'm an old woman! Everything is uncomfortable these days. Honestly, you're poking around too much. Is that all you're going to do? Just tell me if it’s something to worry about, Doctor. All this poking and listening…it’s not telling you anything, is it? My husband served in the war, you know. He expects me home in a reasonable amount of time.
DOCTOR: I understand your impatience, and I apologize if the exam is uncomfortable. You are right, it isn't necessarily telling me exactly what’s going on right now. However, it helps to rule out other possibilities. Given the black stool, your age, and the fact you take pain medication regularly, we need to investigate a possible gastrointestinal bleed. It could be something simple, like a side effect of the medication, but it could also be a sign of something more serious, like a stomach ulcer or bleeding in the intestines. To be safe, I’m going to order a complete blood count and a stool test to check for blood. I also want to check your iron levels. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, for goodness sake. Just what I needed. More waiting. More poking and prodding. Look, are you telling me it’s serious? Because I don't want a bunch of tests if it's just a little something. And I don’t want any fancy procedures. My husband won’t let me. He says I’ve had enough doctoring for one lifetime. Just tell me if I’m going to die, Doctor. I need to know, so I can put my affairs in order. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I just wanted to know why my stool is black.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you I'm not trying to cause unnecessary worry. You’re right, it’s important to be direct. Right now, it’s too early to say definitively whether it's a serious condition. The black stool can be a sign of something serious, which is why I’m ordering these tests. But it also could be something less concerning, like a side effect of your pain medication. The tests will help us determine the cause, so we can get you the right treatment. I'm not suggesting any fancy procedures at this point, only routine blood work and a stool test. It’s important to gather information before making any decisions. I’ll write the orders now. The lab is just down the hall. Do you think you'll be able to go there yourself, or would you like me to call someone to assist you?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. Fine. I can go myself. Just give me the paper. But don't expect me to be happy about it. And I want the results fast. My husband is waiting. Honestly, all this fuss over a little black stool. It’s probably nothing. But if it is something serious… well, I don't want to think about that right now. Just give me the paper, Doctor, so I can get out of here. .
DOCTOR: Here you go. The lab should be able to take the samples right away. They're very efficient. We'll call you with the results as soon as they're available, likely within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, if you experience any dizziness, weakness, or significant abdominal pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I understand your frustration and anxiety, and I want to assure you we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this quickly. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. .
