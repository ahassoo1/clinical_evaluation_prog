DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Frankly, I don’t have a lot of time for this. It’s… a bit embarrassing, really. Something with my mouth. It’s just… white stuff. All over. It’s quite unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay. “White stuff all over…” Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, what is there to tell? It's white. It's in my mouth. It makes it difficult to… well, to eat properly. And it doesn’t look good, obviously. I assure you I maintain a very high standard of hygiene. It’s probably just… something temporary. I don’t see why I even need to be here.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand it’s frustrating, and you’re concerned about your appearance and eating. It’s good you maintain good hygiene. Let's try to figure out what’s going on. When did you first notice this white stuff?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t recall the exact date. A week or so ago, perhaps? It came on rather suddenly. I was preoccupied with… important matters. It's not as if I spend my days examining the inside of my mouth. Really, Doctor, I'm a busy man.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week or so ago. Has anything changed in your routine around that time?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean, “changed”? I eat the same food, I brush my teeth… as I said, I maintain a very high standard. No, nothing has changed. Unless you mean my workload increased, which it has, considerably. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: I ask because sometimes changes in diet, stress levels, or even new medications can contribute to oral issues. And yes, increased stress can be relevant. Have you started any new medications recently?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I pride myself on being a healthy individual. I don't need medications. I get enough… exercise. This is becoming rather tedious, Doctor. Are you going to look in my mouth or are we going to continue with this endless questioning?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration. Let’s take a look. If you could please sit up for me, and open wide. I'll need a good look inside.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. I have a meeting in less than an hour. And try not to poke around too much. It’s quite sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay… I see a white, curd-like coating on your tongue and the inside of your cheeks. It doesn’t appear to be causing any significant redness or ulceration. Do you feel any pain or burning sensation in your mouth?
PATIENT: A little discomfort, yes. Not pain, exactly. More… irritation. It’s worse when I eat something acidic, like tomatoes. And it's… unsightly. Really, Doctor, it's a dreadful appearance. I can’t possibly explain this to my wife. Is it… contagious?
DOCTOR: It doesn't appear to be contagious based on what I'm seeing. The irritation with acidic foods is a clue. Based on the appearance, it looks like oral thrush, also called oral candidiasis. It’s a fungal infection. It's relatively common, and often happens when the natural balance of bacteria in your mouth is disrupted. It can be caused by a variety of things, including stress, certain medications, or even just a temporary weakening of your immune system. Have you been feeling particularly stressed lately?
PATIENT: Stress? Doctor, my entire life is stress. I’m a faller. Do you have any idea the pressures involved? The responsibility? The… the everything? Of course I’m stressed. It’s a constant companion. But I fail to see how that results in… fungus in my mouth. It sounds… barbaric. Is there a cream for this? Something quick and effective? I haven’t got time for lengthy treatments.
DOCTOR: Yes, there are treatments. Usually, we use an antifungal mouthwash or lozenge. The mouthwash, Nystatin, is usually the first line of treatment. We swish it around in your mouth for a few minutes after meals and before bed. It typically clears up within a week or two. However, since you mentioned significant stress, it's important to address that as well, as it can contribute to recurrence. Have you considered any stress-reduction techniques, like mindfulness or therapy?
PATIENT: Therapy? Doctor, with all due respect, that is a preposterous suggestion. I do not have time for “mindfulness” or whatever… new-age nonsense you’re referring to. I manage my stress perfectly well, thank you very much. Just give me the… mouthwash. And instructions. Clear, concise instructions. I haven’t got all day. And is it expensive? I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay. Here’s a prescription for Nystatin oral suspension. It's a liquid you swish around in your mouth for about a minute after each meal and before bed. Spit it out after a minute, do not swallow it. The cost should be around $20-$30, depending on your pharmacy. I’ve also printed out detailed instructions for you. If it doesn't improve after a week, or if it gets worse, please come back to see me. And, while I understand your reluctance, managing stress can be beneficial for your overall health. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. This has been… a waste of my valuable time, frankly. Twenty to thirty dollars, you say? Fine. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be going now. And I expect this to work. .
