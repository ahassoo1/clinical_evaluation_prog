DOCTOR: Good morning, Helaina. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Honestly, I just… I want to talk about staying healthy. A friend mentioned something about a pill you can take before anything happens, to prevent… well, you know. HIV. Is that something you offer here? I'd like to learn more if it is. I haven’t got a lot of time today, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. That's… a very sensible thing to inquire about. It's called PrEP – pre-exposure prophylaxis. It's a medication taken to prevent HIV infection. We do offer it here. It requires some… assessments first, to make sure it’s appropriate for you, and regular monitoring if you do start it. Now, to give you the best advice, could you tell me a little bit more about why you're interested in PrEP at this time?
PATIENT: Well, it's… complicated. I'm single, you see. And, honestly, dating these days… it's not always easy to know where people are coming from. I want to be responsible, and protect myself. I’m not… actively looking for anything long-term, but I still want to be safe. My friend said it's a lot better than worrying all the time, or… well, you get it. Is it expensive? I’m on Medicare, so I’m not sure what it covers.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's very prudent to think ahead and be proactive about your health. Dating can certainly be… complex these days. As for cost, that’s a good question. Medicare does cover PrEP, but the specifics of your coverage can vary. I'll have our billing department check the details for you based on your plan. They can give you a more accurate estimate of any out-of-pocket expenses. Before we proceed with getting that checked, let's go through some basic health questions. Just a routine review… have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: No, nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. High blood pressure, maybe, but it’s usually under control with diet. And I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago. Other than that… I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. I walk every day, try to eat well. I had all my shots as a kid, but I don’t remember what all they were. Would Medicare have a record of that?
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with diet, and gallbladder removal ten years ago. That’s good to know. And yes, Medicare should have a record of your vaccinations. We can access that information electronically. I’ll check for you in a moment. Just to clarify about the high blood pressure… do you currently take any medications for it, even occasionally?
PATIENT: No, never taken a pill for it. I really try to avoid medication if I can. My doctor years ago said if I watch my salt and walk enough, I should be fine. And I've been fine! It goes up a little at appointments sometimes, that’s all. I’m a bit nervous at the doctor, I think that bumps it up. I’m a tall woman, you see, and my heart has to work a bit harder. Not a medical issue, just… how I’m built.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. White coat hypertension is quite common, and being taller can influence blood pressure. It’s good you've been managing it with lifestyle changes. We can certainly monitor it today, and if it’s consistently elevated, we can discuss options. Now, regarding your family history… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. My mother had diabetes, late in life. And my father… he had heart problems, I think. He died when I was young, so I don’t remember much. On my mother’s side, there was a great-aunt who had breast cancer, but that was a long time ago. Nothing else that I can think of, really. We weren’t a family that talked about our health much, if I’m honest. Mostly just worried about getting through the day.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your mother, heart problems in your father, and breast cancer in a great-aunt. That's helpful to know. It's common for families not to discuss health matters openly. Now, a few questions about your social history… do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. My husband – God rest his soul – he tried to quit a hundred times, but I always told him I wouldn’t live with a smoker. He finally managed it, thankfully, right before… well, before he got sick. It's a nasty habit. And I certainly don’t drink much – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I prefer tea, actually. A strong, sweet tea.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. A healthy lifestyle makes a big difference. And it's wonderful that your husband was able to quit smoking. Now, regarding allergies… do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, nothing significant. I get a little itchy sometimes if I’m around cats, but it’s not a full-blown allergy, just a bit of a sniffle. And I think I had a reaction to penicillin once, when I was a child, but it was a long time ago. They didn’t give me penicillin after that, as far as I know. Nothing I need to worry about these days, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild reaction to cats, and a possible penicillin reaction in childhood. We'll make a note of that in your record. Now, just to confirm, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin. And sometimes, if my arthritis acts up, I take some ibuprofen. Nothing else. I really try to avoid pills as much as possible, you know? I feel like they just create more problems than they solve. I’d rather just deal with a little pain than risk side effects. Is this PrEP… is it going to cause a lot of problems? That’s what I’m worried about.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern. It’s good you’re thinking about potential side effects. PrEP is generally very well tolerated, but like all medications, it can have some. The most common side effects are mild – things like nausea, fatigue, or headache. Serious side effects are rare. We would monitor your kidney function and screen for STIs regularly while you’re on it. Now, before we discuss whether PrEP is right for you, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, and blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That sounds… sensible. I suppose it’s better to be sure. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have an appointment later this afternoon, I need to be back in the city by… well, never mind. I'll make it work. Just… quick and thorough, if you can.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Quick and thorough is exactly what we’ll do. If you could just hop up on the table, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Just relax, and take a few deep breaths.
