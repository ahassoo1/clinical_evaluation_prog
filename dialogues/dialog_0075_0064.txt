DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s my chest. It’s been… hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. It feels like… a squeezing, sometimes. Like a tight band.
DOCTOR: Okay, a squeezing chest pain. That does sound concerning, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about when this pain started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started, oh, maybe… three weeks ago? I was gardening, pulling weeds, and I felt it then. Just a little ache, I thought it was just from bending over too much. But it keeps coming back, you know? Not when I’m gardening every time, but… when I do something. Or sometimes… even when I'm just sitting. It’s a little strange. I can remember exactly what I was wearing that day, a blue shirt with little flowers. Funny what you remember, huh?
DOCTOR: It is funny what we remember. And it’s good you recall details like that; it can be helpful. So, three weeks ago, with activity, and now it’s happening even at rest. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, definitely. It's not always there. Like this morning, I felt okay getting ready. But yesterday, when I was making dinner… oh boy, it was a bit much. It felt like someone was sitting on my chest. And it makes it hard to breathe a little when it happens. Not like I can’t breathe at all, but… you know? Shortness of breath, I guess. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Shortness of breath along with the chest pain is important information. Now, does anything relieve the pain?
PATIENT: Well… when I stop what I’m doing, it gets better. If I sit down and rest for a bit, it usually goes away. And… I think when I burp, it feels a little better too! Is that silly? My husband, he says I worry too much. But he doesn't feel it, you know? He says maybe it's just gas, but… it feels like more than that sometimes.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Sherion. Paying attention to what makes it better or worse is very helpful, and your husband isn’t experiencing it, so his perspective is different. Relief with rest and burping…okay. Now, have you noticed any pain radiating to your arm, jaw, neck, or back?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Sometimes, it goes down my left arm. Not all the way, just… a little bit in my shoulder and upper arm. It's not sharp, it's more… a dull ache, like the chest pain. And… now that you mention it, sometimes I feel it in my jaw. Just on the left side. Not every time, but… a couple of times I’ve noticed that when the chest hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherion, that's very important information. Pain radiating to the left arm and jaw along with the chest discomfort… I’d like to get a better understanding of your overall health. Do you have any history of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me see… My blood pressure, the doctor always said it was a little high. He put me on a little pill for it, years ago. I take it every day, I think it's a white one… I don't remember the name. And cholesterol… I had that checked once, maybe five years ago? The doctor said it was a little bit high then too. But no diabetes, no. My mother had that, but I haven't. I've always been pretty healthy, until this chest thing, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of hypertension and borderline high cholesterol. And no diabetes. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, no. Never had any problems with that. I can eat anything, and I’ve taken all sorts of pills over the years for little things, and never had a reaction. My husband, he’s allergic to bee stings, but not me! I can garden all I want, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And are you currently taking any medications besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one for my blood pressure, like I said. And sometimes, I take Tylenol if my knees are bothering me. But that's it. Not regularly, just when I need it. My husband, he takes a lot of pills. For his arthritis and everything. But I try to stay away from them if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My mother smoked, but I always hated it. My husband used to smoke, a long time ago, but he quit. He says it was the best thing he ever did. And I made sure he kept that promise!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… let me think. My father, he had a heart problem when he was older. He had to have a… a procedure, I think it was. A long time ago, I don't remember exactly what it was. He lived to be 85, though, so it wasn't too bad. And my mother, like I said, she had diabetes. And she had high blood pressure too. My brother is healthy, as far as I know. He lives in Florida, so I don't see him very often. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. A history of heart problems in your father and diabetes and hypertension in your mother. Alright, Sherion. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and just do a quick exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what's going on with my chest, you know? It scares me a little.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sherion, and we’ll figure it out. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90, and your pulse is 82, regular. I hear some mild crackles in the lower part of your left lung. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your chest to check for any tenderness. There is some mild tenderness when I press here, on the left side. It doesn’t seem significant, but we'll keep that in mind.
PATIENT: Okay. Crackles… and tenderness. Is that bad, Doctor? It sounds… concerning. My husband always says I worry too much, but… this just doesn’t feel right. And the pain is starting to come back a little, I think. Just a dull ache.
DOCTOR: The crackles and tenderness can be concerning, and the fact that you're experiencing pain now is also important. I’m not going to dismiss your concerns, Sherion. Given your symptoms – the chest pain, radiating to the arm and jaw, shortness of breath, family history of heart problems, and now the crackles I’m hearing in your lung, I want to be cautious. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. An EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity, a chest X-ray to see what's going on in your lungs, and some blood work, including cardiac enzymes to rule out any heart damage. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. If it will tell us what's going on, then yes, please. EKG, chest X-ray, blood work… I just want to know what's wrong. And… what can I do in the meantime? If the pain gets worse? Should I go to the emergency room?
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Sherion. We will get those tests ordered right away. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and get the EKG started. As for what to do in the meantime, if the pain gets significantly worse, especially if it’s accompanied by severe shortness of breath, dizziness, sweating, or nausea, then please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Don’t hesitate. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the results of the tests, so we can discuss them in detail and come up with a plan. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a low dose of nitroglycerin. It’s a medication that can help relieve chest pain by widening the blood vessels. I'll explain the proper way to take it, and its potential side effects, but it’s important to have it on hand just in case. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Nitroglycerin… okay. To relieve the pain. And if it gets really bad, go to the emergency room. I think I can remember all that. The nurse will be in shortly… and then the tests. And then… we wait for the results. My husband is going to worry himself sick. He always worries. But yes, I think I’m ready for whatever you think is best, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherion. It's good you're proactive about your health. We’ll take it one step at a time. The nurse will explain everything thoroughly. I’ll also have her print out detailed instructions about the nitroglycerin and emergency warning signs. Remember, it's always better to err on the side of caution. I’ll be reviewing your test results as soon as they come in, and we’ll discuss them at your follow-up appointment. In the meantime, please try to rest and avoid any strenuous activity. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that's everything. You've explained everything so well, Doctor. Rest, avoid activity, nitroglycerin, emergency room if it gets bad. And wait for the results. Thank you again. I feel a little better knowing we’re doing something.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherion. That’s my job. I’m glad you feel a little more at ease. The nurse should be here any moment. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. .
PATIENT: .
