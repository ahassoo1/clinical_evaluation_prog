DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh? Good morning to you too, Doctor. My people tell me I need to come. Something about the work. I been workin’ in the mine a long time, you know. A very long time. They say checkin’ now is good, even if I feel fine. Not like these young folks, always complainin’.
DOCTOR: That’s very wise of them to schedule a check-up, even if you’re feeling well. It’s good preventative care. And a long time in the mine… that does give us something to look at. Just to be thorough. So, you said something about the work?
PATIENT: Work is work! Diggin’ and movin’. Machines mostly now, thank goodness. Back in my day… well, never mind. It’s dusty, always dusty. And loud. Real loud. But I got ears, don't I? Been breathin’ it in for… well, a long time. They worried ‘bout the dust. Say it can… what they call it?… get in your lungs. I feel alright, though. Really.
DOCTOR: Right, dusty and loud. Okay. And you've been doing this work for a significant period of time. Just to clarify, when you say you feel alright, are you experiencing any coughing, shortness of breath, or wheezing?
PATIENT: Wheezing? Is that like… when you got a cold? No, no colds. Maybe a little cough sometimes, in the mornings. Old man cough, you know? But nothin’ serious. Always been that way. I clear my throat, that’s all. Don’t get your knickers in a twist, Doctor. I’m tough. I survived the mine. A little dust ain’t gonna hurt me.
DOCTOR: A morning cough, okay. And no shortness of breath. I appreciate you telling me you’re tough, Mr. Bigger, and I believe you. But even tough people deserve a check-up. Let's just do a quick listen to your lungs and get a bit of your history, if you don’t mind. It’ll help us make sure everything is alright. Do you have any other medical problems I should know about?
PATIENT: History? What kinda history you want? I been livin’! I got a wife, bless her soul, gone now five years. Had three children. All grown up, thank goodness. They fuss over me now. What kinda history is important for… lungs? I don't got nothin' wrong with my lungs.
DOCTOR: Not a personal life history, Mr. Bigger, though I appreciate you sharing that. I meant any past illnesses, surgeries, or medications you’ve taken. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Hmm... let me think. When I was a boy, I had the fever. Real bad fever. Stayed in bed for weeks. But that was… a long, long time ago. Other than that… no. No hospitals. I broke my arm once, fallin' from a tree, but the doctor just wrapped it up. Didn’t need no hospital. Strong bones, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, a childhood fever and a broken arm. Good to know. And have you ever had any problems with your heart, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: High… what was that now? Pressure? No, I don't think so. My wife, she used to worry about everything. Always checkin' my pulse. Said it was strong as a lion. Heart's fine. And I don't eat much sugar. Too sweet for me. Diabetes? Is that like when you can't think straight? I can think perfectly fine, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good. No history of heart problems or diabetes. And it sounds like your memory is excellent! Just a few more questions then we’ll do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat anything. Never been afraid of nothin’. My wife tried to get me to stop eatin’ peppers, said they were too spicy. I told her a man needs his spice! No allergies. Stop askin’ me about things I don't have, Doctor. I'm a healthy man!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger, no allergies. That's excellent. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter pills or herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don't believe in them. My wife, she used to take pills for her arthritis. Didn’t do her much good, if you ask me. I just rub some liniment on my joints when they ache. That’s all. Natural stuff. That’s what works. Don't need no fancy pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. Just liniment for your joints. Excellent. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to listen to your lungs and heart and do a quick check of your blood pressure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. I got things to do, you know. Don’t poke around too much. And be gentle! Old bones, remember?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bigger. I will be very gentle. Please, have a seat here, and I'll be right with you.
PATIENT: Hmph. These tables ain't what they used to be. Cold and hard. Get on with it then, Doctor. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bigger. Just breathe normally for me. Deep breaths in and out… Good. I'm hearing some… diminished breath sounds, especially at the bases of both lungs. And a few scattered crackles. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly distant. Blood pressure is a little elevated – 145 over 88. Okay, Mr. Bigger, everything is sounding a bit… congested. And your blood pressure is slightly high.
PATIENT: Congested? High blood pressure? What’s that mean? I feel fine! Just a little tired, maybe. Been workin’ hard, you know. Diminished… crackles… You’re makin’ it sound like I’m about to fall apart! Is that the dust? Is that what all this means? I knew I shouldn’t have come.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Bigger, it doesn’t mean you’re falling apart, not at all. And it could be related to your years working in the mine and exposure to dust. Diminished breath sounds mean it’s a little harder for air to get in and out. The crackles… well, they can be caused by fluid in the lungs. And elevated blood pressure simply means your heart is working a little harder than it should. I want to be thorough, so I'd like to order a chest x-ray and some blood work to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray?! Blood work?! Now you’re just tryin’ to scare an old man! What for?! I told you, I feel fine! Just a little tired. This is ridiculous. I came here for a check-up, not to be poked and prodded and… and radiated! My wife would never have let this happen. This is all just… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I understand your concern, and I apologize if I’ve made you feel uncomfortable. I'm not trying to scare you, and it’s not about finding something wrong, it's about being proactive. Given your long history of working in the mine, it’s important to rule out any potential lung damage or other issues that might develop over time. The x-ray is a quick, painless procedure, and the blood work will give us valuable information about your overall health. Would you feel more comfortable if I explained the specific reasons for each test in more detail?
PATIENT: Explain it all you want. Won't change nothin'. My lungs are fine. Always been fine. But… if you insist… what exactly will this ‘x-ray’ show? And what are you lookin' for in the blood? Just tell me plain. None of your fancy doctor talk.
DOCTOR: Alright, plain and simple. The x-ray will take a picture of your lungs, so we can see if there's any scarring, fluid buildup, or other changes that might be caused by the dust you’ve been exposed to over the years. It’s like taking a photograph. As for the blood work, it will check things like your oxygen levels, kidney function, and rule out any inflammation. It also tells us how well your body is working overall. It's just a way to be extra sure everything is okay. If it shows anything concerning, we can discuss treatment options or refer you to a specialist. It’s about peace of mind, Mr. Bigger. Would you be willing to let me order those tests?
PATIENT: Peace of mind… Hmph. Seems like a lot of fuss for an old man. But… alright. Alright, do your tests. But if it's nothin’, you owe me a good cup of tea. And no pokin' around too much! Get it done quick, I don’t want to be here all day.
DOCTOR: That’s very fair, Mr. Bigger. A good cup of tea sounds lovely. And I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. I'll have the nurse come in and draw the blood now, and then we'll get you scheduled for the chest x-ray. It can be done right here at the clinic. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just get it over with. The quicker this is done, the better. Tell the nurse to be gentle, now. I don’t like needles. And make sure that tea is a good one, not that weak stuff.
DOCTOR: I'll make sure the nurse is gentle, and I’ll personally brew you a strong cup of tea. I’ll be right back to arrange everything.
