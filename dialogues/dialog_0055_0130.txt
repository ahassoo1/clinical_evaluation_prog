DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I’m Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… family. Lots of heart trouble on my mother’s side, and her brothers… not so lucky. I just want to make sure I’m okay, you know? Get some peace of mind. I'm Jim Schwer, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, family history is… significant. It's wise to be proactive, Mr. Schwer. Though, frankly, worrying excessively doesn’t usually improve matters. Now, regarding your mother's side… can you be more specific about the “heart trouble”?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Let me think. My mother, she had… well, she got tired easy. Real tired. And her legs swelled up. That's what I remember most. Then her brother, Uncle Boris, he… he had the chest pain. Bad pain. They took him to the hospital, but… well, he didn't come home. I don’t know exactly what it was, the doctors didn't really explain it to me good. Just “heart problems”. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: “Heart problems” is… unfortunately, a rather broad diagnosis. Swelling in the legs suggests potential… fluid retention. And chest pain… that requires further investigation, naturally. Did your mother receive a formal diagnosis, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Formal… no, not that I recall. This was back in… oh, goodness, the 70s, I think. Doctors didn't talk like they do now. They just… did things. She was in and out of the hospital a few times. They gave her pills to make the swelling go down, and she took them. That's about all I know. I was young, still in school. I didn't ask many questions.
DOCTOR: The 70s…yes, medical record-keeping was… less thorough. Alright. And you yourself, Mr. Schwer, have you experienced any similar symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? I’m 73, you know? And my ankles sometimes feel a little puffy after I’ve been on my feet all day selling things. But nothing like my mother. I can still walk around pretty good. Still do my job. I just… I don't want to end up like them, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Understandable. It’s prudent to address anxieties. Now, let's proceed with a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your extremities. Just standard procedure. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Standard… good. I like standard. Here we go… careful now, old bones, don't go breaking anything.
DOCTOR: Quite right. Let's be careful. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please try to breathe normally. Your heart rate is… regular, but slightly rapid. Lungs are clear, though a bit diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes. Blood pressure is 148 over 85. Slightly elevated. Mild edema present bilaterally, as you mentioned. Not severe, but noticeable.
PATIENT: Elevated… is that bad? I don’t understand all these words. Diminished… what does that mean? Am I sick? I just want to know if I'm gonna… you know. Like my uncle.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, please. Let's not jump to conclusions. “Elevated” blood pressure simply means it’s higher than the optimal range. It doesn’t automatically equate to a dire diagnosis. “Diminished” breath sounds indicate… less air movement in certain areas of your lungs. This could be due to a number of factors, including age, or simply being slightly out of shape. We need to investigate further, naturally. I’d like to order a few tests. An EKG to assess your heart’s electrical activity, and a basic blood panel to check your cholesterol, kidney function, and other relevant markers. Also, a chest X-ray to get a clearer image of your lungs. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I take a little something for my arthritis, but it doesn't bother me. The doctor gave it to me years ago. And I had a shot for the flu last winter, and that didn't cause any trouble either. Just the arthritis pills. What kind… I don't remember the name. It’s a white one, I think. Small one.
DOCTOR: A white, small pill… hardly sufficient information. We will need to obtain a list of your current medications from your pharmacy. It is crucial to know precisely what you are taking. I will send an order to the lab for the EKG, blood panel, and chest X-ray. The lab is located just down the hall. They will contact you when they are ready. The X-ray can be done here, in the clinic. In the meantime, I recommend you continue with your normal activities, but avoid strenuous exertion. And please, try to reduce your stress levels. Easier said than done, I realize. We’ll review the results as soon as they are available, Mr. Schwer. Is there anything else I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Just… thank you, Doctor. It's good to have something… something happening. Just knowing someone is looking into it… that helps a little. Sending the order to the lab… that sounds good. I will try to not worry too much.
DOCTOR: Very well. The staff will guide you to the lab and schedule your X-ray. We will be in touch with the results as soon as possible. Please do try to remain calm, Mr. Schwer. Worrying excessively rarely yields positive outcomes. That will be all for today.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I will try. And… thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome. .
