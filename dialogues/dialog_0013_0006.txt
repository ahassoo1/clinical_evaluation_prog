DOCTOR: Hi Jeannemarie, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Um… well, I have been… coughing up a little blood. It scared me, so I thought I should come. It’s not much blood, but… it’s there.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Coughing up blood can definitely be concerning, even if it's not a lot. To get a better idea of what's going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… it started maybe three days ago? At first, I just thought it was a really bad cough. I have been feeling a little tired lately, but nothing too bad. But then I noticed… the red. It's mostly when I cough first thing in the morning. And it’s… bright red. Not… dark. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Bright red blood is helpful information. And three days ago is a good starting point. You mentioned feeling tired – anything else accompanying the cough and fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No fever, I don’t think. Maybe a little… achy, but it could just be from the coughing. And… no chest pain. Oh! And I have been a little short of breath, especially when I walk upstairs. It’s not terrible, but I do notice it more now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or chest pain is good. Short of breath with exertion is something we'll want to keep track of. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a little sniffle maybe a month ago, but it was gone very quickly. Just a normal summer cold, I think. Nothing like the flu. I usually get a flu shot every year, so… I haven’t been sick in a long time, actually. Besides just feeling tired, like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well… my husband… he passed away last year. He had… a long illness. I cared for him at home for a long time. As for me… I don’t really have anything. I've always been healthy. No big problems. I broke my arm when I was a child, but that was a long time ago! I am a physical therapist, so I try to stay active. Do you need to know more?
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. That must have been incredibly difficult. And it’s good to hear you’re generally healthy and active. Just want to cover all the bases. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Nothing at all. Just the broken arm when I was little, but it healed on its own. I’m pretty lucky, I think. I eat healthy, I exercise… I don’t smoke, and I only drink a little wine sometimes. Everything was… normal, until this cough started. It worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No history of surgery, healthy habits... Let's talk about family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… That's a good question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had some kind of heart problem when he was older. Nothing too serious, I don't think. He lived a long life. And… my grandmother on my mother’s side, she had… arthritis, I believe. But other than that… I don’t really know much. We weren’t very close. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. High blood pressure and a heart condition in your family are good things to note. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t take any pills. I try to get everything I need from my food. Sometimes I take Vitamin D in the winter, but I haven’t taken any since spring. I really prefer to avoid medication if I can. It always makes me feel… strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications or supplements. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. No food allergies, no pollen allergies… I can handle most things. I sometimes get a little itchy after being bitten by mosquitoes, but that’s it! I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good. No known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look in your throat. It will just take a few minutes. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I want to know what’s happening, so anything you need to do is fine. I am a little nervous, but… I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath for me... and exhale. Good. And again. Alright. I'm hearing some slight wheezing in the lower lobes of both lungs. Not terribly pronounced, but it's there. Heart sounds are regular, normal rate. Blood pressure is 130/80, a little elevated but not concerning at this moment. Throat looks clear, no significant redness or swelling. Okay, your lungs sound a little congested and there's some slight wheezing, which could explain the shortness of breath. Blood pressure is a little high, but likely related to anxiety or stress. Your throat appears normal. I'd like to order a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, and I’d like to do a sputum test to see if we can identify any infection. How does that sound?
PATIENT: An X-ray and a test of the… spit? Yes, okay. That sounds… a little scary, but if it helps find out what’s wrong, then yes. Is the X-ray… will it hurt? And how do I do the spit test? I’m sorry for asking so many questions. I just… I don’t like being sick.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to ask questions, Jeannemarie. That's what I'm here for. The X-ray doesn’t hurt at all. You’ll just stand or sit in front of a machine, and it takes a picture of your lungs. It’s very quick and there's no discomfort involved. As for the sputum test, it's fairly simple. We'll have you cough deeply into a sterile cup to collect a sample of mucus from your lungs. The nurse will give you detailed instructions on how to do it properly, to ensure we get a good sample. It might take a few tries to get enough mucus, but it’s not painful. We’ll send both tests to the lab and should have results within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend you rest, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid any strenuous activity. Would you like me to write you a note for work, in case you need to take some time off?
PATIENT: That sounds… much better than I thought. No pain, that’s good. And I do need a note for work, yes, please. I teach exercise classes, so I should probably avoid that for a few days, just in case. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It makes me feel… a little less scared. Thank you.
