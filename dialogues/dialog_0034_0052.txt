DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's good to meet ye as well. Well, I've been havin' a wee bit of trouble, really. Mostly it's this mornin' sickness, but… well, the heart isn't what it used to be, ye ken? They told me it was heart failure a while back now. It just feels… different lately, this sickness. More than usual.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Benic. It sounds concerning that your symptoms are different than usual, especially with your history of heart failure. Let’s take things slowly and get a good understanding of what’s been going on. When you say “mornin’ sickness,” could you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Aye, slowly is good. It's just… well, it's not like a woman's mornin' sickness, not exactly. It's more of a… a queasy feeling, right in the gut. And I get right sick, ye ken? Throwin' up, mostly. It usually hits first thing, like the name suggests, but it's been lingerin' on throughout the day now, more and more. And it's not always first thing, sometimes it's after I eat, sometimes just… randomly. It's been goin' on for about a week now, gettin' worse each day. I haven't been able to keep much down, and I'm feelin' proper weak.
DOCTOR: Thank you for explaining that so clearly, Mr. Benic. It's good you're describing when it happens and how it’s changed. It's concerning that it's lingering throughout the day and impacting your ability to keep food down. Now, regarding your heart failure diagnosis – do you recall when you were diagnosed, and what treatment, if any, have you been receiving for it?
PATIENT: Aye, I do. It was… let me think now… March of 2022, I believe. Dr. MacLeod told me, bless his soul, he's retired now. Said it was the valve, weakened over time. I was put on… well, a water tablet, Furosemide, I think it was called, and something for the blood pressure, Lisinopril, I'm fairly certain. I've been takin' them regularly since, though I'll admit I've maybe missed a dose or two over the years. Life gets in the way, ye ken? I haven't had much trouble with it 'til now, just the usual tiredness. I haven't been back to the doctor much, just kept keepin' on with the pills.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so open with me, Mr. Benic. It’s helpful to know the details of your medications and your history with heart failure. It’s not uncommon to miss a dose from time to time, so don't worry about that. Let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, swelling in your ankles or feet, or any chest pain accompanying this nausea and vomiting?
PATIENT: Aye, well now that ye mention it… the breathlessness has been a bit worse, aye. Not too bad, mind ye, just gettin' a bit winded walkin' up the stairs. And the ankles… I have noticed they're a wee bit swollen, especially at the end of the day. I just put it down to the heat, to be honest. This summer's been a scorcher. Chest pain, no, not really. Just this constant queasiness and the feelin' of being proper drained. I'm mostly just worried somethin's terribly wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Benic, and it’s good you’re bringing these additional symptoms to my attention. Worsening shortness of breath and ankle swelling can be related to heart failure, and with the recent change in your nausea and vomiting, we need to investigate further. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you may have, or if you've had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Aye, well… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a lad, must be… sixty years ago now, easy. And I've got high cholesterol, Dr. MacLeod said so. I try to eat a bit better, but… I’ve got a sweet tooth, ye ken? I also have a bit of arthritis in me knees, makes walkin' a bit o' a bother. But that’s about it, really. No serious illnesses, just the usual aches and pains o' gettin' old. I've never had any heart procedures or anything like that, just the pills for the heart and cholesterol.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Benic. That’s helpful information. And it's understandable to have the usual aches and pains with age. Now, regarding medications, you mentioned taking Furosemide and Lisinopril for your heart and something for cholesterol, do you recall the name of the cholesterol medication and the dosage you are taking of all medications?
PATIENT: Aye, let me think… the cholesterol one… it was… Simvastatin, I believe. 20 milligrams, I think, every night before bed. The Furosemide is 40 milligrams every mornin', and the Lisinopril is… 10 milligrams, I think. I’m fairly certain. I keep the boxes, but I haven't checked them recently. They’re in the kitchen, actually, with the other pills. I usually just refill them when I run out, and the pharmacist sorts it all out.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Benic. That’s very helpful. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I've been quite lucky in that regard. My wife, God rest her soul, she was allergic to penicillin, but I've never had any trouble myself. No allergies, no, just a bit o' bad luck with the heart.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Benic. I’m sorry to hear about your wife. Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. It’ll just take a few minutes. Would you be comfortable getting onto the table?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds fine. Physical exam is good. I'll get up on the table for ye, no problem at all. I'm not as nimble as I used to be, but I can manage. Just let me know if ye see anything worryin'.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Benic, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Please take deep breaths for me. Okay, your heart sounds a bit irregular, and I can hear some fluid in your lungs. I’m going to check your blood pressure now. Your blood pressure is a little high today, 148/92. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but a little tender when I press here. Okay, that completes the quick exam. I want to order some blood work and a chest X-ray to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that all sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work and an X-ray… good. I'd rather know what's goin' on, even if it's not good news. Yes, please, order them up. I trust yer judgment, Doctor. Just let me know what ye find.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Benic. I appreciate your trust. I’ll get the orders sent to the lab and radiology. It usually takes a few hours to get the results back. In the meantime, I’m going to start you on some intravenous fluids to help with dehydration from the vomiting. We'll also give you an anti-nausea medication to help with the sickness. While we’re waiting for the results, it’s important to monitor your heart rate and breathing. I’ll have a nurse check on you regularly. If you experience any chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or dizziness, please let the nurse know immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds good, Doctor. Fluids and somethin' for the sickness… that'll be grand. Hmm… well, I suppose… is it serious, Doctor? Is it… is it the heart gettin' worse? I'm worryin' it's somethin' bad, somethin' that can't be fixed.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Mr. Benic, and it’s understandable to be worried. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on without the results of the blood work and X-ray. However, given your history of heart failure, the new symptoms of nausea and vomiting, shortness of breath and fluid in your lungs, it could indicate your heart failure is worsening. It’s also possible something else is going on. What I can tell you is that we’re taking this seriously and are doing everything we can to find out what’s causing your symptoms. The blood work will help us assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels, and the X-ray will show us if there’s any fluid buildup in your lungs. We’ll discuss the results as soon as they’re available and create a plan of action together. It's important to remember that there are many treatment options available for heart failure, even if it is worsening. For now, let’s focus on getting you stable with the fluids and anti-nausea medication. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Aye, I understand. Fluids and anti-sickness, and then the tests will tell us more. Focus on gettin' stable… that makes sense. It's just… it's a lot to take in. I appreciate ye explainin' it so clearly, Doctor. It helps to know ye're takin' it seriously, and that there's still options. Thank ye. I'll just wait for the results, then. And let the nurse know if anythin' changes. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. It’s my job to explain things clearly and ensure you feel informed and cared for. Please don’t hesitate to let the nurse know if anything changes, even if it seems minor. We’re here to support you. I’ll check back with you as soon as the results are available. .
