DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I'm Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's get this over with. It's… well, it's my belly. It just… hangs. Always has, truth be told, but it's worse now. And my wife… well, she used to like it, but she’s gone now, so what does it matter? I just want it… smaller. Is that something you can do?
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. You’re concerned about some changes with your abdomen, and… a desire to reduce its size. Let’s try to be a little more specific, if you don’t mind. When you say it’s “worse now,” how long have you noticed this worsening?
PATIENT: Worsening? Hmm. Well, since… let me think. Since the funeral, I suppose. About six months now. Six months and a bit. Everything just feels… looser. And bigger. I used to have a bit of a… a shape, you understand? Now it's just… there.
DOCTOR: Six months, following your wife’s funeral. And you’ve noticed increased looseness and size in your abdomen, a change from a previous more defined shape. Okay. Has there been any change in your weight around the same time?
PATIENT: Weight? Hmm. Not really, not that I noticed. I eat about the same. Maybe a bit less, truth be told, haven't had much appetite. But I ain’t been weighing myself, if that’s what you mean. Always been a skinny man, even when I was working the pile driver. Still am, for that matter. Just got this… bulge now.
DOCTOR: Alright. The chart notes your height at 178 centimeters and weight at 122 pounds. That is a bit underweight, actually. Has anything else changed?
PATIENT: Underweight? Now hold on a minute. I may be slim, but I ain’t underweight. I'm strong as an ox, still am! And what's that got to do with my stomach? Look, are you going to help me fix this or just talk about my weight? I didn't come here for a lecture.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I’m causing offense, Mr. Trendler. I'm not trying to lecture you. Knowing your current weight is just important information for me to assess your overall health and figure out the best course of action. But let’s focus on your abdomen. Besides the size change, have you noticed any pain, discomfort, bloating, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Discomfort… sometimes a bit tight, but that's all. Bloating, not really. Bowel habits… well, they're a bit slower, I suppose. Always have been when I get a bit… upset. But nothing major, understand? It's just the look of it. It's… unsightly. It reminds me… never mind. Just want it smaller, if that's possible. Is there a way to do that without all this… talk?
DOCTOR: Okay. No pain, occasional tightness, slower bowel movements, and primarily concerned about the appearance. I understand. Before we discuss potential options, I’d like to perform a quick physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. Just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It involves listening to your abdomen with a stethoscope and gently feeling it to check for any abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Listen with a stethoscope? Feel my stomach? Look, I ain't a fan of people poking around. What exactly are you looking for? And will it… hurt? I don’t want any poking and prodding if it's gonna be uncomfortable. I came here for a simple fix, not a full examination.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Trendler. I wouldn't do anything to cause you discomfort. Listening with the stethoscope helps me assess bowel sounds, and gentle feeling allows me to check for any masses or tenderness. It's a standard part of evaluating abdominal concerns. It shouldn’t hurt, but if you feel any discomfort at all, please let me know immediately, and I will stop. It helps me rule out anything serious. If everything feels normal, we can discuss potential options, which might include lifestyle changes or a referral to a specialist if needed. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Lifestyle changes? What kind of changes? I eat perfectly fine, thank you very much. And a specialist? Look, I ain’t got time for all that. This is getting complicated. If it's just… fat, can’t you just… remove it? Like they do on the television? I’m a simple man, Doctor. I want a simple solution.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you’re hoping for a quick fix. It’s important to be realistic. While procedures like liposuction are available, they’re not always the best option, and they carry risks. Before we consider anything like that, I need to determine the cause of the abdominal change. It could be related to muscle tone, fat distribution, or other factors. A proper assessment is crucial. Would you allow me to do a brief examination, just to rule out any medical concerns?
PATIENT: Look, I’m telling you, it’s just a bit of a belly! I worked hard my whole life, running that pile driver. My body ain’t broke. I just want it gone. If you can't just fix it, then what's the point of me being here? Waste of my time, that’s what. But fine. Go ahead. But if it gets uncomfortable, I'm walking out. Understand? Don’t go poking around too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I understand. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen with this. Bowel sounds are present, though slightly diminished. Abdomen is soft, but slightly distended. No masses palpable. No tenderness to palpation. No acute findings, but there is some fullness. Given your weight and history, this could be related to decreased muscle tone and increased visceral fat. However, the diminished bowel sounds warrant further investigation. I recommend a stool analysis to rule out any underlying digestive issues and a repeat abdominal exam in one month to assess for any changes. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Stool analysis? You want me to… give you my stool? Now you’re just being ridiculous! I came here to get rid of my belly, not have you inspect my… waste! This is absolutely absurd. I'm leaving. Waste of time. Complete waste of time. Forget it. I'll just live with the belly. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Trendler, please wait. The stool analysis is a simple test to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your abdominal discomfort and changes. It’s not about inspecting waste; it’s about your health. But if you’re not comfortable with that, I respect your decision. I'm sorry we couldn't find a solution today. If you change your mind, please don’t hesitate to call. .
