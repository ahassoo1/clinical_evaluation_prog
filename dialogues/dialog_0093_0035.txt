DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sucich. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor Bakan. It's lovely to meet you as well. Well, it's these hiccups, you see. They just won't go away! Been with me for... goodness, almost a week now. It's a bit embarrassing, really, but they’re persistent.
DOCTOR: A week, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a full seven days. Started right after I had a particularly spicy curry with my granddaughter, Leilani. Though, I’ve had spicy curry before and never had this trouble. It's a funny thing, isn’t it? Sometimes your body just decides to do something different.
DOCTOR: Indeed, the body can be quite mysterious. And it's good you mention the curry, as timing can sometimes offer clues. Now, could you describe the hiccups for me?
PATIENT: Oh, they're… well, hiccups! You know, that little jerk in your chest, then you gulp air. They come and go, not really a pattern. Sometimes a few in a row, then nothing for a bit, then whoop – there they are again. They’re not painful, just… annoying. Especially when I'm trying to have a nice cup of tea.
DOCTOR: I understand. Annoying is a good way to put it. And you said they've been constant for seven days now?
PATIENT: Pretty much constant. There might be a few minutes here and there where I don’t have one, but then they always come back. It’s just… unrelenting. I tried holding my breath, like you always hear, and drinking water upside down. Nothing seems to do the trick.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the hiccups, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying them?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… Not really. I haven’t felt sick or anything. No heartburn, no trouble breathing. My appetite is normal, maybe a little less because it interrupts my tea, ha! No dizziness, no chest pain… Honestly, just the hiccups. It's just so strange to have one thing bothering me like this. I usually feel pretty good for my age, you know?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you generally feel well. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let's see… I had my gallbladder out years ago, probably twenty years now. And I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, nothing too bad, just a little stiffness. I also had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy. I've been lucky, really.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure, and for the arthritis, if any?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… for the blood pressure, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams every morning. And for the arthritis, just over-the-counter ibuprofen when my knees are acting up. Usually just a couple of tablets a day, if I need them at all.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, I don't. Never had a reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see… My mother had diabetes, later in life. And my father had heart trouble. My brother, he had high cholesterol, but that's about it, really. Nothing too alarming on either side, I think. We weren't a particularly sickly family, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly. I'm divorced, been on my own for quite a while now. I have three grown children, all doing well, and six lovely grandchildren. I keep busy with them, gardening, and volunteering at the local library. I don't smoke, and I only have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to stay active and keep my mind busy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Sucich. That gives me a good overall picture. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat, just to rule out anything obvious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Your breathing sounds very good. Now, if you would open your mouth for me, I’d like to take a quick look at your throat. Your throat appears normal, no redness or swelling. Everything looks healthy there as well.
PATIENT: Alright. That’s good to hear, isn’t it? It’s reassuring to know everything looks normal. So, what do you think is causing these hiccups, Doctor? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Well, Mrs. Sucich, given your otherwise good health and the normal physical examination findings, it’s unlikely to be something serious. Prolonged hiccups, like the ones you’ve been experiencing, can sometimes be caused by a variety of things. Often, they are idiopathic, meaning we don't have a clear cause. Sometimes, they are related to minor irritation of the nerves that control the diaphragm. Stress, excitement, or even certain medications can play a role. The fact that they started after a spicy meal could be a coincidence, or it could have been a minor irritation to the esophagus. In your case, it's most likely a benign, self-limiting condition. However, to be on the safe side, I would like to order a simple blood test to check your electrolyte levels and rule out any underlying metabolic imbalances. Also, a chest X-ray just to ensure there's nothing obvious going on in your lungs.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. I appreciate you being thorough. A blood test and an X-ray… yes, that makes me feel better. It’s good to rule things out. Will the blood test be a lot? I don't particularly like needles, you see.
DOCTOR: It won't be extensive, Mrs. Sucich. Just a standard panel to check your potassium, sodium, calcium, and kidney function. It's a relatively small sample, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. It should be quick and relatively painless. The X-ray is also quite simple—you'll just stand or sit in front of the machine, and it takes only a few seconds. I’ll write the orders for both tests now. Once the results are back—usually within a day or two—we'll review them together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to stay hydrated, and try to avoid any potential irritants like carbonated beverages or very spicy foods. If the hiccups become significantly worse or are accompanied by any new symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, or vomiting, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Hydrate, avoid spice… I can do that. And I will definitely contact you if anything changes. Thank you for taking the time to listen and for being so thorough. I feel a bit better already, just knowing we’re getting it checked out.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mrs. Sucich. It’s my pleasure. I understand how frustrating persistent hiccups can be, and I'm glad we’re taking steps to investigate. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and provide you with instructions for scheduling your chest X-ray. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you again for your time and attention. I appreciate it very much. .
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Mrs. Sucich. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Wishing you a speedy resolution to these hiccups. Have a good day. .
