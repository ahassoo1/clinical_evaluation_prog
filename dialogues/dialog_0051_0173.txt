DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailenne. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Glazewski, it’s nice to meet you too! Um, well, I’ve just been getting chills lately. It’s a bit weird, honestly. Not a fever or anything, just…cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills. And you said just chills, no fever, no other symptoms accompanying that?
PATIENT: No, nothing else really. Maybe a little tired, but I usually am, to be honest. It’s just…the cold feeling comes and goes. Like a shiver, but it lasts a bit longer than usual.
DOCTOR: I understand. And how long has this been going on for, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Probably about a week, maybe a little longer? It started slowly, and I just figured it was the AC being too high at work. But it’s still happening even on the weekends now.
DOCTOR: Okay, about a week or so. And you’ve noticed it regardless of your environment, even when you’re not at work?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. It's not just at work anymore. It happened yesterday when I was just relaxing at home, watching TV. And even this morning, getting ready. It’s just…annoying, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms at all alongside these chills?
PATIENT: Let me think... No, not really. I mean, I've been a little bit more thirsty than usual, maybe? But I always drink a lot of water, so I didn't really think anything of it. No cough, no sore throat, no aches… just the cold feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms besides the chills and slightly increased thirst. Now, have you had any recent changes in your life – any travel, new foods, increased stress, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… no travel, no new foods. Stress… well, the divorce is still pretty recent, so yeah, I guess there's that. It's been about six months now, but it still pops up sometimes, you know? I'm generally okay, but things still feel a bit… unsettled.
DOCTOR: I understand. A divorce is a significant life event, and it's perfectly normal to still be feeling the effects six months later. Okay. Now, let's go over some basics. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Oh! Except for a specific type of lotion once, it made my skin really itchy, but it was years ago. Nothing serious, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies besides a mild reaction to a lotion years ago. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, and sometimes I take ibuprofen if I have a headache. That's it. I try to stay away from taking too much stuff if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. Now, do you have any significant medical history – any chronic illnesses, hospitalizations, or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've been pretty healthy, thankfully. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that's about it. I try to eat well and get some exercise when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, otherwise generally healthy. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Um… my mom has high blood pressure, and my dad had diabetes. Both are managing it with medication, though. And my grandma on my mom’s side had arthritis. I think that’s about it. Nothing too major, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure, diabetes, and arthritis. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Go ahead. I hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and take a look at your throat. Then, I'll check your reflexes and feel your lymph nodes. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but otherwise sounds normal. Lungs are clear. Temperature is 98.8 Fahrenheit – slightly on the lower side, which could be consistent with the chills. Throat looks clear, no redness or swelling. Lymph nodes feel normal – no swelling or tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Everything seems normal on initial examination.
PATIENT: Okay, good. That’s…reassuring, I guess. So, what do you think it could be? Is it just a virus, or something else? I'm just a little worried, you know? I don’t usually get sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, and it's good that you're proactive about your health. Given your symptoms and the normal physical exam findings, it’s difficult to pinpoint a definitive cause at this moment. It could be a mild viral infection, although you don’t have typical viral symptoms like cough or congestion. The chills, slight lower temperature, and the recent stress could be contributing factors. Another possibility, though less likely given your history, is a thyroid issue. To rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order some blood tests. A complete blood count will help us look for signs of infection. We'll also check your thyroid levels to see if that's playing a role, and a basic metabolic panel to evaluate kidney function and electrolytes. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Blood tests are fine. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I feel kind of…off, and it's worrying me. So, thyroid and blood counts, right? How long will it take to get the results? And will I need to come back for another appointment?
DOCTOR: Yes, thyroid levels and a complete blood count. The lab results usually take about 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once I have them, I'll review them carefully and contact you to discuss the findings and next steps. Depending on the results, we may need to schedule a follow-up appointment for further evaluation, but hopefully, it will give us a clearer understanding of what's going on. In the meantime, I recommend staying hydrated, getting plenty of rest, and managing your stress levels as much as possible. If your symptoms worsen – such as developing a fever, severe fatigue, or any new symptoms – please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Dr. Glazewski. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and running the tests. I'll wait for the results and hopefully, it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. I'm glad I could help. We'll get to the bottom of this. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Have a good day, and I'll be in touch soon. .
