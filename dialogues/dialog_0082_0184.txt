DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Humph. Good morning to you too. Look here, Doctor, I ain’t got all day. It’s… well, it’s this body, see? It’s… not what it used to be. Always been strong, a pile driver don’t run itself, but… things are sagging. And frankly, it's embarrassing. I want it fixed. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. "Sagging," you say. And you’d like to get to the bottom of this… quickly. To help me understand, could you tell me a little more specifically where you’re experiencing this… sagging?
PATIENT: Where? Heavens, man, use your eyes! All over! Stomach, mostly. Arms a little. Used to be hard as rock, now it’s… wobbly. And the skin, it's loose! Like an old tent. I don’t need a geography lesson, Doctor, I’m telling you what’s wrong. Just fix it. Is that possible, or am I wasting my time?
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seemed…unfocused. It’s important for me to get a clear picture of what’s going on, and I understand your impatience. When did you first notice these changes?
PATIENT: Notice? Honestly, it was gradual. Years, probably. But it really got bad… maybe six months ago? After I stopped working, I guess. Not using those muscles every day. Used to lift steel beams all day, every day. Now... now I mostly sit. And this is what happens! You got some of them… treatments that can tighten things up, right? I heard on the television. Don't tell me I gotta exercise, because that ain't happenin'.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it seems to have worsened after you retired, coinciding with a decrease in physical activity. Yes, there are several options we can explore, though it's important to understand they don't always provide a complete “fix,” and the results vary. Before we discuss those, I'd like to get a little more information about your overall health. Have you experienced any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Well, I get tired easier, I suppose. Used to be able to work a full day, no problem. Now, I need a nap after just mowing the lawn. And my knees… they ache something awful. Doctor, look, I ain't here for a full checkup. I want to know if you can do something about this… problem area. The rest of me is fine. Mostly. Don't need you asking about my breakfast! Just tell me about the tightening.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re focused on the… “problem area,” Mr. Trendler, and we’ll certainly get to that. But it’s important to understand how everything is connected. The fatigue and knee pain could be related, and it's helpful for me to have a complete picture before recommending any treatment. Just briefly, have you noticed any swelling in your knees, or any stiffness when you first get up in the morning?
PATIENT: Swelling… sometimes. Not all the time. And yes, they’re stiff as boards in the morning. Takes a good while to get moving. I told you, Doctor, I'm an old pile driver. Been doing this work for fifty years. Things wear out. Just like machinery. Don’t need a lecture about the importance of breakfast and stretching. Can you tighten the skin or can’t you? That's all I wanna know. I got appointments later today.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. We can discuss options for addressing the loose skin. There are non-surgical and surgical possibilities. Non-surgical options, like radiofrequency treatments or ultrasound therapy, can sometimes help improve skin tone and elasticity, but the results are often subtle and require multiple sessions. Surgical options, like a tummy tuck or arm lift, provide more dramatic results but involve downtime and risks. Before we proceed further, I would like to perform a quick physical examination just to assess the extent of the skin laxity and rule out any other underlying conditions. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Humph. Downtime? Risks? See, this is what I was afraid of. Look, I ain't getting sliced open. I'm too old for that. Radio… whatever you called it. That sounds… less scary. But what kind of results can I expect? I ain’t paying for something that barely makes a difference. And how many sessions? And how much is this gonna cost me? Get to the point, Doctor. I haven't got all day. And no lectures.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s be straightforward. With radiofrequency treatments, you can expect a modest improvement in skin tightness and some reduction in the appearance of loose skin. It won’t give you the results of a surgical procedure, but it can make a noticeable difference. Typically, it requires a series of 6-8 sessions, spaced about 4-6 weeks apart. The cost per session is around $300-$500, depending on the area being treated. However, it’s difficult to give you an exact estimate without examining you first. Now, if you’re agreeable, I’d like to quickly examine your abdomen and arms just to assess the skin laxity and see if you’re a good candidate for this treatment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: $300-$500 per session?! Good heavens! That’s… expensive. Look, Doctor, I ain't made of money. And to be honest, I’m startin’ to think this whole thing is a waste of time. I've wasted enough time already, comin’ here and gettin’ questions asked. Fine. Examine me. Get it over with. But if you tell me I need six sessions at $500 a pop, I’m walkin’ out the door right now. Understand? Just… be quick about it. I got a dominoes game at three. And tell me, honestly, do you think it will actually make a difference? No sugarcoating.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Trendler. I assure you, I’ll be as quick and thorough as possible. And I’ll be honest with you about the potential results. If you're not a good candidate, or if the cost is prohibitive, I won’t recommend it. If you’d like, you can change into this gown, and we’ll get started. I'll need to examine your abdomen and arms while you are standing and lying down. I'll palpate the skin and assess the amount of laxity. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort during the examination.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But don’t go pokin’ around too much. I’m an old man, not a… a test subject. Just get it over with. And I swear, if you start talkin' about exercise, I'm leaving.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. If you could stand for me, please. I'm going to start by visually assessing the skin laxity in your abdomen and arms. Hmm. As you mentioned, there is significant skin laxity in both your abdomen and arms. The skin does have some elasticity, but it's not very robust. There's also a moderate amount of subcutaneous fat present. Based on my examination, you would likely benefit from radiofrequency treatments, but I want to be realistic about the results. It might not give you dramatic tightening, but it could improve skin tone and reduce some of the sagging. We're talkin' about a subtle improvement, Mr. Trendler. Maybe a 20-30% improvement at best. And it would require all six sessions for optimal results.
PATIENT: 20-30%?! After all that money and all those sessions?! That's… that's barely noticeable. Honestly, Doctor, I’m startin' to think I should just accept my fate. Sagging is sagging. What's the point of spendin’ all that money for something that barely makes a difference? Is there anything else? Any other options, even if they’re… expensive? I don’t want to spend a fortune, but I don’t want to just give up completely. Tell me straight. No sugarcoating. And no lectures about healthy living. I’m an old man. I've lived a good life. I just want to look a little… less wobbly.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be cautious, Mr. Trendler. Spending a significant amount of money for a limited result is not a good investment. As you mentioned, radiofrequency treatments offer only a modest improvement. The other option, as you suspected, is surgical intervention – a tummy tuck or arm lift. Those procedures provide more dramatic and lasting results, but they involve downtime, risks, and a more significant financial commitment. The cost of a tummy tuck can range from $8,000 to $15,000, depending on the complexity of the procedure, and an arm lift can range from $5,000 to $10,000. However, given your age and overall health, I would be hesitant to recommend surgery without a thorough evaluation by a qualified surgeon. We would need to assess your cardiovascular health, your ability to heal, and your risk of complications. Honestly, Mr. Trendler, it might be best to focus on accepting your body as it is and focusing on maintaining your overall health and well-being. There are many things you can do to feel good about yourself without resorting to expensive and potentially risky procedures.
PATIENT: Well… that’s what I figured. No magic fix. No easy answer. Just… gettin’ old. Look, Doctor. Thank you for your honesty. I appreciate you not tryin’ to sell me somethin’ I don’t need. And thank you for not givin’ me a lecture about exercise. I think… I think I’ll just go home. And maybe… maybe I’ll just buy a bigger shirt. I got a dominoes game at three. And frankly, I’m startin’ to feel a bit tired. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been… helpful. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Trendler. I’m glad I could provide some clarity. And enjoy your dominoes game! If you ever have any other concerns, please don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Trendler.
