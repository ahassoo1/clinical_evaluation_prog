DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you as well. Well, it is… a little embarrassing, to be honest. I have been… passing gas. A lot of gas. More than usual, and it is… disruptive, you understand? It started maybe a week ago, I think. Perhaps a little longer.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be quite bothersome, and you’re right to address it. There’s no need to be embarrassed at all – these things happen. “Disruptive” is a good way to put it. So, it's been going on for about a week or so, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately a week. Maybe ten days. It is… difficult to pinpoint exactly. But it is definitely more than it used to be. And it doesn’t seem to matter what I eat, Doctor. I tried cutting back on beans, like my mother always said, but it made no difference. I even avoided fizzy drinks. Still… the gas.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. It sounds like you've already tried some common dietary adjustments. And it’s not being influenced by anything specific that you’ve noticed, even eliminating potential triggers like beans and carbonated beverages. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you describe the gas itself?
PATIENT: Describe it? Well… it smells… normal, I suppose. Like… food, maybe? Not particularly bad, not particularly good. Just… there. It is mostly… just loud. Very loud. Sometimes it comes with a little… rumble in my tummy, but not always. It does not… hurt, Doctor. It is just… inconvenient. And… well, a little frightening when it happens in quiet places.
DOCTOR: Okay, “normal” smelling, mostly loud, occasionally a rumble, no pain. That’s good to know. No pain is definitely reassuring. When you say it happens in quiet places… is there a particular time of day it’s worse, or certain situations that bring it on?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. I do not think there is a specific time. It seems to happen… randomly. Though, perhaps it is a little worse after I eat. Not immediately, but a few hours later. And… when I am nervous, perhaps? Like now, talking about it. It makes me a little anxious, and then… the gas. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Goodstein. It sounds like there might be a connection between your anxiety and the gas. We'll definitely explore that. So, to get a more complete picture, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant problems… Well, I had my appendix out when I was a boy, a long time ago. And… I have a little bit of trouble with my blood pressure, sometimes. The doctor says it is “borderline.” I take a small pill for it, every morning. Otherwise, I am… fairly healthy, I think. I have not been to the hospital in many years.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And you mentioned a small pill for your blood pressure – do you mind telling me the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It is… Lisinopril. Just one small pill, every morning with my breakfast. I have been taking it for… maybe five years now? The doctor said it keeps things… even. And it seems to work. No problems with that, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, 5 years. Good. And any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I do not think so. I have never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. My mother always said I was a strong boy, and I have always had a good stomach. Though, perhaps… a little bit of trouble with dairy, sometimes? Not a full allergy, but it makes my tummy rumble a little. But that is all.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible dairy sensitivity, but no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or use tobacco in any form?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. My father smoked, and it was… not a good experience. I avoid it, completely. I do not even like being around people who smoke, if I can help it. I do enjoy a glass of wine with my dinner sometimes, but that is all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional glass of wine. Good. And how about alcohol consumption overall – how many drinks would you say you have in a typical week?
PATIENT: Hmm… perhaps two or three glasses of wine. Maybe four, if there is a special occasion. I do not drink beer or spirits, only wine. And not every day, certainly. More like… two or three times a week, perhaps? I do not go out to bars or anything like that. Mostly with my dinner at home.
DOCTOR: Okay, two to three glasses of wine a week, mostly with dinner. That’s helpful. Now, one last question about your lifestyle, and then we can move on to a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Are you currently experiencing a lot of stress in your life?
PATIENT: Stress… yes. Perhaps a little. I live alone, you see. My work is… routine. Fast food, you understand. It is not very exciting. And… well, I worry sometimes. About the future, mostly. About being alone. It is nothing major, but it is always… there. A little bit of stress, always.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you’re dealing with some understandable stressors, and that’s perfectly valid. It's good you're acknowledging that. Based on what you've told me so far—the excessive gas, the lack of specific triggers, the possible dairy sensitivity, and your current stress levels—it's possible this is related to Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS, possibly exacerbated by anxiety. However, to rule out other potential causes and get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable. We’ll just listen to your abdomen, and I’ll palpate it gently to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. I understand you need to check things properly. I am… a little nervous, to be honest, but I trust your judgment. If you think it is necessary, then please proceed. Listening and… palpating… yes, I understand.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It will be quick and shouldn't be uncomfortable. Just let me know if anything feels painful. Please lie back on the examination table. I'm just going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope, and then I'll gently press on different areas to feel for any tenderness. Okay, I’m listening now. Your bowel sounds are… slightly hyperactive, which can be consistent with gas and IBS. I don’t hear anything alarming. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. A little. Not sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. A bit of pressure. It is… a little sensitive there. But not anywhere else, really. Mostly just there, on the left side.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Some mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant. That could be related to gas build-up or potentially some sensitivity in that area of the colon. It doesn't seem to be anything acutely concerning. Alright. Based on everything you’ve told me, and the physical exam, I still suspect this is likely related to Irritable Bowel Syndrome, possibly triggered or exacerbated by stress and potentially some dietary sensitivities. To be more certain, and to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a couple of blood tests: a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool sample to check for any inflammation or infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… thorough. Blood tests and a… stool sample. Yes, of course. If that is what you think is best, then please proceed. I want to get to the bottom of this, and I trust your judgment. I suppose I should ask… how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab work usually takes about 3-5 business days to come back. Once I have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a more definitive plan. In the meantime, I'd recommend keeping a food diary to track what you're eating and when you experience symptoms. Also, try to incorporate some stress-reducing activities into your routine, even something simple like a daily walk or some deep breathing exercises. And try to avoid anything that you suspect might be a trigger, like dairy. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. You have explained everything very clearly. A food diary, stress reduction, and avoid dairy… yes, I can do that. Thank you very much for your time and your patience. I feel… a little bit better, just knowing there is a plan. When should I schedule the follow-up?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. Once the lab results are back, my nurse will give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment. Generally, we'll want to see you within a week of getting the results. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, fever, bloody stools, or significant weight loss, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Otherwise, I look forward to seeing you then. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That is all. Thank you again for everything. You have been very kind and helpful. I appreciate your time and your concern. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day as well. .
