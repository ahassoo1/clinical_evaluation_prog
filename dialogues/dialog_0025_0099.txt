DOCTOR: Well, hello Denis. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Fourney. It is a pleasure to meet you. I received some results back from a test… a test of my insides, I believe it was called, and they indicated something wasn’t quite right. An abnormal GI Endo Test, the paperwork said. I’m not entirely sure what that means, exactly, but my regular physician suggested I come in for a consultation with you.
DOCTOR: An abnormal GI Endo Test… yes, I see it here. Honestly, people self-diagnosing from paperwork these days. It is a bit much. Right. Well, an Endoscopy looks at your digestive tract. “Abnormal” can mean a lot of things, Denis. Let’s start with the basics. Can you tell me what prompted them to do this test in the first place?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. It wasn't self-diagnosis, I assure you. It began with… well, some discomfort. A persistent ache in my abdomen, really. And some… changes in my usual routine, if you understand. I was feeling quite bloated, and… less regular, shall we say? My physician thought it best to investigate, and that led to the test. It started perhaps three months ago, the discomfort. It hasn’t been severe, but… constant enough to be worrying.
DOCTOR: Three months of “discomfort.” Right. And by “discomfort,” are we talking cramping?
PATIENT: Not precisely cramping, Doctor. It’s more of a… dull ache, low down in my belly. It doesn’t come and go in waves, like a cramp. It’s just… there. And sometimes it feels… full. Like I’ve eaten a very large meal, even when I haven’t. It’s difficult to describe, I apologize. It's not a sharp pain, thankfully, but… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Unsettling. Yes. Well, Denis, let’s try to be a little more specific. On a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate this ache at its worst?
PATIENT: That is… a fair question, Doctor. Hmm. At its worst… I would say perhaps a four? It’s rarely more than that, thankfully. A four, as in, noticeable and uncomfortable, but not debilitating. I can still go about my daily activities, but it's always… present, nagging at me. And it does sometimes interfere with my sleep, if I lie on my stomach, for example.
DOCTOR: A four, consistently for three months. And you said changes in your usual routine… can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Certainly. As I mentioned, my… regularity has been affected. Fewer trips to the restroom, if you understand. And when I do go, it’s… not quite the same consistency as it used to be. Shall we say, a bit harder. I’ve also noticed… a bit of fatigue. I tire more easily, even with my usual amount of activity. I generally try to remain active, you see – I enjoy my metal work, it keeps me busy. But lately, I find myself needing more rest afterwards. It’s subtle, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Metal work... interesting. And this fatigue… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's more consistent, Doctor, rather than coming and going in waves. I wouldn’t say I’m exhausted, mind you. Just… depleted more easily. It's as if my energy reserves are lower than usual. I used to be able to work for hours on my projects without a break, but now I find myself needing to pause and rest every so often. And it takes longer to recover afterwards. It’s a gradual change, but I’ve definitely noticed it. I am 67, of course, so perhaps some of it is simply age. But this feels… different.
DOCTOR: Age is a factor, Denis. Always is. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything significant?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Let me see… I had a bout of pneumonia when I was quite young, perhaps ten years old. And I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. Other than that, nothing significant. I’ve always been quite healthy, actually. I pride myself on my good health, and I've always been very careful about what I eat and how I live. No chronic illnesses, no surgeries beyond the gallbladder, and I've never been hospitalized for anything serious. I do have a touch of arthritis in my hands, from the metal work, but it's well-managed.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia as a child, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, arthritis… Alright. Any family history of anything noteworthy?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My mother suffered from high blood pressure in her later years, and my older brother had diabetes. He managed it well enough, with medication and diet. My father, bless his soul, was remarkably healthy throughout his life. He lived to be eighty-nine, and was still gardening up until a few months before he passed. On my mother’s side, there was a great aunt who had… I believe it was colon cancer. Quite a long time ago, though. Perhaps forty years ago. It was… a difficult time.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, diabetes, colon cancer… Alright. Now, before we proceed, Denis, let's just quickly go over your medications and allergies. Are you currently taking anything, prescribed or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a small amount, Doctor. I take a daily multivitamin, of course. And occasionally, when my arthritis flares up, I take ibuprofen. Over-the-counter, you understand. I am not allergic to any medications, as far as I am aware. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. And I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Denis, based on what you've told me – the persistent abdominal ache, the changes in your bowel habits, the fatigue, and your family history – it could be a number of things. We need to investigate further. I'd like to perform a physical exam. Can you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I understand. A physical exam sounds… sensible. Yes, I can lie down on the examination table. Please, lead the way. I trust your judgement. I will do as you advise.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie flat, and I’ll begin with auscultation – listening to your abdomen. …Bowel sounds are present, though somewhat diminished. No bruits detected. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness or pain. …Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not particularly. A slight pressure, perhaps, but no pain. It feels… normal, as far as I can tell. It’s much like when I’m examined for my annual check-up. Just a bit of pressure, that’s all. Though… perhaps a little more sensitivity on the left side, lower down. It’s not sharp pain, mind you, but… a subtle awareness. I can feel it more when you press there.
DOCTOR: …Yes, I detect some mild tenderness here. Not alarming, but worth noting. Now, I’m going to percuss your abdomen. This just helps me assess for any fluid or masses. …Sounds are tympanic throughout, no dullness detected. Now, I’m going to check for rebound tenderness… please let me know if this is painful. …Any pain when I release pressure like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain when you release the pressure. It's… surprisingly comfortable, actually. A bit of a strange sensation, perhaps, but not painful at all. I was a little apprehensive, but it's not unpleasant. I appreciate you explaining each step, it puts my mind at ease. Is that… a normal response?
DOCTOR: It’s… good that there’s no rebound tenderness. That rules out some things. However, the mild tenderness in the left lower quadrant, combined with your symptoms and family history… I’m going to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel to get a better baseline. We should also repeat the GI Endo test, as sometimes things are missed. And, frankly, Denis, given your age and family history of colon cancer, I think we need to consider a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… I see. That sounds… thorough. And perhaps necessary, given the circumstances. I understand your reasoning, Doctor. I do, however, confess to some apprehension. I’ve heard… stories. Is it a painful procedure? And is it absolutely essential? I’m not opposed to doing what needs to be done, of course, but… a little reassurance would be greatly appreciated.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be apprehensive, Denis. A colonoscopy isn't pleasant, but it’s also not the ordeal people make it out to be. You’ll be sedated – you won’t feel a thing during the procedure. The prep – the cleansing beforehand – is the least enjoyable part, admittedly. As for essential… given your age, your family history of colon cancer, and these persistent symptoms, it’s prudent. It's the best way to rule out anything serious and give you peace of mind. We are looking for polyps, or any other abnormalities. Early detection is key, Denis. I’ll give you a referral to Dr. Ramirez – he’s excellent. He’ll explain the procedure in detail, answer all your questions, and schedule the appointment. In the meantime, we’ll get those blood tests done and repeat the GI Endo test. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… quite reasonable. Dr. Ramirez, you say? I shall look forward to speaking with him. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. The blood tests and the repeat Endo test… certainly. I trust your judgement implicitly. Early detection… you are quite right. Peace of mind… that is invaluable. Thank you, Doctor Fourney. I feel… much better informed now. What is the next step? Do I need to schedule the blood tests immediately?
DOCTOR: Yes, the lab is right down the hall, room 203. I’ll send the order electronically. They’ll draw blood for the CBC and CMP. It should take about thirty minutes, and you’ll need to be fasting – no food or drink for eight hours beforehand. I’m also sending a prescription for a mild stool softener to help with the prep for the repeated GI Endo test. And, as I mentioned, I’ll send the referral to Dr. Ramirez. He’ll contact you to schedule the colonoscopy. Here are your lab orders and the prescription. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe you have covered everything quite thoroughly. Eight hours fasting for the blood tests, stool softener for the prep… I shall make a note of that immediately. Thank you again for your time and your… patience. You have eased my anxieties considerably. I’m very grateful. I shall see you again, then, after the tests are completed. Have a pleasant day, Doctor Fourney. .
DOCTOR: You too. Next patient. .
