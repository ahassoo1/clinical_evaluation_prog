DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Bilstein, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Genette Bilstein. Though… everyone just calls me Genette. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Sink, is it? My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, Sink. And please, just get to the point. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my legs. They… they bother me at night. Cramp up something awful. It wakes me up, usually. It’s been going on for…oh dear. A while now. I can’t rightly say how long, exactly. It just… started. It’s not a constant thing, thankfully, but when it happens, it’s quite painful.
DOCTOR: Nighttime leg cramps. Right. And how would you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it's a tight squeezing, mostly. Like someone’s… well, like someone’s twisting my calf muscle really hard. And it feels… deep. Not just on the surface, if that makes sense. It’s hard to explain. It just hurts. It makes me want to… well, to stretch it, but sometimes that doesn't even help.
DOCTOR: Do you have any other symptoms with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I’ve noticed, really. No swelling, no numbness… just the cramping. Sometimes my leg feels a little achy the next day, but that passes quickly. I do get tired easily, but… well, I’m eighty-four, dear. I suppose that’s to be expected. I wouldn't say it's related, if you understand me. Just old age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Any past medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That's a hard one. I've lived a long life, you see. I had a bad bout of the flu when I was younger, and…well, my husband, God rest his soul, he always took care of the doctor visits. I mostly just… let him handle it. I think I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. But honestly, Doctor, I couldn’t say for certain. It was so many years back. I apologize. My mind just isn’t as sharp as it once was.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: No, no medications, dear. I haven't taken anything regularly in… oh, goodness. Years. A little aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's it. I try to stay away from pills if I can. My mother always said they’re more trouble than they’re worth. I just drink a lot of water and try to get some rest. Though, as I said, these cramps are making that difficult.
DOCTOR: Allergies?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I’m aware of. I used to help my grandmother with her garden, and I handled all sorts of plants, never had a reaction. And I’ve eaten just about everything over the years, never anything bothered me. I don’t believe I’m allergic to anything, no. Though… now that I think of it, I did get a bit of a rash once from a bee sting when I was a child. But that was ages ago, and it wasn't a serious reaction. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: We’ll get to it eventually. Let me just… Alright. I’m going to have a quick look at your legs now, if you don’t mind. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Whatever you think best. It's a little tricky these days, getting up and down, you see. But I’ll manage. Is that table… high? I don't want to fall.
DOCTOR: It’s adjustable. Just lie down. I need to assess your circulation and reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh, good. That's a relief. There we are. Alright, Doctor. Do whatever you need to do. Just… be gentle, please? I bruise easily, you see. Old age, again. It’s a nuisance.
DOCTOR: Pulses are present, though a bit weak in the lower extremities. Reflexes are diminished, as expected for your age. No significant swelling or discoloration. Skin is cool to the touch. Any history of varicose veins?
PATIENT: Varicose… Oh, dear. I’m not sure I know what those are, exactly. I think my mother had some, on her legs. They were… kind of bumpy and blue, I think? But I don’t recall ever being told I had them. I used to wear stockings, quite often, when I was younger. Maybe that helped? I don't know. Everything's a bit of a blur, I'm afraid. Is that important, Doctor? Are they causing these cramps, perhaps?
DOCTOR: It's possible. Alright. I’m going to order some basic blood work: a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a magnesium level. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but it’s best to rule out any underlying imbalances.
PATIENT: Oh, very well, dear. Whatever you think is best. Blood work… that sounds… alright. I do hope it doesn’t take too long. I get rather nervous around needles, you see. And I have a little… a little tea party with my niece later this afternoon. I wouldn’t want to be late. Will it take long to get the results?
DOCTOR: The lab usually gets them back within a few days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment then to discuss the results. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated, and consider gentle stretching exercises before bed. I’ll give you this requisition form. Go to the lab downstairs, and they’ll take care of it. It should only take a few minutes. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. Downstairs, to the lab. Hydrate and stretch. Gentle stretching... I think I can manage that. Will they… will they need an appointment at the lab too? I don't want to have to wait too long. My legs aren’t what they used to be, you see. Long waits are… difficult.
DOCTOR: No appointment necessary. Just go downstairs. They’re used to older patients. Next. Is there anything else I should know?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I suppose… well, sometimes I feel a little tingling in my feet, now that you mention it. Not all the time, just… occasionally. And it's worse when it's cold. I wear thick socks, usually. But it doesn’t really seem to help much. It’s probably just old age, again. I don’t want to bother you with… with trivial things. Is that… important? Or should I just ignore it?
DOCTOR: Peripheral neuropathy is common with age. We’ll keep it in mind. Alright. That’s all I have for now. I’ll see you for a follow-up appointment next week. My nurse will schedule that for you on your way out. Any questions?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think… I think that’s everything. Next week, then. With the nurse. I do appreciate your time, Doctor. And your… patience. It’s just… hard to remember everything these days. Thank you. I suppose I’ll just… go find the nurse. Is she… nearby?
DOCTOR: Down the hall, to your left. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to see. .
PATIENT: Oh. Very well. Thank you again, Doctor. Down the hall… to the left. Down the hall to the left… I hope I remember. .
