DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I'm Dr. Burlingham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it's about my… business. In the bathroom, you see. Not a pleasant topic, I assure you. There was… blood. In the stool. Not a little, either. Quite concerning, really, for a man of my… standing.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood in the stool. And you say “quite concerning”?
PATIENT: Concerning! Of course it's concerning! I used to fly these fancy jets, you know. Top of the line. Didn’t have time for… this sort of thing back then. A man needs to be regular when you’re responsible for hundreds of lives. It’s… unsettling. Makes a fella wonder what’s going on inside, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I understand it's unsettling. And your… profession is duly noted. Now, can you tell me when you first noticed this blood?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It wasn’t yesterday, no. Maybe… the day before? It’s hard to say precisely. I don’t go poking around in things, if you understand. Just… noticed it. After. It was… bright red. Not like those old war movies, thankfully. More of a… streak. A rather alarming streak, I must say.
DOCTOR: Bright red, you said. And just the one instance, or has this happened more than once?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s happened a couple of times now, yes. Not every time, mind you. Just… occasionally. Seems to come and go. Which is what makes it so frustrating! A man likes predictability, you see. Especially at my age. Everything’s falling apart as it is.
DOCTOR: A couple of times… unpredictable. Alright. And is it just blood, or have you noticed any changes in your… bowel movements themselves?
PATIENT: Changes? Well… they seem a little… thinner, perhaps? Not as… substantial as they used to be. And a bit… harder to pass, if you don't mind my saying. It's not something a gentleman discusses openly, naturally, but you are the doctor. It's just… not as easy as it once was. Everything’s looser these days, you know. Not just… down there.
DOCTOR: Thinner, harder to pass… Alright. And any abdominal pain or discomfort along with this?
PATIENT: Pain? Not exactly pain. More of a… cramping. A bit of a rumble, if you catch my drift. It comes and goes, like everything else these days. Mostly just after… well, after the incident. It’s not debilitating, mind you. Just… bothersome. A gentleman shouldn't have to worry about his stomach, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any weight loss recently, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. Now that you mention it… my trousers have been feeling a bit… loose around the waist. Though, to be fair, that could just be old age. Everything’s shrinking these days. But yes, I suppose I haven’t been eating quite as much lately. Didn't have much of an appetite, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, Mr. Rowbottom. Just to get a better idea of what’s going on. I’ll need you to lie down on the table, please. And we’ll start with listening to your abdomen. It won't be pleasant, but necessary.
PATIENT: Hmph. Listening to my abdomen? Sounds… invasive. But I suppose you’re the doctor. Very well. Though I must warn you, I haven't been entirely comfortable with doctors since… well, never mind. Just try to be quick about it, alright? And no poking, if you please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Just relax and breathe normally. Now, tell me if you feel any tenderness anywhere as I press. Anything here feel particularly uncomfortable?
PATIENT: Hmph. A bit chilly, actually. This gown isn't very… substantial. And yes, that is rather uncomfortable. Right… there. A bit tender, just on the left side. Not excruciating, mind you, just… a bit of a twinge. Feels… bloated, if you catch my drift. Like a balloon about to burst. Honestly, the indignity of it all. A former airline pilot, reduced to being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm also going to do a quick digital rectal exam, Mr. Rowbottom. I know it's not pleasant, but it's important to rule out any obvious issues. I'll use lubricant and be as quick as possible. Please let me know if you experience any pain during this.
PATIENT: Hmph. Another exam? Honestly! The things a man has to endure. Lubricant, you say? Well, that’s… marginally reassuring. But still. This is… undignified, to say the least. Do hurry up, alright? And please, be gentle. I haven't been feeling particularly… robust lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. I did detect some mild tenderness and… a small area that feels a little irregular. And there was a small amount of occult blood present on the glove. Mr. Rowbottom, based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, I’m concerned about the possibility of a lesion in your colon. The blood in your stool, the changes in your bowel movements, the weight loss, and the tenderness all point to this. I'm going to order a stool test to confirm the presence of blood, and I want you to get a colonoscopy as soon as possible.
PATIENT: A colonoscopy?! Good heavens. What does that even involve? And a lesion? Are you saying… cancer? Honestly, this is dreadful. Utterly dreadful. I haven't the energy for all this fuss. And a stool test? More indignity! Is there… is there anything else I can do? Perhaps a strong dose of… something? I don't want any poking around inside me, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, I understand your concerns. A colonoscopy involves inserting a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your rectum to visualize the entire colon. It allows us to identify the source of the bleeding and take a biopsy if necessary. It’s the best way to determine what’s going on. And while I can’t say definitively whether it’s cancer at this point – that’s what the colonoscopy will help us determine – it’s important to rule it out. I'm not going to downplay the seriousness of your symptoms, but early detection is key. There aren't any other reliable ways to get a definitive diagnosis without a colonoscopy. A “strong dose of something” won’t address the underlying issue and could even mask the symptoms, making it harder to treat later. I’m going to order the stool test to confirm the bleeding, and then I’ll give you a referral to a gastroenterologist who can schedule the colonoscopy. They will explain the procedure in detail and answer all your questions. Would you like me to write down the name of a highly-recommended specialist?
PATIENT: Hmph. A specialist, you say? Very well. Write down the name, please. And make sure they're… gentle. I don't have much tolerance for… rough handling these days. This is all so… unsettling. A man expects to fade away peacefully, not be poked and prodded and… examined. Honestly. But… early detection, you said? Well, I suppose that’s something. Just… please, make sure they explain everything thoroughly. I don’t want any surprises. And… are there any risks involved with this… colonoscopy?
DOCTOR: Here you go. Dr. Eleanor Vance. She has a very good reputation, and her staff is excellent. She’s known for being thorough and explaining everything clearly. As for risks, any medical procedure carries some risk, but colonoscopy is generally very safe. The most common risks are perforation of the colon – which is rare – and bleeding. There’s also a small risk of infection. Dr. Vance will discuss these risks with you in detail before the procedure, and you’ll have the opportunity to ask any questions you have. She will also review your medical history to assess your individual risk factors. I’m also going to give you a prescription for a mild stool softener to help with the changes in your bowel movements. And I recommend you maintain a healthy diet, stay hydrated, and avoid straining. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Hmph. A stool softener… marginally reassuring. And a healthy diet… well, I suppose I can try. It’s all so… much. I haven’t been feeling up to much lately, if I’m honest. This Dr. Vance… is she… old? I prefer a doctor who understands the… sensitivities of a man of my age. And… what if this is… the worst? What if it’s… cancer? I don’t want to… dwell on it, but… it’s a worry.
DOCTOR: Dr. Vance is very experienced, and quite compassionate. She’s been practicing for over 20 years, and she’s very good at putting patients at ease. I believe you’ll find her to be very understanding. And I understand your worry about the possibility of cancer, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s natural to be afraid. However, it’s important to remember that not all bleeding is caused by cancer. Many other conditions can cause it, and we won’t know for sure until we do the colonoscopy and take a biopsy. If it is cancer, there are many effective treatments available, especially when it’s caught early. Dr. Vance will discuss all your options with you and help you make the best decision for your health. Right now, the most important thing is to focus on getting the colonoscopy scheduled. I'm going to arrange for a referral today and have the office contact you to set up an appointment. Do you want me to write a note for your employer or any other arrangements you need made?
PATIENT: Hmph. No. No employer to notify. Retired, you see. A former airline pilot. Used to be in charge of hundreds of lives, now… I'm just a worry to my… well, never mind. Just… a referral will do. And… thank you. For… not dismissing me as an old man. It’s… appreciated. I suppose. Just… get it over with, alright? Get it over with as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I understand. I'll get that referral sent over right away. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. I'll also make a note for my nurse to check in with you to see if you need any assistance scheduling. We're going to get this sorted out. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that's all. Just… try to be quick about it, alright? And… thank you again. For… listening.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. You take care now. And remember, don’t hesitate to call if you need anything. .
