DOCTOR: Hi Kiante, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. Confirming I'm able to fly. It's… a bit complicated, but I’m planning a trip overseas and they need official confirmation from a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medical clearance letter for flying. I can definitely help with that. That is a good idea to get sorted out ahead of time. To write that letter accurately, I’ll need some information from you. First, where are you planning to travel to, and roughly how long will the flight be?
PATIENT: It’s to Mongolia, actually. Back home, to see family. The flight… let me see. It's about fourteen, maybe fifteen hours total, with a layover in Seoul. It's a long one, yes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mongolia – wonderful! And fifteen hours with a layover... that’s a significant flight. Now, do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. Otherwise, nothing major. I've been pretty healthy, thankfully. My husband… well, he wasn't so lucky, but that was… different.
DOCTOR: Okay, so pneumonia a few years ago with full recovery – good to know. We'll definitely document that. And I understand you don't want to dwell on your husband’s health. That's perfectly alright. Just to be thorough, have you had any recent surgeries or been hospitalized for anything else?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. And no, not hospitalized since… well, since my husband. Just the pneumonia a few years back. I had a really bad cough and fever for a couple of weeks, but the antibiotics cleared it right up. Honestly, that was the worst of it.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. No recent surgeries or hospitalizations aside from the pneumonia. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nothing at all. I can eat anything, take most medications... no reactions, ever. My mother always said I had an iron stomach, which is probably why I traveled so much with my husband. We were always trying new foods.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to know. An iron stomach can be very handy! And I’m glad to hear you haven’t had any allergic reactions. Are you currently taking any medications at all, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Not a single thing. I try to stay healthy with good food and plenty of rest, that's it. I don't really believe in loading up on pills unless absolutely necessary. And right now, I don’t need any.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. That simplifies things. Now, let's talk a little bit about your general health. Have you been experiencing any pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I’ve been feeling really good, actually. A little tired, maybe, with all the planning for the trip, but that’s it. No pain, no dizziness, breathing is fine... everything feels normal. I really don't want to cause any trouble on the flight, so I wanted to get this letter just to be safe.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you're feeling well overall, and it's very responsible of you to get this letter beforehand. Just to be complete, I'd like to quickly run through a basic review of systems, just to make sure we haven't missed anything. It’s a series of questions about different parts of your body. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I understand it's just to be thorough. I'm happy to answer whatever you need. Just let me know.
DOCTOR: Great. Let's start with your heart. Have you experienced any chest pain, palpitations, or irregular heartbeats?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My heart feels strong. I used to walk a lot when we traveled, exploring new cities... lots of hills, you know? Never any problems. No chest pain, no fluttering, nothing. Perfectly normal, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And what about your lungs?
PATIENT: No problems with my lungs either. As I said, I had pneumonia a few years ago, but I fully recovered. Since then, no coughing, no wheezing, no shortness of breath. I can walk up stairs just fine, no trouble at all. I even did some gardening a few weeks ago, bending and lifting... no issues.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about your digestive system?
PATIENT: Perfectly fine. I told you, I have an iron stomach! No problems with my digestion at all. No pain, no bloating, no… irregularities. Everything works as it should. I can eat pretty much anything, and I usually do when I'm traveling!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Let's move on. Have you had any recent changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: No, not at all. My vision is still pretty good, I think. I wear reading glasses sometimes, just for small print, but that’s nothing new. And my hearing is fine. I can hear you perfectly well, no problems there. My husband used to say I had ears like a hawk!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And finally, have you experienced any recent changes in your mood, sleep patterns, or any unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, none of those things. My sleep is pretty regular, I’ve been a little restless with excitement about the trip, but that's all. No changes in my mood, and my weight is stable. I haven’t lost or gained anything recently. Is that everything?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very thorough, thank you. It sounds like you're in good overall health. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to confirm what you’ve told me. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Please go ahead. I just want to get this letter so I can see my family, so anything you need to do, just let me know.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out as I listen. Your heart sounds regular and strong, no murmurs or extra sounds. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 128/78, which is good, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Throat looks clear, no redness or swelling, and your ears are normal. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Everything seems normal on the physical exam, consistent with what you've told me. I'm confident I can write a letter confirming you're medically cleared to fly. Do you have any specific requests for what should be included in the letter?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful! Thank you, Doctor. Um… could you just mention that I had pneumonia a few years ago but fully recovered, and that I'm in good overall health with no current medical issues? And maybe just a sentence saying I’m able to tolerate long flights? That should be enough, I think. The airline is just being cautious.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll include all of that in the letter – mentioning the previous pneumonia with full recovery, confirming your good overall health, and stating your ability to tolerate long flights. Give me just a few minutes, and I’ll have it printed out for you. While I’m doing that, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I really appreciate it. Getting this letter is such a weight off my shoulders. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Here you go. This confirms you are medically cleared for travel and includes the information we discussed. I've also included my contact information should the airline have any further questions. Do you have any other concerns I can address today, or is there anything else I can help you with?
PATIENT: Oh, perfect! Thank you so much, Doctor. This is exactly what I needed. No, that's everything. Truly. I really appreciate your time and your help. You’ve been wonderful. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. It was my pleasure to help. I hope you have a wonderful trip and a lovely time visiting your family. Safe travels, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. Have a good day as well.
