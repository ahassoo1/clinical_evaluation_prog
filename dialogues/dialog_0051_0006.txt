DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Um… well, I have been… coughing up some blood. Just a little, but it worried me, so I thought I should come see someone. It happened a few times now.
DOCTOR: Okay, coughing up blood… that certainly warrants a check-up. Just to clarify, Ms. Weichers, when you say “a few times now,” could you tell me roughly how many times this has happened, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… two weeks ago? And it’s happened… four times, I believe. Not a lot each time, just… spots, really. Like when you brush your teeth too hard, maybe? Is that… a good way to explain it? I am sorry, I don't know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That actually is a helpful comparison, Ms. Weichers. Thank you for sharing that. It gives me a better idea of the amount. And no need to apologize at all – describing these things can be tricky. Two weeks, four times, small amounts… alright. Have you noticed anything else associated with the coughing?
PATIENT: Um… yes. Sometimes I feel a little… tired afterwards. Not very much, just a bit more tired than usual. And… a little short of breath, maybe? But I don’t get winded easily, normally. I walk every day, you see. It is just… after the coughing. And… I have a little ache in my chest, sometimes. Not a bad ache, but… present.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue afterwards, shortness of breath following the cough, and a mild chest ache. Thank you. Now, Ms. Weichers, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well… my husband… he passed away three years ago. It was… very sad. And I had pneumonia when I was younger, maybe… twenty years ago? It was not very serious, I recovered quickly. Other than that… I have not been to the doctor much. I try to stay healthy. I eat good food, I walk every day… I don't really have any other problems, I think.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Weichers. And it’s good to hear you generally stay healthy. Pneumonia twenty years ago… was that treated with antibiotics, do you recall?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. I remember taking… pills. Many pills. And resting a lot. The doctor came to the house. It was… a long time ago. I don't remember exactly what the pills were, but I know I had to take them for many days. And I got better, thankfully. It was a very scary time.
DOCTOR: Okay, treated with antibiotics, recovered fully. Good. Have you ever had any surgeries, Ms. Weichers?
PATIENT: No, never. I have not had any surgeries. I have been very lucky, I think. I have always been healthy enough to avoid them. Just the usual things, like… vaccinations when I was a child.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And you mentioned vaccinations as a child. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don’t think so. I have never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, I don’t have any problems with pollen or animals… No, I don’t have any allergies, as far as I know. I have very strong stomach, usually.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications. Just… vitamins, sometimes. A multivitamin, once in a while, when I remember. But I haven’t taken one in a few weeks, I think. I try to get my vitamins from my food.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Now, Ms. Weichers, to get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had some problems with his heart when he was older. He smoked a lot when he was young. My brother is healthy, as far as I know. We don't see each other very often. And… that is about it. Nothing major, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure in your mother, and heart problems in your father, who smoked. Thank you. And finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… I live alone, as I mentioned, since my husband passed away. I have a few friends, but we don't see each other very often. I used to work as a physical therapist, but I retired a few years ago. Now I mostly… walk, garden, read. I don't drink alcohol, and I have never smoked. I try to stay active and keep busy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Weichers. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your throat, and feel your lymph nodes. It shouldn't take too long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me, in through your nose and out through your mouth. Your heart sounds are regular, though a little faint. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though I do hear some mild diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes. Your throat is clear, no redness or swelling. I do feel a few slightly enlarged, but non-tender, lymph nodes in your neck. Not overly concerning, but something to keep an eye on. Now, I'd like to look at your throat with a light. Just open your mouth and say “ah” for me.
PATIENT: That is okay, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your throat appears slightly red, but no obvious signs of infection. Your tonsils are normal in size. Now, just to be thorough, I'm going to check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter. This is just a clip that goes on your finger. Your oxygen saturation is 96%, which is within a normal range. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and this initial exam, I’m concerned about the coughing up blood, the mild fatigue, and the slightly enlarged lymph nodes. It’s difficult to say definitively what’s causing this without further investigation. It could be a number of things, from a mild respiratory infection to something more serious. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. If that will help you find out what is wrong, then please do. A chest X-ray and… the blood count. Yes, that is fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I’ll get the orders sent to the radiology department and the lab. They’ll contact you to schedule the X-ray and blood draw. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms – such as a fever, significant shortness of breath, or a large amount of blood when you cough – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Once we have the results of the X-ray and blood work, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. I will definitely go to the emergency room if things get worse. And I will wait for the results, and then we can talk about them. Thank you very much for your help. I feel much better knowing that we are doing something to find out what is wrong.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I’m glad I could help. I understand this can be worrying, and we'll work through this together. I’ll also give you a written summary of our discussion and the orders for the tests before you leave. Do you have any questions for me right now, before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You have explained everything very clearly. I think I will just wait for the results of the tests, and then we can talk more. Thank you again for your kindness and patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I'm glad I could reassure you. Just remember, if anything changes, don’t hesitate to contact the office. Here are the papers. They detail everything we discussed today and provide the instructions for scheduling your tests. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself. We’ll be in touch once the results are available. .
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor. You too. .
