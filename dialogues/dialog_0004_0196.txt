DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. It’s been going on for a while now, I guess. Honestly, it’s hard to say how long. Everything feels a bit blurry these days.
DOCTOR: "A while now," is… not particularly helpful, Ms. Licano. We need to establish a timeframe for proper assessment. Can you try to recall when you first noticed this persistent fatigue?
PATIENT: Ugh, timelines… right. Honestly? Maybe… after my husband passed? It’s hard to separate everything, you know? Grief and… just feeling run down. It’s all mixed up. Was that… 2020? I think so. Or maybe 2021? It all feels like one long… haze.
DOCTOR: So, approximately 2020, following your husband’s passing. And this fatigue has been continuous since then?
PATIENT: Continuous… yeah, I think so. Some days are worse than others, definitely. But it’s always there. Like… a weight. It’s not just being sleepy, you know? It’s… everything feels like too much effort. Even getting out of bed.
DOCTOR: And are there any other symptoms accompanying this fatigue, Ms. Licano?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I get… achy, sometimes. My joints, mostly. And I forget things… a lot. You probably noticed that already! It's not like… big things, usually. Just… where I put my glasses, what I was doing… little things.
DOCTOR: Aches and forgetfulness. Can you describe the aches?
PATIENT: Oh, they're just… all over. Mostly my knees and hips, but sometimes my back too. Not sharp pain, just… dull and constant. Like I’ve done too much gardening, even when I haven’t. It’s worse in the mornings, I think. And in the cold weather. It's… annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And the forgetfulness… has it been getting worse, or has it stayed relatively the same?
PATIENT: Oh, I think it’s worse. It’s hard to tell, really. I keep misplacing things, forgetting appointments… little things that I used to never do. My daughter keeps having to remind me. It's embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Not really. I eat about the same, I think. Maybe a little less, now that I don’t… well, I used to bake a lot for my husband. Now… not so much. And my weight… I haven’t weighed myself in ages. I used to be quite thin. Still am, I guess. I don’t really pay attention to that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Ms. Licano, do you have any difficulty sleeping?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, sometimes. I fall asleep alright, usually. But I wake up a lot during the night. Just… restless. And I don’t always feel rested when I get up, even if I’ve slept for a good eight hours. It’s frustrating. It’s… just one thing after another.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… sometimes. A little… irregular. Nothing major, you know? Just… not as regular as it used to be. Is that important? I don't really like talking about this.
DOCTOR: It's relevant, Ms. Licano. Everything is relevant. And before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh. Right, sorry. Um… I don’t think so. Not that I know of, anyway. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Except… I think I was a little itchy once after taking an antibiotic, years ago. But it wasn't a big deal.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just… Medicare helps with some things. Oh! And I take a vitamin D supplement sometimes, in the winter. My daughter told me to. Something about the sun. And… oh, I take something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. But I don't really remember the name.
DOCTOR: Ms. Licano, it is imperative that you know what medications you are taking. This is... concerning. Do you have any records of your medications or perhaps know the name of the pharmacy you use?
PATIENT: Oh, dear, don’t get upset! It’s just… things are blurry, you know? I used to handle all of it, but… since my husband… My daughter usually helps with the refills. I think it’s… Miller’s Pharmacy? Down on Main Street. Yes, that’s right! Miller’s. I’m sorry. It’s just… hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. We will verify your medications with Miller’s Pharmacy. Now, let's proceed with a brief physical examination. Please step onto the scale for me.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I hope it’s not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: 108 pounds. That is… quite low. And your height is listed as 187 centimeters. Correct?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. I've always been tall, I suppose. Is that bad? I don't really keep track of those numbers.
DOCTOR: BMI is 30.9… indicative of obesity, despite your low weight. Please lie down on the examination table. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs.
PATIENT: Obesity? But… I’m so thin! Oh. Alright. I hope everything is alright. This is all a bit much.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Please relax. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh, um… A little. Just… a dull ache. Like a pressure, really. It's not sharp, but it’s… always there. It's worse when I'm… constipated, I think. My daughter keeps telling me to drink more water.
DOCTOR: Mild tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen, no guarding or rebound. And your knees?
PATIENT: Oh, they’re just achy. Right there, that’s a bit sore. And this side too. Not terrible, just… uncomfortable. It's worse in the mornings, and when it’s cold. Like they’re… creaking.
DOCTOR: Moderate crepitus bilaterally in the knees, mild swelling. Range of motion is limited. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh… I hate those things. They always make my leg jump. Are you sure you have to?
DOCTOR: Reflexes are diminished bilaterally. Now, if you’ll just follow my finger with your eyes...
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Is everything alright? This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Slightly sluggish pursuit. Now, I’m going to need to draw some blood for routine labs. Complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, vitamin D level, and inflammatory markers. If you’ll follow me…
PATIENT: Oh, blood work? I… I don’t like needles. Really don’t. Is it absolutely necessary? Maybe my daughter can talk to you about it? She’s much better with this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Ms. Licano, blood work is essential to determine the cause of your fatigue and assess your overall health. It is not optional. I understand you are apprehensive, but we need to proceed. It will be quick. And I assure you, our phlebotomist is very skilled. Let's go.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. But… can my daughter come with me? Just to… hold my hand? I really don’t like this. Please?
DOCTOR: Very well. Your daughter may accompany you. But I expect full cooperation during the blood draw. If you'll follow me…and please, try to remain calm. This will be much easier for everyone.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you. That helps a lot. I just… I don’t do well with this sort of thing.
