DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. But I’ve noticed something… unusual. A discharge, you see. From… down there. It’s not right, and frankly, I haven’t the slightest idea what to do about it. I thought it best to come in and have a professional take a look.
DOCTOR: A discharge… right. And how long have you been noticing this discharge, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it’s been… perhaps a week? Maybe a little longer. It's hard to say exactly, you understand. One doesn’t focus on these things, normally. It just… appeared. And it’s not a pleasant color, if you must know. It’s not… normal.
DOCTOR: Not normal… can you describe the color to me, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a bright, healthy pink, certainly. It’s… more of a yellowish-gray. And it’s… thick. Not watery, thankfully, but still… concerning. It also has a… a smell. Not a good smell, I assure you. Honestly, Doctor, it’s quite dreadful. I’ve always been very… clean, you see. This is not typical for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this discharge?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see. No fever, thankfully. And no pain, exactly… but a bit of… irritation. A slight burning sensation when I… use the facilities, you understand. And… oh, dear. I’ve also felt a bit tired lately. But that could be anything, really. I am getting on in years, you know. But I suppose it’s worth mentioning, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is. And have you noticed any itching, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: Itching… yes, actually. Now that you mention it. Not constant, but it comes and goes. Mostly around… well, the opening. It's rather bothersome when it does happen. It’s not excruciating, but it’s… distracting. It makes me feel… unclean, if you understand. And I always keep myself very tidy, as I said. This is all very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently sexually active, Ms. Wartick?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, Doctor, that is… rather personal. But… no. Not for quite some time. It's been… years, to be perfectly honest. I am a single woman, as you can see, and… well, it hasn’t been a priority. But that doesn’t mean… I assure you, I’m not careless. This is a most unwelcome development, regardless.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, have you had any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Changes in diet… no, not really. I eat the same things I always have. Mostly vegetables, a bit of fish… nothing fancy. I try to be healthy, you see. Although, I did have a rather lovely paella last week… but I doubt that would cause this. It was from a very reputable restaurant. Honestly, Doctor, I can’t imagine what’s causing it. I’ve never had anything like this before in my life. It’s quite distressing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any pain in your lower abdomen?
PATIENT: Lower abdomen… no, not pain, exactly. But a bit of… discomfort. A dull ache, sometimes. It’s not sharp, or anything, and it comes and goes. It’s not enough to keep me up at night, but I do notice it. It’s just… a general feeling of being… off. Everything feels a bit… tender, if you understand. And frankly, Doctor, I'm starting to worry this is something serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. I think it's best if we do a quick pelvic exam. It will allow me to get a better look and determine the cause of these symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a pelvic exam? Oh dear. Well, Doctor, I must admit, that sounds… unpleasant. But if it’s necessary… I suppose so. I do want to get to the bottom of this, as you say. But… will it be very… intrusive? I’ve never had one before, you see. And frankly, the thought makes me quite nervous. I do trust your judgment, Doctor, but… it's a bit alarming, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It's not the most comfortable thing in the world, Ms. Wartick, but it's necessary for diagnosis. I will explain everything as I go, and we will take things at your pace. I’ll be as gentle as possible. First, I’ll just take a look externally, then I’ll use a speculum to get a better view of your cervix. It might feel a little pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. We may also take a swab to test for infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A swab… yes. Well, if it’s necessary. I suppose I trust your expertise, Doctor. But… please, be gentle. And explain everything, as you promised. I’m not… accustomed to these procedures, you see. It all feels rather… invasive. And please, do tell me if you see anything… concerning. I’d rather know the truth, however unpleasant it may be. Just… please be quick, if possible. This is all rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. I will do my best to make this as comfortable and quick as possible. Please lie back on the examination table and put your feet in the stirrups when you're ready. I'll explain everything as I go. Let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Proceed when you are ready. But… please, do be gentle. I’m rather… delicate, you see. And… I do hope it’s nothing too serious. This is all very worrying.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wartick. I’m just going to perform a visual exam first. I’ll be using a light to get a better view. I’m seeing some mild redness and swelling of the vulva. Nothing too alarming at this stage. Now, I’m going to insert the speculum. It may feel a bit cold and uncomfortable for a moment. Just breathe deeply, Ms. Wartick. Okay, I’m looking at your cervix now… There is some discharge present, as you described, it's yellowish-gray and has a slightly foul odor. I also see some inflammation. I’m going to take a swab now to send to the lab for testing. This will help us determine the cause of the infection. Just a quick swab, Ms. Wartick. Alright, all done. That might sting a little for a moment. Okay, Ms. Wartick, you can sit up when you’re ready. We'll send that sample to the lab and should have results in a few days.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, that wasn’t pleasant. Thank you, Doctor. I must say, I’m rather relieved it’s over. What do you suspect it is? Is it… serious? And what sort of treatment will I need? I do hope it's not something… contagious. I have a rather active social life, you see, and I wouldn't want to… inconveniece anyone. Please, tell me everything, Doctor. Even if it’s not good news. I’d rather know, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Wartick, based on the visual exam and the nature of the discharge, I suspect it could be bacterial vaginosis, or possibly a sexually transmitted infection like trichomoniasis. It’s too early to say definitively without the lab results, but those are the most likely possibilities. Both are treatable with antibiotics. Bacterial vaginosis is not typically considered an STI, but trichomoniasis is. Either way, it's important to abstain from sexual activity until we get the results back and you’ve completed treatment. I will also recommend that your partner be tested and treated if you have been sexually active recently. As for contagiousness, bacterial vaginosis isn’t highly contagious, but trichomoniasis is easily spread through sexual contact. We will need to know the results to determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a course of metronidazole, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, just to be safe. If it turns out not to be bacterial vaginosis, it will still likely be effective against trichomoniasis. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Metronidazole… hmm. I don’t believe so. No allergies, to my knowledge. But… an STI? Oh dear. That’s… rather embarrassing. And I suppose I have been seeing a gentleman… rather casually, you understand. This is all very distressing. I pride myself on my… discretion. And to think, I could have… passed something on to him! Oh, the shame! What does he need to do? And will it… affect me long-term? I’m not getting any younger, you know, and I certainly don’t need any complications. And this gentleman… he’s a very important person in the community. This could be… disastrous. Tell me everything, Doctor. Everything! What are the chances I’ve already… spread it?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I understand your concern. It's natural to feel anxious and embarrassed in this situation. First, let’s focus on getting the results back. The lab should have them in 3-5 business days. Once we have those, we can determine the appropriate course of action for both you and your gentleman friend. If it is an STI, he will need to be tested and treated as well, regardless of whether he’s showing symptoms. It’s important for him to get tested to prevent further spread, and to ensure he doesn't have any complications. As for the chances of having spread it, it’s difficult to say without knowing the specific infection. Some STIs are easily transmitted, while others are less so. If it is trichomoniasis, it has a relatively high transmission rate. However, many STIs are treatable with antibiotics, and often cause no long-term damage if caught early. I will write you a prescription for metronidazole, enough for a 7-day course. It’s important to take the full course, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished. I will also provide you with information about safe sex practices, and a list of local resources for STI testing and treatment. We’ll discuss everything in more detail once we have the lab results. And please, try not to worry too much. Many people experience STIs, and they are often easily treatable. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Seven days… Yes. And safe sex practices… Oh dear. It’s been quite some time since I’ve had to… consider such things. A list of resources… Very well. I suppose I should ask him to get tested immediately. But how do I… approach the subject? It’s rather delicate, you understand. And I certainly don’t want to cause a… scene. And will this show up on any… routine tests? He has a very important physical coming up next month. I certainly don’t want to jeopardise his position. And… is there anything I can do to… alleviate the symptoms in the meantime? It’s rather uncomfortable, you know. And I have a very important luncheon next week. Oh, goodness. This is all so dreadful.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wartick, I understand your concerns. It's a lot to process. Let's address your questions one by one. Approaching the subject can be difficult, but honesty is the best policy. You could simply explain that you've been experiencing some discomfort and have gone to the doctor, and that it's important for both of you to get tested to rule anything out. Emphasize that it's a precautionary measure and nothing to be ashamed of. As for routine tests, some STIs will show up on a standard blood panel, while others require specific testing. He should specifically request an STI screening during his physical, and inform his doctor of your concerns. In the meantime, to alleviate your symptoms, I recommend avoiding douching, wearing loose-fitting cotton underwear, and refraining from sexual activity. You can also use a warm sitz bath for 15-20 minutes a day. Over-the-counter probiotic suppositories may also provide some relief. I will provide you with a handout outlining these recommendations, as well as a list of local testing centers and resources. Is there anything else I can help you with at this time?
PATIENT: Cotton underwear… a sitz bath… very well. I suppose I can manage that. But this whole situation is… humiliating, Doctor. Absolutely humiliating. And to think, I always prided myself on my… discretion. I’ve lived a very respectable life, you know. And now this! Oh, goodness. I suppose I should call him. But I dread the conversation. Absolutely dread it. And what if he… reacts badly? What if he blames me? Oh, goodness. I feel quite faint. And I have that luncheon next week! Perhaps I should cancel it. Yes, perhaps I should cancel everything. This is all so dreadful. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I’ll… see what happens. But I dread it. Absolutely dread it. .
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wartick. It’s perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed and anxious in this situation. Take your time, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. I'm here to support you. Here's my card. Please call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, you're not alone. .
