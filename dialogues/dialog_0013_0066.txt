DOCTOR: Hi Jamill, good to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Morenomartinez. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing a rather…unusual sensation in my back, and I thought it best to have it checked out. It’s a sort of “popping” or “clicking” sound and feeling, mostly when I move a certain way.
DOCTOR: Okay, a popping or clicking sensation in your back. That's good you’re getting it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s…difficult to describe precisely. It seems to be located mainly in my lower back, right around where my spine curves in. It doesn't happen every time I move, but it’s fairly common when I bend over, or twist to reach for something. It doesn't usually hurt, which is what’s made me delay coming in – it’s more…noticeable than painful. Though, occasionally, after it pops a few times in a row, I feel a little stiffness.
DOCTOR: Alright, lower back, around the spinal curve. More noticeable than painful, and sometimes followed by stiffness. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. It began, I believe, approximately three months ago. At first, it was very infrequent – maybe once a week, or less. But it has gradually increased in frequency over the past month or so. It hasn't worsened dramatically, but it is happening more often now, and that's what prompted me to schedule an appointment. I don't recall any specific injury that triggered it, if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months ago, gradual increase in frequency, no specific injury. Has anything specific made it better or worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Honestly, nothing I’ve done seems to consistently affect it. Resting doesn't necessarily make it better, and being active doesn’t seem to make it worse. I work with electrical systems, primarily on transportation equipment—trains, mostly—so I’m on my feet and bending a lot throughout the day, but that hasn’t appeared to aggravate it noticeably. Stretching occasionally feels good, but I don’t think it actually does anything to resolve the popping. I suppose I haven’t actively tried to avoid anything, either, as it wasn’t truly painful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no clear aggravating or alleviating factors despite your work being physically demanding. Do you have any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the occasional stiffness in the lower back after the popping sensation. No pain in my legs, no numbness, no tingling…nothing else. It really is isolated to that one area. I do sometimes feel a little fatigued after long days at work, but I attribute that to the physical demands of the job, not this back issue.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a complete picture, have you had any previous back problems, surgeries, or injuries?
PATIENT: Let me see…I had a rather nasty muscle strain in my shoulder a few years ago, while lifting some heavier equipment, but that was fully resolved with physical therapy. Apart from that, no. No previous back problems, no surgeries, and no other injuries to my back that I recall. I’ve always been fairly careful about lifting properly, and I generally maintain a good level of physical fitness. My wife always makes sure of that, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother suffered from arthritis in her knees in her later years, but I don’t believe anyone else in my immediate family had any significant back problems. My father was quite active well into his eighties, and my siblings have also been relatively injury-free, as far as I know. It wasn't really a topic of much discussion, to be honest. We didn't really have a family history of skeletal issues.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not. I pride myself on maintaining good health. I take a daily multivitamin, but that’s the extent of it. I generally avoid medication unless absolutely necessary. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible, although I haven't found anything that seems to address this back sensation.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I'm aware of. No reactions to any medications in the past, and no environmental allergies. I've always been quite fortunate in that regard. I can tolerate most things without issue. My wife always double-checks when we travel, just in case, but I’ve never had an allergic reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, no medications. Alright Jamill, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be excellent. I appreciate you taking the time to investigate this thoroughly. Please, proceed at your convenience. I'm ready whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could lie down on your stomach for me, please?
PATIENT: Certainly. Just let me know if you need me to adjust my position in any way.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bending forward…any pain with that?
PATIENT: A little stiffness, but no pain, precisely. It feels…tight. There’s a slight clicking sensation when I bend forward, right around the same area in my lower back that I described earlier. It doesn’t hurt, but I can certainly feel it. It’s a bit like…a pop, but softer.
DOCTOR: Okay. And bending backwards?
PATIENT: Similar sensation, Doctor. Again, some stiffness, and the clicking sound is present. It's not as pronounced as when I bend forward, but it's definitely there. I wouldn’t describe it as painful, but it is noticeable. I do feel a slight stretch in my lower back, but it’s not unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, can you side bend—reach towards your knees, one side at a time?
PATIENT: Certainly. A little stiffness on that side, but nothing significant. The clicking sound is less noticeable when I side bend. The same on this side. It feels slightly tighter on my right side, but the sensation is still mild. No sharp pain or discomfort. Just the usual tightness and the occasional clicking.
DOCTOR: Okay, everything seems to be neurologically intact. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength is good in both legs.
PATIENT: That's reassuring to hear, Doctor. I was a little concerned it might be something more serious, so that’s good news.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you likely have what we call mechanical low back pain. The clicking sensation is probably due to some minor facet joint dysfunction—small joints in your spine that can sometimes get a little irritated. The muscle tension is likely a protective response to that irritation. It’s very common, and often resolves with conservative treatment. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that does make sense. Facet joint dysfunction…so, not a serious structural issue? More of a…mechanical problem, as you said? That is certainly a relief to hear. And conservative treatment…what does that entail, specifically?
DOCTOR: Exactly. Not a serious structural issue, thankfully. More of a mechanical problem, and very treatable. Conservative treatment usually involves a combination of things: over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen if needed, stretching and strengthening exercises, and maintaining good posture. We can also consider a short course of physical therapy to help guide you through the exercises and address any muscle imbalances. I can write you a prescription for physical therapy if you’d like. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds excellent, Doctor. A combination of exercises and physical therapy seems like a reasonable approach. Yes, please, a prescription for physical therapy would be greatly appreciated. And would you recommend any specific stretches or exercises I can begin doing at home in the meantime, before my first appointment? Something gentle, just to start?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Here's the prescription for physical therapy. They’ll assess you and create a tailored program. In the meantime, for gentle stretches, you can try pelvic tilts. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Gently flatten your lower back against the floor by tightening your abdominal muscles, then release. Repeat that 10-15 times. Also, a gentle knee-to-chest stretch can be helpful. Lie on your back, bring one knee towards your chest, and hold it there for 20-30 seconds. Repeat on both sides. Avoid any movements that cause sharp pain. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes perfect sense. Pelvic tilts and knee-to-chest stretches. I can definitely manage those. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, and for providing me with some exercises to start with. I feel much more reassured now, knowing what’s likely causing the issue and how to address it. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jamill. I’m glad I could help. I'll also send your primary care physician a summary of our consultation. Just monitor your symptoms, and if they worsen or you develop any new symptoms, like numbness or weakness in your legs, don't hesitate to contact me or go to the emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very comprehensive, and I truly appreciate your time and expertise. I’ll schedule an appointment with physical therapy as soon as possible. Thank you again for your help.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jamill. Have a good day, and please let me know if you have any questions down the line.
