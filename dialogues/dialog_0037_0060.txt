DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. AX. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Look, it’s… family history, mostly. My mother’s side, specifically. Lots of… problems. I just want to make sure I’m not headed that way, you know? I’d rather know now than… later. It’s probably nothing, honestly, but my ex-wife insisted I get checked out. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very proactive of you to come in and discuss your family history, and it’s good you’re taking your ex-wife’s concerns into consideration. Knowing your family’s medical background is a really important step in preventative care. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about what kind of “problems” you’re referring to on your mother’s side?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. Well, my grandmother… she had this… I don’t even know what it was called. Something with her brain, I think? She forgot things. A lot of things. Eventually, she didn’t even recognize us. It was… unpleasant. And then my aunt, my mother’s sister, she got… well, she got really sick, couldn’t move much. They said it was… nerves, I think. Something deteriorating. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. My mother keeps talking about it, always saying I should be careful. Honestly, it's a little dramatic. She thinks everyone's going to end up the same.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’ve experienced some difficult family health issues, and it’s understandable that you’re concerned about your own risk. It's good you're being mindful of this. Just to clarify, when you say your grandmother forgot things, was this a gradual decline, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual, definitely gradual. It wasn’t like she just woke up one day and didn’t know who anyone was. It was… slow. Over years, really. She’d misplace things, forget appointments, then started forgetting names. Eventually, she… well, she just didn’t seem to be herself anymore. My mother was the one who really noticed it first, always saying she was acting strange. Honestly, I was busy with… things. Work, mostly. I didn’t pay much attention until it was pretty bad. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A gradual decline is important information. And it’s common to not fully recognize changes until they’re more noticeable. Regarding your aunt, you mentioned she got sick and had trouble moving. Do you recall anything more specific about her illness?
PATIENT: Ugh, specifics? No, not really. It was years ago. I think it started with weakness, in her legs, maybe? Then it just… spread. She ended up in a wheelchair. My mother said it was something with her… nerves, like I said. Something was breaking down. She kept saying it was genetic, that's why I'm here. It wasn't a quick thing, though. It took years for it to get really bad. She… she didn't really talk about it much, and frankly, I didn't push it. It was… depressing. I honestly don't want to dwell on it too much, if you don't mind. It's all very unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s perfectly alright if you’d rather not dwell on difficult memories. We can focus on what’s important for your health now. So, to summarize, you’re concerned about a potential family history of neurodegenerative diseases, specifically a gradual memory loss similar to what your grandmother experienced and a progressive weakness affecting your aunt. Before we proceed, could you tell me about your own medical history?
PATIENT: Right. That sounds about right, yeah. Neuro… whatever that means. Look, I'm healthy. Always have been. I haven't been sick a day in my life, practically. I get regular check-ups, the usual. Blood pressure's good, cholesterol's fine. I exercise… sometimes. I eat reasonably well, although I do enjoy a good takeaway now and then. I've never been hospitalized for anything serious. Honestly, I’m probably wasting your time. My ex-wife just… overreacts to everything. She read something on the internet and decided I was a walking time bomb. It’s ridiculous. Are you even listening to me?
DOCTOR: I am listening, Mr. Theriot. And it's not a waste of my time at all. It’s good to hear that you’ve been generally healthy and that you have regular check-ups. Knowing your baseline health is very helpful. You mentioned you have regular check-ups. Do you happen to know when your last physical was and what was checked during that exam?
PATIENT: Ugh, let me think. Last physical… probably about six months ago. Dr. Patel, over on Elm Street. He… did the usual. Blood work, checked my heart, listened to my lungs, took my blood pressure. Asked about family history, actually. I told him about my mother's side, briefly. He didn’t seem overly concerned, just made a few notes. He did ask about my… mental state, I guess. Asked if I was stressed or depressed. I told him I was fine. He probably thought I was a bit of a cynic. He didn't do anything specific, though. No brain scans or anything fancy. Just the standard stuff. Honestly, I don't remember much else. I try not to dwell on doctor's visits, if you understand. They're… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Doctor's visits can be unsettling. And it sounds like Dr. Patel did a fairly standard check-up six months ago. Now, just to get a complete picture, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don't believe in all that… stuff. I eat reasonably well, get enough sleep… mostly. I don't need pills or powders to tell me how to live my life. My ex-wife tried to get me to take vitamins once. Said it would improve my mood. It was awful. They tasted like dirt. I stopped taking them after a week. Honestly, I think a healthy lifestyle is all you need. And a little bit of cynicism doesn't hurt. It keeps you grounded. Do you take vitamins? I bet doctors like to push those things, don't they?
DOCTOR: I can understand your skepticism. I don’t personally push vitamins unless there’s a specific deficiency. Now, have you ever had any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Never. I've eaten everything. Spicy food, exotic fruits, you name it. I'm not a picky eater. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Honestly, I think allergies are… overrated. People just use them as an excuse to be difficult. My ex-wife is allergic to cats. It's ridiculous. She avoids them like the plague. It's… dramatic. No, I don't have any allergies. Not a single one. I’m perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Can we please move on? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Theriot. No known allergies. Before we move on to a physical exam, I just have a few quick questions about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Ugh, here we go. Look, I'm an engineer. I don't do that sort of thing. Smoking? Absolutely not. It's bad for you. Alcohol? Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Nothing excessive. Recreational drugs? Are you serious? I have a degree, a job, responsibilities. I don't need… that. Honestly, I find the question a little insulting. I'm not a… degenerate. Is this standard procedure? Do you ask all your patients this? It feels… judgmental. And I’m quite busy, if I may say so.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions felt judgmental, Mr. Theriot. It’s standard procedure to ask about these things as part of a comprehensive health assessment, not as a judgment of your character. It simply helps me understand potential risk factors. So, to clarify, you occasionally drink a glass of wine with dinner, but do not smoke or use recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s correct. Occasionally. A glass of red wine. It’s good for the heart, isn’t it? I read something about that once. Antioxidants or something. Look, I’m a responsible adult. I don’t need a lecture on the dangers of… anything. Can we please move on to the physical exam? I’m starting to feel… uncomfortable. And frankly, I have a meeting in a few hours. I need to get back to work. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Theriot. We can proceed with the physical exam. I apologize again for any discomfort. Alright, let’s start with your vital signs. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. The quicker this is done, the better. Honestly, I don't see the point of all this. I feel perfectly fine. But… alright. Do what you need to do. Just… try to be quick, okay? And don't poke me too much. I hate needles. Are you going to take blood? Please tell me you're not going to take blood. I really dislike needles.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I understand your aversion to needles, and I won’t take any blood today unless it becomes medically necessary. We’ll start with the basics. Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is within the normal range. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, also normal. Respiration rate is 16, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm just going to do a few simple tests to check your reflexes and coordination. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: There. Happy? I’m perfectly coordinated, thank you very much. I design bridges for a living. It requires a certain amount of… precision. Honestly, this is all a bit… patronizing. Are you sure you need to do all this? It feels like you’re… testing me. I assure you, my reflexes are perfectly fine. Just get it over with. I have important work to do. This is a complete waste of my valuable time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. I understand your frustration. I’m simply completing a standard neurological assessment. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, could you please close your eyes and tell me when I touch your fingers?
PATIENT: There. There. There. Happy now? Perfectly fine, as I said. It’s all perfectly normal. Can we please move on? This is ridiculous. I’m a perfectly healthy individual. I don't understand why I'm wasting my time here. Honestly, my ex-wife is going to hear about this. She’s going to feel very silly when she finds out everything is perfectly fine. This is a complete and utter waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. Your sensation is intact. Now, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. Perfectly fine. Steady gait, no balance issues, no coordination problems. Honestly, this is all very… unnecessary. I'm a perfectly capable individual. I design bridges, remember? It requires a certain amount of physical competence. Can we please be done now? I have a meeting in a few hours. This is becoming increasingly… irritating. Honestly, I'm starting to regret coming here. This is a complete waste of my valuable time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. Your gait appears steady, and I didn’t observe any balance issues. Based on this brief physical exam and your reported history, everything appears to be within normal limits. However, given your family history of potential neurodegenerative conditions, I would recommend some baseline cognitive testing to establish a point of reference. It’s a simple test, a series of questions and tasks designed to assess your memory and thinking skills. It would help us monitor any changes over time, if any were to occur. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Cognitive… testing? You mean… a brain test? Honestly, that sounds ridiculous. I already told you, I’m perfectly fine. My brain is perfectly functional. I design bridges for a living! But… my ex-wife would probably insist. She’s going to say I should “do everything possible.” Ugh. Fine. Do your… brain test. But if it shows anything, I'm blaming her. This is entirely her fault. And it better not take long. I have a meeting, remember? I'm a busy man. But… fine. Do the test. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. I understand your reluctance, and I assure you it’s a quick and simple test. It shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes. It’s simply a precautionary measure, given your family history. Okay, let's start with a simple task. I'm going to show you four words, and I want you to try and remember them. Then I’ll ask you to recall them in a few minutes. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Fine. Show me the words. Get it over with. This is… humiliating. I’m an engineer, not a… test subject. But… alright. Show me the words. Quickly, please. I have a meeting to get to. This is a complete and utter waste of time, but… fine. Let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Theriot, try to memorize these four words: Apple, Table, Penny, Cloud. I'll give you about 30 seconds. Let me know when you're ready for the next part.
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Penny… Cloud. Apple, Table, Penny, Cloud. Okay. I’ve got it. Apple, Table, Penny, Cloud. Yes. Ready. Let’s just get this over with. This is… ridiculous. Are you sure this is necessary? It’s a complete waste of my valuable time. But… fine. Ask me the words. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. Now, can you tell me the four words I just showed you?
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Penny… and… Cloud. Yes. Apple, Table, Penny, Cloud. Correct. See? Perfectly fine. I told you. My brain is perfectly functional. Are we done now? This is… humiliating. I have a meeting, remember? I’m a busy man. Please, let’s just get this over with. This is a complete and utter waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Theriot. You recalled all four words correctly. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions about your current memory and thinking skills. Just answer honestly. First, have you noticed any changes in your memory recently?
PATIENT: Changes? No. Not really. I mean… everyone forgets things sometimes, right? I forget where I put my keys occasionally. I forget names. But nothing… significant. Nothing that would concern me. I mean… I’m busy. I have a lot on my mind. But no, nothing… major. I’m perfectly fine. Honestly, this is a waste of time. Are you sure you need to ask me all these questions? It’s… insulting. I’m a perfectly capable engineer. I design bridges for a living. I don't have memory problems. But… no, no significant changes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. And have you noticed any difficulties with problem-solving or making decisions recently?
PATIENT: Problem-solving? Making decisions? Look, I design bridges. That is problem-solving. That is making decisions. It’s my job! I deal with complex calculations, structural integrity, budgetary constraints… it’s all problem-solving. No, I haven't noticed any difficulties. Honestly, this is ridiculous. You're asking me if I can still… think? Of course, I can still think! I'm a perfectly capable engineer. This is insulting. I haven’t noticed any difficulties. This is a complete and utter waste of my time. I have a meeting. Can we please just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. And have you noticed any changes in your personality or behavior recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my personality? Look, I've always been… cynical. A little bit grumpy. I haven't suddenly become… cheerful. I haven't started singing show tunes. No. My personality hasn't changed. I'm still the same… me. Honestly, this is absurd. You're asking me if I've suddenly become a different person? Of course, I haven't! This is a complete waste of my time. I have a meeting. Can we please just get this over with? I’m starting to lose my patience. This is… humiliating. Insulting. A complete and utter waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. Thank you for answering those questions. Based on the cognitive assessment and the physical exam, everything appears to be within normal limits. However, given your family history, I would recommend establishing a baseline with a follow-up appointment in six months to monitor for any subtle changes. I also recommend maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet. I will send you home with some resources on brain health. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Six months? Another appointment? Ugh. Fine. Whatever. But I’m not promising I’ll come back. I have a busy life. But… fine. Six months. Resources on brain health? Great. Just what I needed. More things to read. Look… is it possible I’m just… worrying too much? My ex-wife has been… insistent. She’s the one who pushed me to come here. Is it possible everything is perfectly fine and I’m just wasting my time and money? Honestly, that’s what I suspect. Is there anything I should be doing, specifically? Besides… coming back in six months? Any red flags I should be looking for? Anything that would actually… worry me? Other than my ex-wife’s anxiety?
DOCTOR: It's entirely possible you're worrying unnecessarily, Mr. Theriot. Your concern is understandable given your family history, but at this point, there's no indication of any significant issues. Regarding red flags, pay attention to any new difficulties with memory that disrupt your daily life – forgetting important appointments or conversations repeatedly. Also, watch for any sudden changes in personality or behavior, difficulties with problem-solving that weren’t present before, or any challenges with language or coordination. If you notice any of those changes, even subtle ones, please don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment. But for now, try to relax and focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I will send you home with those resources and a follow-up appointment reminder for six months. Do you have any other concerns I can address today?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s it. Just… try not to scare me unnecessarily in six months, okay? I have enough stress in my life. And please, don’t suggest I take any vitamins. I told you, I don’t believe in that sort of thing. Okay. Fine. Six months. I’ll… see you then. Or not. Whatever. Thank you… I guess. I have a meeting to get to. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. I understand. I will do my best to provide clear and unbiased information at your follow-up appointment. And I won’t push any vitamins. Have a good day, and good luck with your meeting. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before then.
