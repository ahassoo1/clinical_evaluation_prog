DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Krahn. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Um… right. Performance physical, that’s what it was for. They sent me over. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur these days. Something about needing to be cleared for… acting work? Yes, that sounds right. It's for a show, I think. A small one.
DOCTOR: Okay, a performance physical for some acting work. That’s perfectly alright. It is common to need a check-up before starting something like that, just to make sure everything is in good working order. Do you have any specific concerns you want to discuss today, or should we just go through a standard examination?
PATIENT: Concerns? Hmm… not that I recall. I feel… alright, I suppose. Old, mostly. But alright. Standard is fine, I think. Less for me to remember that way. I don't really… keep track of things like that anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll do a quick review of your medical history first, then a physical exam. It shouldn't take too long. I see here you’re 69 years old. Have you seen a doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Regularly… no. Not really. It's been… a while. Years, definitely. My wife used to handle all that. After… well, things changed. I mostly just… kept going. Didn’t feel like bothering anyone. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. Life happens, and things get missed. It’s very common. It’s good that you’re coming in now to get things checked out. To help me get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me about any major illnesses or surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Major… illnesses? Gosh. That’s… difficult. I had the flu a few times, I think. And a bad cold last winter. Surgeries… My appendix, a long time ago. That's all I can think of right now. Maybe something with my knee, but it was so long ago, it’s all a bit fuzzy. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn't what it used to be. Is it okay if I just… try my best?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. That’s perfectly fine. Just tell me what you remember, and we’ll go from there. No pressure at all. Alright, appendix removal is good to know. And you think something with your knee. We can try to dig a little deeper if needed, but for now, let’s just focus on what you recall. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… Not that I'm aware of. I eat everything. My wife used to worry about it, but I never had a reaction. Pollen… maybe a little sniffly in the spring, but everyone is, aren’t they? I don’t take any medication regularly, not anymore. Stopped years ago. Just a little something for aches and pains now and then, when I really need it. Nothing serious, I promise.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies or regular medications. That’s helpful. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… complicated. My parents are both gone now. My father… he had something with his heart, I think. But I don't know what exactly. My mother… she was healthy as a horse until the very end. I have a brother, somewhere. Haven't seen him in years. We… drifted apart. He lives on the coast, I think. I don't really know much about their health, honestly. We weren't close. Is this useful? I feel like I’m not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Mr. Krahn. It's alright if you don’t have a lot of details. Family history can be hard to track down. Knowing your parents had some health issues is good enough for now. Okay, let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, no, no. Never smoked. Tried it once, didn't like it. Alcohol… I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. But that was a long time ago. Stopped years ago, too. And definitely no… recreational drugs. Never been interested in any of that. Just a quiet life, that’s all I’ve ever wanted. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. No smoking, alcohol, or drug use. Okay, so we’ve covered quite a bit of your history. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. We’ll just check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your general health. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Sounds… fine. I don’t love doctors, if I’m being honest. But if it's necessary for the show, I suppose I can endure it. Just… please be quick? And gentle? I’m not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible, Mr. Krahn. We'll take it slow. If you could just sit up on the table for me, we'll start with your blood pressure. Okay, blood pressure is 142 over 88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s faint, but we’ll want to investigate that further. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, let's just take a look at your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes… I always fail those tests. Always have. I’m just… not very reactive, I guess. Don't worry if they're slow. It's just how I am. Ow. See? Slow. Very slow. Just like always. Is this going to be a problem for the show?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a bit diminished, yes, but not alarmingly so. It could be normal for someone your age. We'll note that as well. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Krahn. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're generally in stable condition, but there are a few things I'd like to investigate further. The slight heart murmur and diminished reflexes are worth looking into. Also, your blood pressure is a little high, so we should monitor that. Would you be willing to get some blood work done and possibly an EKG to check your heart?
PATIENT: Blood work… and an EKG? Oh dear. This is getting complicated. Is it… necessary? For the show, I mean. I really just wanted to get cleared and be done with it. I don’t do well with hospitals and tests and… everything. Couldn't we just… skip those parts? I feel fine, mostly. Perhaps my blood pressure is just from the stress of the exam?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Krahn. And I truly appreciate your honesty. It’s good that you’re telling me how you feel. While you feel mostly fine, these tests are important to get a complete picture of your health, especially before starting a physically demanding activity like acting. The blood work will give us information about your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. The EKG is a quick and painless test that will check the electrical activity of your heart and help us determine the cause of the murmur. Skipping these tests could potentially put your health at risk. I wouldn’t recommend it. However, we can take things slowly. If you’re worried about going to the hospital, we can schedule the blood work at the clinic and find a mobile EKG service that can come to you. Would that make you feel more comfortable?
PATIENT: A mobile EKG service… That… that sounds better. Much better. Having someone come here, instead of me going to a hospital… yes. That's a relief. And the blood work at the clinic too? Alright. Yes, let's do that. Blood work at the clinic and the mobile EKG. But… could we hurry? I really don’t want to drag this out any longer than necessary. I have a rehearsal next week, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll get everything scheduled as quickly as possible. I'll have my assistant set up the blood work for you at the clinic tomorrow morning, and we’ll contact a mobile EKG service to schedule a visit within the next few days. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a low-sodium diet and regular, gentle exercise. Nothing strenuous, just a light walk each day. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Low-sodium diet… and walking. I suppose that's manageable. I used to enjoy walking. But… walking won’t fix a heart murmur, will it? No, I don’t think so. Just… what does a heart murmur mean? Is it serious? Is it going to stop me from acting? That’s what I’m really worried about.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Mr. Krahn, and it’s good you’re asking it. A heart murmur is simply an unusual sound heard when listening to your heart. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s anything seriously wrong. Many murmurs are harmless, especially those that develop with age. However, it’s important to investigate it to rule out any underlying causes. The EKG will help us determine if the murmur is significant. As for stopping you from acting, it’s too early to say. It depends on the cause of the murmur and the results of the tests. If it’s a minor issue, it shouldn't be a problem. If it’s something more serious, we may need to adjust your activity level or consider other options. But we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Right now, let's just focus on getting the tests done and finding out what's going on. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay. Tests… and then we see. Alright. Fine. Get the tests done. I suppose that's all I can do. Just… please hurry. And if it turns out I can't act… well, I don't even want to think about that right now. Thank you, Doctor. For… not laughing at me. And for being patient. I’m not very good with all of this. I think that's enough for today. Can I go now? I have a feeling I need a nap.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely not laughing material, Mr. Krahn. And you’re doing perfectly fine. It’s alright to be anxious or confused – that’s perfectly normal. My assistant will come and give you the paperwork for the blood work and contact information for the mobile EKG service. You take care and get some rest. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And don’t worry about the results just yet. Let’s just get the tests done first. You can go now. And yes, a nap sounds like a very good idea.
PATIENT: .
