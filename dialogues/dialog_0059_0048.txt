DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Chagaris. It's nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Lason is the name. It’s… well, it’s about these little spells, I suppose. Moments where I just… don’t quite know where I am, or what I’m doing. It’s not all the time, thankfully. My wife, she worries, naturally. She says I ask the same questions twice in a row sometimes. Frankly, I’ve always had a good memory, so it’s a bit unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. Those kinds of moments can certainly be unsettling, and it's good that your wife is keeping an eye on things. It's also wise to investigate when you notice a change in your memory. When did you first start noticing these spells, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s been… oh, maybe six months now? Around the time the weather started getting warmer last year, I’d say. Though, it was just a little thing at first. A forgotten name here, a misplaced tool there. Nothing serious. It’s gotten… more frequent, I suppose, in the last couple of months. I still know how to set tile, don’t you worry. Best in the county, they say. But sometimes... the details just slip my mind.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Mr. Lason. So, it's been a gradual onset over the past six months, with an increase in frequency recently. And you mentioned it doesn't interfere with your ability to perform skilled tasks like tiling?
PATIENT: Exactly. My hands still work just fine. I laid a whole bathroom floor last week, beautiful work if I do say so myself. No, it’s not like… I can’t do things. It’s more… like a blank space, for a moment. I’ll be talking, and suddenly I can’t recall what I was saying. Or I’ll walk into a room and forget why I went there. Small things, mostly. But annoying. And it worries my wife. She keeps saying I shouldn’t be driving. Honestly, I’m a perfectly good driver.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like these are primarily memory lapses, affecting recall rather than the ability to perform tasks. It’s very good you’re aware of this and that your wife is supportive. And it's understandable that she’s concerned about driving. Let's explore this a bit further. Besides the memory lapses, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… let me think. I get tired easier, I suppose. Always been a hard worker, but now… a full day on the job really wipes me out. And I've been… a bit more irritable, maybe? Snapping at my wife over small things. I don't mean to, but it just… happens. She says I'm more forgetful with things like appointments, but honestly, I've always been terrible with remembering dates. She manages all that anyway. I don’t really pay attention to those sorts of details.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased fatigue and some irritability, in addition to the memory lapses. And the forgetfulness with appointments seems to be ongoing. These are all things we should consider. Now, thinking about your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. Doctor told me years ago, but I mostly ignore it. Take a little pill now and then when I remember, but it doesn’t really bother me. No diabetes, and my heart’s always been strong. Worked hard all my life, you know. Physical labor. Built this country, practically. As for other illnesses... nothing major. Had the flu a few times, a bad cold here and there. Nothing that required a hospital stay, if that's what you’re asking. I'm a strong man, Doctor. Always have been.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Mr. Lason. It's good to know you haven't had any significant medical issues in the past. And while being a strong man is admirable, even strong people can benefit from managing their health. We should definitely discuss your blood pressure further. Now, are you currently taking any medications regularly, besides the pill for your blood pressure when you remember?
PATIENT: Just that one, really. Sometimes I take something for my knees, when they act up. Over-the-counter stuff, you know. Ibuprofen, that sort of thing. Nothing else. And a multivitamin, I suppose, but my wife buys that. She’s always trying to get me to take more pills. Says I need this and that. I just don’t believe in loading up on medication unless I absolutely have to. Makes you feel sluggish, in my opinion. Less… sharp.
DOCTOR: Okay, so just occasional ibuprofen for your knees, and a multivitamin. And you mentioned you don't like taking a lot of medications. I understand that completely. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. Never had any problems with that. I eat everything. My wife always worries about me trying new foods, but I’ve got a strong stomach. Never been one to be bothered by pollen or dust or anything like that. I work outdoors all day, you know. Exposed to everything. Never had a reaction, not once. I think she worries too much sometimes, honestly. A good woman, but… a worrier.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Lason. No known allergies is helpful. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history. Have any of your close family members – your parents, siblings, or children – experienced any memory problems, dementia, or neurological conditions like Parkinson’s disease or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My father… he was a bit forgetful towards the end, I suppose. But he was old. Lived a long life, though. Didn’t really pay much attention to how forgetful he was. My mother, she was sharp as a tack right up until the day she died. No… I don’t think anyone else in the family had any serious problems like that. A few strokes here and there, minor things. Nothing like… losing their mind, if that's what you mean. We weren’t a family that talked much about health, to be honest. More concerned with getting the work done.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. And finally, Mr. Lason, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I work. Hard. Tile setting, like I said. It's physical work. I eat… reasonably well. My wife cooks. Mostly Cambodian food, spicy stuff. I used to drink… a bit more when I was younger, but not so much anymore. A beer with dinner sometimes. I don’t smoke. I don't really have hobbies, not in the way some people do. Just work, really. And spend time with my wife when I'm not working. It’s a simple life. A good life, I think. Though, these spells are starting to worry me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Mr. Lason. That gives me a much clearer picture. Based on what you've told me, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. Your symptoms – the memory lapses, fatigue, and irritability – could be related to several things. Your blood pressure, even if you don’t always take medication for it, is a potential factor. And while it's good that you don't have a significant family history of neurological conditions, your father's forgetfulness is something we should keep in mind. Before we proceed, I'd like to perform a brief physical and neurological exam. This will help me assess your overall health and rule out any obvious causes for your symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Sounds sensible. If you think it’s worth doing, let’s get on with it. I’ve got work tomorrow, you know. I don't like wasting time, but… if it will put my wife’s mind at ease, I’m happy to cooperate. Just… don’t keep me here all day. I've got tiles to lay.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Lason. I understand your time is valuable. This won’t take long. I’ll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll do a basic neurological exam to assess your reflexes, coordination, and cognitive function. Okay, your blood pressure is 150/90. A little elevated, as expected. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me…
PATIENT: 150/90, huh? See? I told you I didn’t need the pills. Probably just stressed. Lots of deadlines, you know. Okay, deep breath… Just get it over with, Doctor. I've got things to do.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please sit on the edge of the examination table and let your legs dangle?
PATIENT: Reflexes, huh? Never had any problems with those. Strong legs, I tell ya. Been on my feet all my life. Get it over with, Doctor. I've got a bathroom floor waiting for me. This is a waste of a perfectly good working day, but… if it makes my wife happy, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and cognitive function. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… hmm. August… the second? Is it the second? Yes, I think it’s August 2nd. Though… honestly, I always lose track of the dates. My wife handles all that. I’m more of a hands-on kind of guy. You know, building things, not remembering dates. Still, August 2nd, I believe. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct. Now, can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: … Apple. Table. Penny. Is that right? Apple, Table, Penny. Hopefully, I got those… I'm not good at remembering things like that. It’s like they just… disappear. My wife says I have a mind like a sieve. I prefer to think I just have too much on my plate.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s fine. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more questions about your orientation. What city are we in?
PATIENT: Well, we’re in… near the suburbs, aren’t we? I don't pay much attention to the city names. Just know it’s close to where I live. My wife drives me here. I just focus on the tile setting, you know? It’s better that way. Less to worry about. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a city person. Just a working man.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, can you draw a clock, including all the numbers, and set the time to ten past eleven?
PATIENT: Draw a clock? Doctor, I set tile. I don’t draw clocks. I build things, not… pictures. I haven’t drawn anything since… well, probably grade school. This is ridiculous. I suppose… like this? This is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Lason. That’s sufficient for now. Based on the exam, your vital signs are a little elevated, and you’ve had some difficulty with the memory questions and the clock-drawing task. These findings are concerning and warrant further investigation. It's important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. I recommend we order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and rule out any infections. I’d also like to schedule a brain imaging study, such as an MRI, to get a more detailed look at your brain structure. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood work, brain scans… honestly, Doctor, it sounds like a lot of fuss over nothing. But… my wife would want me to. She worries so much. Alright, alright. Do whatever you think is necessary. But I’ve got work tomorrow, you know. I can't be spending all day in a hospital. Just… try to keep it quick. And don't tell my wife too much. She’ll get all worked up. Just do the tests, and tell me what you find, alright? I’m a simple man, Doctor. Just want to get back to laying tile.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Lason. We’ll do everything we can to keep it as quick and convenient as possible. I'll order the blood work for you now, and we can schedule the MRI for next week. The lab is just down the hall, and the MRI facility is a short drive from here. I'll also send a referral to a neurologist for a consultation. They are specialists in brain health and can provide further evaluation and guidance. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid driving and refrain from operating heavy machinery. It’s just a precaution, while we are waiting for the results. I’ll also provide you with a list of resources for caregivers, in case your wife needs any support. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… not really. Just… tell me when to come back. And try to keep it simple, alright? No complicated medical jargon. Just tell me what's wrong, if anything is wrong. And please… don't tell my wife it’s something serious. She’ll fall apart. Just… let me get back to work. That’s all I ask. Alright, Doctor. Let's get this over with. Where's the lab?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. I'll keep things as simple as possible and will certainly respect your wishes regarding your wife. The lab is just down the hall to your right. The nurse will take your blood sample and send the results to my office. I'll contact you as soon as they're available. Here's a card with my contact information and the lab’s address. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I hope everything goes well, Mr. Lason. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out. .
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Thank you. .
