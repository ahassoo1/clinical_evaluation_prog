DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tippens. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Just Melvenia is fine, please. Well, I need some papers signed, actually. Some health forms for… well, a few things. I just need them notarized, I guess. Is that what you do here? I don’t want to take up too much of your time, I have an appointment later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Notarizing forms isn't precisely what we do here, Ms. Tippens. This is a medical practice. We provide healthcare. However… … before I can simply sign paperwork, I am required to at least briefly assess whether you need medical care. It’s a matter of professional responsibility. Even if it's just to confirm you have another physician managing your health. Are you currently under the care of another doctor?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I hadn't thought of that. Well, no, not right now. Not really. I used to have a doctor back in… well, it’s been a while. I mostly just handle things myself, you know? Little aches and pains, that sort of thing. I really just need these papers signed so I can… get things sorted. Is there a form I need to fill out for you to just… verify I’m alright? I'm a pretty healthy woman for my age, honestly.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, with all due respect, “handling things yourself” isn’t a substitute for proper medical evaluation. We need to establish a basic health history before I can even consider signing off on these forms. It’s not simply about whether you feel healthy; it’s about identifying potential issues that you might not be aware of. Let's start with the basics. Do you have any current medical problems – anything that’s been bothering you, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, alright. You're right, I suppose. It's just… doctors, well, they always want to poke and prod. Let me think… well, my knees get a little creaky sometimes, especially when it’s cold. And I get tired easier now than I used to, naturally. Being my age. I also have a little trouble sleeping, but that’s been going on forever. Honestly, that's about it. Nothing major, really. I don't want to bother you with little things. Do I need to list everything, even things from years ago?
DOCTOR: “Little things” can often be indicative of larger issues, Ms. Tippens. That’s why we ask. And yes, I do need a complete medical history, or as complete as you can recall. It's important. Let’s start with the knees. How long have they been creaky?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time, I suppose. Probably… ten years, at least? It comes and goes. Worse in the winter, like I said. Not constant pain, just… stiff. Makes getting up and down a little tricky. I just put it down to getting older, you know? I try to stay active, I walk when I can. Is there a specific question about my knees, or should I just… tell you everything that happens with them? It’s a little hard to explain sometimes. They just… ache.
DOCTOR: "Ache" isn't particularly helpful, Ms. Tippens. Is it a sharp pain?
PATIENT: No, no, not sharp. It’s… dull. Like a deep ache, inside the joint, I guess. Not on the surface, inside. And it’s worse when I first get up, or after I’ve been sitting for a while. Then it loosens up a little, but it’s still there. Honestly, I probably should have had it looked at, but I just figured it was arthritis. My mother had terrible arthritis, so I just assumed it was the same thing. Is that… okay to just assume things? I didn't want to bother the doctor over something I thought I knew the answer to.
DOCTOR: Ms. Tippens, self-diagnosis is rarely accurate, and dismissing symptoms as “just getting older” is… problematic. Now, you mentioned difficulty sleeping. How long have you been having trouble sleeping, and can you describe how you’re having trouble?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, probably as long as the knees, honestly. Ten years or more. It’s not that I can’t fall asleep, it’s… staying asleep. I wake up a lot during the night. Sometimes I just lie there for hours, staring at the ceiling. And then I'm tired all day. I used to be able to sleep through anything, but now… a little noise, a little discomfort, and I’m wide awake. I've tried warm milk, you know, the old remedies. Doesn't really help much anymore. And I worry. I worry a lot when I'm lying awake. Does that make sense? It’s a vicious cycle, really. Worried about something, can’t sleep, then worry more because I can’t sleep.
DOCTOR: Worrying is… understandable, Ms. Tippens. However, it doesn’t address the underlying issue. Before we continue, do you take any medications at all – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, anything?
