DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shaub. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Pehrson. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, I asked to come in for an HIV test. It’s… something I’ve been wanting to get checked for a little while now, and I figured it was best not to put it off any longer.
DOCTOR: Right. An HIV test. Okay. And… why now, specifically?
PATIENT: Well, my husband and I… we haven’t been as careful as we should have been lately. It’s been… a long marriage, you understand. Things slip. And I just thought it was a good idea to be sure. Better safe than sorry, as they say. It’s been on my mind, honestly.
DOCTOR: Right. “Things slip.” I see. And has this been… recent?
PATIENT: Yes, it has been quite recent. Within the last three months, I would say. We went on a trip, and… well, let's just say we were enjoying ourselves. I know it wasn’t the wisest thing, and now I’m a little anxious about it. Is there a lot I need to worry about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Shaub, most people worry unnecessarily. But alright. We’ll do the test. It's a simple blood draw. But honestly, given your age, and assuming you’ve been married a long time, your risk is probably… minimal. Still, better to know, I guess. Any other… concerns?
PATIENT: Well, that’s… reassuring to hear about my age, I suppose. But I've read things online, and it seems like anyone can get it, regardless of… well, anything, really. And honestly, Doctor, I don’t have a lot of… experience with this sort of thing. What exactly does a positive result mean? What happens then? I haven't been feeling unwell, so I’m a bit confused about what to expect.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Shaub, the internet is full of misinformation. A positive result means you have the virus. It's… not ideal. Then we'd discuss medication – there are treatments. A lot of appointments. It's manageable, if you catch it early. But frankly, you’re likely fine. Let's just get the test done and stop borrowing trouble. Do you have any allergies to latex or anything?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Allergies… no, not that I know of. I’ve had injections before, at the pharmacy, and I didn't have any reaction. But… medication? A lot of appointments? That sounds… daunting, to be honest. Is it something that… would change my life drastically? I’m still trying to understand what this all means, and it's a bit overwhelming. Could you explain the medication a little more simply? I don’t understand medical jargon, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Shaub, I have other patients waiting. The medication… it's a pill. You take it every day. It keeps the virus under control. It’s not like the old days. You can live a normal life, mostly. But it requires… discipline. And regular check-ups. It's a commitment. Honestly, you're overthinking this. Let's just get the blood drawn. Nurse will be right in. Do you have any current medications you're taking?
PATIENT: No, I don't take any other medications. Just vitamins, occasionally. And I understand you're busy, Doctor. I'm sorry to be… difficult. It’s just… a lot to process. And it's a little frightening, not knowing. So, just a blood draw then? And the nurse will explain the rest? Will I get the results quickly? I'm… anxious to just know one way or the other.
DOCTOR: Yes, just a blood draw. Nurse will handle it. Results usually take a few days. I’ll have her explain the follow-up process. Now, if you'll excuse me... Let’s get this over with.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you fitting me in. I’ll just wait here then, for the nurse.
