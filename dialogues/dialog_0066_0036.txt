DOCTOR: Hi Kiwane, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Barban is my name. I am here… for the check-up. Before the insurance starts, you understand? I have Medicare, and they said I need this done first. It is… required.
DOCTOR: Right, a welcome to Medicare check-up. Absolutely, very common. We want to get everything documented and make sure you're all set with your coverage. It’s good you’re being proactive about this. So, even though it's a required check-up, is there anything specifically you've been concerned about or any health issues you wanted to discuss while we're here?
PATIENT: Concerns? No. I feel… fine. Everything works. I eat, I sleep, I go to work. It is simple. I do not usually… bother with doctors unless something is broken. This is just paperwork, yes? To make the insurance happy?
DOCTOR: That’s a good approach – only when needed! But a check-up is still valuable even when things seem fine. It’s a chance to catch anything early, before it does become a problem. Okay, well, let's start with some basics then. I'll need to get a good history of your overall health. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. My grandmother… she had something with her stomach, a long time ago. But that was in Yemen. I was a child. As for illnesses… a cold, sometimes. The usual things. I work in the food place, you understand? Lots of people. You get little things. Nothing serious. I do not remember anything major.
DOCTOR: Okay, no major surgeries or illnesses, that's good to know. And you work in food service, so exposure to common illnesses is understandable. How about in your family?
PATIENT: Family? My father… he had problems with his blood pressure, I think. He was always tired. And my mother… she died when I was young. Something with her heart, I believe. But it was a long time ago, and I was only a boy. I do not know details. They were… old. Old people get sick, yes? Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, thank you. It is good to be aware of family history, yes. High blood pressure and heart issues can sometimes run in families. It's okay you don’t know the specifics, we just try to get a general idea. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or environmental things?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never taken anything. I do not like taking pills. They make me feel… strange. Allergies… no. I eat everything. I work with food, you understand? I must be able to eat all kinds of things. No problems. Dust, maybe. Sometimes it makes my nose itch, but that is all.
DOCTOR: Good, no medications or allergies to worry about. That simplifies things. Alright, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. It is bad for you. My father… he smoked, and he always coughed. I do not want to cough. Drink… sometimes a little tea. With sugar. Not alcohol. Alcohol is… foolish. And drugs? No. I work. I do not have time for such things. A man must be responsible.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Kiwane. Very responsible. So, no smoking, no alcohol, no drugs. That's all very good for your health. Now, just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little about what your typical day looks like?
PATIENT: Typical day? I wake up. I eat breakfast - bread, usually, with some fruit. Then I go to work. I work at the food place. I prepare things. I clean things. It is… busy. Long hours. I come home, I eat dinner, I sleep. Sometimes I watch the television. It is… simple. Not exciting, but it is work. A man must earn money.
DOCTOR: Okay, so long hours on your feet at work. That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else at all you'd like to mention?
PATIENT: Physical exam? What does that involve? Will you poke me? I do not like being poked. And will this take long? I have things to do after this. It is important to be efficient, you understand? I do not want to waste time.
DOCTOR: Yes, it will involve a quick exam. It's pretty standard. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, look in your ears, nose and throat, and maybe feel your abdomen. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable, and I'll explain everything as I go. And it won't take long, maybe 15-20 minutes. We're just trying to get a baseline of your health. It's good preventative care. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fifteen minutes? That is… acceptable. But you must be quick, Doctor. I have responsibilities. And please, be gentle. I do not enjoy being… prodded. And explain everything, as you said. I do not like surprises. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Absolutely understood, Kiwane. Quick, gentle, and explained every step of the way. No surprises, I promise. Okay, let’s start then. Could you please hop up on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Very well. But be quick, Doctor. As I said… time is valuable. And please, explain what you are doing before you do it. I do not like surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course. First, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. It helps me hear how things are functioning. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again…
PATIENT: It is… cold. And what do you expect to hear? Is my heart broken? I do not feel broken. Is this a normal procedure? You should explain these things, Doctor. It is unsettling to have things pressed against your body without knowing why.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask, Kiwane. I apologize for not explaining better. Listening to your heart and lungs is a routine part of a check-up. I am listening for any unusual sounds – murmurs, wheezes, crackles – that might indicate a problem. It doesn't mean your heart is broken, just that I'm checking to make sure everything is functioning smoothly. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure. This will feel a little tight, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’m looking for a reading within a healthy range.
PATIENT: Tight… very tight. Is this normal? It feels… constricting. And what is a ‘healthy range’? You must explain these things, Doctor. I do not understand medical jargon. Just tell me… is it good or bad? Is my blood pressure… dangerous?
DOCTOR: It is normal to feel a bit of pressure with the cuff. Your blood pressure is 130 over 80. That’s slightly elevated, but not dangerously high. A normal reading is usually around 120 over 80, but it can fluctuate depending on stress, activity level, and other factors. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m just going to quickly look in your ears, nose, and throat with this light.
PATIENT: Into my ears? What are you looking for? Dirt? I keep myself clean. This is… intrusive. What if it hurts? You must be careful. I do not enjoy having things poked into my body. And I still do not understand why you are doing all of this. Is there something wrong with me?
DOCTOR: You are right to ask, Kiwane. I apologize for not explaining well enough. I'm looking to make sure there's no sign of infection or blockage in your ears. It’s a quick check, and it shouldn't hurt. I'm just shining a light and looking inside. Everything looks clear in your ears. Now, I'll just take a quick look at your nose and throat.
PATIENT: Throat… it feels strange. Is everything alright? You are taking a very long time. I have responsibilities, you understand. Is there something wrong with my throat? Do I need medicine? I do not like surprises. Tell me… is it serious? I feel… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Your throat looks a little red, but that could be due to a number of things - a mild cold, allergies, or even just dry air. It doesn’t seem serious at all. I don’t see any signs of infection or anything concerning. Okay, that completes the basic physical exam. Everything looks good overall, Kiwane. As I said, your throat is a little red, but nothing to worry about at this time. Now, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm… Yes. You said my blood pressure was slightly elevated. What does that mean? What can I do about it? Is it something serious? Do I need to take pills? And will this… throat redness… get worse? You must explain these things, Doctor. I do not understand medical jargon. And how long will this check-up take? I am losing valuable time.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Kiwane. Let's address them one by one. Slightly elevated blood pressure means your heart is working a little harder to pump blood through your body. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong now, but it’s something we want to keep an eye on. It can be caused by a number of things – stress, diet, lack of exercise, and even just being at the doctor's office can raise it temporarily. For now, I recommend making a few lifestyle changes. Try to reduce your stress levels, eat a healthy diet low in salt and processed foods, and get regular exercise. Even a 30-minute walk most days of the week can make a big difference. We can discuss this further and create a plan tailored to your lifestyle. As for pills, we don’t need to consider medication right now. We’ll see if the lifestyle changes help lower your blood pressure. We’ll recheck it in a few months. Regarding your throat redness, it's likely just a minor irritation. It shouldn't get worse if you stay hydrated and avoid irritants. If it does worsen, or you develop a fever or sore throat, then we'll need to investigate further. We’ve been at this for about 30 minutes now. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Thirty minutes… Yes. That is… acceptable. So, no pills yet. But I must change my diet and exercise? That is… inconvenient. And what kind of diet? And what kind of exercise? You must be specific, Doctor. I do not understand vague instructions. And what if my blood pressure does not go down? Then what happens? Will I need more tests? Will I need… surgery? I do not like surgery. And what if this throat redness is… serious? You must explain the worst-case scenarios, Doctor. I need to be prepared. I do not like surprises.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about worst-case scenarios, and I apologize for not being more specific. Let's go through this systematically. If lifestyle changes don't lower your blood pressure, we would likely start with more frequent monitoring. We may also order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. In some cases, medication may be necessary to control your blood pressure. However, we would only consider that as a last resort. Surgery is extremely unlikely for high blood pressure. It's rarely required. Regarding your throat, if the redness worsens, develops a fever, or you experience difficulty swallowing, we would consider a throat swab to check for infection like strep throat. Depending on the results, we might prescribe antibiotics. Again, this is just a precaution, and I don’t anticipate this being necessary. Here's a handout with more information on healthy eating and exercise. Focus on reducing your salt intake, eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, and getting at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. Walking, swimming, or cycling are all good options. I want to reassure you that your blood pressure is only slightly elevated, and your throat redness is likely minor. We’ll monitor your progress closely, and I’ll be here to answer any questions you have along the way. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in three months to recheck your blood pressure. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Three months… Very well. But if I feel unwell before then, I can come see you? And what is the cost of a follow-up appointment? I need to be aware of the financial implications. And what if the tests are… expensive? I do not have unlimited funds. I need specifics, Doctor. I do not like surprises. And one more thing. You said you would explain everything. But you used a lot of medical terms. What is ‘moderate exercise’? And what does ‘strep throat’ even mean? You must explain these things in simple language. I am not a doctor.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You can come see me any time if you feel unwell before the three-month follow-up. There is a standard co-pay for follow-up appointments, which is [state co-pay amount] with your Medicare coverage. We will discuss any potential costs for tests before they are ordered. I will never order a test without first explaining the reason for it and the associated cost. Let's clarify those terms. 'Moderate exercise' means activity that raises your heart rate and makes you breathe harder, but you can still carry on a conversation. Think brisk walking, cycling at a leisurely pace, or swimming. You should feel somewhat challenged, but not completely exhausted. 'Strep throat' is an infection caused by a bacteria called streptococcus. It causes a sore throat, fever, and sometimes white patches on your tonsils. It’s easily treated with antibiotics. It's not usually serious if caught early. I apologize for using medical jargon earlier. I will make a conscious effort to explain things in simpler language going forward. My goal is to make sure you understand everything and feel comfortable with your care plan. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think that is… sufficient for now. You have answered my questions, and you have clarified the terms. You seem… competent, Doctor. But I will be watching you closely. And if you try to give me vague instructions or use medical jargon again, I will… object. I suppose I will see you in three months. But if I feel unwell before then, I will contact you. And I expect clear explanations and specific instructions. Do not surprise me, Doctor. And one last thing. What time is my follow-up appointment? I need to schedule my work accordingly. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand, and I appreciate your directness. I will certainly do my best to keep you informed and avoid any surprises. Your follow-up appointment is scheduled for November 2, 2025, at 10:00 AM. The receptionist will send you a reminder a week before. It was a pleasure meeting you, Kiwane. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day.
