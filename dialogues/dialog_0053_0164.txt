DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Haggar. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s a bit strange, honestly. I’ve been feeling really weak and…yellow, for a few days now. It started after I ate some fava beans. I love them, normally, but this time…not so good.
DOCTOR: Yellow, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, my skin is definitely yellowish. And my eyes too, I think. It’s hard to tell for sure, but my daughter pointed it out. She was pretty worried, which is why I came in so quickly. It's not just the color, I feel really tired all the time too. Like, exhausted.
DOCTOR: Fava beans… and now jaundice, and fatigue. Interesting. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or dark urine along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No vomiting, thankfully. I did feel a little queasy yesterday, but I wouldn't call it full-blown nausea. And no, no abdominal pain. My urine… I haven't really noticed anything different about it, to be honest. I don’t usually pay that close of attention. Is dark urine something serious?
DOCTOR: It can be, yes. It’s often a sign of liver or gallbladder issues, which is why I ask. Alright. And has this weakness been sudden, or has it been building up over time?
PATIENT: It was pretty sudden, actually. I felt fine one day, and then the next… just really wiped out. The yellowing started around the same time, maybe a little after. It wasn’t gradual at all. It really shocked me, because I usually have a lot of energy. I work full-time, you know? Receptionist at a law office. I need to be on my feet all day.
DOCTOR: Receptionist, alright. That does require some stamina. And you mentioned you’ve eaten fava beans before with no problems?
PATIENT: Yes, for years! My grandmother used to grow them, and we’d have them all the time. I never had any trouble at all. That’s what makes this so confusing. I mean, I love them. But it's like they suddenly… turned on me? I feel a little silly even talking about it, like maybe I'm just being dramatic. But I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all. It is unusual to develop a reaction after years of consumption. It sounds like we may be dealing with something called Favism. It’s a genetic condition where people are deficient in an enzyme that helps break down substances in fava beans. It can cause a sudden onset of jaundice and fatigue, as you’ve described. However, we need to rule out other possibilities first. I'm going to do a quick exam, just to get a better picture of things. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Favism… I’ve never heard of that. A genetic thing? Oh dear. Well, if that's what it is, I suppose it makes sense. It would explain why it suddenly started, wouldn't it? Yes, please, an exam sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better. Hopefully it’s not too serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your abdomen feels soft, no tenderness there, which is good. And yes, I do see some jaundice in your sclera, confirming your daughter’s observation. Your skin tone is also noticeably yellow. Let's check your vital signs quickly. Blood pressure is a bit on the lower side, 110/70, pulse is normal at 72, and temperature is 98.6. Now, I'm going to need to order some blood tests – a complete blood count, liver function tests, and a G6PD enzyme assay to confirm or rule out Favism.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough. Lower blood pressure… is that related to feeling so weak? And a G6PD… what does that test actually do? Sorry to ask so many questions, Doctor, but I get a bit anxious when I don’t understand things. Is it something serious if it is Favism? Is there a treatment?
DOCTOR: It's alright to ask questions, Ms. Haggar. It’s my job to explain things. Lower blood pressure can contribute to weakness, yes, but it's not necessarily the main cause here. The G6PD test measures the level of an enzyme in your red blood cells. A low level indicates a susceptibility to Favism, meaning your body has trouble processing substances in fava beans, leading to red blood cell breakdown, which causes jaundice and fatigue. Now, is it serious?
PATIENT: Okay, red blood cell breakdown… that sounds scary. And you were saying, is it serious? I'm trying not to panic, but it's hard. Are people… do people die from this? What's the treatment? I really appreciate you explaining it to me, Doctor. It's much better than just saying "you have this" without knowing what that means.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. While red blood cell breakdown sounds alarming, it's manageable. Severe cases can lead to complications, but it's relatively rare with prompt diagnosis and treatment. Thankfully, you're here, and we're getting it sorted. The primary treatment is avoidance of fava beans and other trigger foods – certain medications and even some chemicals can also cause a reaction. If you have a reaction, it typically involves supportive care – hydration, rest, and in some cases, a blood transfusion if the anemia is severe. We will monitor your blood counts closely. I'm going to order those blood tests now, and we should have the results back within 24 to 48 hours. In the meantime, I strongly advise you avoid fava beans entirely, and let’s review any medications you're currently taking to make sure they aren’t contributing to this. Do you have a list with you?
PATIENT: Okay, that’s…reassuring, a little. Supportive care sounds manageable. I'll definitely avoid fava beans. I hadn’t even considered other foods or medications. Yes, I do! Just a minute… Here. It's mostly just a daily vitamin, and something for my allergies. Cetirizine, I think it’s called? And sometimes ibuprofen for headaches, but not very often. Oh, and occasionally a sleeping pill – zolpidem – when I have trouble sleeping. Is that enough information? I can write down the dosages if that would help.
DOCTOR: Cetirizine and ibuprofen are unlikely to be the cause, but zolpidem can sometimes affect the liver, so it’s good to know you’re taking it. The vitamin is fine. Let's get those blood tests ordered right away. The lab technician will take a sample from your arm. It shouldn’t take long. I will also send a referral to a hematologist – a specialist in blood disorders – for a second opinion and further management. It’s always best to have another set of eyes on something like this. Do you have any preferences regarding hospitals or specialists?
PATIENT: Okay, good. I'm glad the others aren't likely to be the problem. And a hematologist… that sounds sensible. No, I don’t have a preference for hospitals or specialists. Whatever you recommend is fine, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I just want to get this figured out and feel better again. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should watch out for?
DOCTOR: Alright. In the meantime, continue to avoid fava beans. Watch out for any signs of worsening jaundice – darker urine, pale stools, abdominal pain, or extreme fatigue. If you experience any of those symptoms, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Also, stay well-hydrated and get plenty of rest. I’ll have the lab results sent to me as soon as they're available, and my assistant will schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss them. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for explaining everything so clearly and taking the time to listen to me. I feel a lot better knowing what's going on, even if it's a bit scary. I really appreciate it. I'll go to the lab now. Thank you again, Doctor Pitmon. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Haggar. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. We'll get to the bottom of this. You have a good day as well. .
