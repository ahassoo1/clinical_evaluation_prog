DOCTOR: Hi Velda, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because I’m planning a cruise – a lovely one, to the Mediterranean – and the cruise line requires some medical information before I can confirm my booking. They need a doctor to fill out a form, you see. It’s all rather… bureaucratic, but necessary, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right, a pre-cruise medical evaluation. Understandable, lots of requirements these days. Okay, so the cruise line has a specific form?
PATIENT: Yes, they do. Here it is. I believe it's fairly standard, but I haven’t had much experience with these sorts of things, to be honest. My late husband always took care of these details. Would you be able to take a look when you have a moment?
DOCTOR: Yes, this looks pretty straightforward. Mostly a quick overview of your health history. Let’s just run through some questions to make sure I have everything filled out accurately, okay?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Please, do ask away. I’ll do my best to recall everything accurately. Though, I must confess, it’s been a few years since I’ve had to think about some of this in detail.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, asthma, arthritis, or anything else that requires ongoing medical care?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… No, not as such. I had a touch of bronchitis once, many years ago, but that cleared up completely with a good rest and some cough syrup. And I do get a bit of stiffness in my knees sometimes, especially in colder weather, but I wouldn't call it arthritis, not really. It’s just… getting older, I suppose. I haven’t been regularly under a doctor’s care for anything significant for a very long time. Is that what you mean by ‘chronic’?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. By chronic, I mean conditions that require ongoing treatment or management. So, no major diagnoses then. And the knee stiffness… is it painful, or more just a feeling of limited movement?
PATIENT: It's not particularly painful, no. More… uncomfortable, and it can be a bit difficult getting up from a chair sometimes. It's worse on damp days, definitely. It doesn’t stop me from doing things, mind you. I still enjoy a good walk and gardening, though I might be a bit slower than I used to be. I suspect it’s just the Scottish weather getting to my old bones!
DOCTOR: Alright, that gives me a good picture. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… yes, actually. When I was quite young – about twenty years old – I had my tonsils removed. And… oh, yes! A rather silly thing, really. I tripped and broke my wrist when I was a teenager. It was a clean break, mended quite well, and hasn't bothered me since. Nothing else, I don’t believe. Should I be remembering anything else?
DOCTOR: No, that’s good. Tonsillectomy and a wrist fracture… noted. Now, how about any significant illnesses or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Significant illnesses… well, as I said, that bout of bronchitis. I was bedridden for a week or so, but I recovered fully. I haven’t been hospitalized for anything else, no. Not ever, as far as I recall. I’ve always been quite healthy, generally. A bit of a cold now and then, of course, but nothing serious enough to require a hospital visit. I’m a sturdy Scottish lass, you see!
DOCTOR: Good to hear. Okay, and are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. Not a single one. I prefer to avoid them if at all possible, unless absolutely necessary. I believe in a good diet and fresh air, and that’s served me well so far. I take a multivitamin occasionally, but that’s just a precaution, really. And a cup of chamomile tea before bed, if that counts!
DOCTOR: No, chamomile tea doesn't count. So, no prescription medications, over-the-counter medications regularly, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. Nothing at all. I occasionally take a paracetamol for a headache, but that's very rare indeed. And I used to take iron supplements when I was a young woman, but I haven’t needed those for many years. I do rub some cream on my hands sometimes, as they get a bit dry in the winter, but that's hardly a medication, is it?
DOCTOR: No, hand cream doesn't count. Alright, good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I am aware. My husband always used to worry about allergies, but I've always been quite fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything, and I haven’t had any trouble with bee stings or anything like that, either. I suppose I might get a slight sniffle if I’m near a particularly dusty room, but that's not an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: No, a sniffle from dust doesn't count. Okay, that's very good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My father had a touch of high blood pressure in his later years, and my mother had arthritis, quite badly, in her hands. And… oh, yes! My aunt on my mother’s side had breast cancer, but that was a long time ago. Other than that, I don’t recall any major health problems in the family. My grandfather lived to a very good age, and my grandmother was remarkably fit for her age, too. It's difficult to remember, truthfully. It was a long time ago, and we weren't always so aware of these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, father with hypertension, mother with arthritis, aunt with breast cancer. Do you know if your aunt’s breast cancer was diagnosed at a young age?
PATIENT: That's a rather specific question, Doctor. She was… oh, goodness. I believe she was in her fifties when she was diagnosed. Not particularly young, I suppose. She lived for several years after the diagnosis, though. She was quite a strong woman. I don't believe it ran in the family before her, not that I know of. It was rather a shock, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of sherry at Christmas, but that’s it. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I’m a respectable Scottish woman, Doctor! I believe in a healthy lifestyle, and those sorts of things have never appealed to me.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That's all very good to know. Now, I'd just like to quickly check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. Please, do go ahead. I'm quite comfortable with all of that. I always try to be prepared for these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax your arm for me. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, which is slightly elevated but not concerning. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular and lungs are clear. I’m just going to quickly feel your pulse. Pulse is 72, also normal. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I have a bit of stiffness in my knees sometimes, as I mentioned, but that's not pain, not really. It’s just… a bit uncomfortable getting up from a chair. And my hands can feel a bit dry in the cold weather, but that’s hardly pain, is it? Other than that, I feel perfectly well. I’m a very sturdy Scottish lass, as I said!
DOCTOR: Good. And your weight is 109 pounds and your height is 171 centimeters. That puts your BMI at 37, which is considered obese. It's important to consider your weight as it can contribute to other health issues, but it doesn't necessarily mean you have any problems right now. Are you concerned about your weight?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, I hadn't really thought about it. I've always been… comfortably built, I suppose. My late husband always said I was a good size. I enjoy my food, you see. And I don't do a great deal of strenuous exercise, no. Obese, you say? That sounds rather… strong. I suppose it's something I should be mindful of, then. But I feel perfectly healthy, Doctor. Are you suggesting I should lose weight?
DOCTOR: I'm not suggesting anything, Velda, but being overweight can increase your risk of things like heart disease and diabetes. It's good you feel healthy now, and that's the most important thing. But it's something we can discuss if you'd like. We could talk about some small changes you could make to your diet or exercise routine, if you're interested. Or we could just monitor your blood pressure and cholesterol levels regularly to make sure everything stays healthy. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: Hmm. I suppose regular monitoring sounds best. I really don’t think I have the inclination for drastic changes, Doctor. I enjoy my life as it is, and I don’t want to spend my retirement worrying about every morsel I eat! Perhaps just checking my blood pressure now and then would be sufficient. And cholesterol, you say? Is that something I should be concerned about? I don’t understand all the medical jargon, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Regular monitoring is a perfectly sensible approach. And yes, cholesterol is something we should check. It’s a type of fat in your blood, and high levels can increase your risk of heart disease. It’s a simple blood test we can do during your check-ups. So, to summarise: you've had no major illnesses, surgeries, allergies, or medications. You're slightly overweight, but you feel healthy. And we'll monitor your blood pressure and cholesterol. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and for not making me feel… pressured to change my lifestyle. I feel much more confident about my cruise now, knowing I have a clean bill of health, more or less! And thank you for not judging my weight. It’s a sensitive topic, you see. Now, about this form for the cruise line… will you be able to sign it today?
DOCTOR: Of course. I’m happy to sign the form. Here you go. Everything looks good. You're cleared for travel! Just remember to stay hydrated and protect yourself from the sun while you’re on your cruise. And if you experience any sudden changes in your health, please seek medical attention. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful! Thank you so much, Doctor. No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been most kind and helpful. I appreciate your patience and understanding. I shall certainly enjoy my cruise now, knowing I have your blessing. Have a lovely day, Doctor. And thank you again for everything. .
