DOCTOR: Hi Mannie, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, it's… the team. The baseball team. I gotta… get checked out, I think. For tryouts. My wife, bless her heart, she made the appointment. I don't remember all the details, though. Just gotta make sure I'm okay to play, you know? Old man needs checkin' out!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mannie. It’s smart of you to get checked out before tryouts, and even smarter of your wife to schedule it! We'll get everything sorted out. So, you're wanting a sports physical, essentially?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. A sports… physical. That's it! Just makin' sure everything still works, you know? Been playin’ softball for… a long time now. Gotta make sure this old ticker can handle it! Don’t wanna fall apart on the field.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll definitely check things out. To get started, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… Hmm. Well, I… I think it’s okay. I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn't at my age, right? I try to eat good, my wife is a great cook. And I walk a little bit, when the weather's nice. No big problems, really. Nothing I can think of anyway. Do you… need me to list things? My brain isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Mannie. We can take it slow. Just tell me what you feel comfortable sharing. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… high blood pressure… I think the doctor mentioned something about that a few years back. But I don’t really remember the details. He gave me some pills, I think. And… diabetes? No, I don’t think so. My wife would definitely tell me if I had that! She’s always lookin’ after me. Heart… well, I get a little chest pain sometimes when I really push myself, but I figured that was just old age. It’s hard to remember everything, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're aware of the chest pain, though. And it's helpful to know about the possible high blood pressure. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones, regularly?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Oh! I take a little pill for my knees, sometimes. They bother me after I play. And… sometimes I take something for heartburn. Tums, I think they’re called. Just when I eat something spicy, my wife makes a really good chili. Other than that… I don’t think so. Nothing regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with allergies, thankfully. My wife always checks the labels when she cooks, just in case. She's very careful. I’ve been lucky in that department, I guess. No hives, no itchy throats, nothing like that. Never had to carry one of those… EpiPen things.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Alright, Mannie, just a few more questions about your history, then we’ll do a quick physical exam. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, a long, long time ago. And… I think I had a broken arm once, when I was playin’ baseball. But that was so long ago, I barely remember it. Hospitalized… I don’t think so. Not for anything serious, anyway. Maybe for the tonsils, but that was just overnight. It's all a bit blurry, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family… My father, he had… something with his heart, I think. He passed away when I was young. And my mother, she had… arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. She was always complainin’ about it. And… my sister, she had… I can’t quite remember, something with her stomach, I think. It was a long time ago. It’s hard to remember all the details. We weren't very good at keepin’ track of things like that back then.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mannie. It’s common to not have all the details. Knowing about the heart issues and arthritis is helpful. Lastly, before we move on to the physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I try to take it easy. I like to watch baseball on TV, of course. And I enjoy spendin’ time with my wife. We go for walks sometimes, when the weather's nice. I don’t smoke, never have. And I only drink a little bit of wine with dinner, maybe a glass or two. I used to work hard, construction work, but I’m retired now. I enjoy a good meal, too! Not as much exercise as I probably should get, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mannie, that gives me a good overview. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if it’s gonna hurt! Old bones ain't what they used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: I'll be as gentle as possible, Mannie. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just relax and take some deep breaths for me. Okay, heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not terribly concerning at this point, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Blood pressure is 142/88, a little elevated. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your pulse in your wrists and ankles. Pulses are a little weak in your ankles, but present. Now let's take a look at your abdomen… Do you have any pain or tenderness anywhere?
PATIENT: A murmur, huh? Never heard about that before. My wife will be wantin’ to know about that! And 142… is that bad? I try to stay away from salt, but I like a good steak now and then. My ankles… they get a little cold sometimes, but nothin’ too bad. Weak, huh? I’ve been walkin’ less lately, to be honest. No pain really, just a little… full, maybe? After dinner. But nothin’ I’d worry about. My wife makes good food!
DOCTOR: Okay, abdomen is soft, but a little bit full. No tenderness. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but not alarming. Finally, I'm going to take a quick look at your feet and ankles for any swelling or signs of circulation problems. I do see a little bit of swelling in your ankles, and your skin is a little bit dry. Okay, Mannie. That concludes the physical exam. Overall, things aren't terrible, but there are a few things we need to address. The elevated blood pressure, the ankle swelling, the weak pulses, the murmur… and the diminished reflexes. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like there may be some early signs of peripheral artery disease and potentially some early heart failure.
PATIENT: Peripheral artery… what now? And heart… failure? Oh dear. That doesn't sound good at all. My wife is gonna be worried sick. Is it serious, Doctor? Do I need… surgery? I don't want to be layin' in a hospital bed! And what about baseball? Can I still play? That's important to me, you know! I’ve been lookin’ forward to tryouts.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mannie, let's not jump to conclusions. "Heart failure" sounds scary, but it doesn't necessarily mean your heart is about to stop working. It just means it's not pumping as efficiently as it should be, and we can often manage it with medication and lifestyle changes. As for peripheral artery disease, that means there's some narrowing of the arteries in your legs, which is why your pulses are weak and your ankles are swollen. It can cause pain when you walk, and if left untreated, it can lead to more serious problems. The good news is, we can definitely take steps to address these issues. I want to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Specifically, I'd like to do a blood test to check your cholesterol and kidney function, an EKG to look at your heart rhythm, and an ankle-brachial index test to check the blood flow in your legs. We may also need to do an echocardiogram to get a closer look at your heart. As for playing baseball, I wouldn’t recommend strenuous activity until we have the results of these tests. We need to make sure your heart is strong enough to handle the exertion. But we'll work together to get you back on the field if we can! Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… okay, tests. That sounds… sensible. I guess I gotta do what the doctor says. And no baseball… oh dear. My wife is gonna be disappointed. But… she'll understand. She always does. Echocardiogram… what is that exactly? Is it painful? And the ankle-brachial… you said? Will it hurt my legs? I don’t want to be lyin’ in bed all day! And what about the medication? What kind of pills are we talkin’ about? I don't want anything that'll make me tired. I gotta be able to spend time with my wife, you know? This is a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mannie, let’s take it one step at a time. An echocardiogram is a non-invasive test – it's like an ultrasound for your heart. We just put some gel on your chest and use a probe to get pictures of your heart beating. It doesn't hurt at all, it's completely painless. The ankle-brachial index test is also painless. We just measure your blood pressure in your arms and ankles and compare the readings. It tells us how well the blood is flowing in your legs. As for medication, it's hard to say exactly what we'll need until we have the test results. But the goal is to find something that helps your heart pump more efficiently and controls your blood pressure, without making you feel tired or unwell. There are a lot of different options available, and we'll work together to find the right one for you. We might start with something mild and see how you tolerate it. I understand this is a lot to take in, and you’re right to ask questions. We’ll go through everything step-by-step, and I'll explain everything in detail. My nurse, Sarah, will schedule the tests for you and give you detailed instructions on how to prepare. She can also answer any questions you have. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Sarah, huh? That sounds good. A nurse is always a good idea. Someone to explain things… that's helpful. And no pain… that's a relief. So… no baseball for now. But maybe… maybe later? If I take the pills and get the tests… maybe I can still play? That would be… good. Okay, Doctor. I trust you. Let's do the tests. And I'll talk to my wife. She'll know what to do. She always does. Do I need to fast for any of the tests? I like my breakfast.
DOCTOR: That’s the spirit, Mannie! And yes, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood tests. No breakfast, unfortunately, but you can drink water. Sarah will give you a detailed list of instructions when she schedules the tests. Okay, I’m going to go ahead and write up the orders for the tests. Sarah should be in to see you shortly. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this and figure out the best plan for you. And please, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness before your tests, call 911 immediately. Do you have any questions for me before I let Sarah come in?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think you've covered everything. Just… thank you. For explainin' things. And for not… rushin' me. Tell Sarah to be gentle with the tests, okay? Old bones ain’t what they used to be. And… thank you again. You’ve put my mind a little bit at ease. I think… I think that’s all. I’ll wait for Sarah. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mannie. I’m glad I could help. I’ll make a note for Sarah to be gentle. We’ll take good care of you. Just relax, and we'll get through this together. .
