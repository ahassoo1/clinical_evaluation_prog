DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I seem to be going to the bathroom… rather frequently. More than usual, certainly. I wouldn’t say it’s painful, just… a lot. I suppose that’s what you call it, “polyuria,” isn't it? Though, I must admit, I’ve a terrible memory for those sorts of words.
DOCTOR: Yes, polyuria is the medical term for frequent urination. No need to be embarrassed at all, Mr. Verbos, it's quite common. And don't worry about remembering the words, that's what I’m here for. Could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It’s… mostly during the day, I suppose. I wouldn’t say it keeps me up at night, thankfully. Perhaps three or four times an hour, on a normal day? It's difficult to say precisely. My routine isn't terribly structured, you see. I do drink a fair amount of tea, though. Black tea, mostly. Does that… contribute, do you think? I also seem to be thirstier than usual, but again, it's hard to pinpoint. My memory… it’s not what it once was.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four times an hour during the day, not at night, and you drink a fair amount of black tea. And you've noticed increased thirst as well. Yes, tea can certainly have a diuretic effect, meaning it can make you urinate more frequently. To get a clearer picture, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: A typical day… Well, I usually wake up around seven, though sometimes later. I have a cup of tea, of course. Then I work… I’m an environmental engineer, you see. Mostly desk work, reports and such. I might go for a walk in the afternoon, if the weather is nice. More tea throughout the day, and a simple dinner. Perhaps some reading before bed. It’s rather… uneventful, I’m afraid. Not much excitement. I do try to stay active, when I can, but honestly, my energy levels fluctuate. It’s probably age, you know.
DOCTOR: Desk work, some walking, and fluctuating energy levels. That’s helpful. And you mentioned the tea throughout the day – roughly how many cups would you say you drink?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a difficult question. Perhaps… four or five? Maybe six on a particularly busy day. I do enjoy a good cuppa, you see. It helps me concentrate. Although, now that you mention it, I’ve been drinking more tea lately. Perhaps that’s the reason for all of this? It’s all so… unclear. I apologize for my lack of precision.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Verbos. It's perfectly alright. We're trying to piece things together. Four to six cups of tea a day could certainly contribute. Now, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… other changes… let me see. I believe I’ve been a little more tired than usual, yes. And… perhaps a bit more hungry, although my appetite isn’t terribly strong to begin with. No weight loss, I don’t think. It's all rather vague, I'm afraid. My daughter keeps telling me I need to see a doctor more often, but I always put it off. I don’t like to bother people.
DOCTOR: Increased tiredness and appetite, but no weight loss. It’s alright that things are vague, we’ll work through it. And it's good you're here now. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… that’s a difficult one. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, quite some time. I had my appendix removed when I was a boy, that much I remember. And I had a bout of pneumonia many years ago, but I recovered fully. I do have a bit of… well, my family has a history of high blood pressure, I believe. My father suffered from it, and so did his father. But I haven't been formally diagnosed, if that makes sense. I avoid doctors whenever possible, truthfully. It’s not a pleasant experience.
DOCTOR: Appendix removal as a child, pneumonia years ago, and a family history of high blood pressure. That's helpful. We can check your blood pressure today. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any reactions to any medications, thankfully. I occasionally take an over-the-counter pain reliever for aches and pains, but nothing serious. And… I don’t have any food allergies, as far as I know. Though, my daughter is convinced I’m allergic to dust, but I think she exaggerates. She’s a worrier, you see.
DOCTOR: No known allergies, just occasional over-the-counter pain relievers. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, not regularly. Just the occasional pain reliever, as I mentioned. Perhaps once or twice a month, if that. Nothing prescribed, nothing I take every day. I prefer to avoid medications whenever possible, if you don't mind. I believe in letting nature take its course, when appropriate.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. No regular medications. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and a brief abdominal exam. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. I suppose it’s necessary. Though, I must warn you, I’m not terribly fond of examinations. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, proceed when you’re ready. I'll try to be as still as possible.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you. If you could please sit up and I'll start by checking your blood pressure. Alright, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 92. We’ll want to monitor that. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, though a little quiet, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Your abdomen feels soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness. There's a little bit of fullness in your lower abdomen, but nothing concerning at this point. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. It was quick and painless, I hope.
PATIENT: Yes, it was perfectly tolerable, thank you. Though, I must admit, I always feel a bit anxious during examinations. The elevated blood pressure… is that something to be worried about? And the fullness in my abdomen… what could that be? I apologize for asking so many questions, Doctor. I simply like to understand what’s happening.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Verbos. It’s good you’re asking questions. The elevated blood pressure is something we should monitor, yes. It’s not an immediate emergency, but consistently high blood pressure can lead to health problems down the line. We can discuss lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication to help manage it. The fullness in your lower abdomen could be due to several things. It could be related to your diet, gas, or simply a normal variation. Given your increased urination, we should also rule out other possibilities. I think it’s best to order some lab tests, including a urine analysis and a blood test to check your kidney function and blood sugar levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Urine analysis and a blood test. I suppose it’s the only way to be certain. Blood tests… are they very painful? I haven’t had one in… well, a very long time. And how long will it take to get the results? I hope it won’t be too long. I dislike waiting for things.
DOCTOR: No, the blood test isn’t painful at all. It’s just a quick prick of a needle, and it’s usually over before you know it. We’ll draw a small amount of blood from your arm. As for the results, it usually takes a few days, typically 24 to 48 hours, for the lab to process everything. We’ll give you a call as soon as they come back. In the meantime, try to drink plenty of water, and avoid excessive caffeine. Do you have any other questions for me right now, Mr. Verbos?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything for the moment. Drink plenty of water, avoid caffeine… and wait for the results. It seems I spend most of my life waiting for things. But thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient and understanding. I appreciate your thoroughness. I suppose I’ll be on my way, then?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Verbos. I’m glad I could help. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’ll explain the process. Yes, you can head out now. We'll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or if anything changes. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You as well. I shall try to remain optimistic. .
