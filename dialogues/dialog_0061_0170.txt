DOCTOR: Bula and hello, Mr. Putney. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Just...this life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, you know? For the paperwork. I'd like to get it over with quick if that's alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A life insurance physical – no problem at all, we can definitely get that done for you. It sounds like you're mostly here to satisfy the requirements for the paperwork, but is there anything you are hoping to get checked out while we're at it?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Just the insurance stuff. I don't usually go to the doctor unless somethin's really wrong, and right now, I feel okay. Just a little tired, maybe, but that's probably just work.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to hear. We'll focus on the requirements for the insurance then. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Um... medical history. Let me think. I had the usual kid stuff, measles, chickenpox… nothing serious. I broke my arm once, fallin' out of a tree when I was little. And… I had high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on pills and it's been okay since. I think. I stopped seein' that doctor when I moved.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, childhood illnesses, a broken arm, and high blood pressure in the past that was treated with medication. Do you remember what medication you were on for the blood pressure?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. It was… a white pill, I think? Small one. I don't really remember the name. It was a while ago, and like I said, I haven't been to a doctor regularly since then. Sorry I can't be more help. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Putney. It's common to forget details like that. We can look it up if needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My ex-wife was always makin' fun of me for that. She was super careful about what she ate. But me? I'll try anything once.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin sometimes. Usually when I remember. And if my back's really botherin' me, I'll take some ibuprofen. But that's it. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh boy. Family history... Okay, my dad, he had… diabetes, I think. And heart trouble. He passed away when he was pretty young, maybe in his sixties. My mom, she was okay for a long time, but then she got sick. Real sick. Cancer, I think. And my brother... he's got high cholesterol, I know that much. It runs in the family, I guess. Is that enough? I’m not really good at rememberin’ details.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, thank you. Diabetes and heart trouble on your father’s side, cancer with your mother, and high cholesterol with your brother. Okay. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle... Well, I work a lot. I manage a small hotel, so it's pretty much always busy. Long hours, lots of stress. I try to get some exercise when I can, mostly just walkin' around the hotel checkin' things, but it's not much. I used to fish a lot when I lived back home, but haven't had much time for that lately. And I... I used to drink a bit, but I cut back a lot after the divorce. Now I just have a beer or two sometimes. Mostly on weekends. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good picture. Long work hours, some walking, used to fish, and occasional alcohol use. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and satisfy the insurance requirements. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do. Let's just get it over with. I got things I need to take care of.
DOCTOR: Okay. Great. If you could hop up on the table for me?
PATIENT: Alright, I'm up. Just tryin' to get comfortable here. This table's kinda cold.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I'm just going to check your blood pressure. 150/90. A little elevated, but we'll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now I'm going to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Ears look fine, nose is clear, throat looks good. Now, let's just check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Finally, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Okay. Everything sounds okay, but given the slightly elevated blood pressure, I’d like to run some basic blood work. Just to get a better picture of things. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Blood work is blood work. As long as it doesn't take too long, I guess. I got a hotel to run, you know? I'm hopin' this doesn't mess up my whole schedule.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We’ll try to be as quick as possible. The blood work will just check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and a complete blood count. It'll give us a good baseline. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now. She'll explain the process. After that, we can discuss the results and what they mean. While we wait, is there anything else at all you want to mention?
PATIENT: Nah, I think that's it. Just gettin' a little impatient, to be honest. But thanks for tryin' to be quick. I appreciate it. I'm just hopin' everything's okay. I really need this insurance. Especially now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like this insurance is important to you, and we'll do our best to get everything sorted out quickly. I'll let the nurse know you're ready. She should be in shortly. She’ll be right with you.
PATIENT: Alright. Thanks, Doctor. Let's just get this over with. .
