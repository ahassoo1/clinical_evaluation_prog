DOCTOR: Hi Noelani, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Maskal. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's… a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve been having some… discomfort. Down there. In my… groin, I suppose. It's been on and off, but lately it's been more frequent. I'm not quite sure what to make of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to be embarrassed at all, Noelani. That’s what I’m here for. “Discomfort” is a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… It’s not exactly painful, all the time. More of a… heavy feeling? And sometimes a dull ache. It seems to get worse after I’ve been… working, you know, with the wood. Bending and lifting, that sort of thing. It's hard to say exactly when it started… things have been a little… hazy lately, if I’m honest. I do remember it wasn’t bothering me much a few weeks ago, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy feeling and a dull ache, worse with bending and lifting… and it’s been more noticeable recently. It sounds like it’s related to activity. You mentioned things have been “hazy” lately – are you experiencing any other symptoms, like fatigue, changes in your appetite, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear… now that you mention it, yes. I have been rather tired. More so than usual, and I usually have quite a bit of energy, even with the work. And… my appetite hasn't been the best. I haven’t been not eating, exactly, just… not very hungry. It comes and goes, really. Everything feels a bit… disconnected, if that makes sense. I apologize, Doctor, I’m not being very helpful. It’s just difficult to remember all the details.
DOCTOR: No, you’re being perfectly helpful, Noelani. It’s good you’re sharing all of this with me, even the things that feel a little vague. Fatigue and decreased appetite along with the discomfort… okay. Let’s talk about your medical history a bit. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. I’ve seen doctors over the years, of course, but… I don’t recall any major diagnoses. I had my usual check-ups, vaccinations… I believe I had the flu once, badly. And a bad shoulder a few years back from lifting. But nothing… chronic, I don’t think. I have Medicare, so I’ve been to quite a few specialists, but honestly, keeping track of everything is a bit of a struggle. Would my doctor’s office have that information? I apologize again for being so… disorganized.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Noelani. We can absolutely access your records through Medicare. That's a great idea, let me pull those up now. While I’m doing that, can you tell me about any surgeries you’ve had?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I believe. And… oh, yes! A small procedure on my knee a long time ago. A sports injury, I think. Nothing major, just a little arthroscopy. It was many years ago now, I barely remember it. Everything feels so distant. I really appreciate you looking into this, Doctor. It’s a weight off my mind knowing you have access to my records. Perhaps they will shed some light on what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils as a child and arthroscopy on your knee. I’m seeing those listed here in your records, along with some routine screenings. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… that’s another tricky one. My parents… they’re both gone now, unfortunately. I don’t recall any specific illnesses they suffered from. My mother… she was a very healthy woman, as far as I know. My father… he had some heart trouble, I believe, later in life. And… I had an older brother, but we weren’t very close. I don’t know much about his medical history, I’m afraid. I apologize. I really wish I was more helpful with these details. It’s all so… fragmented.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Noelani. You're doing just fine. It's common to not have all the details about family history. Knowing your father had heart trouble is good to know, thank you. Let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. And I very rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with a special meal, but that’s it. And recreational drugs? Goodness, no. I've always been very careful about my health, or at least, I try to be. I eat a fairly balanced diet, mostly fruits and vegetables. And I try to get regular exercise, even though the work keeps me busy enough! I apologize for rambling, Doctor. Is this information helpful?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, thank you. Knowing you’re a non-smoker, rarely drink, and maintain a fairly healthy lifestyle is good. Now, just to cover all bases, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me see. I don't think so. I've never had a serious allergic reaction, as far as I recall. I'm slightly sensitive to certain perfumes, they sometimes give me a headache, but that’s it. No known allergies to foods or medications, no. I’ve taken over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches occasionally, ibuprofen and acetaminophen, and those haven’t caused any problems. I’m reasonably sure of that, at least. It’s just… remembering everything precisely is proving to be a challenge.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, a slight sensitivity to perfumes… That’s good to know. And you’ve taken ibuprofen and acetaminophen without issue. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh, yes! I take a low-dose aspirin every day, prescribed by my doctor after a… scare, I think. Something about my blood pressure. And I take a multivitamin occasionally, mostly when I remember. It's nothing regular, though. Just when I feel like I need a little extra boost. I'm terribly sorry I can't be more precise, Doctor. My memory is simply not what it used to be. Would my records list the aspirin?
DOCTOR: Yes, it looks like you've been prescribed low-dose aspirin for cardiovascular prevention. That’s listed here. Okay. Now, let’s move on to a physical examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly sensible. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement completely. Please, proceed. I apologize if I seem a bit… flustered. It’s all a little overwhelming, to be honest. I simply want to get to the bottom of this discomfort.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Noelani. It's perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed. Okay, I’m listening to your heart now. Sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, breathing evenly. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness in the upper quadrants. Hmm... a little bit of mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, on the left side. Not sharp, just a bit sensitive to the touch. No masses detected, organs feel normal in size. Pulses are strong and equal in all extremities. Blood pressure is 130/80. Within normal limits. Now, I’m going to do a quick neurological exam, just to assess your reflexes and coordination. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… prudent. Please, proceed. I apologize if I seem nervous. It’s just… the uncertainty of it all. I appreciate you being so thorough. And I understand the importance of checking everything, even if it seems… insignificant. Please, don't hesitate to let me know if you notice anything unusual. I trust your expertise completely.
DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani. No need to apologize at all, I understand. Reflexes are normal, equal on both sides. Coordination is good, no difficulty with fine motor skills. Gait is stable, no noticeable abnormalities. Okay, everything seems relatively normal, but the mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, along with your fatigue and discomfort, is something we need to investigate further. Based on your symptoms and my initial examination, it could be a number of things, but muscle strain, a mild urinary tract infection, or even early signs of diverticulitis are possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some lab tests, including a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and a stool sample to rule out infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… excellent. Whatever tests you deem necessary, I'm happy to comply. I just want to know what’s causing this discomfort, and to get it addressed as soon as possible. Complete blood count, urinalysis, stool sample… yes, absolutely. Please, don’t hesitate to order whatever you need. And… will I need to schedule another appointment to discuss the results? I apologize for asking, but I’m a little concerned about keeping track of everything.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Noelani. I understand your concern about keeping track of everything. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for about a week from now to discuss the results. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a requisition for the lab tests. Here you go. The lab is just down the hall. They'll likely need a stool sample, so please ask them for the container and instructions. Once you've completed the tests, they'll send the results to me directly. While we wait for the results, I recommend getting plenty of rest, drinking plenty of fluids, and avoiding any strenuous activity that exacerbates your discomfort. If you experience a fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your urine or stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very thorough. No… I think that covers everything for now. Just… the emergency room… if those symptoms appear. I’ll remember that. I apologize for being such a worry. And… just one small thing. Could you… perhaps send the results to my doctor’s office as well? I don’t recall the name at the moment, but it might be helpful for their records. And… I’m terribly sorry, but I’m afraid I’m not very good at remembering details. Is that alright? I'll try to recall the name before I leave, if possible.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Noelani. Sending the results to your primary care physician is absolutely fine. We can add that to the request. Don't worry about remembering the name now, we can follow up later. Okay, everything is set. Just rest, hydrate, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your patience and kindness. You’ve been very… reassuring. I appreciate your thoroughness and your willingness to listen. I truly do. I suppose… I’ll just head to the lab now. Thank you again, Doctor Maskal. I feel… much better knowing I’m being taken care of. And… thank you for being so understanding. It’s difficult to explain how much I appreciate it. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Noelani. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything changes before your appointment. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you next week. .
