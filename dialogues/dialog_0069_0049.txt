DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Schneer’s the name. It’s… well, it’s my ears, I think. They just ain't what they used to be, ya know? I have trouble hearin’ folks sometimes. It’s been gettin’ worse, I reckon. Not sure when it started, exactly… seems like a long while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schneer, I understand. Trouble hearing that’s been getting worse over time. That's a common concern, and we can definitely look into that. When you say you have trouble hearing, can you tell me a little more specifically what kind of trouble?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not like I can’t hear nothin’, ya know? It’s just… muffled, sometimes. And high-pitched sounds… those are the hardest. Like, if a young’un’s laughin’, I gotta ask ‘em to speak up. Or the telly… I have to turn it up pretty loud, and even then it's not always clear. Especially women’s voices...they seem to get lost. I don't know why that is. It's just… hard to follow a conversation sometimes, especially when there’s noise around. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Schneer. So, it sounds like the sounds are distorted, especially higher-pitched ones, and it’s harder to hear women's voices and in noisy environments. That gives me a good starting point. Have you noticed this happening gradually, or was there a specific event that you can recall when it started to become more noticeable?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question… lemme think now. Gradual, I reckon. It didn't just happen one day. It was more… a slow fade, ya know? I used to work in a shoe factory, a long time ago. Lots of noise there, machinery hummin’ and clatterin’ all day long. Maybe that had somethin’ to do with it? I don't rightly recall when it got bad enough to bother me though. It’s all a bit blurry, to be honest. My memory ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gradual onset, potentially linked to noise exposure at the shoe factory. That's helpful information. And it's perfectly normal for memory to change over time. We'll take things at your pace. Aside from the difficulty hearing, have you experienced any other symptoms, such as ringing in your ears, dizziness, or a feeling of fullness or pressure in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… now, that’s a thought. Sometimes, yeah. A sort of… high-pitched whine. Not all the time, mind ya. Mostly when it's quiet, I suppose. Like at night, when I’m tryin’ to sleep. It doesn't last long, usually. And no dizziness, no. And my ears don’t feel… full, or pressured, no. Just… quiet. Too quiet, if you ask me. But the ringin’, yeah, I get that sometimes. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent ringing in your ears, especially at night. That’s known as tinnitus, and it's a common symptom associated with hearing loss. It doesn’t always mean there’s something serious wrong, but it's good to be aware of. Now, let’s talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I got high blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a little pill for it every day. And my knees… they ain't what they used to be, ya know? Arthritis, they say. Other than that… not much. I’m pretty healthy for an old fella, I reckon. I used to walk a lot, but the knees… they make it harder now. And I've been meaning to get my cholesterol checked, but haven't gotten around to it. Does that help? I'm afraid I don't recall everything... my daughter usually keeps track of these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Mr. Schneer. High blood pressure managed with medication, and arthritis in your knees. And you mentioned wanting to get your cholesterol checked – good to be aware of that. It’s perfectly fine that your daughter helps keep track of things. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one for the blood pressure, as far as I remember. Sometimes I take a little somethin' for my knees when they're really botherin' me, some sort of pain reliever, but not every day. It’s… Ibuprofen, I think? The little blue pills. My daughter gets ‘em for me. I don’t really keep track of these things myself, ya see. It all gets a bit confusing. Is it alright if I ask her to bring a list of my medications next time? I wouldn’t want to forget somethin' important.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schneer. That's a great idea. Having your daughter bring a list of your medications next time would be very helpful. No need to worry about forgetting things; that's what we're here for. Now, before we move on, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or latex?
PATIENT: Allergies… let me think now. Not that I know of. Never had a problem with food, nothin' like that. And I don't recall ever being allergic to anything at the doctor's office, or nothin' like that. Used to get shots when I was a kid, and never had a reaction. So, no, I don't think I have any allergies. But, I suppose I could be wrong. My mind just doesn’t hold onto things like that anymore. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schneer. No known allergies is good to know. We can always ask again later if anything changes. Now, I’d like to do a quick examination of your ears to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever ya need to do. I trust your judgment. Just tell me if it’s gonna be uncomfortable, alright? My ears are a bit sensitive these days. I'm gettin' old, ya know! Go ahead, then. I'll just sit here and try not to fidget.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schneer. I'll be as gentle as possible. I'm just going to use an otoscope to look inside your ears. It doesn't usually cause any discomfort, but let me know if you feel anything. Alright, Mr. Schneer. I see a little bit of wax buildup in both ears, which could be contributing to the muffled hearing. The eardrums themselves appear intact, but a little dull. It’s hard to say for sure without a hearing test. Do you feel any pain when I gently tug on your earlobes?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all, Doctor. Just a little pullin', that’s all. Not uncomfortable, nothin' like that. I used to get my ears pierced when I was a young man, but I took the earrings out years ago. They weren’t for me, ya see. But no pain, just a little tug. Is that wax somethin' serious? Could that be what's makin' it hard to hear? I get kinda worried sometimes, ya know. My wife… she used to take care of all this, but she’s been gone a long time. It all gets a bit much sometimes.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Schneer, no pain is good. The wax buildup is very common, especially as we get older. It can definitely contribute to muffled hearing, and sometimes it can even cause ringing in the ears. It’s likely a significant part of the problem, but we need to rule out other causes. To get a better understanding of your hearing, I’d like to order a hearing test, also called an audiogram. This will help us determine the extent and type of hearing loss. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A hearin’ test, eh? Sounds sensible, Doctor. If that’s what ya think is best. I trust your judgment. I don’t mind a bit of poking and proddin’ if it’ll help me hear better. I just wanna be able to hear my grandkids when they come to visit, ya see. They talk so fast these days! So, yes, go ahead with the test. When can we do it? I'm pretty flexible, but I got a bingo night on Thursdays… don’t wanna miss that!
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Schneer. That's a wonderful reason to want to improve your hearing. We can schedule the hearing test for Tuesday morning at 9:00 AM. That gives us plenty of time, and avoids your bingo night. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday mornin’ at nine… that sounds perfect, Doctor! No bingo that day, so I’m free as a bird. Nine o’clock it is, then. Just tell me where to go, and I’ll be there. And thank ya for takin’ the time to listen to an old fella like me. It means a lot, ya know. My wife… she always took care of these things, but she’s been gone a long time. It’s nice to have someone explain things so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It’s my pleasure. We’ll get you checked out and see what we can do to help. The audiology department is just down the hall to your left – room 203. Just let the receptionist know you’re here for a hearing test scheduled by Dr. Andraca, and they’ll take care of everything. I’ll see you on Tuesday. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your hearing, or develop any pain or dizziness, please don’t hesitate to call the office.
