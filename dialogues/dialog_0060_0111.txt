DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the foggiest idea why I’m here. My wife insisted. Something about my… complexion, she said. And feeling tired, I suppose. It's all rather bothersome, wasting my time like this. I have work to do, you know. Reinforcing iron doesn't build itself.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's good that your wife is looking out for you. Even if you don't think there's a problem, it's always best to get things checked out. "Complexion" and "tiredness" can mean a lot of different things. Let's start with the tiredness. How long have you been feeling unusually tired, and can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. Years, probably. It's just… old age, Doctor. I’m eighty-five years old! What do you expect? It’s not like I bounce around like a young colt anymore. I just… don't have the energy I used to. It's tiring, getting out of bed, tiring doing the work… everything is tiring! Is that specific enough for you? Frankly, I don't see what good all this questioning is going to do.
DOCTOR: I understand you feel it’s just age, Mr. Drahota, and that’s certainly a possibility. But fatigue can also be a symptom of other things – things we can address. And dismissing it as simply “old age” isn’t good enough medical practice. Now, you mentioned getting out of bed is tiring. Is it difficult to get out of bed, or just that you feel drained after you get up?
PATIENT: Difficult, drained… what difference does it make? It’s both! It’s hard to pull myself up, and then I feel absolutely depleted. Like all the strength has been sucked out of me. Really, Doctor, I've been doing this job for sixty years. I've always been a bit… worn down. It's the nature of the beast, you know? Heavy lifting, hot sun… don’t tell me I’m supposed to feel spry at my age. It's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I'm not suggesting you should feel “spry,” Mr. Drahota. But significant fatigue, coupled with difficulty getting out of bed, warrants investigation. It’s not simply about feeling good; it could indicate something underlying that’s affecting your quality of life. Let's talk about your appetite. Has that changed recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Hmm… I eat. My wife makes sure of it. She's quite insistent on three square meals a day. I suppose it's… normal. Not less, not more. I don’t fuss over food, never have. It’s fuel, Doctor, nothing more. Why are you asking me about food? Are we diagnosing my dinner habits now? This is rather pointless, you know.
DOCTOR: Changes in appetite, even if you’re still eating “normal” amounts, can be telling. It’s just another piece of the puzzle, Mr. Drahota. Now, have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Oh, for goodness sake. I haven't been weighing myself, Doctor. What would be the point? I wear the same trousers, more or less. Perhaps a little looser… but that's probably just the wife's washing shrinking them. Honestly, I haven't the foggiest. This is all so… intrusive. Are you suggesting I’m wasting away? My wife would never let that happen. She's a very capable woman. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. Given your reluctance to provide specifics, and your wife’s involvement in your care, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. It's standard practice. Then, I'm going to order some blood work. It will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. We’ll check your heart and lungs, and I'll take a look at you overall. Is that alright?
