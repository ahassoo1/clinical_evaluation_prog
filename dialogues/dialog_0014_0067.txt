DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ruocco. Welcome. I'm Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's… this pain. When I breathe deep, it hurts. It's been… a little while now, I think. Hard to say exactly how long, you know? My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Right, pain with deep breathing. It's… common, at your age. And I understand memory can be tricky. “A little while now” isn’t terribly helpful, unfortunately. Can you try to give me a ballpark?
PATIENT: Ballpark… hmm. Maybe… a few months? Or was it longer? I did some work, construction, you see. Heavy lifting. Maybe it started then? It’s… dull mostly. Not sharp. And it feels… in my chest, I guess. Not all the time, just when I really take a breath.
DOCTOR: Construction work… okay. Dull chest pain with deep breaths, a few months duration. Is it worse with any particular activity, besides the deep breathing?
PATIENT: Well… climbing stairs is hard now, always has been since I got older. But the pain… no, I don’t think it's worse with stairs. It's just… everything gets harder. Coughing makes it a little worse, maybe. Not a bad cough, just… you know, an old man's cough.
DOCTOR: An old man's cough… right. And do you have any other symptoms along with this pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I get tired easier, that’s for sure. And… sometimes my ankles swell up a bit, especially at the end of the day. But… I’ve always had that.
DOCTOR: Swollen ankles… alright. And when you say “tired easier,” can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Just… worn out, you know? I used to be able to work all day, no problem. Now I need to sit down a lot. Can’t do like I used to. Just getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, we need to rule a few things out. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’d like to check your ankles. Then we'll get a chest X-ray to have a look. Do you have any allergies to medication?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. I haven't taken much medicine in years, honestly. Just some stuff for… aches and pains. Oh, wait. Something once. A rash. But I don't remember what it was for. Long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible allergy, undocumented. Let’s just proceed cautiously then. Okay, if you could sit back, please. I'm going to listen to your breathing now. Please take slow, deep breaths for me.
PATIENT: Okay, doctor. Slow breaths. Like this? I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. It's a bit unsettling, being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Alright. Breathing sounds… a little diminished on both sides, some mild wheezing. Heart sounds… regular rhythm, a slight murmur. Not overly concerning at this stage. Now, let me take a look at those ankles. Could you please extend your legs?
PATIENT: Okay, doctor. Here they are. Always puff up like that by evening, you know? Doesn’t really bother me, mostly just… ugly.
DOCTOR: Yes, significant edema. Alright, Mr. Ruocco. Given your history, the chest pain, the swelling, and the diminished breathing sounds, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work. The blood work will check your kidney function and rule out any infection. The X-ray will help us see what's going on in your lungs. Do you understand?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood work… Sounds serious. Will it hurt? And how long will it take? I don’t like hospitals… or doctors poking around.
DOCTOR: The X-ray won't hurt, Mr. Ruocco. You'll just stand still for a few moments while the machine takes a picture. The blood work is just a small needle prick. It will be quick. We can get this all done here in the clinic, you won't have to go to the hospital. It will take a few days to get the results back. We’ll call you as soon as we know something. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A few days… that's okay, I suppose. Better than going to the hospital. Quick needle prick… Alright. Let’s get it over with. But you'll call me? Don’t forget. My memory… you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Ruocco. We’ll definitely call you. I'll make a note in your chart to remind us specifically. Now, let me have the nurse draw those blood samples, and then we'll get you over to X-ray. It's just routine, okay?
PATIENT: Routine… alright. Thank you, doctor. I just want to know what’s wrong. Being in the dark is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Ruocco. We will get to the bottom of it, I promise. I'll be in touch as soon as the results come back, and we can discuss them thoroughly. Just let me call the nurse now to get started.
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Let's get it done.
