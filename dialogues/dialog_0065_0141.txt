DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this itching, really. It’s all over, and it’s been going on for a couple weeks now, maybe a little longer. It’s just… annoying, you know? Drives me a bit mad, actually.
DOCTOR: "Annoying" is… not a particularly helpful description, Mr. Ferneding. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Right, sorry. You’re right. Specific… okay. It's not like a rash, there are no bumps or anything. Just… the skin feels like it needs scratching all the time. It's everywhere – arms, legs, back, even my stomach. And it doesn’t really seem to matter what I’m wearing, or if I’ve been inside or outside. It’s just… there. Does that make more sense? It's not painful, just… intensely itchy.
DOCTOR: Slightly. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I can recall. I haven’t changed soaps or detergents. I haven’t been travelling. My diet’s the same… mostly. I’ve been eating a bit more fruit, maybe? Peaches, mostly. But I've been eating peaches for years, so I doubt that’s it. My wife… well, she passed away six months ago, so things are… different, generally. But I don’t know if that would cause an itch, you know? Just… a lot to think about.
DOCTOR: “Different” can certainly manifest physically, Mr. Ferneding, though we wouldn’t immediately attribute it to itching. Let’s try to rule out more straightforward causes. Have you noticed this itching being worse at any particular time of day?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… yes, actually. It seems to be worse in the evenings. Like, when I’m trying to relax and watch TV, it really flares up. During the day, when I'm busy, I don't notice it as much. It’s weird, really. Distraction, maybe? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this itching?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no fatigue, no weight loss… nothing like that. My appetite’s been a little off, but honestly, that's probably just… everything. I sleep okay, although I wake up a few times a night, but that’s normal for me. Really, it’s just the itch. It’s frustrating because it’s just the itch. Everything else feels… normal, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: "Normal" is subjective, Mr. Ferneding. We need to be precise. Let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions – diabetes, kidney disease, liver problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years. And just… a bad back, from years of lifting things. But that's it. Never been hospitalized for anything serious, never had any major surgeries… I was always a pretty healthy guy, up until… well, up until recently.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: Just the Lisinopril for the blood pressure. Twenty milligrams, once a day. And… sometimes I take an over-the-counter sleep aid if I’m really having trouble. Melatonin, I think it’s called. But not every night. Maybe once or twice a week. Nothing else, I promise.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten pretty much everything, and never had a reaction. No bee stings, no rashes, nothing like that. My wife always said I had an iron stomach, though I suppose that doesn’t mean much, does it?
DOCTOR: It confirms you haven’t experienced allergic reactions, Mr. Ferneding. Now, family history. Are there any skin conditions – eczema, psoriasis, anything like that – that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had… dry skin, I guess. Always complained about it, especially in the winter. But nothing serious, no big rashes or anything. My father… he was pretty healthy too, actually. I don’t recall anyone having anything like eczema or psoriasis on either side of the family, to be honest. We weren’t really the type to talk about medical things much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Please lie down on the examination table. I need to take a look at your skin.
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go. It’s a bit cold, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: I’m noting diffuse, normal skin tone with no visible rash, lesions, or excoriations. There’s no edema or palpable induration. Capillary refill is within normal limits. No significant findings on the trunk or chest. Skin turgor is within normal limits. No jaundice appreciated. Exam unremarkable. No objective evidence of dermatological pathology.
PATIENT: So… what does that mean? Is it… in my head? I know it sounds silly, but it’s really bothering me.
DOCTOR: It means, Mr. Ferneding, that we have not identified a clear physical cause for your pruritus. However, that does not invalidate your experience. Several factors can cause unexplained itching, including neuropathic processes, psychogenic factors, or even early stages of certain systemic conditions. Given your recent loss, and the absence of any dermatological findings, a psychogenic component is certainly plausible. I recommend a trial of emollients to address potential dryness, and suggest we monitor your symptoms closely for any changes. If the itching persists or worsens, we may consider referral to a dermatologist or a mental health professional.
PATIENT: So… lotion? And… maybe talk to someone? I guess that makes sense. It’s just… I feel like I’m going crazy, you know? It’s just… itchy. I really thought there would be something… wrong. A rash, or something visible. Lotion… Okay. I’ll try the lotion. And… I’ll think about… talking to someone. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. I'm prescribing a hypoallergenic emollient – CeraVe Moisturizing Cream. Apply liberally twice daily, especially after bathing. If there is no improvement within two weeks, or if new symptoms develop, please schedule a follow-up appointment. And do not dismiss the possibility of addressing the emotional component of your discomfort, Mr. Ferneding. It is a valid consideration. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you listening, even if you couldn't find anything "wrong". It's just… hard, you know? Everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Take care, Mr. Ferneding. .
