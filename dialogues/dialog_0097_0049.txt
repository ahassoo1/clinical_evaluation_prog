DOCTOR: Good morning, Betty! It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor… Georgiou, is it? Yes, well… it’s me ears, I think. They ain’t what they used to be, that’s for sure. Folks been tellin’ me I gotta get ‘em looked at. I mostly just… don’t hear things as clear as I once did. It's been goin' on a while now, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Betty, that’s perfectly alright. It's very common for hearing to change as we get older, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. “A while now” is a bit vague – can you tell me roughly how long you’ve been noticing this difficulty?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… how long? It’s… hard to say, really. A few years, maybe? It came on slow-like. Not all at once, ya know? I used to hear the birds singin’ real clear out back, and now… well, I don’t recall when I stopped hearin’ ‘em so good. It’s just… faded, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, "faded over a few years" is helpful. And is it both ears, or is it worse in one than the other?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… I think it’s the left one. The right one’s still alright, mostly. I can hear folks talkin’ to me on that side just fine. It’s the left that gets muffled. Sometimes I gotta ask ‘em to speak up, or I just… miss what they say altogether.
DOCTOR: Alright, so more trouble in the left ear, with some difficulty understanding things. Do you notice this more in quiet places, or is it worse when there’s background noise?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, the noise! That makes it much worse, Doctor. When it’s quiet, I can usually get by. But if there’s a TV on, or folks talkin’ at the same time… forget about it. It all just… blends together. Makes it real hard to follow a conversation, ya know? Especially at the church social, bless their hearts. So much chatter!
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Background noise can definitely make things harder when there’s already some hearing loss. Have you noticed any ringing, buzzing, or other sounds in your ears at all?
PATIENT: Ringing…? Now that is a good question… I… think so? Sometimes, late at night, when it's real quiet… I get a sort of… hummin’ sound. Not a loud ringin’, more like… a faint buzz. It doesn't bother me too much, mostly just notice it when I'm tryin' to fall asleep. It comes and goes, ya know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a faint humming sound that comes and goes, mostly at night. That’s good to know. Now, have you ever been exposed to a lot of loud noises – at work, perhaps, or as a hobby?
PATIENT: Loud noises… Well, I worked in the shoe factory for… oh, goodness, nearly forty years. Lots of machines, clatterin' and whirrin’ all day long. Never thought much about it at the time, ya know? Just part of the job. We all wore earplugs sometimes, but… not always. And I did enjoy a good polka band back in my younger days. They were loud, alright. But nothin’ too terrible, I don’t reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of noise exposure with the shoe factory and polka band. That’s helpful. Now, just to get a full picture, have you had any problems with dizziness, balance issues, or ear pain recently?
PATIENT: Dizziness… Now and then, I get a little lightheaded when I stand up too fast. But I just figured that was my age, ya know? Old bones creakin’. And no, no ear pain, thankfully. Never had much trouble with pain in my ears. Just the hearin’ gettin’ worse, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no ear pain, occasional lightheadedness. Now, Betty, I'd like to take a quick look in your ears with an otoscope, and then we’ll do a simple hearing test to see what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it’s gonna be uncomfortable. My ears are a little sensitive, ya know? But I’m not afraid. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, Betty, I’m just going to take a quick look in each ear. This might be a little chilly. Alright, I see a little bit of wax build-up in both ears, but nothing too concerning. Your ear canals look healthy. Now, we'll do a quick hearing test to get a better understanding of how well you're hearing different tones. I'm going to have you wear these headphones, and you'll raise your hand when you hear a beep. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Beeps, huh? Alright, sounds simple enough. Headphones are fine. Just tell me what to do, Doctor, and I'll do my best. I'm not very good with fancy machines, ya know. But I can raise my hand. That I can do.
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright, Betty. No need to worry about fancy machines at all. I'll be right here, and I'll explain everything as we go. Okay, Betty, we’ll start with your right ear. I’m going to play a series of tones at different pitches and volumes. Just raise your hand whenever you hear a sound, even if it’s very faint. … Okay, good. That one. And that one. Hmm, a little weaker on the… 2000 Hz tone. And 4000 Hz… fainter still. Alright, let’s move on to the left ear now… Okay, Betty, the results show some hearing loss in both ears, as we suspected. It’s more pronounced in the higher frequencies, and a bit worse in the left ear, which is consistent with what you’ve been describing. There’s a mild to moderate high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss bilaterally, with slightly greater severity on the left. It appears to be age-related, potentially exacerbated by the noise exposure in the factory.
PATIENT: High-frequency… sensorineural… bilateral…? Oh, goodness. That sounds… complicated, Doctor. What does that mean, exactly? And… is it bad? Will I go deaf? I mostly just wanna hear the grandkids when they come to visit, ya know?
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly reasonable question, Betty, and it's important you understand what's going on. “High-frequency” means you’re having trouble hearing higher-pitched sounds – like birds chirping or the ‘s’ sounds in speech. “Sensorineural” means the hearing loss is in the inner ear or the nerve that carries sound to the brain. It’s not something we can fix with medication or surgery, unfortunately. And “bilateral” simply means it’s in both ears. It's not likely you'll go completely deaf, Betty. Based on these results, it’s a mild to moderate loss. It means you'll likely continue to have difficulty hearing in certain situations, like noisy environments or with higher-pitched sounds. But we can definitely do something to help you hear better. The most common solution is a hearing aid. It wouldn't restore your hearing to what it once was, but it can amplify sounds and make it much easier to communicate. Would you be interested in discussing that further?
PATIENT: Hearing aids… hmm. Well, I always thought those were for… older folks. But if it'll help me hear the grandkids… and maybe catch a bit more of the church service… then yes, Doctor, I’d be very interested. What are they like these days? Are they big and clunky? And… do they cost a fortune? I’m on a fixed income, ya know.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Betty. Hearing aids have come a long way in recent years. They're much smaller and more discreet than they used to be – most are worn inside the ear canal now, or behind the ear. They’re also much more sophisticated, with features like noise cancellation and automatic volume adjustment. As for the cost… yes, they can be expensive. But Medicare does offer some coverage for diagnostic hearing tests, and many insurance plans will cover a portion of the cost of hearing aids. We work with several different manufacturers and have options to fit a variety of budgets. I can schedule you for a comprehensive hearing aid evaluation with our audiologist, Sarah Miller. She can assess your specific needs and recommend the best options for you. She’ll also explain the costs and financing options available. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Sarah Miller, you say? A comprehensive evaluation… yes, that sounds good. I trust your judgement, Doctor. If she can help me hear a little better… well, that would be a blessing. And explaining the costs… that’s very kind of you. I don’t want any surprises, ya know? Yes, let’s schedule that evaluation. When is Sarah available? And… how long does it usually take? I don't wanna be gone all day.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Betty. Sarah is available next Tuesday afternoon at 2:00 PM, or Thursday morning at 10:00 AM. The evaluation usually takes about an hour – she’ll do some further testing, discuss your hearing loss in more detail, and then talk about the different hearing aid options. I’ll have my nurse, Emily, schedule that appointment for you before you leave. She’ll also give you some information about hearing aids and what to expect during the evaluation. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask. Is there anything else I can address for you today, Betty?
PATIENT: Tuesday afternoon… yes, that sounds alright. 2:00 PM is fine. And Emily will explain everything? That’s good. I appreciate you takin’ the time, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old lady like me. No, I think that’s all for now. Just… lookin’ forward to hearin’ better. Thank you kindly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Betty. It was my pleasure. Emily will be right in to schedule your appointment. And remember, it’s never too late to address hearing loss. We’re here to help you every step of the way. Have a wonderful day, and I’ll see you again soon.
PATIENT: .
