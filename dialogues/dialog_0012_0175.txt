DOCTOR: Hi Michae, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, it’s this pain, you see. It’s been bothering me for a little while now. It’s mostly in my… well, it’s hard to say exactly where, but it feels like it’s deep inside.
DOCTOR: Okay, “deep inside.” That's a good start. Can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, really. It comes and goes, but it’s been pretty consistent lately. It doesn’t really seem to get worse with anything specific… maybe a little when I’ve been on my feet all day, but not always. It just… is there.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache that comes and goes, and doesn’t seem to be strongly linked to any particular activity, but possibly a bit worse when you’re on your feet. That gives me a little something to work with. When you say “lately,” about how long has it been consistent like this?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. Let me see… probably about a month, maybe a little longer? It started off just now and then, like a little twinge, and then it just… stayed. It hasn’t gotten worse worse, thankfully, just… consistently there. My wife keeps telling me to come in, she says I wait too long to see the doctor.
DOCTOR: It's good you finally came in, and smart of your wife to encourage you! A month of consistent pain is definitely worth checking out. Okay, so it’s been about a month. Does anything help the pain at all?
PATIENT: Well, not really, to be honest. I’ve tried a few things. I tried some of those over-the-counter pain relievers, you know, the ibuprofen and stuff, but they don’t seem to do much. And I’ve tried resting it, but like I said, it doesn’t really seem to be a “use it or lose it” kind of thing. Just… always there. Sometimes a warm bath helps a little, but just for a little while.
DOCTOR: Okay, so over-the-counter pain relievers haven’t been effective, and warm baths give you temporary relief. Got it. Now, when you say “deep inside,” can you be a little more specific about where you’re feeling it?
PATIENT: That’s the tricky part! It’s… hard to pinpoint. It’s kind of in my lower abdomen, but not right on the surface. More… back there, you know? Like, deep in my belly. It’s not in my back, though. And it doesn’t really go up into my chest. It’s just… in that general area. Sorry, I’m not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright! It can be difficult to describe pain. Lower abdomen, deep inside, not on the surface… Okay. And has this pain been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I haven’t had any fever or anything like that. No nausea, no changes in my… bathroom habits, if you know what I mean. I’ve been eating normally, sleeping okay. Just the pain, really. It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no nausea, no changes in bowel habits, normal appetite and sleep… just the pain. That's helpful. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that's alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Let me see… well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but they got that under control with medication a few years back. Other than that… not much. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. Nothing major, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, and an appendectomy as a child. Do you remember what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. You’re asking a lot! Let me think… it’s a little white pill… I get it filled at the pharmacy every month. I… honestly, I don’t really pay attention to the name. My wife handles all that stuff. I just know to take one every day. Sorry, I’m not very good with names and stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, no problem at all. We can look it up in the pharmacy records if you're comfortable with that. Let's hold off on that for now. Okay, so one medication for blood pressure, name unknown. Have you ever had any surgeries besides your appendectomy?
PATIENT: No, just the appendix when I was a kid. I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. No broken bones or anything like that. Mostly just aches and pains from getting old, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no other surgeries. And how about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history… Well, my father had diabetes. And my mother… she had some kind of heart trouble, I think. Not sure exactly what. And my brother, he had high blood pressure too, like me. Nothing else that I can really think of, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your father, heart trouble in your mother, and high blood pressure in your brother. And finally, let me ask about your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. And I don't drink much alcohol, either. Maybe a beer every now and then with dinner, but that’s about it. Nothing regular. I try to stay healthy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, very minimal alcohol use. Alright, Michae, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll gently feel your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels painful during the exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Just let me know if I need to tell you anything. I’m ready when you are, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm pressing gently here. Do you feel any pain in any particular spot?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, not really. A little tender there, on the lower right side, but nothing major. It’s kind of the same area where the pain usually is, but it doesn’t hurt any worse when you press on it. It’s just… a little sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, some tenderness in the lower right abdomen. No guarding or rebound tenderness, which is good. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses. Alright, Michae, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it's difficult to say exactly what's causing your pain. It could be a number of things, such as muscle strain, constipation, or even something a bit more involved like diverticulitis. Given your age and the location of the pain, I think it's best to rule out anything serious with some imaging. Would you be open to getting a CT scan of your abdomen?
PATIENT: A CT scan… Oh, geez. Is that going to be expensive? I don’t have insurance, you know. I wasn’t really planning on anything like that. But… if it’s to make sure it’s nothing serious, I guess I have no choice. What are we looking for exactly?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Michae, and we can definitely discuss options to help minimize that. The hospital does offer financial assistance programs, and we can explore those. As for what we’re looking for, a CT scan will give us a detailed picture of your abdomen and help us rule out things like appendicitis, diverticulitis, kidney stones, or any other abnormalities that might be causing your pain. It’s really the best way to get a clear diagnosis. Would you like me to have someone from the billing department speak with you about the costs and potential assistance programs?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be a big help. I really appreciate that. I’m just worried about getting a big bill I can’t afford. I’ve been trying to save up for a trip to see my grandkids, you know? But… getting this figured out is important too.
DOCTOR: Of course, Michae. I understand. Let me write a referral for the CT scan and I'll have the billing department reach out to you right away. They can discuss the costs and any available assistance programs. In the meantime, I'm going to give you a stool softener to help with any potential constipation, just in case. And if the pain gets significantly worse, develops a fever, or you experience any nausea or vomiting, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. A stool softener sounds helpful. And I will definitely go to the emergency room if things get worse. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, even if it’s a little scary thinking about all this.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Michae. It’s always best to be cautious and get things checked out. I'm going to write everything down for you, including the referral for the CT scan, the stool softener prescription, and the instructions about when to go to the emergency room. I'll also have the billing department contact you as soon as possible. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough. Thank you again, Doctor Yoshino. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Michae. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get you scheduled for that CT scan as soon as possible. Take care, and I hope you feel better soon.
