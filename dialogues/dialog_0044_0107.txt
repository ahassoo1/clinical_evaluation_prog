DOCTOR: Good morning, Philipp. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, my heart… it feels like it’s flapping sometimes. Not always, but… when it happens, it’s like a bird in my chest. It’s… worrying me. My wife, she told me to come see you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Philipp, that sounds unsettling, definitely worth checking out. “Flapping,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… fast. Not strong, just… fast and quick. It stops after a little bit, maybe a minute or two. But it makes me feel… shaky. Like I need to sit down. It happened again just yesterday when I was at work.
DOCTOR: Alright, that gives me a little more to work with. When it happens, are you doing anything specific?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. I was… fixing a pump. A big pump for chemicals. It’s my job. I lift things, walk around… sometimes it’s hot. But it doesn’t always happen at work. Once, it happened when I was just sitting and watching TV. It just… starts.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be somewhat random. Have you noticed anything that makes it more likely to happen?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I drink coffee, maybe two cups in the morning. But I always drink coffee. And I try to sleep okay, but work… sometimes I’m tired. But I don’t think that’s it. It just happens. I don’t know. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. And has this been happening for a long time, or is this a new thing?
PATIENT: It's… new-ish. Maybe… six months now? At first it was not so often. Once a month, maybe. But now it’s… more like once a week, sometimes two times. It worries my wife a lot. She says I need to get it checked.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months, and increasing in frequency. And you mentioned your wife is concerned, which is good – it’s always good to have someone looking out for you. Have you had any other symptoms along with this “flapping” – things like dizziness, shortness of breath, chest pain, or feeling faint?
PATIENT: No pain, Doctor. No. Sometimes I feel… a little weak when it happens. Like my legs might give out. And maybe… a little bit dizzy. Not falling down dizzy, just… the room spins a little. No shortness of breath, though. I can still breathe okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, so weakness and mild dizziness along with the palpitations. And just to be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I have never been sick, really. Just… a cold sometimes. I go to work, I eat food, I sleep. I don’t go to the doctor often. This is… new for me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Philipp. That’s good to know. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don't take anything. Just… coffee. My wife says I should take vitamins, but I haven't yet. I’m a simple man. I eat rice, I drink water, I go to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No medications to worry about. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Um… my father, he had… problems with his stomach, I think. He needed… operations. But I don’t know about heart problems. My mother… she was healthy. She lived a long time. I don't remember anyone in my family having… this heart thing. It's hard to say, really. We don’t talk about these things much.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. Now, just a couple of quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No smoking. No drinking. No… drugs. Never. I don't like those things. My wife would be very angry! I just work, and I try to be a good husband. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. That’s all very helpful information, Philipp. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just get a general sense of how you’re doing. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds okay. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… tell me if it’s something bad.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this. It will be cold, but it won’t hurt. Try to relax and breathe normally. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Now another one… and exhale. Okay, deep breath… and exhale. Again… and exhale. Alright, blood pressure is 130 over 80. Heart sounds are a little… rapid, but no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear. I also feel your pulse… it’s a little fast and a bit irregular. It's good that your lungs are clear, and no murmurs were detected. However, the increased heart rate and irregularity warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Okay. Irregular? What does that mean, Doctor? Is it… bad? My wife… she will worry a lot if I say something is wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, Philipp, let's not jump to conclusions. “Irregular” just means that the rhythm of your heartbeat isn’t perfectly even. It doesn’t automatically mean something serious is wrong. It could be a number of things – stress, dehydration, too much caffeine, or something a little more involved. To get a better idea of what's going on, I'd like to order an EKG – that’s an electrocardiogram. It’s a simple test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn't hurt at all – they just put some stickers on your chest. We can also do a blood test to check your electrolytes, thyroid function, and rule out any other underlying issues. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Stickers… that sounds okay. Blood test… okay. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what is wrong. My wife… she always says I need to listen to the doctor. So, I will do what you say. When can we do these tests?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Philipp. I'm glad you're willing to get these tests done. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. We can do the EKG right here in the office, it will only take a few minutes. While we’re waiting for the results, and just to be cautious, I'm going to recommend you limit your caffeine intake for now. And if you experience any chest pain, severe dizziness, or shortness of breath, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. No more coffee. And… emergency room if I feel bad. I understand. Is it… is it my heart, Doctor? Is that what you think? Could it be something serious? My wife… she’s been saying… she’s very worried about my heart.
DOCTOR: Philipp, it’s good that your wife is paying attention, and it’s smart of you to come in and get this checked out. Right now, it's too early to say definitively what’s going on. These tests will help us rule out potential causes and get a clearer picture. It could be something related to your heart, but it could also be something else entirely. We need to gather more information before we can make any conclusions. Jumping to worst-case scenarios won’t help anyone. Let’s focus on getting these tests done and then we can discuss the results and come up with a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. You are right. No jumping. Tests… then plan. That sounds better. Thank you, Doctor. For not… scaring me. My wife will be so relieved to hear you are not… worried yet. I just… I want to go back to work. I like my job. But I don't want to… fall down at work.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Philipp. I understand. It’s good to know what's going on so you can continue to do the things you enjoy. We’ll do our best to get you some answers quickly. The nurse should be in shortly to get started with the blood test. In the meantime, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Just the tests. Thank you. You are very kind. I hope it’s not… too bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, Philipp. Just try to relax, and we’ll take it one step at a time. I’ll be right here if you have any questions or concerns. .
PATIENT: .
