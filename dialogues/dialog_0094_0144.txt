DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Dr. Gegan, is it? Well, honestly? Curiosity, mostly. My Harold – bless his soul – always insisted on yearly check-ups. I never really paid much attention, to be frank. Just figured he took care of everything. Now… well, now I’m thinking maybe I should see what all the fuss was about. It's not like anything's wrong, you know? I just thought I'd… look around.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible reason to come in, Ms. Calvery. It's wonderful you’re being proactive about your health, and it’s always better to be safe. Harold sounds like a very thoughtful man. So, just to clarify, you’re coming in for a general check-up, preventative care, and to establish care with me?
PATIENT: Establish care… is that what they call it now? Seems awfully formal. Yes, I suppose. Preventative… Harold used to say that too. Honestly, I don't really feel like I need anything. I still feel pretty good for my age, you know? I mean, I get a little tired sometimes, but who doesn't? Is this going to take long? I have a bridge game this afternoon.
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound like you’re experiencing anything concerning, which is great. Establishing care just means we’ll go through your medical history, do a basic exam, and get a baseline understanding of your health. It helps me to know what’s normal for you so we can better address any issues that might come up in the future. And yes, we’ll try to be as efficient as possible, and I'll keep your bridge game in mind. It shouldn’t take too long. To start, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, medical history... Harold always kept all those papers. I really didn't pay attention. Let me see... I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, that I remember. And… oh, and a bad case of the flu a few years back. But other than that? Nothing major, really. I've always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I did have a hysterectomy, oh goodness, ages ago. Must be… thirty years now? More? Honestly, the dates all blur together.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils out as a child, a bout of the flu, and a hysterectomy approximately thirty years ago. That’s a good start. Do you recall where you had the hysterectomy performed, and if you remember the reason for it?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that was so long ago. Let me think... It was at St. Luke’s hospital, I’m pretty sure. And the reason… well, it was… complications. Something about fibroids, I think Harold said. Very common, he assured me. I mostly remember being relieved when it was over. It was a long recovery. I think Dr. Abernathy did it... or was it Abercrombie? I'm terrible with names. I just followed Harold’s instructions, you know? He always knew what to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, St. Luke’s hospital for the hysterectomy, due to fibroids. And you recall a long recovery. That’s helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... Just a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. It bothers me in the mornings, especially when it's damp. It's... Ibuprofen, I think? The regular kind. And sometimes I take a little vitamin D, because Harold said I wasn't getting enough sunshine. But that's about it. Really. I try not to take too many pills, you know? They can't be good for you.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and vitamin D occasionally. Do you know the dosage of either of those?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Dosages… Harold handled all of that. I just take them when I need to. The ibuprofen… maybe two pills at a time? It's the little blue ones. And the vitamin D… it's a small pill, I think. Once a day, sometimes. Honestly, I don't pay much attention. I just know they’re supposed to help. Is it important? I'm not very good with details, you know. My mind just isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Calvery. We can sort all of this out. It’s more important to me to get a general sense of what you’re taking. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. That's a good question. I don't think so. I haven't had any serious reactions to anything, that I can recall. I get a little itchy sometimes, but that's probably just the dust. Harold always said I was sensitive to dust. And I think I was allergic to penicillin when I was a child, but that was ages ago. I haven’t taken penicillin in… well, I can’t even remember. Do you need a specific answer? It’s all a bit blurry, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, potential penicillin allergy in childhood, and sensitivity to dust. That's helpful. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history... Well, my mother lived to be eighty-five, which is pretty good, I think. She had a bit of trouble with her heart in the end. And my father... he passed away when I was young, from a stroke, I believe. Harold’s side… his mother had diabetes, and his brother had high blood pressure. It seems like everyone has something, doesn’t it? I always tried not to worry about it too much, you know? What's the point? It doesn't change anything.
DOCTOR: That gives me a good starting point. A family history of heart trouble, stroke, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Now, have you ever smoked, or been exposed to secondhand smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Never smoked a day in my life. Harold hated smoking. And we always made sure to avoid it. It’s just… unhealthy, you know? We always took care of ourselves. I don't think I was ever around much secondhand smoke, either. Maybe a little at parties when we were young, but nothing serious. I always steered clear of it. I always thought it smelled dreadful.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little. Harold and I would have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, especially on weekends. Nothing excessive, you know? A little red wine is good for the heart, they say. But I haven't had much lately, to be honest. Not much of an appetite these days. Mostly just tea. Earl Grey, if I have it. Do you need to know how much we drank? It was never a problem, I assure you. We were very responsible people.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Calvery, just wanted to get a general sense. So, a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Now, lastly, can you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, social history? What does that mean? I have friends, of course. A few bridge partners, mostly. We get together a couple of times a week. And I volunteer at the library on Tuesdays. It keeps me busy. Harold and I used to travel a lot when we were younger, but… well, that was a long time ago. Now I mostly just keep to myself. Is that what you mean? I'm not a very outgoing person, you know. I prefer a quiet evening at home with a good book.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I meant. So, you’re socially active with bridge and volunteering, and enjoy reading. That’s wonderful. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, is there anything specific you've been worried about, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, sometimes my knees ache a little. It’s nothing serious, you know? Just old age, I suppose. And I've been feeling a little tired lately, but that could be anything. And… oh, I’ve been a little forgetful lately, too. But that’s probably just getting old. I forget where I put my glasses sometimes, and I have trouble remembering names. It’s nothing to worry about, I’m sure. Is that what you were asking about? I just thought I'd mention it, in case it was important. It’s just… things aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Calvery, that’s helpful to know. The knee pain, fatigue, and forgetfulness. We'll definitely look into those. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a basic neurological assessment. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A physical exam. Well, I suppose it can’t hurt. Just try not to poke and prod too much, dear. My Harold always said I was sensitive. And please be gentle with my knees. They’ve seen better days, you know. Go ahead, then. I’m ready, I think. As ready as I’ll ever be.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/85 mmHg. Knees exhibit mild crepitus with range of motion, slight tenderness to palpation medially on both sides, no significant swelling noted. Range of motion is full but slightly limited due to discomfort. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Coordination is intact. Everything seems within normal limits so far. Now, I’d like to order some basic bloodwork to get a clearer picture of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Everything within normal limits… that’s good to hear. Bloodwork, you say? Well, I suppose it can’t hurt. Harold always said it was good to keep an eye on things. But don’t poke me too much with the needle, dear. I don’t like needles. And please tell me what you’re looking for, you know? I like to know what’s going on. What kind of bloodwork are you ordering? Just the usual? Or something special? I just don't want any surprises, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. We'll be very careful with the needle. I'll order a Complete Blood Count to check your red and white blood cell levels, a Basic Metabolic Panel to assess your kidney function and electrolytes, a Lipid Panel to check your cholesterol levels, and a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test to check your thyroid function. We will also check your Vitamin D level, given your supplementation. These are all routine tests, and they'll give us a good baseline understanding of your health. They can help us identify any potential issues early on, such as anemia, kidney problems, high cholesterol, or thyroid problems. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. All those… names. It sounds awfully complicated. But if it’s routine, I suppose it’s alright. You’re checking for… anemia, kidney problems, cholesterol… and something about my thyroid? Well, if Harold thought it was important, I suppose I should do it. But please don’t tell me if anything’s seriously wrong, dear. I don’t like bad news. Just tell me if everything’s… satisfactory. And please be quick with the needle. I get nervous easily, you know. Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: We will take things at your pace, Ms. Calvery. The blood draw itself will be very quick, and I'll make sure the phlebotomist is gentle. You might feel a slight pinch, but it shouldn't be painful. And I understand your concern about bad news. I will explain the results in a clear and understandable way, and we'll discuss them together. If anything does require further investigation, we'll do it one step at a time. My goal is to ensure you feel comfortable and informed throughout the process. Now, do you have any questions about the tests before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You explained everything very well, dear. A little complicated, perhaps, but well-explained. Just… please be quick with the needle. And gentle. That’s all I ask. And don’t tell me if anything’s seriously wrong, you promised. Honestly, I just want to get this over with so I can get to my bridge game. It starts at two o’clock, you know. I’m paired with Mildred this week, and she’s a very competitive player. It’s very important that I’m on my game. So, let’s just get this bloodwork done, shall we? The sooner the better. And tell the person doing it to be very gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Calvery. We will prioritize your comfort. I will personally let the phlebotomist know to be as gentle as possible, and I will stay with you throughout the process. Let’s go ahead and get you comfortable in the chair, and I’ll call the phlebotomist. It shouldn’t be too much longer.
