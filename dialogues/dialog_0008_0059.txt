DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be honest, it’s… my speech. It feels a little off, like I’m not saying things clearly. It’s been happening for a bit now, and my husband suggested I come get it checked. I don’t really know when it started, exactly. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Okay. "Feels a little off," you said. Can you describe what "off" means exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… It’s hard to explain. Like… the words get jumbled sometimes? Or… slurred, I guess is the word. Not all the time, but enough that people have asked me to repeat myself. It's just… frustrating, really. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. And how long has this been going on – you said "a bit," can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Oh dear… specific… That’s a tricky one. Maybe… a few weeks? Perhaps a month? It's all a bit blurry, to be honest. I don't really keep track of those things. It wasn't sudden, more like… it gradually got worse, if that makes any sense. I really wish I could pinpoint a date for you.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradually over the past month. Have you noticed anything else happening at the same time?
PATIENT: Let me think… Not that I’ve noticed, no. I mean, I’ve been a little tired lately, but that’s just from work, isn’t it? Construction is… demanding. No headaches, no dizziness, no weakness… Nothing else really stands out. My appetite's been normal, I think. I do feel a little clumsy sometimes, but I always have been! It’s probably just me being… well, me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any past medical problems that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, to my knowledge. I’ve always been pretty healthy, thankfully. Nothing major, anyway. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing serious. I don’t think I’ve ever been hospitalized or had any surgeries. I have Medicare, of course, but I haven't used it much. I can’t really recall anything significant, if that makes sense. My husband might know more, to be honest. He’s got a better memory than me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any family history of speech problems, neurological conditions, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, family… That's… difficult. My mother passed away a few years ago, and I wasn’t very close to my father. I don't really know much about his side of the family, and my mother… she didn't really talk about health problems, if that makes sense. I don't recall anyone having speech issues, but I honestly couldn’t say for sure. It’s a bit of a blur. I wouldn't be surprised either way, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t really take anything. Just… vitamins occasionally, if I remember. Nothing prescribed, nothing over the counter regularly. I try to stay healthy, so I don’t really need anything. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I’m aware of, no. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I can recall. No food allergies, no medication allergies… I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. I don’t really have any sensitivities, either. I think I’d know if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I? I'm pretty lucky, in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’d like to check your reflexes, coordination, and just listen to your heart and lungs. It’ll only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do. I'm happy to cooperate. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Adyn. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Let’s test your coordination now. Could you follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly, Doctor. I'm following it… Is this okay? It feels a little… strange, but I'm trying my best. I hope I'm not doing it wrong.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, can you touch your nose with your finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Like this? It feels a little… off, I’m not sure I got it right. My hand feels a bit clumsy, sorry. Is this what you meant?
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's try that a few more times. Okay. And now, say "baseball" for me.
PATIENT: …Baseball. Is that… okay? It feels a little difficult to say. Like my tongue isn't cooperating. I’m sorry if it doesn’t sound right.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now say "baby".
PATIENT: …B-baby. That… that was harder than I thought. It feels like I’m stumbling over the words. Is it really that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay. Adyn, I'm noting some slight slurring of your speech and a little incoordination during the exam. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’m seeing, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further investigation. It could be something relatively minor, but we need to rule out more serious possibilities. I want to order an MRI of your brain to get a better look. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI…? Oh dear. Is… is it something serious, Doctor? I mean, what are we looking for? I’m a bit frightened now, to be honest. I just came in because my speech was a little off… An MRI sounds… very serious. Is there anything else we can do? What are the risks?
DOCTOR: Okay, take a deep breath. It's understandable to be frightened. An MRI is a precaution. We're looking for any potential issues that could be causing your symptoms - things like a small stroke, a lesion, or any other abnormalities in the brain. It doesn’t necessarily mean there is something wrong, but it helps us rule things out. The risks are minimal. You’ll be lying inside a large magnet, so we need to make sure you don't have any metal implants. It’s also fairly noisy, but we'll give you earplugs. You’ll be closely monitored by a technician the entire time. I’m also going to order some blood work to check for any underlying conditions. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Blood work, yes, that sounds… less frightening. And the MRI… if it’s necessary to rule things out, then I suppose I should do it. But… metal implants? I don't think I have any… I've never had surgery. What happens if they do find something, Doctor? Will I have to have… more surgery? Or… is there any chance this is just stress? Work has been very demanding lately.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll go through a thorough checklist to make sure you’re safe for the MRI. I’m confident you don't have any implants, but it’s important to be certain. As for what happens if we find something, it depends on what it is. It could range from something minor that requires no treatment, to something more serious that might need further intervention. I will explain everything clearly if we find anything, and we'll discuss all your options. It's possible this could be related to stress, but with your symptoms and the exam findings, it's best to investigate further to be safe. I'm going to write you an order for the MRI and the blood work. The MRI center is located at [address]. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment. The blood work can be done at [lab location]. I’ll also give you a referral to a neurologist for a consultation after we have the results. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, that sounds… alright. A neurologist… more appointments. I suppose it’s better to be safe than sorry. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for not making me feel… foolish. It's just… frightening to think something might be wrong. Could you please spell the neurologist’s name for me? And maybe write down the address for the MRI center, just in case? I just want to make sure I don't forget anything.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The neurologist’s name is Dr. Anya Sharma, S-H-A-R-M-A. Her number is 555-123-4567. The MRI center is at 123 Main Street, Anytown, USA. Here’s a slip with all the information written down. I’ll also send the results of your blood work and the MRI directly to Dr. Sharma’s office, so you don’t have to worry about carrying them around. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Thank you so much, Doctor. That’s very helpful. No, I think that covers everything for now. I’m just… a little anxious, to be honest. But I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll call to schedule the MRI as soon as I get home. And thank you again, Doctor Cumper. I hope it’s nothing serious. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Adyn. Take a deep breath, and try not to worry too much. We're taking all the necessary steps to figure out what's going on. I'll be in touch if I have any concerns before your appointment with Dr. Sharma. You take care now, and please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns.
