DOCTOR: Alright, Ellan, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Ellan Rannells. Though, frankly, I find it rather… unnecessary for you to be reading my name off a piece of paper. One would think after all these years, a doctor would remember a patient’s name.
DOCTOR: Look, I see a lot of patients. It's… a busy practice. Now, let's not get sidetracked. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s rather straightforward, isn’t it? I’m here about getting one of those… medical marijuana cards. My daughter, bless her heart, has been telling me about it. She says it’s good for… well, for everything. I’m not entirely convinced, of course. But I suppose it’s worth investigating. I just don’t see why it needs such… official documentation. It seems rather silly, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Right. Medical marijuana. Look, I’m a family doctor, not a…pot dealer. But fine. We have to jump through hoops these days, don't we?
PATIENT: Precisely! Hoops. That's a rather apt description. And truthfully, I wouldn't have bothered if it wasn't for my daughter. She's very insistent. She says it will help with my… discomfort. Though, I’ve managed all these years without it, so I’m not entirely sure what all the fuss is about. But, if you think it might be beneficial, I suppose I’m willing to consider it. Just… don’t expect miracles, young man.
DOCTOR: "Discomfort," right. Okay. Let's be specific. What kind of discomfort are we talking about?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… a general ache, really. You know, the sort that comes with… living. My joints, mostly. Knees, hips, back. It's not debilitating, mind you. I still manage my household, my garden. But at the end of the day… they just ache. And it’s been progressively worse over the years. It's just… part of getting older, I suppose. Though, I certainly don't relish it. Do you need a detailed anatomical breakdown? I assure you, it’s not a pleasant list.
DOCTOR: No, no anatomical breakdowns. "General ache" doesn't tell me much. Has anything specific made it worse recently?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it, the humidity has been dreadful this summer. Absolutely dreadful. It seems to settle right into the bones, you know? And I did a bit more gardening than usual last month, trying to get everything just right before it got too hot. Perhaps I overdid it slightly. Though, I've always been a firm believer in hard work. One shouldn’t let a few aches and pains deter one from a good day's labor. Still, it did leave me feeling rather… stiff. Is that helpful? It's all rather connected, don't you think? The weather, the gardening, the general… decline.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's see… age 74, Dominican… No prior records listed here. Any other medical issues I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had a touch of the flu a few years back, but that was nothing a good cup of chamomile tea couldn't fix. And my blood pressure runs a little high, but nothing that requires medication, according to my previous doctor. He retired, you see. A perfectly good man, but getting on in years himself, I suppose. Mostly, I’ve always been quite healthy, truthfully. I attribute it to a good diet and a sensible lifestyle. And avoiding doctors whenever possible, naturally. Though, here we are. Is this information… satisfactory? I do hope it isn't too tedious.
DOCTOR: Any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I've never been one for allergies. I can tolerate just about anything. Though, I do find certain perfumes rather… overpowering. Not an allergy, per se, but a distinct dislike. And I avoid shellfish, naturally. It just doesn't sit right with me. Other than that, I’m perfectly robust. I suppose I'm rather lucky that way. Is that what you were looking for? Or are you expecting some rare and exotic sensitivity?
DOCTOR: Medications?
PATIENT: As I mentioned, I avoid medications whenever possible. A bit of chamomile tea here, a little ginger for an upset stomach there… that’s about it. I believe in letting the body heal itself, you see. All these pills and potions… they just mask the problem, don’t they? Though, I suppose one can’t entirely avoid them forever. But I’ve managed quite well thus far, without resorting to such drastic measures. I used to take something for my blood pressure, years ago, but my previous doctor said it wasn’t necessary. A perfectly good doctor, he was. Though, he did retire, as I mentioned. Is this… sufficient?
DOCTOR: Right. Look, Mrs. Rannells, with all due respect, I need a clear picture of your medical history. This isn't about what you believe or what your previous doctor said. Do you take any prescription medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Such directness! Well, alright, alright. There is… one thing. My daughter reminded me just this morning. It’s a small dose of something for… sleep. Just to help me rest. It's a new thing, she insisted I try it. Said I hadn’t been sleeping well. It’s called… lorazepam, I believe. A very small pill, just before bed. But honestly, I’m not even certain it’s doing anything. I’ve always been a sound sleeper. It's just… she worried. Honestly, it’s probably nothing. But there. Is that what you were looking for? Don’t tell me you need the dosage, I wouldn't have the slightest idea. She handles all that.
DOCTOR: Lorazepam…okay. And how long have you been taking this lorazepam?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not long at all. Perhaps… a month? Maybe a little less. She started me on it when I visited her last month. She’s very… thorough, my daughter. Insists on keeping me on a strict regimen of everything. Vitamins, exercise, now this. She worries, you see. She’s a good girl, but sometimes… a bit overbearing. I can barely keep track of everything myself. It’s all rather… modern, if you ask me. I used to just get a good night's sleep naturally. Honestly, it’s probably not even worth mentioning. But there. Is that satisfactory? I do hope we're getting closer to the end of this interrogation.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. A physical exam. I suppose that’s to be expected. Though, I must warn you, I haven’t been particularly active lately. It’s the weather, you see. Dampness settles in the joints. And all this talk about medications has rather taken the energy out of me. Still, I can manage. Here. Don’t expect miracles, young man. I’m not as sprightly as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are… normal, albeit a little faint. Lungs are clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds on the bases. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. A little pressure, perhaps, but nothing significant. I have a rather sensitive stomach, you see. Always have. It’s probably just my internal organs protesting the examination. Honestly, I’ve never been one for poking and prodding. It feels rather… invasive. But I suppose it’s necessary. Is that what you were looking for? Are we getting any closer to the marijuana card? I must confess, all this fuss is rather tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay. Knees have a limited range of motion, some crepitus with movement. Hips are… similar. Reflexes are present, but diminished. Mrs. Rannells, while I understand your desire for a medical marijuana card, I’m not convinced this is the right course of action. Your symptoms seem more consistent with age-related wear and tear. We could explore some physical therapy options, or perhaps some over-the-counter pain relief. I don’t want to dismiss your discomfort, but I’m hesitant to prescribe a medication without a clear diagnosis.
PATIENT: Oh. Well. That’s… rather disappointing. Physical therapy? Honestly, I haven’t the energy for all that bending and stretching. And over-the-counter pain relief… I’ve tried those. They do very little, I assure you. My daughter… she’s very convinced marijuana will be the answer. She reads all sorts of articles online. Says it will help with everything. She thinks I'm just dismissing it because I'm… old-fashioned. Are you certain there’s no benefit to be had? Perhaps just a small dose, to see if it helps? I’m not asking for a miracle, young man. Just a little relief. Honestly, I’m beginning to think I should have just stayed home with my chamomile tea.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Rannells, I can write a referral for a consultation with a rheumatologist. They can assess your joints and determine the underlying cause of your discomfort. That's a more responsible approach than simply handing you a card for marijuana. I'm not opposed to exploring all options, but I need a clear understanding of what we're dealing with first. I understand your daughter's influence, but ultimately, this is about your health. Do you want the referral?
PATIENT: A rheumatologist… Honestly, the thought of another specialist fills me with dread. More poking and prodding, I presume? More waiting rooms and endless questionnaires? My daughter will be very disappointed. She's already picked out a whole dispensary. She has opinions on strains and dosages. But... … alright. A referral. If you think it’s best. But please, tell them to be gentle. And quick. I haven’t got all day, you know. Honestly, I’m beginning to regret the whole endeavor. Just… send me home with a nice cup of tea, and I think I’d be much happier.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm sending a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma. She's a good rheumatologist, very thorough. I'll also print out some information on over-the-counter pain relief options for the meantime. Here you go. And please, try to manage your expectations. It may take a few weeks to get an appointment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… this paperwork. And the information on… over-the-counter remedies. Honestly, I doubt they’ll be of much use. Very well. I suppose that’s that. Thank you… for your time, young man. Though, I must say, it wasn’t quite the experience I’d hoped for. I think I’ll just go home and have that cup of tea now. Perhaps with a little biscuit. That always helps. Goodbye. And thank you… again. Though I don’t expect much will come of it. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day.
