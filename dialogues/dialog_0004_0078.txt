DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to put it simply, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a…reset, or a jumpstart, to get my health back on track. I’m not quite sure where to begin, honestly.
DOCTOR: “Stuck,” alright. That's…vague, but we can work with that. It's good you're recognizing something isn't quite right. To help me understand what “stuck” means for you, let's start with the basics. Could you describe what specifically feels off?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it’s not one particular thing, Doctor. It’s…energy, mostly. I feel very low energy, all the time. And a little…foggy, if that makes sense? Like I’m not as sharp as I used to be. It’s been going on for…oh, goodness, maybe six months now? It’s affecting everything, really – work, even just enjoying things with my husband. I’m a molder, you see, shaping things…and it takes a lot of focus, a lot of strength, and I just…don’t have it like I used to.
DOCTOR: Low energy and mental fog for six months. Okay. And would you say this came on suddenly, or was it a gradual decline?
PATIENT: It was…gradual, definitely. It wasn't like I woke up one morning feeling this way. It sort of crept up on me. I think…perhaps around the time the weather started changing last winter? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, honestly. Work got busier, too, around then. Lots of extra orders, which I was happy about, of course, but…maybe that had something to do with it. I just assumed it was stress at first.
DOCTOR: Stress is certainly a common culprit. Let’s dig a little deeper to see if we can identify other factors. Aside from the fatigue and fog, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. I’ve been a little more…irritable, perhaps? Not with anyone in particular, just…shorter-tempered, I suppose. And my sleep hasn't been the best. I wake up a few times during the night, even when I’m tired. And…oh! My digestion hasn’t been great either. A little…off, if you know what I mean. Nothing terrible, but not as regular as it used to be. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Irritability, disrupted sleep, and digestive issues…yes, that’s helpful. And when you say “digestive issues,” are we talking bloating, constipation, diarrhea…anything specific?
PATIENT: Mostly…constipation, I think. And some bloating. Not terribly painful, just…uncomfortable. I try to drink plenty of water, but it doesn’t seem to help much. It comes and goes, really. Some days are better than others. It’s probably nothing, to be honest. Just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: “Probably nothing” is not a diagnosis, Ms. Pitzel. And 45 is hardly “old age.” Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. I've always been quite healthy, truthfully. I do have mild arthritis in my hands, from the molding, but it's well-managed with over-the-counter pain relievers. And…oh! I had a rather bad bout of the flu a few years back, but I recovered fully. Other than that, nothing major. My husband has high blood pressure, if that's relevant?
DOCTOR: Family history is important, so thank you for mentioning your husband’s high blood pressure. Have any other close relatives – parents, siblings – had any significant health issues?
PATIENT: Let me see…my mother had some heart trouble when she was older, but she lived to be 85, so I don’t worry too much about that. And my father…he was always very healthy, thankfully. No major illnesses on either side of the family, really. We’re a pretty robust bunch, all things considered. That’s probably why this is so baffling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your current medications and allergies. Are you taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications regularly?
PATIENT: Just the over-the-counter pain relievers for my arthritis, Doctor. Ibuprofen, mostly. And occasionally something for a headache, but that’s very infrequent. As for allergies…no, I don’t have any known allergies. No food allergies, no medication allergies, nothing like that. I can wear any perfume or lotion without any reaction. I’ve always been very lucky in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, Ms. Pitzel, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your thyroid. Then I’d like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Absolutely. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment completely. Please, go ahead. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. Blood pressure is 130/85, slightly elevated but not drastically so. Pulse is 72, regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your thyroid… Thyroid feels normal, no noticeable enlargement or nodules. Finally, let’s do a quick neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and coordination. Reflexes are normal, coordination appears good. Now, I'm going to order some blood work - a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, vitamin D levels, and a metabolic panel. This will help us rule out a number of possibilities. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very thorough. Perfectly good. I appreciate you being so comprehensive. Vitamin D levels…that makes sense. I don't get out in the sun very much, being in the workshop all day. So, yes, let's do all of that. How long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: The lab typically takes 3-5 business days to return the results. Once I have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I recommend trying to get at least 20 minutes of sunlight each day if possible, and focusing on a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Are you currently taking any supplements, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I'm not. I’ve never really been one for supplements. I try to get everything I need from my food. Twenty minutes of sunlight…that might be a challenge, truthfully. But I’ll certainly try. It's good to have a starting point. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should be avoiding?
DOCTOR: For now, I’d suggest avoiding excessive caffeine and alcohol, as both can disrupt sleep. Try to maintain a regular sleep schedule, even on weekends. And if you're feeling particularly stressed, consider incorporating some relaxation techniques into your daily routine - deep breathing exercises, meditation, or even just taking a few minutes to listen to music. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Ms. Pitzel. Let's start with these tests, and then we'll reassess. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude this visit?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You've been very thorough, and you've explained everything very clearly. I feel much better just having spoken with you, honestly. Thank you. And please, let me know if you need anything from me – any additional information, or if you think of something else I should be doing.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. The lab results will be sent to this clinic and we will schedule a follow-up appointment then. Here is a copy of the lab order and some general information on improving sleep hygiene. Take care, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. Have a good day.
