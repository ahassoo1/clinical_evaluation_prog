DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It's nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is okay to call you Doctor Pirl? I… my son, he want me to live in one of those… senior places. He say I need checkup first, to make sure I am… good for it? Is for make sure I no sick, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, Doctor Pirl is perfectly fine. And yes, that’s a very sensible request from your son. A check-up before transitioning to a senior living community is a good idea, to ensure you’re as healthy as possible and to identify any potential needs we should address. So, to start, are you experiencing any specific health concerns right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. Sometimes… my knee, it ache a little. But is old age, I think. And I get tired easy, but… I am old woman! No big problems, you understand? No pain all the time, no… falling down or nothing.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s common for things to ache a little as we get older, and feeling more tired is often part of aging as well. We'll certainly look into both of those things. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history? That is… a long time ago. I… I had a baby, two babies, a long time ago. Normal babies, no problems. And… when I was young, I had the fever, a bad fever. But I get better. I think that is all. I no go to doctor much, you understand? I mostly just… rest when I feel bad.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Many people don't see doctors frequently. So, you had two children without complications, and you had a fever when you were younger, but recovered fully. That's helpful. Do you recall if that fever required a hospital stay, or if you remember anything specific about it?
PATIENT: Hospital? No, no hospital. My mama, she take care of me. She give me… tea with herbs. And… cool cloths on my forehead. Is long ago, Doctor. I was a little girl, maybe five, six years old? I remember feeling very hot, and sleepy. But she make me better. She was good with herbs, my mama.
DOCTOR: Your mother sounds like a very capable woman. Thank you for sharing that. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than that childhood fever?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never. And no other hospital. I… I break my wrist once, when I was young woman, fall from a tree when I pick mango. But the… the bonesetter, he fix it. He put it in the… wood and wrap it tight. Is not like hospital, you understand?
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations aside from the childhood fever, and you had a wrist injury that was treated by a bonesetter. That's good to know. Now, Ms. Abdollahi, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so. I eat everything. My son, he tell me to not eat too much salt, but… I like salt! No… I never feel sick from food, or… medicine. I don't take much medicine, you see. Mostly just… tea when I feel a cold. Is that an allergy?
DOCTOR: No, tea isn't an allergy! It sounds like you haven’t experienced any true allergic reactions, which is excellent. Now, could you tell me if you are currently taking any medications—prescription or over-the-counter—vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No… no medicine. My son, he give me vitamins sometimes. The little white pills. But I forget to take them, mostly. And… no herbal things. Just the tea. I like chamomile tea when I cannot sleep. Is that all. I try to remember what the doctor tell me, but… I get old, you understand? Things slip my mind.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand completely. You take occasional vitamins, and chamomile tea for sleep. No other regular medications. That’s helpful. Now, Ms. Abdollahi, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Family? My mama, she live long time. She die when she was very old. My papa… he die young. From the… the sickness with the cough. A bad cough, very bad. And… my brother, he have the trouble with the sugar, the diabetes, my son say. He have to take the pills. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. So, your mother lived to a good age, your father died from a cough, and your brother has diabetes. Do you know of any other significant medical conditions that run in your family—like heart problems, high blood pressure, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… My aunt, she have the trouble with the heart. She feel very tired all the time. And… I think my cousin, on my papa’s side, he have the… the sickness of the blood, the cancer, my son say. He go to the hospital for the… the treatments, a long time ago. Is that enough? I don’t know much about my family’s sicknesses, you understand. We don’t talk about it much.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Abdollahi. You’ve given me some very useful information. Heart trouble and cancer in your family. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, no smoke. Never. My mama, she say smoke is bad for you. And I listen to my mama. Very bad. Is poison. My son, he try once, when he was young man, but I make him stop.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Sometimes, a little wine with my son. Is special occasion, you understand? Birthday, Christmas. But not every day. Is not like… habit. I like the taste, but is okay without.
DOCTOR: Just a little wine on special occasions. Very good. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a bit about your daily activity level?
PATIENT: Daily… activity? Well, I walk around the house. I cook, I clean. I sit and watch the television sometimes. I go to the church on Sunday. I no run marathons, you understand! But I no sit all day. I try to stay… busy. Is good for the mind, my son say.
DOCTOR: That's good. Staying active and engaged is very important. Now, Ms. Abdollahi, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is okay. Whatever you need. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could please sit up on the examination table for me, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 140 over 85. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I'm going to feel your abdomen now. Soft, no tenderness. Now, let's check your reflexes. Good reflexes. And finally, let me just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears look clear, and your throat is… a little dry. Alright, Ms. Abdollahi, that was quick. Everything seems generally good, though we’ll want to do some blood work to get a more detailed picture of your health.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Is good. Blood work is okay. You think I am good enough for the… senior place? My son, he worry a lot. He want me safe, you understand?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Abdollahi, based on this brief exam, you seem generally healthy for your age. However, the blood work will give us a more complete understanding of your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and vitamin levels. That will help us determine if there are any underlying issues we need to address before you transition to a senior living community. It’s good your son is concerned about your safety. It's important to address any potential health concerns beforehand. I’ll order the blood work now, and we should have the results in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated, and continue with your current activity level. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Water is good. I drink a lot of tea, but water is good too. Hmm… what if the blood say I am sick? Will I not be able to go to the nice place? My son, he already pick out my room. Is by the garden, he say.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. Abdollahi. If the blood work does reveal any concerns, it doesn't necessarily mean you won't be able to transition to the senior living community. It simply means we might need to address those issues first—perhaps with medication or lifestyle changes—to ensure you're as healthy and safe as possible. We'll discuss all the options together, and I can work with your son and the community to make sure you receive the appropriate care. The goal is to make this transition as smooth and safe as possible for you. We’ll go through everything, step-by-step. Do you want me to write down the name of the lab for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Write down the name of the lab. And… thank you, Doctor. You make me feel… less worried. My son, he worry too much. But he loves me, you understand?
DOCTOR: Here you go. It’s called “Rural County Labs,” right here on Main Street. You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. It’s perfectly natural for your son to be concerned. It sounds like he cares about you very much. That’s a wonderful thing. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before we get the results back. We’re here to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is all. Thank you again. You are very kind. I go now, and drink some water. And maybe… maybe go see the garden. My son will be happy.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. That sounds like a wonderful idea. Enjoy your day, and we'll be in touch soon with your results. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you need anything.
