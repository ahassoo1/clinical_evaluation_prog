DOCTOR: Good morning, Janie. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um... chronic fatigue, they said. That's what the paper says, anyway. Honestly, it's just… being really tired. All the time. It’s been going on… a while now, I think. I don't really keep track of things so well these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, “chronic fatigue.” And you say it's been going on for a while. Can you tell me a little more about how tired you are?
PATIENT: Just… tired. Like, I can sleep all night, and still wake up feeling like I haven’t slept at all. Everything feels like… a lot of effort. Even getting out of bed. I used to be able to do… things. I don't remember exactly what things, but… more things. Now, mostly I just… sit. Is that… helpful? I don't know what you want to know.
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Janie, thank you. It sounds very frustrating. When did you first start noticing this increasing tiredness and difficulty?
PATIENT: Ugh, it is. Really frustrating. Trying to remember… hmm. It was after… after my husband passed, I think. Or maybe a little before? It's all a bit… blurry, to be honest. Probably… a couple of years ago? Maybe more? I really can’t say for sure. Things just sort of… faded in. It wasn’t one day, you know? Just… gradual.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started around the time of your husband’s passing, roughly two years ago, and has been gradual. Besides the fatigue, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Let me think. My bones ache sometimes. Not all the time, but… yeah, aches. And I feel… foggy. Like I can’t think straight. I forget things. Like I said. Mostly little things, but it’s annoying. I don’t know… does that count? I just feel… old, I guess. Even though I don't feel old, just… worn out. Is that what you mean by symptoms?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean. The aches and the “fog” are helpful information. Do you have any trouble with your memory that interferes with daily tasks, like managing medications or appointments?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. Medications… I have a little pill box, but sometimes I miss days. I don’t remember if I took them or not. And appointments… I have my daughter write them down for me. She’s a good girl. I wouldn’t… I wouldn’t be able to manage on my own, I don't think. That’s… embarrassing to admit. I should remember, but I just… don't. It's like my brain just... slips.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me, Janie. It takes courage to talk about these things. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me see… I had my gallbladder out years ago. And… high blood pressure, they said. I take a pill for that, I think. Other than that… not that I remember. The doctors always talked so fast. I mostly just… did what they told me. My husband used to handle all the details. I’m sorry, I’m probably not being very helpful. It’s all just… a jumble in my head. I have Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: It does matter, thank you. Medicare is helpful to know. And don't worry about being "helpful"—you're telling me what's going on, and that's the most important thing. You mentioned high blood pressure and a past gallbladder removal. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ugh… it’s a little white pill. That’s all I know! Seriously. It has… letters on it? I think. My daughter fills the little box every week. She knows what I take. I don’t even bother to look at the bottle anymore. It’s… embarrassing. I should know, but I just… don't. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel better. Is there something you can give me?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Janie, and wanting to feel better is exactly why we’re here. It's okay that you don't know the medication name; we can look it up in your records. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I used to get hives when I was a little girl, from… something. But I haven't had those in… decades. No, I don’t think so. I eat just about anything. My daughter always worries about me, but I haven’t had any reactions to anything. No, I don't have any allergies. I'm pretty sure. Hopefully. Is this taking too long? I have a… a thing later. Not important. Just… a thing.
DOCTOR: No, this isn’t taking too long, thank you. Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or certain types of cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. My mother had… something with her heart, I think. She died when I was young. And my brother… he had cancer, lung cancer. He smoked, you see. A lot. Other than that… I don't really know. My family wasn’t very good at talking about… health things. It was just… something you didn't discuss. I’m sorry, I’m probably not much help. Everyone on my mother’s side is… gone now, to be honest. It's hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That’s helpful information. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, no! Heavens no! My husband smoked, and it… well, it wasn’t good. I would never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. No, definitely not. I drink… a little wine sometimes, with dinner. Just a glass. Nothing more. I’m not a big drinker. Mostly just water. Is that okay? I feel like I'm being interrogated! No offense, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No offense taken at all, Janie. This is just routine information gathering. Okay, so no smoking, just a glass of wine occasionally. And finally, are there any major stressors in your life right now?
PATIENT: Stressors… Oh, dear. Losing my husband… that was a big stressor. Still is, I suppose. It’s been… a few years, but. And… being alone. My daughter is very good, she visits every week, but… it’s not the same. Just… the quiet. And worrying about things. I worry a lot. Mostly about my daughter. And… just feeling old and useless. Is that a stressor? Honestly, Doctor, I just want to be able to… do things again. I don’t want to be a burden. Is that too much to ask? I think… I think that's enough talking for now. I'm really tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, Janie. That’s a lot to process, and you’ve shared a great deal with me. It sounds like you’re grieving, feeling lonely, and understandably concerned about becoming a burden. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just checking your heart, lungs, and a few neurological things, to get a better picture of what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Okay. If you think it’s necessary. Just… please be quick. I have that… thing later. Not important, but still. And… be gentle, please. My bones ache, you know. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Let's just get it over with. I’m really tired. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Janie. We'll take it slow. First, let's listen to your heart. Deep breaths, please. listens for approximately 30 seconds. Your heart rate is a little slow, but regular. No murmurs or extra sounds detected. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs. listens to each lung for approximately 30 seconds. Your lungs are clear. I don't hear any wheezing or crackling. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. tests reflexes in both arms and legs. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which isn’t necessarily concerning, but we'll keep an eye on that. Finally, I'll quickly assess your gait and balance. observes Janie as she stands and walks a few steps. Your gait is a little unsteady. Can you tell me if you've had any falls recently?
