DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s my head. Back of my head hurts. Been hurting for… oh, maybe three days now? Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Feels like a… a tight band, maybe? I don’t know the words for it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache for about three days, coming and going, feels like a tight band. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More? Hmmm… Well, it’s not a bad bad pain, you know? Not like when I broke my arm when I was a boy. It’s… annoying. And it feels worse when I stand up too fast. Makes me a little dizzy too, sometimes. I used to work with the trains, you see. Lots of standing, lots of moving. Maybe that has something to do with it? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Alright, annoying pain that's worse when you stand up quickly, and you get a little dizzy. And you used to work with trains, a lot of standing and moving. Okay. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Not much, Doctor. I mostly stay home now. My wife… she passed away last year. So, it’s just me. I try to keep busy, read the paper, watch TV. Eat my meals. I walk around the house, but… not like I used to. Not much different than before, really. Except for… well, except for her not being here.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Brum. That must be very difficult. Okay, so no recent injuries, no new medications, and the main change has been your wife's passing. Let's talk about some other things, just to get a better picture. Do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, the doctor told me a long time ago my blood pressure was a little high. He gave me some pills, but I stopped taking them. They made me feel tired. And my knees… they bother me sometimes. Old age, I guess. Nothing serious. I don’t see doctors much. Never liked them much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure in the past, you stopped taking medication for it because of tiredness, and some knee pain. Do you know what the name of the blood pressure medication was?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no. I don’t remember the name. Little white pill. That’s all I know. I stopped taking it… oh, maybe ten years ago? More? I don’t keep track of those things. I just… stopped. Felt better without it, even if I was a little… puffed up sometimes. My wife, she used to tell me to go back to the doctor, but… well, she’s gone now.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay, so a long time ago you were on medication for high blood pressure, stopped taking it due to tiredness, and haven't been regularly followed up with a doctor. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never had allergies. I eat everything. My wife, she was the one with the allergies. Pollen, dust… always sneezing. I never had a problem. Never. I think I'm pretty lucky, you know? Even now, at my age. Mostly just this headache. And the knees. But mostly the headache.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter things like aspirin or ibuprofen for the headache?
PATIENT: No, I haven't taken anything for it. I don’t like taking pills. I try to tough it out. My wife, she always had a bottle of something for everything. But I just… wait it out. Usually goes away on its own. That’s what I do. It’s been three days now, though. That’s why I came. It’s not going away like it usually does.
DOCTOR: Okay, you haven’t been taking anything for the headache and are usually able to wait it out, but it’s lasting longer than usual this time. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll take a look at your head and neck. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Just… don’t poke me too much. Old bones, you know. And don’t be surprised if I flinch a little. It's the headache, maybe. Makes me a little jumpy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. Your blood pressure is a little high, and I hear a slightly irregular rhythm when listening to your heart. I also feel some tenderness at the back of your head. Your lungs sound clear. I’m going to check your neurological function quickly – just your balance, reflexes, and a few simple things. This will help me understand what might be causing the headache. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Sounds… thorough. Balance, you say? Well, I used to be good at balancing things. Trains, mostly. Big heavy things. But that was a long time ago. Go ahead. Do what you need to do. Just be gentle, please. And tell me what you find, alright? I like to know what’s going on. Even if it’s not good news.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. Your gait is a little unsteady, and your reflexes are a bit slower than usual. You had some difficulty with the tandem walking test. Everything else seems okay. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like a few things could be going on. It could be a tension headache, related to stress and muscle tightness, especially given your wife's passing. The tenderness in your neck supports that. However, your high blood pressure and irregular heartbeat are concerning and could also be contributing to the headaches. And the unsteady gait warrants further investigation. I'd like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Well, I don't like tests, but… if you think it’s important, then yes. Do what you need to do. I want to feel better, you know? I just want this headache to go away. What kind of tests? Will they hurt? And… how much will they cost? I don’t have much money. My wife… she handled all that. I’m not very good with those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. I understand your concerns. We'll take things one step at a time. I'm going to order a blood test to check your overall health and kidney function, and an EKG to look at the electrical activity of your heart. The blood test will involve a simple blood draw – a little pinch, but it shouldn’t hurt much. The EKG is painless – we’ll just put some sticky pads on your chest. As for the cost, I’ll have the billing department check if there are any assistance programs available, given your insurance situation. We can also discuss options for more affordable testing if needed. It's important to rule out anything serious, and these tests will help us do that. I'm also going to start you on a low dose of medication for your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Low dose of pills, you say? Hmmm… I don't like pills, but… if it helps the headache and my heart… alright. Yes, alright. Do whatever you think is best, Doctor. And thank you. For explaining everything. And for checking about the money. My wife… she always knew what to do. I miss her. But… let’s do the tests. And the pills. Let’s just get this headache fixed.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brum. We'll get those tests ordered right away. I'll write you a prescription for a low dose of lisinopril for your blood pressure, and the nurse will go over the instructions with you. She’ll also schedule you for the blood test and EKG. In the meantime, I want you to focus on getting some rest, drinking plenty of water, and avoiding stress as much as possible. If the headache gets significantly worse, or you experience any new symptoms like vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Vision changes, weakness… okay, I’ll remember that. Emergency room… alright. No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. And tell the nurse to speak slowly, please. I don’t hear as well as I used to. That’s all. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. I'm glad I could help. I'll make a note for the nurse to speak slowly and clearly. We'll get you taken care of. If anything comes up, don't hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day, and please, take care of yourself. .
