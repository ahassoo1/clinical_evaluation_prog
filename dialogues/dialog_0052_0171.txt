DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Thut. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’. Doc, right? Yeah... my nails. They just… look funny. Not like they used to. I don't really know what’s wrong with ‘em, just… different. I noticed it a couple weeks ago, maybe? Time kinda runs together, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Shely is correct. Thank you for coming in to discuss this with me, Ms. Thut. It's good you're addressing it. “Different” is a good starting point. Could you describe what you mean by “different”?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… They’re kinda… ridged? Like, not smooth anymore. And one of ‘em, this one right here , it's got a white spot. Always been a strong nail person, I have, but now… they feel weak, too. Like they gonna break if I just look at ‘em wrong. Does that make sense? I don't know nothin' about nail stuff, honestly.
DOCTOR: Yes, that clarifies things considerably, Ms. Thut. Ridges and a white spot, along with a feeling of weakness – that gives us something to work with. To get a better understanding, have you noticed any changes in the color of your nails besides the white spot?
PATIENT: Color, huh? Not really. They're still, you know, kinda pinkish. Maybe a little… duller than usual? But I put polish on ‘em most the time, so it’s hard to tell. I get the bright red, usually. Covers up a lot of things, that polish does. I don’t pay too much attention, to be honest. Nails are nails, right? As long as they look okay.
DOCTOR: That's a fair point, Ms. Thut. The polish can certainly obscure things. Since you mentioned they feel weaker, have you experienced any pain or discomfort with your nails – perhaps when typing, doing housework, or just general use?
PATIENT: Nah, nothin’ like pain. Just… worried. They never felt like this before. I do a lot of stuff with my hands, bein’ an audiologist and all. Gotta fiddle with those little ear things, you know? Don't wanna break a nail mid-exam. That would be… embarrassing. I wouldn't wanna have to cancel on patients. They already complain enough about the wait times.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely, Ms. Thut. Being able to rely on your hands for your profession is essential. Let's delve a little deeper into your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as thyroid problems, anemia, or skin conditions like psoriasis?
PATIENT: Oh, medical stuff… Hmm. Let me think. Doctor always told me my blood pressure was a little high, years ago. Gave me some pills for it, but I stopped takin’ ‘em. Didn't like how they made me feel. Other than that… nothin’ I can recall, really. I don’t go to the doctor much. Waste of time, most of it. Just tell you to eat better and exercise more. Like I don't already know that! My mama had… somethin’ with her joints, I think. But I don't know what. Old age stuff, probably.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Thut. High blood pressure is good to know, even if you're not currently taking medication for it. And your mother’s joint issues are also helpful information. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had nothin’ like that. I try to stay outta hospitals. Bad smells and everything. I broke my arm once when I was a little girl, climbin’ a tree, but they just put a cast on it. That was a long time ago. Didn't need no surgery. I'm a pretty healthy person, generally. Just these nails… they're botherin’ me. Makes me feel old.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk about any medications you are currently taking – including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, and supplements. You mentioned stopping the blood pressure medication, but are you taking anything now?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin' for my arthritis sometimes. The doc gave it to me a while back. It’s… Naproxen, I think? Little white pill. And I take a multivitamin every day, the one with all the letters and numbers on it. I forget the name, though. It’s the cheap one from the store. That's about it. I don't like takin' a lot of pills. Messes with my stomach.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Naproxen and a multivitamin are good to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Don’t think so. Never had a bad reaction to nothin'. I eat all kinds of things. Spicy food, weird fruits… I got a strong stomach, I tell ya. My mama always said I could eat anything. Allergies are for other people, not me. I get a little sniffly sometimes in the spring, but that's just the pollen, I think. Not a real allergy, just… seasonal stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut, that’s very helpful. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to take a closer look at your nails. Could you please extend your hands, palms up?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. Go ahead, take a look. They ain't much to look at, honestly. Just old lady nails. I always did have strong hands, though. Gotta be, for my job. Fiddlin' with them tiny hearing aids all day. You let me know if you see somethin' scary, okay? I don't wanna hear nothin’ bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Thut. I’m observing some longitudinal ridging, which are those lines running the length of your nails. The white spot, known as a leukonychia, is fairly small. Your nails appear slightly brittle, but there’s no obvious inflammation or pitting. The nail beds themselves look normal in color. Overall, they don’t appear severely damaged. Based on what you’ve told me and my initial examination, the ridging and brittleness could be related to a few things, including minor nutritional deficiencies, trauma to the nail matrix , or even just the natural aging process. The white spot is often harmless and can sometimes resolve on its own. However, given the changes you’ve noticed, I’d like to order a few blood tests to rule out any underlying deficiencies like iron or vitamin B12. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… oh, great. I hate needles. But… if you think it's important, I guess. I don’t wanna be missin’ somethin’ serious. I just… don’t like bein’ poked and prodded. How many tests are we talkin' about? And will it take long? I got a patient comin' in this afternoon. I don't wanna be late. They'll complain somethin' fierce.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Thut. No one enjoys needles. We'll only need a standard complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to start, along with a check of your iron levels and vitamin B12. It shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes for the blood draw itself, and the lab usually has a quick turnaround time. We can get the results back within a couple of business days. I’ll also give you a prescription for a biotin supplement, which can help strengthen nails. It’s over-the-counter and generally well-tolerated. In the meantime, I recommend keeping your nails short and moisturized, and avoiding harsh chemicals like acetone-based nail polish remover. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Biotin... okay, I can try that. I’ll have to see if the store has it. Short nails… well, I like my nails a little long, but I guess I can manage. Harsh chemicals… I always used the cheap stuff, anyway. Probably ain’t doin’ me any favors. So, blood tests and biotin… and keep ‘em short. Sounds like a lot of work for a couple of nails. But… if it makes ‘em strong again, I guess it's worth it. Will Medicare cover the blood tests? I don't wanna get a big bill. I’m on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. Thut, and a valid concern. Yes, Medicare should cover the blood tests we’ve discussed, as they are considered medically necessary to investigate your nail changes. However, it's always best to confirm coverage with your insurance provider directly to be certain. I can provide you with the specific CPT codes for the tests, which will help them process your claim. Here you are. The codes are 85048, 80053, and 82565. Once we have the results back, we can discuss them in more detail and determine the best course of action. If the tests come back normal, and your symptoms persist, we might consider a referral to a dermatologist for further evaluation. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: CPT codes... okay. I’ll have to get my daughter to help me with those. She’s good with that stuff. Dermatologist… oh, great. More doctors. But… okay. Tests first, then maybe a skin doctor if nothin’ helps. You think this biotin will really work? I don’t wanna waste my money on somethin’ that ain’t gonna do nothin’. I got bills to pay, you know. So, I go get the blood drawn, then take the biotin… and we see what happens. Is there anything else I need to do? Or can I just go now? I got a patient waitin’. A very grumpy patient.
DOCTOR: That's correct, Ms. Thut – blood draw, biotin supplement, and then we’ll review the results when they’re available. Biotin can be helpful for some people, but it’s not a guaranteed solution. It’s a relatively inexpensive supplement, and it’s generally considered safe, so it’s worth a try. There’s nothing further you need to do at this time. I'll have the lab requisition form ready for you at the front desk. You can go ahead and schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the results. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks...okay, I can do that. As long as it don't interfere with my schedule. Alright, then. Lab form and then the grumpy patient. You been a big help, Doc. Even if it is just for a couple of nails. I appreciate you not makin' me feel like I'm crazy for worryin' about this. Some doctors just brush you off. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Thut. It’s important to address your concerns, no matter how small they may seem. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or experience any changes in the meantime. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks. .
