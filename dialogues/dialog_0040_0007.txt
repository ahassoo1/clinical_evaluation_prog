DOCTOR: Alright, Lakiya. Forty-two, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Forty-two years of age. Is there something wrong? I have things I need to attend to this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Yes, well… something brought you in, didn’t it?
PATIENT: It did. My… my body is causing me pain. Quite a lot of pain, actually. I don’t usually complain, but it’s… difficult to ignore now. I work with fences, you see. It’s hard work.
DOCTOR: Fences, right. And where is this pain, exactly?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly in my lower back. And it travels down my left leg. It feels like… like a bad ache, but sometimes it’s sharp. Very sharp. It makes walking difficult. I try to ignore it, but… well, you asked.
DOCTOR: Right, lower back radiating down the left leg. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: About… three months, I think. It started slow, just a little stiffness after work. I thought it was just from lifting the posts. But it hasn’t gotten better. It’s gotten worse, steadily. I haven't taken time off work though. I can't afford to.
DOCTOR: Three months... lifting posts. Hmm. Any numbness or tingling in your leg or foot?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. In my foot, mostly. The little toe, and sometimes along the side of my foot. It feels… like pins and needles. Not all the time, but often enough that I notice it. It’s worse when I’ve been on my feet all day.
DOCTOR: Pins and needles... Okay. And any bowel or bladder changes?
PATIENT: Bowel… or bladder changes? I… I don’t understand the question. Could you explain that in simpler terms, please? I’m not good with… medical words.
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any trouble… controlling your bladder or bowels?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. Everything is… normal in that respect. I apologize if I didn’t understand your first question, but those are… private things. I would know if something was wrong there.
DOCTOR: Yes, alright, good. Just checking. Let’s have you lie down on the exam table. I’ll take a look.
PATIENT: Very well. I suppose that is necessary. I hope this won’t take long. I have commitments this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Just lie flat, facing up. I need to check your reflexes and strength. And I'll palpate your spine. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Alright. Relax… I will try. It’s difficult when everything hurts. Do you need me to tell you if something causes me pain?
DOCTOR: Yes, tell me immediately if something hurts. And where, specifically. Don't just say "my back." Now, can you point to the exact spot where you feel the most pain right now?
PATIENT: Ow! There. Right there. That is… very tender. And a little to the left. It’s not a sharp pain, more like a deep ache that radiates outwards. Be careful, please. That really hurts.
DOCTOR: Tenderness at L4-L5. Okay. Now, can you lift your left leg, straight up, keeping it flat?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s difficult. It hurts too much. I can’t lift it very high. It pulls on my back, and the pain shoots down my leg. I can’t do that.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Don’t strain yourself. Now, can you try to stand on your tiptoes?
PATIENT: I can try. No. No, that’s… impossible. It hurts too much. My leg feels weak. I might fall. Please, I think I need to sit down.
DOCTOR: Weakness… Alright. I think we have enough for now. It sounds like you may have a pinched nerve. Possibly a herniated disc. We'll need some imaging to confirm, an MRI preferably. And I'll order some physical therapy.
PATIENT: Imaging… and therapy… Will that be expensive? I have Medicare, but… I don't want a large bill. And how long will this take? I need to know if I can still work. I have to provide for myself.
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover most of it, but there will likely be a copay. As for work… I can’t say for certain without the MRI results. You should avoid heavy lifting until we know more. I’ll write a note for “limited duty” work, but don’t expect to be back to normal right away. Here. The referral is for the imaging center, and this is a note for your employer. Physical therapy will be scheduled separately. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No. I think that is all. Thank you. I appreciate you seeing me, even if you haven’t given me good news. I need to go now. I have things to take care of. .
