DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Puder. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hello Doctor. My heart… it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s beating too fast, but not… regular. It scares my wife.
DOCTOR: “Funny,” huh?
PATIENT: Yeah. Not ha-ha funny. Like… it flutters. And then it’s okay for a while. But then it does it again. It’s been happening for maybe… two months now? I don’t know exactly. Time gets away from me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And does anything specifically seem to bring it on?
PATIENT: Not really. I work at the plant… with the chemicals. Sometimes when I’m… mixing things, it happens. But also when I’m just sitting and watching TV. It doesn’t seem to care. Maybe… when I drink too much coffee? But I like my coffee.
DOCTOR: Right. And you said two months. Has it been getting worse, staying the same, or… better, at all, during that time?
PATIENT: I think… worse, maybe? It didn’t bother me much at first. Just a little skip here and there. Now… it lasts longer. And my wife gets really worried. She says I look pale when it happens. She’s a very good wife.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s get some basics down. Do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get a little tired sometimes, from the work. But everyone gets tired, right? Nothing the doctor needs to know about, I think. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. My wife makes me come.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries or hospital stays in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… when I was a little boy, I broke my arm falling out of a tree. But that was in Yemen, a long, long time ago. And… no, nothing else. No hospitals here. Just the broken arm. They put a cast on it. It healed okay.
DOCTOR: And family history?
PATIENT: Family… my father, he had… problems with his stomach, I think. He was always sick. And my mother, she died when I was young. Not from anything special, just… old age. I don’t think anyone had heart problems, but… I don’t really know. We didn’t talk much about that stuff. It was a long time ago, and… far away.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I can eat anything. I like spicy food. And I don’t take any medicine, except… sometimes for headaches. But just the over-the-counter stuff. Nothing special. I don’t have any bad reactions to anything I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about caffeine and nicotine?
PATIENT: I like my coffee, like I said. Maybe three or four cups a day? Sometimes more when I’m busy at work. And… I used to smoke, a long time ago. But I stopped. Maybe ten years ago? It was bad for me, my wife said. She was right. I don’t smoke anymore.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Well, Mr. Puder, it sounds like you’re experiencing palpitations. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. Then we’ll do a quick EKG. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want it to stop. The fluttering. It scares my wife. And… it makes me nervous too.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just lie down on the table, we’ll get started. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Like this? Is this good? My wife always tells me to breathe deep when I’m stressed. She’s very good at knowing what I need.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your lungs sound clear. Heart rate… a little fast, but regular for now. Blood pressure is 130/85. Not terrible, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to attach some stickers to your chest to get an EKG. It won't hurt a bit. Just lie still.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Stickers are fine. I don’t like needles, but stickers are okay. It feels… a little cold. Is this going to take long? I have to get back to work later. The plant needs me.
DOCTOR: Just a few minutes. Okay, hold still… and breathe normally. We're getting a good reading. Hmm…
PATIENT: Is something wrong, Doctor? It looks… complicated. All those lines and squiggles. My wife is very good at reading things. Maybe she could help? She’s a very smart woman.
DOCTOR: It’s… inconclusive. Your heart rhythm is mostly normal, but there are a few… irregularities. It's not enough to be overly concerned about right now, but it's enough to warrant further investigation. I’m going to order some blood work to check your thyroid levels and electrolytes. And I want you to wear a Holter monitor for 24 hours. It records your heart rhythm continuously. It's just a precaution. It's probably nothing, but we need to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: A Holter… what is that? More stickers? And blood work… I don’t like needles, Doctor. What if it’s something serious? My wife… she will be very worried. What do you think it could be? Is it from the plant? The chemicals?
DOCTOR: A Holter monitor is a small device, about the size of a pager, that you wear on your chest with… yes, some stickers. It records your heart’s electrical activity. As for what it could be… honestly, Mr. Puder, it could be a lot of things. Anxiety, caffeine, a minor electrolyte imbalance… or something more significant. It’s unlikely it’s related to the chemicals at the plant, but we can’t rule it out completely. The blood work and Holter monitor will give us a better idea. Honestly, you’re relatively young and healthy-appearing. It’s probably nothing to worry about, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. I’ll have the nurse explain the Holter monitor and draw your blood.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. If you think it's best. My wife will be glad you’re being careful. She always worries about me. And… I’ll try not to drink too much coffee. But it’s hard. It helps me at work. Maybe the nurse can explain everything slowly? I don’t understand all the words you’re saying. And… I really don’t like needles. .
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the nurse come in and explain everything. Don’t worry, she’s very good at explaining things. And yes, she’ll be gentle with the needle. I’ll see you in a week to discuss the results. .
