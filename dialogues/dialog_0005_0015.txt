DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… my sinuses, I think. They feel… bad. Like a lot of pressure. It’s been… a little while now. I don't remember exactly how long, sorry.
DOCTOR: Right. "Bad" sinuses. A little while... That's helpful. Okay. And what exactly does "bad" mean?
PATIENT: Hmm. It hurts… here, and here. <points to forehead and cheeks> And I feel… full. Like when you have a cold, but… not a cold. No fever, I don't think. Just… stuffy. It makes it hard to… breathe sometimes, through my nose. Is that… okay to explain? I'm not good with… the words.
DOCTOR: It’s fine. A lot of people aren't good with "the words," as you say. Okay, so pressure in your forehead and cheeks, feeling stuffed up… no fever. When did this start?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. The time… I really don’t know. Maybe… last month? Or maybe before. It’s hard to say. Work has been… busy. A lot of long days with the drill. My husband, he tries to remind me of things, but… sometimes I forget. I am sorry. It just… comes and goes, this feeling.
DOCTOR: Right. “Comes and goes.” A month, maybe. And this “work”... you said something about a "drill"?
PATIENT: Yes. I work with the… the big drills. For oil. It’s… hard work, out in the field. A lot of noise. And dust, I think. We have masks, but… sometimes they don’t feel enough. It's… Rotary Drill Operators, they call it. Is that… important? It feels like it might have something to do with my… sinuses.
DOCTOR: Rotary Drill Operators... dust exposure, noise… yes, that could be relevant. It certainly explains why you aren’t remembering things clearly. Okay. Have you had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. <pauses, frowning> I… I get headaches, sometimes. Behind my eyes. And… I smell things funny. Like… something is burning, but there is nothing burning. My husband says I talk in my sleep, but I don't remember that either. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: “Funny” smells... headaches, sleep-talking… Okay. And what about a cough?
PATIENT: A cough? Not much. Sometimes, a little tickle in my throat, but not… a big cough. More like… I need to clear my throat. It happens more when I… lay down, I think. <pauses> Oh! And I feel… tired. Very tired. But I work hard, so maybe that’s just… normal tiredness.
DOCTOR: "Very tired," huh?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Very tired. Even after I sleep. It's… hard to explain. Not just the body tired, but… the mind tired too. Like… everything is a little blurry. It's been happening more lately, I think. <fidgets with her hands> My husband worries about me. He says I should rest more.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam. I want to listen to your lungs and take a look at your sinuses. It's probably just a sinus infection, but we need to rule other things out. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can stand. <stands slowly> Is… is it something bad? I get… scared sometimes, when I don’t know what’s happening. But I will do whatever you need. Just… please explain it to me, slowly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just lean forward. I’m going to listen to your lungs first. Breathe deeply through your mouth, if you can. <places stethoscope on Ms. Boham’s back, listens for a few moments> Okay. Sounds clear, but a little congested. Now, I'm going to palpate your sinuses. This might be a little uncomfortable. <presses gently on Ms. Boham’s forehead and cheeks> Does that hurt?
PATIENT: Yes. <winces slightly> Here… it hurts. <points to her right cheekbone> And a little here, on my forehead. It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp. Like… pressure, like you said before. Is something… wrong? I feel a little dizzy now. <leans forward slightly>
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness over the right sinus, dull ache. A little dizziness. We’ll need to check your vital signs. Nurse, can you please come in and take Ms. Boham’s blood pressure, pulse, and temperature?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. <looks around nervously> I don't… I don’t like feeling dizzy. Is that… something to worry about? Maybe I just need some water. My husband always says I forget to drink enough water. <pauses> I’m sorry if I’m… a lot of trouble.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being a trouble, Ms. Boham. Just trying to get a full picture. It could be something as simple as dehydration and a sinus infection, but we have to rule other things out. Let's just take a few minutes while the nurse gets those readings. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. <pauses, thinking hard> I don’t think so. Not that I know of. My husband… he gives me something for the dust at work sometimes. A little pill. But I don’t remember the name. It doesn’t… make me sick, so I guess I’m not allergic to it. But I don't… I don't take much medicine, usually. It makes me… sleepy. <fidgets with her hands again>
DOCTOR: "Doesn’t make me sick" isn't the same as not being allergic. Knowing what you're taking is important. Do you have any idea what this pill looks like?
PATIENT: Oh! <brightens slightly> Yes! I think… it's small and white. Round, with… a line down the middle. I think it has a number on it. But I can't remember the number. My husband keeps it in… a little plastic bottle. In the kitchen, I think. He's better at remembering things. <pauses, frowning> I'm sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… everything is a little foggy.
DOCTOR: Right. A small, white, round pill with a line. This is… concerning. Ms. Boham, with your symptoms and your difficulty remembering, I'm worried about possible lead exposure from your work. Lead can cause memory problems, headaches, and dizziness. It’s important to get this checked out. We need to order a blood lead level test immediately.
PATIENT: Lead… exposure? <eyes widen, looking frightened> From the… drill? But we wear masks! My husband… he would never let anything happen to me. Is it… very bad? What does that… mean? I feel… scared now, Doctor. Very scared. <starts to tremble slightly>
DOCTOR: Now, now. Let's not panic. The masks should protect you, but we have to be sure. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong, but we need to rule it out. We'll draw some blood and send it to the lab. It’s standard procedure. And frankly, Ms. Boham, with your history of memory issues, it’s irresponsible not to check. I’m going to order the blood test, and I’m also going to recommend a consultation with a neurologist to assess your cognitive function. Would you like me to refer you to someone immediately?
PATIENT: <trembles, looking down at her hands> A… neurologist? Cognitive… what? This is… a lot. I just came in for my sinuses. I don't… I don't understand. Is it very expensive? We… we don’t have much money. And… will they find something bad? I’m scared to know. <looks up, eyes filled with tears> Maybe… maybe I just need some rest. And some water. I don’t want any tests if it’s going to be very expensive. My husband… he works so hard. I don't want to… worry him.
