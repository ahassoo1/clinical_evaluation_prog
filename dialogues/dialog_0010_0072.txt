DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a little embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been having trouble remembering things lately. It’s not like, big important things all the time, but… just little stuff. Like where I put my keys, or why I walked into a room. It’s been worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Heidenthal, no need to be embarrassed at all. Memory issues are quite common, and we can certainly look into this. It's good you're addressing it. When did you first start noticing these little lapses in memory?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It's hard to pinpoint exactly. Maybe… six months ago? It started very slowly, just forgetting where I left things. Now it feels like it’s happening more often, and sometimes… it’s a little more than just keys. I might forget a name, or what I was saying mid-sentence. It’s frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. Six months is a reasonable timeframe to start investigating. And it’s good you’re able to articulate how it’s progressing. To help me get a better picture, can you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Well, I’m a dentist, so most of my day is spent at the practice. I usually get in around 8, see patients until about 5, with a lunch break of course. It's pretty routine, lots of check-ups and fillings. I live alone, so evenings are quiet. I usually cook dinner, watch some TV, maybe read. Nothing too exciting. I try to stay active, go for walks when I can, but work keeps me pretty busy. I do have a bit of a walk to get to work, if that matters?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. The walk could matter, just in terms of overall activity level. You mentioned a fairly routine day. Have you experienced any significant changes or stressors in the last six months – anything at all, work-related or personal?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, I don’t think so. Work’s been… work. Same as always, a few difficult patients here and there, but nothing major. Personally… my mother’s health hasn’t been great, but that’s been going on for a while now, it hasn't suddenly gotten worse. Oh! There was that new software the practice made us switch to… that was annoying, but I’ve gotten used to it now. It’s not like it stressed me out, exactly. It was just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. The software change is worth noting; sometimes even seemingly small changes can contribute to mental fatigue. Let's talk a little bit about your symptoms themselves. You mentioned forgetting names and mid-sentence thoughts. Do you find that you have trouble recalling recent events more than older memories?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely recent events. Like, I can remember things from childhood perfectly fine. Or what I had for breakfast last week. But yesterday? Sometimes it's a bit… hazy. It's like trying to grasp smoke. It's not a complete blank, just… the details are fuzzy. And names are the worst! I’ll be talking to someone and just… the name slips my mind. It’s so embarrassing!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Heidenthal. That pattern – difficulty with recent memory but older memories intact – is certainly something we want to explore further. Now, have you noticed any other changes alongside the memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have been a bit more… clumsy lately. Knocking things over, bumping into furniture. Nothing major, but my friend mentioned I seemed a bit uncoordinated when we went for a walk last week. And… I’ve been sleeping more, I guess. More tired, even when I get enough hours. It's hard to say if that's related, though. Could just be the summer heat!
DOCTOR: Okay, those are both potentially relevant details – the clumsiness and increased fatigue. I want to get a better understanding of your overall health. Do you have any known medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, and I broke my arm once, but nothing long-term. I have regular check-ups with my GP, and he usually says I’m pretty healthy. My blood pressure is usually good, I think, and I’ve never been told I have diabetes. I do take a multivitamin, that's it. And I drink a lot of water.
DOCTOR: Good. That's helpful to know. And just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, as far as I know. I can take pretty much any medication without any problems. My friend is allergic to penicillin, but that's not me! I always double-check with the pharmacist anyway, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, Ms. Heidenthal, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to assess your neurological function. That includes checking your reflexes, balance, and coordination, and a basic cognitive assessment, just some simple memory tests. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on, so I'm all for it. .
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Okay, Ms. Heidenthal, I'm going to ask you to stand up for me, if you're able. Let's start with a simple Romberg test... Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. This is… a bit wobbly, to be honest. I haven’t done this since school.
DOCTOR: That's alright, it's not something people do every day. I’m just observing your balance. Now, let’s check your reflexes... Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits. Now, I’m going to ask you to recall three objects. I'll say them, and then after a few minutes, I’ll ask you to repeat them. Ready?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm ready. . Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. The three objects are: apple, table, and penny. Try to remember those. . Okay, Ms. Heidenthal, can you recall the three objects I asked you to remember?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Apple… and… table… Oh, gosh, I’m already forgetting. And… penny? Yes! Apple, table, and penny. Was that right?
DOCTOR: That's good, you recalled all three! Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions about your orientation to time and place. What is the date today?
PATIENT: Today is… August 2nd. 2025, right? Yes, August 2nd, 2025. .
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: We’re… at your clinic. In the… rural part of town. Doctor Annesley's clinic. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Heidenthal. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam results, there are a few possibilities. The recent memory lapses, combined with the increased fatigue and slight unsteadiness, warrant further investigation. It’s not necessarily anything serious, but it’s important to rule out potential causes. I think it’s prudent to order some blood tests. .
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds sensible. What kind of blood tests? And what are we… ruling out? It’s a bit scary just hearing “investigation” and “ruling out.” .
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Heidenthal. We're going to do a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, a thyroid panel to assess your thyroid function, and a Vitamin B12 level. We'll also check your glucose levels, and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. We're ruling out things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid issues, diabetes, or other underlying medical conditions that can cause cognitive symptoms. It could also be something as simple as a mild medication side effect, though you aren’t taking anything regularly. And while less likely, we want to rule out any early signs of neurological problems. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. And yes, I’m comfortable with them. I’d rather know, I suppose. Will I need to come back for another appointment once the results are in? And… how long will that take?
DOCTOR: Good. It's best to be proactive. The lab work should take about a week to process. I’ll call you as soon as the results are available, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to stay hydrated, get regular, moderate exercise, and maintain a balanced diet. If you notice any sudden changes in your symptoms – like difficulty speaking, weakness on one side of your body, or severe headaches – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve… put my mind a little at ease, even with the tests. It's good to have a plan. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I'm glad I could help, and remember, we’re here to support you. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. She’ll explain the procedure. . Have a good day, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns.
