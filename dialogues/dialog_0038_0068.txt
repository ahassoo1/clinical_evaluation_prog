DOCTOR: Good morning, Sasha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Neeraj Auelua. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's... this swelling. It's been happening since the cancer treatment. It's mostly in my legs, you see? It's not painful, exactly, just… puffy. I hope you can help.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sasha, I understand. Swelling in your legs since cancer treatment. That's definitely something we want to look into. To get a better idea of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about the cancer treatment you had?
PATIENT: Oh, um... let me think. It was… chemotherapy, I think? And then some radiation. It was a long time ago, maybe five years? It was at the big hospital downtown. They gave me lots of things through the IV. I don’t remember all the names, sorry. It was… a lot to take in. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly okay, Sasha, don’t worry about remembering specific names. Five years ago with chemo and radiation… that gives me a good starting point. And it's completely understandable that it's hard to recall everything. Now, you said the swelling started since the treatment. Was it gradual, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Hmm… gradual, I think. It didn’t just pop up one day. It got a little worse each month, maybe? At first I thought it was just from sitting too long, you know? But it didn’t go away. Now it’s… noticeable. Especially at the end of the day.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset, worse with prolonged sitting, and noticeable now, especially at the end of the day. That’s helpful. Is it worse in both legs, or is one leg more affected than the other?
PATIENT: Both legs, pretty much the same, I think. Maybe the right one is a little more puffy, but not much. It's hard to tell, really. They both feel… heavy. And sometimes my ankles feel a bit… tight? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Sasha. Heavy and tight ankles, along with the swelling… alright. Have you noticed any changes in your skin color in those areas?
PATIENT: Skin color… hmm. I don't think so. It looks… normal, I suppose. Maybe a little paler than usual? But I don't really pay attention to that sort of thing. I mostly just notice the puffiness. And the heaviness.
DOCTOR: Okay, no noticeable changes in skin color, just the swelling and heaviness. Alright. Have you had any pain in your chest, shortness of breath, or dizziness recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no chest pain or anything like that. I get a little… breathless if I climb too many stairs, but that’s just because I’m… not as young as I used to be! And no dizziness, thankfully. I just want this swelling to go away. It makes it hard to wear my shoes.
DOCTOR: I understand, Sasha. It sounds quite bothersome, and we want to get to the bottom of it. Just to get a fuller picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a bit of a… mess, I’m afraid. Besides the cancer, I have… high blood pressure, I think? And my doctor told me I had some cholesterol problems. I take pills for both, but I forget which ones sometimes. I go to a different doctor for that, you see. It's all a bit confusing. Medicare pays for it all, so I don’t worry too much about the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and cholesterol problems, managed with medication. That’s helpful to know. And it’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember all the details, we can look that up in the system if you'd like. Do you know if you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of! I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat everything, I just… try to avoid too much sugar. My mother always said sugar was bad for you.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Good to know. And finally, just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your urine?
PATIENT: Urine? Oh… um… not really. It looks… normal, I guess? Sometimes it’s a little darker if I don’t drink enough water, but that’s all. I try to drink plenty of water, but I forget sometimes. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is good information, Sasha. Thanks for sharing all of that with me. It sounds like you’ve given me a pretty good overview. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your legs and ankles. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I just want this swelling gone. It's getting embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sasha. Let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's take a look at your legs and ankles. Okay, I do see some noticeable swelling in both legs, as you mentioned, and it's a bit more pronounced on the right side. Your skin feels warm and there's no significant tenderness. I'm also noting some slight discoloration around your ankles, a bit of brownish tint. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve observed during the exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing lymphedema, possibly related to your previous cancer treatment. It’s also important to rule out other causes, like venous insufficiency or heart failure. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, kidney function tests, and a BNP to check your heart function. I also think it would be helpful to get an ultrasound of both legs to assess the blood flow. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Lymp-e-de-ma? Is that serious? And blood tests and ultrasounds… it sounds like a lot. I just want to be able to wear my shoes again! But… if you think it's necessary, Doctor, then yes, okay. Do whatever you need to do. Just… please explain everything to me afterwards? I get confused easily.
DOCTOR: Of course, Sasha. I will absolutely explain everything thoroughly. You’re right, it can feel a bit overwhelming, but we'll take it one step at a time. Lymphedema is a condition where fluid builds up in the tissues, often due to damage to the lymphatic system. In your case, it's likely related to your cancer treatment, as the radiation or surgery can sometimes affect the lymph nodes and drainage. It's not necessarily serious in the sense of being immediately life-threatening, but it can cause discomfort, swelling, and make it difficult to move around, as you’ve experienced. The sooner we address it, the better we can manage it. The blood tests will help rule out other potential causes and give us a better understanding of your overall health. The ultrasound will help us look at the blood flow in your legs and see if there's any evidence of blood clots or other problems. I'll get the orders sent to the lab right away. They’ll call you to schedule the tests, and the ultrasound clinic will contact you as well. It's usually pretty quick to get everything done. In the meantime, I’d recommend elevating your legs whenever possible, and wearing compression stockings. I’ll write you a prescription for those, too. Would you like me to explain anything else right now, or would you prefer to wait until we have the test results?
PATIENT: Compression stockings? Oh, those stretchy things? My sister used to wear them. But aren’t they… uncomfortable? And elevating my legs… I suppose I can do that. I have a recliner. I think… I think that’s all for now. I just… I’m a little worried, to be honest. But thank you for explaining everything. And thank you for not making me feel silly. I just want to get back to normal.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sasha. It’s perfectly normal to be worried, and I’m glad I could help ease your concerns a little. And you’re not silly at all – it’s my job to listen and explain things clearly. Compression stockings can take a little getting used to, but they can really help reduce the swelling and discomfort. We'll start with a lower compression level and see how you tolerate them. If they’re too uncomfortable, we can adjust the strength or try a different brand. I’m going to write you a prescription for the stockings, and also a note for a physical therapist. A physical therapist can teach you some exercises to help improve the circulation in your legs and manage the swelling. Here’s a summary of everything we discussed: Prescription for compression stockings Order for blood tests Order for ultrasound Referral to physical therapy I'll also send a copy of all of this to your primary care physician. I’ll have the receptionist give you these papers as you leave. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the test results, usually in about a week. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden pain, redness, or warmth in your legs, or if the swelling gets significantly worse, please don’t hesitate to call the office immediately. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I just… I hope these tests don’t take too long. And I hope the stockings aren’t too awful. I suppose I’ll go home and try to relax. And elevate my legs. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sasha. I’m glad I could help. Don't worry about the tests – we'll get them done as quickly as possible. And I’m confident we can find compression stockings that are comfortable for you. Take care of yourself, elevate those legs, and try to relax. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. Have a good day, Sasha.
