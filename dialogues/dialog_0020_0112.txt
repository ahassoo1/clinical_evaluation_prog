DOCTOR: Good morning, Keoni. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve been… going to the bathroom a lot. Much more than usual, lately. It’s… frequent. I'm not quite sure why it started, to be honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. Frequent urination… I understand. It's perfectly alright to feel a little embarrassed, it's why you came here. And don't worry about your memory, we’ll take things slowly. When you say “a lot,” could you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Before, I'd go, perhaps… three or four times a day? Normal, I believe. Now? It feels like every couple of hours. Even during the night, I’m getting up. It’s… disruptive, and rather tiring, actually. I don’t… recall it being this bad before, but then, like I said, my memory… it’s patchy. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Keoni. Every couple of hours, including at night… that definitely indicates a change. And it’s good you’re noticing it. Do you experience any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain…? No, not exactly pain. It’s not… sharp or anything. Sometimes, a little discomfort, perhaps, a sort of… mild stinging, but it’s not constant. It's very fleeting, if that makes sense. More often, it just feels like I still need to go, even after I’ve just been. Does that clarify anything? I apologize for being so vague. It's difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: No apology needed at all, Keoni. It's perfectly alright. You’re explaining things very well. A mild stinging, occasionally, and a feeling of incomplete emptying… that's good information. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… color and smell. Let me think. I… I honestly haven’t paid much attention, Doctor. I know, it's silly. I just… go. I haven’t seen anything alarming, I don’t think. It’s generally… clear, as far as I can recall, but I don’t actively look, you understand? And the smell… I suppose it smells like… urine? I’m terribly sorry, I’m not being very helpful, am I? Perhaps I should try to be more observant?
DOCTOR: You are being perfectly helpful, Keoni. Don't worry about it at all. It's not everyone's habit to carefully observe these things! Knowing you haven’t noticed any significant changes is still useful. Alright. And have you noticed any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I haven’t felt feverish. Chills, no. And abdominal pain… sometimes a little discomfort, low down, but nothing severe. It’s not constant, and it’s not… debilitating. More like a dull ache, on occasion. It’s hard to say if it’s even related, to be honest. I do… occasionally have stomach troubles, but I assumed that was just… something I live with. Is that making sense? I’m rambling, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Keoni. You're doing fine. It’s good to know about the occasional abdominal discomfort, and that you haven’t had any fever or chills. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes or urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… that’s… tricky. I had a divorce a few years back, and things were rather chaotic. I wasn't very good at keeping track of appointments then. I believe I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, rubella… but nothing serious. I don’t… recall ever being diagnosed with anything like diabetes. And urinary tract infections… I think I had one once, years ago, but I don’t remember the details. I just remember feeling unwell. I saw a doctor, I took some pills, and it went away. It’s all rather hazy, I'm afraid. I’m so sorry. My ex-husband handled most of the paperwork then. Is there a way to… find out?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Keoni. It's very common for things to be a bit unclear during stressful times. We can definitely try to find out. Let me see if there’s anything recorded here. Okay… it looks like there is a record of a UTI about five years ago, treated with a course of antibiotics. No record of diabetes. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a serious reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. I’m generally alright with most medications. Perhaps a slight upset stomach with some, but nothing major. No hives, no swelling, nothing like that. I used to take… something for headaches, years ago, but I don’t remember the name. It’s all a bit of a blur. I really wish my memory were better. It’s so frustrating.
DOCTOR: It is frustrating, I understand. Don't worry about it. We'll do the best we can. No known allergies, that’s good. Alright. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle? And… if I start to ramble, feel free to stop me. I do apologize in advance.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Keoni. I will be as gentle as possible, and you can stop me anytime. Take a few deep breaths for me, please. Okay, everything sounds normal so far. Now I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen, just to feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: It's… a little tender, actually, on this side. Not sharp, but… a dull ache, like a pressure. It's not constant, it comes and goes. And… yes, here too, a little bit. It’s more noticeable when you press, though. It's not something I'd normally be aware of. Oh, and… that’s a little uncomfortable, there. It’s… a sort of burning sensation, but very mild. I'm probably being overly sensitive, aren't I? I apologize.
DOCTOR: No, you're not being overly sensitive at all. It's important to let me know what you're feeling. Okay, I'm noting the tenderness in your lower quadrants and above your pubic bone. Now I'm going to listen to your back, just to rule out any kidney issues. Everything sounds clear on your back as well. Okay. Based on the exam, there's some tenderness in your lower abdomen, which could indicate a few different things. The burning sensation above your pubic bone is also worth investigating.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… concerning. What sort of things? I'm rather worried now, if I'm honest. Is it serious? And what happens next? I do apologize for asking so many questions. I just… I’d like to know what I'm facing, if possible.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to ask questions, Keoni. That's what I'm here for. And it's good that you're expressing your concerns. Based on what you've told me and the exam, the tenderness could be due to a number of things, including a urinary tract infection, a bladder issue, or even something like muscle strain. The burning sensation could be related to inflammation. However, it's important to rule out anything more serious. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a urine analysis and a urine culture. This will help us determine if there’s an infection and what bacteria is causing it. I'd also recommend a basic blood work panel to check your kidney function and rule out other potential causes. Do you have any allergies to latex or any concerns about the blood work?
PATIENT: No, no allergies to latex, and… blood work is fine. A little daunting, perhaps, but fine. So, a urine analysis and blood work. And then… what? What happens after the tests? Will I need more tests? Will I need medication? And… is it painful? I'm terribly sorry for being so anxious. It's just… everything feels so uncertain.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be anxious, Keoni. It's understandable when things feel uncertain. After the tests, we’ll review the results. If the urine analysis and culture show an infection, we'll start you on a course of antibiotics. We’ll choose an antibiotic that’s appropriate for the specific bacteria causing the infection. The blood work will help us assess your overall health and kidney function, and rule out any other potential issues. Whether you'll need more tests depends on the results of these initial tests. If everything comes back normal, we may need to investigate further to determine the cause of your symptoms. The blood work is typically just a standard needle prick, so it’s usually not very painful. You might feel a slight sting, but it’s generally well-tolerated. I’ll give you a lab requisition for both tests now. You can go to [Name of Local Lab] on [Street Address]. They're open from [Opening Hours] to [Closing Hours]. Do you think you can get there easily?
PATIENT: Yes, [Name of Local Lab]… I believe I’ve driven past there a few times. I can get there easily enough, yes. [Opening Hours] to [Closing Hours]… that gives me plenty of time. A requisition, right. And… is there anything else I need to know? Do I need to fast before the blood work? Do I need to avoid drinking anything before the urine sample? I'm trying to remember everything you've said, but my mind is a bit of a jumble.
DOCTOR: That's a good question. Yes, you'll need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood work. That means no food or drinks, except water. For the urine sample, it's best to collect a midstream sample – that means you start urinating, then collect the sample mid-flow, and finish urinating. It's also helpful to avoid drinking a lot of fluids right before the sample. I've also written down these instructions on the requisition for you. It's also good to let the lab technician know that you’ve been experiencing some abdominal discomfort. Once you have the results, you can either call the clinic to schedule a follow-up appointment, or you can bring the results with you when you come in. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Fast for 8 hours, midstream sample, and bring the results or schedule an appointment. I'll remember that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me, and… I feel a little less anxious now, if I’m honest. It’s just… dealing with this on my own has been difficult. Is there anything I need to do now, before I leave? Or am I free to go?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Keoni. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. It's completely understandable that dealing with this on your own has been difficult. No, you're free to go now. Just remember to take the requisition with you, and try to get the tests done as soon as possible. If you experience any worsening symptoms – like a high fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your urine – please don't hesitate to call the clinic or go to the emergency room. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor Beinborn. You’ve been wonderful. I suppose I’ll… go get the tests done. And… I’ll try to remember everything. I really hope it’s nothing serious. Have a good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: You too, Keoni. And don’t worry too much. We'll figure out what's going on.
