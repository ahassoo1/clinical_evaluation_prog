DOCTOR: Right. Londell, is it?
PATIENT: That’s right, Londell Kammans. Pleased to meet you, Doctor… Osga, wasn't it? Sorry, getting older, names don’t stick like they used to. But I’m here for a men’s health check-up, if you will. My wife… well, she always kept on top of these things, and now it falls to me.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, the wife. They always do. Look, I’ve got a busy schedule. A “men’s health check-up” is… broad. What specifically are you worried about?
PATIENT: Well, now, that's a fair question. Truth is, I haven’t really been worried about anything specific. Just… feeling my age, I suppose. A little slower to bounce back after things, you know? And… well, things just aren’t working the way they used to. It’s probably just old age, but figured I’d get it checked out while I’m still able. Is that… enough of a worry, I guess?
DOCTOR: Right. “Feeling your age.” Vague. Let’s get this over with. Any pain?
PATIENT: No, not really pain, no. More like… discomfort. And not all the time, mind you. Mostly… down there. It’s not sharp, just… a dull ache sometimes. And it sometimes takes a bit longer to… well, you know. To get things going. I’m probably just rambling.
DOCTOR: Look, I need specifics. Is it before, during, or after… activity?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… mostly during. Though sometimes a little before, if I’m… anticipating things. And sometimes lingers a bit after, if you follow. It’s not constant, like I said. And it’s not bad bad, just… noticeable. Enough to make me wonder if everything's alright, you know? My wife used to say I worried too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any changes in urinary habits?
PATIENT: Urinary habits… Hmm. Let me think. I get up more at night than I used to, maybe? Just once or twice, though. And sometimes it feels like I don’t quite empty everything out. Not every time, but more often than it used to. I figured that was just the prostate acting up, like I’ve heard tell. Is that what you’re getting at? I don’t have any burning or anything like that, if that helps.
DOCTOR: "Heard tell." Right. Well, let's just confirm what you've "heard tell". I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just a prostate check, nothing dramatic. Try to relax.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. A… a prostate check. I… I guess that makes sense. Never had one of those before. Is it… is it going to be uncomfortable? And how long does it take? Not that I’m scared, exactly, just… curious. My wife always handled all the medical stuff, so I never really had to ask these questions.
DOCTOR: It’s… not pleasant. It’ll be quick. Try to breathe. I’ll let you know what I find. If you could just lie down on your side, please.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Side, right? Just… let me know when you’re ready. And… if it’s going to be bad, just tell me. I can handle it. Probably. Just try to be quick, alright? I don’t do well with… poking and prodding, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Definitely enlarged. Some nodularity. Alright. It’s not… ideal. I’m going to order a PSA test – that's a blood test to check for prostate cancer markers. Also, a urine analysis to rule out infection. We'll need to schedule a follow-up to discuss the results. Don’t panic, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious.
PATIENT: Cancer markers… Oh. Well. That doesn't sound good. A blood test, you said? And… and what if it is something serious? I mean, what are the options? My wife… she always knew what questions to ask. I don’t even know where to start. Is this… is this something I should be really worried about?
DOCTOR: Look, let’s not jump to conclusions. It could be benign prostatic hyperplasia – BPH – that's just an enlarged prostate, common with age. The PSA test will give us more information. If it’s elevated, we might need to consider a biopsy. There are treatments available, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. I’ll have the nurse schedule the tests for you. Don't Google everything, you’ll just scare yourself. And honestly, I have other patients waiting. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. A little hay fever in the spring, but nothing serious. Penicillin, maybe? My wife thought I was allergic, but it was a long time ago. A biopsy… that sounds… unpleasant. And what about the treatments? Are we talking… surgery? I just… I’m not sure I’m ready for surgery. This is all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. I just wanted a little check-up, not… all of this. Is there anything… anything I can do right now? To make things better? Or… or just to calm down?
DOCTOR: Look, it's all manageable. The nurse will explain everything. Honestly, you’re making me late for my next appointment. Try to stay calm. And, if you feel any pain or difficulty urinating, go to the emergency room. Allergies noted. Penicillin. .
PATIENT: .
