DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbose. I am Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Please, call me Westly. Hmm… what brings me in. Well, it’s… it’s about going to the bathroom, I suppose. A lot. More than usual, certainly. It’s been… a bit disruptive, if you understand. I don’t quite recall when it started, to be honest. It feels like a while now.
DOCTOR: I understand, Westly. Frequent urination can certainly be disruptive. It’s good you came in to get it checked. You mentioned it’s been going on for a while… and you’re having to go more often than usual. Could you describe what a “usual” day looked like for you before this started?
PATIENT: That’s… difficult. My memory isn’t what it used to be, Doctor. I… I used to go, well, when I needed to, naturally. Perhaps three or four times a day? No, that doesn’t sound right… Maybe fewer. It wasn’t something I counted, you see. I just… went. It wasn’t a preoccupation. Now… now it's quite a bit more. I do find myself thinking about where the restrooms are when I go places. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make perfect sense, Westly. And it’s perfectly alright that you don’t recall exact numbers. We'll work with what you do remember. So, it’s increased from a relatively infrequent need to needing to find restrooms frequently now. Do you experience any urgency – a sudden, strong need to go – or is it a gradual feeling?
PATIENT: Urgency… yes, I think so. Sometimes it builds… rather quickly. Not always, mind you. Sometimes it’s a gentle reminder, and I can wait a bit. But other times… it’s quite sudden. I’ve had a few… close calls, shall we say. It’s not painful, thankfully, just… inconvenient. And a bit worrying, I suppose. It’s not something one anticipates, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it isn’t, Westly. And it's good you're addressing it. The urgency is helpful information. Now, when you do go to the bathroom, do you find yourself emptying your bladder completely, or do you feel like you have to go back shortly afterwards?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I think I do empty it. Mostly. But… sometimes, shortly after, I feel the need to go again. Not a full bladder, mind you, just… a lingering sensation. It's rather difficult to describe. It’s not a strong urge, just… a feeling that there’s a little bit left. I often find myself going back just to be sure, if you understand. It’s probably nothing, but… it’s part of the reason I came.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Westly. Lingering sensation and the need to return shortly after is helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… hmm. Now that you mention it… I believe it’s… lighter in color, perhaps? I don’t normally pay much attention, to be honest. And I haven’t noticed any… unpleasant smells, or blood, thankfully. Just… paler, I think. Though, I could be mistaken. My eyesight isn’t what it used to be either.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Westly. You're providing excellent detail. Paler urine is noted. Now, let’s move on to some other questions. Do you have any pain or burning sensation when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. And no burning sensation. Not when I start, or finish. It’s… just the frequency, and the lingering feeling, and the pale color. It’s not a comfortable situation, but it’s not painful, thankfully. I’m relieved it’s not painful, at least. That would be most unpleasant.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Westly. No pain or burning is certainly a positive. Now, I’m going to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any past medical conditions – anything you’ve been diagnosed with in the past, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or prostate issues?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. That’s another thing I struggle with, Doctor. It was a long time ago, and I’ve seen many doctors over the years. I believe I had… some issues with my blood pressure, many years ago. They gave me some pills, and it seemed to resolve. I don’t recall anything about diabetes. And… I don’t believe I’ve ever been told anything about prostate issues. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is quite poor. I apologize. I’m trying my best. I do have Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Westly. We can often find information in your records. Medicare is helpful, yes. I see here a history of hypertension, as you mentioned, treated several years ago. No diabetes listed. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, I believe. And… I had a hernia operation, many years ago. Perhaps ten, fifteen years ago? It was… relatively minor, as I recall. Aside from those two, I don’t believe I’ve had any other surgeries. Although, it’s possible… my memory, as you know. It’s a bit like trying to piece together a puzzle with missing pieces.
DOCTOR: I understand. Appendectomy and hernia repair noted. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off of it years ago. Now… I take a multivitamin, occasionally. And… No, that’s it, I believe. I don’t take any regular medications. Just the multivitamin now and then. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly. Fruits and vegetables, you know. When I can remember to go to the market, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright, multivitamin only noted. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I recall. I used to be stung by a bee when I was a child, but I don’t believe I had a severe reaction. Just a bit of swelling, I think. Aside from that, no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, thankfully. I enjoy a good Czech pastry when I can find one.
DOCTOR: No known allergies noted. Alright, Westly, let’s move onto some questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never smoked. And I do not drink alcohol, either. Not at all. My father… he had some issues with alcohol, and I decided very early in life that it wasn’t for me. I prefer a good cup of tea, if you don’t mind. Much healthier, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s very good, Westly. No smoking or alcohol noted. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s another difficult one, Doctor. My family… we weren’t very good at keeping track of such things. My mother… she had some heart problems when she was older, I believe. And my grandfather… he had cancer, I think. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t recall the details. Aside from that, I don’t know much about my family’s medical history. We didn’t talk about such things very much. I apologize for being so vague. It’s not something I’ve ever paid much attention to.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Westly. Many people don't have detailed family medical histories. We can work with what you know. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also need to do a quick abdominal exam. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly acceptable. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I understand it’s necessary. Please, proceed. I’ll try to remain as still as possible. Although, I must warn you, my bones do creak a bit these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 145/90. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Lungs sound clear. Now, during the abdominal exam, I'm palpating your abdomen… I feel no masses or tenderness. Your bladder is… palpable, but not significantly distended. Now, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam just to check your reflexes and sensation.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. That sounds… thorough. Reflexes, you say? I hope they still work! I do sometimes forget where I put my keys, but I don’t think that’s a medical issue. Proceed as you need to. I'll cooperate as best as I can. Just let me know if anything feels… unusual. I believe I have a slightly sensitive lower back, from an old injury. But it shouldn’t interfere.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Sensation is intact. No significant deficits noted. Alright, Westly, the exam is complete. Based on your history and the physical findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of an overactive bladder, possibly with some underlying urgency. The slightly elevated blood pressure is also something we need to monitor. To help confirm this, I’d like to order a urinalysis to rule out infection, and a post-void residual urine test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An overactive bladder… that sounds… plausible, I suppose. All those trips to the restroom certainly suggest something is amiss. And the blood pressure… well, I wouldn’t be surprised. A urinalysis and a test to see how much urine is left… yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever tests you deem necessary, I’m happy to undergo. I trust your judgment. When would those tests be? And… how are they performed?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The urinalysis is a simple urine sample - I'll give you a container and instructions. You'll just need to collect a sample when you are able. The post-void residual urine test is performed after you urinate. A nurse will use a small ultrasound device to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder. It’s non-invasive and doesn’t cause any discomfort. We can do both tests here today. Would that be convenient for you?
PATIENT: Both tests today would be most convenient, yes. A simple urine sample… I can manage that. And the ultrasound… non-invasive, you say? That’s reassuring. I’m not fond of needles, you see. So, if it doesn’t involve a needle, all the better. Very well, Doctor. Let’s proceed with the tests. Just let me know when and where I should provide the sample, and where I should go for the ultrasound. I trust your nurse will guide me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Westly. I will have the nurse, Sarah, come in and explain the process and provide you with the necessary containers. She will also guide you to the ultrasound room. It shouldn't take long at all. While we wait for the results, I would like you to keep a bladder diary for the next three days, recording the time and amount of each urination. This will help us get a better understanding of your frequency and urgency. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: A bladder diary… recording each trip… hmm. It sounds… meticulous. I suppose I can manage it, Doctor. Although, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I’ll do my best to be accurate. A small notebook and a pen, I presume? And… what exactly should I record? Just the time? Or the amount as well? I’m not quite sure how one measures the amount of urine…
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Westly. A small notebook and a pen are perfect. You'll record the time of each urination, and an estimate of the amount. You don't need to be precise. We use a scale of small, medium, and large to estimate. Small would be like half a cup, medium would be a cup, and large would be more than a cup. We just want a general idea of your fluid intake and output. And don't worry about being perfect – just do your best. I’ll have Sarah provide you with a simple instruction sheet as well. Once we have the results of the tests and the bladder diary, we can discuss treatment options, which may include lifestyle modifications, bladder training exercises, or medication. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Small, medium, and large… that sounds manageable. Lifestyle modifications… bladder training… medication… yes, Doctor, that sounds like a reasonable plan. I’m happy to try whatever you recommend. I’m simply relieved to be getting to the bottom of this. All those trips to the restroom are rather disruptive, you see. Very well, Doctor. I’ll await Sarah, and I’ll do my best to keep a diligent diary. And I’ll await the results with… cautious optimism. .
DOCTOR: Excellent, Westly. I’m glad we've developed a plan. I'll have Sarah come in right away. And don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. We will get this sorted out. Sarah?
