DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. I’m Dr. Voytek. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s my back. It’s been… painful. I want to get this sorted quickly, if that’s alright. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner, I understand wanting to get this sorted quickly. We'll do our best. “Painful” is a good start, but can you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Yes. It’s… a dull ache, mostly. But when I bend over, or lift things… it’s sharp. Like a knife, almost. It’s in my lower back, right about here. It started a few weeks ago, just a little bit, but it’s gotten worse every day. I do a lot of heavy lifting at work, you see. Fences. It’s hard work.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache with sharp pain on bending or lifting… lower back, started a few weeks ago and progressively worsening with your work. That gives me a better idea. And just to clarify, when you say “a few weeks ago,” roughly how many weeks are we talking?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… four weeks? Close to five, I suppose. It was right after we finished that big ranch fence out by Willow Creek. A lot of posts, heavy wire… it was a difficult job. I didn’t think much of it at first, just normal soreness. But it hasn’t gone away. It’s actually… worse now than it was then.
DOCTOR: Okay, roughly four to five weeks, coinciding with that fence work. I see. And is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant, yes. A dull ache all the time. But it gets much worse when I move. Especially bending. Or twisting. And lifting, of course. Even just sitting for too long can make it bad. Standing isn’t as bad, but even that isn’t comfortable. It’s just… always there. It’s wearing me down, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand. Constant pain with exacerbations with movement… that certainly sounds frustrating. Now, have you noticed any pain radiating down your legs?
PATIENT: Radiating… you mean… going down my legs? No, not really. It stays in my back, mostly. Sometimes I get a little bit of stiffness in my hips, but nothing like… shooting pain, or numbness. Just… tight. Like they’re not moving right. Is that what you mean? I don’t know all the medical words.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. You’re explaining it just fine. Just trying to rule things out. No radiating pain, just stiffness in the hips… good to know. Now, have you tried anything to relieve the pain so far?
PATIENT: Yes. I’ve been taking… ibuprofen, I think it’s called? The over-the-counter kind. It helps a little, but not much. And I’ve tried heat packs. And resting. But I have to work, Doctor. I can’t just stop. I tried resting for a day, but it didn’t make much difference. It just felt… worse when I went back to it.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen with limited relief, heat packs… okay. And you’ve tried resting, but it didn’t significantly improve things. Alright. Now, just a few questions about your medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. And I don’t take any other medicines, regularly. Just the ibuprofen when my back hurts. I generally stay pretty healthy.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies, no regular medications. And have you ever had any back problems before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I’ve pulled muscles before, lifting things, but it always went away on its own, with a little rest. This is… different. It hasn’t gone away, and it’s just getting worse. It’s worrying me, Doctor. I need to be able to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior back problems. I understand your concern, especially needing to be able to work. Alright, Ms. Reihner, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just so I can get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. That’s fine. Get it over with, if you please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you could lie down on your stomach for me, please. We'll start with checking your range of motion and palpating your spine. Okay, I’m going to feel along your spine. Let me know if anything is particularly tender. Alright, a little bit of muscle spasm here… and tenderness over the lumbar vertebrae. Now, can you bend forward, as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Ouch. That’s… not comfortable. It hurts right here. And it feels… tight. Like something is stuck. Can I sit up now?
DOCTOR: Yes, please sit up slowly. Okay, and can you try to twist to each side for me, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: It’s… difficult. It hurts on both sides, but… worse on the right. It feels like something is pulling. And it makes my hip ache. Can I get up now, Doctor? I don’t think I’m very flexible today.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Okay, Ms. Reihner. Thank you. Based on what you've told me and the examination, it appears you have a lumbar strain, likely aggravated by the heavy lifting at work. There doesn't appear to be any neurological involvement at this time, which is good. But the muscle spasm is significant, and the pain is impacting your daily activities. I'm going to recommend a course of physical therapy to help strengthen your back muscles and improve your flexibility. I’d also like you to continue taking ibuprofen, as directed on the label, for pain relief. And, most importantly, we need to discuss how to modify your lifting technique at work to prevent this from happening again.
PATIENT: Physical therapy… alright. And the ibuprofen. I can do that. But modifying my lifting technique… that might be difficult. It's heavy stuff, Doctor. But… I suppose I’ll try. Do you have a referral for the therapy? And… how long will this take? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Here’s a referral to Willow Creek Physical Therapy. They’re very good, and they have experience with workers who do heavy lifting. As for how long it will take… it’s difficult to say definitively. Most lumbar strains resolve within a few weeks with consistent physical therapy and proper management. However, it depends on the severity of the strain and your individual response to treatment. We'll monitor your progress closely. I want to see you back in two weeks to reassess. In the meantime, if the pain worsens significantly, or you experience any numbness or weakness in your legs, please call the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Two weeks… alright. Numbness or weakness… I’ll remember that. No, I don’t think so. Just… tell me about the lifting technique. What should I be doing differently? I’ve been doing this for years, Doctor. It’s… hard to change habits.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s hard to change habits, especially after years of doing things a certain way. The key is to focus on proper form. First, always bend your knees and keep your back straight when lifting. Don’t twist while lifting – pivot your feet instead. Keep the load close to your body. And most importantly, don’t try to lift anything too heavy for you. It's better to ask for help or break the load down into smaller pieces. Willow Creek Physical Therapy will show you the proper techniques and help you develop a safe lifting plan. They can also assess your workstation and make recommendations for modifications. Do you want me to write a note for your employer indicating the restrictions on lifting while you’re recovering?
PATIENT: A note… yes, that would be good. Something about… limited lifting, and proper technique. I don’t want to get fired. They need me. Just… keep it simple. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I hope this works.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here’s a note for your employer recommending limited lifting – no more than 25 pounds – and emphasizing the importance of proper lifting technique. It also states that you are under medical care and following a rehabilitation plan. I’m glad I could help, Ms. Reihner. I’m optimistic that with physical therapy and careful management, you’ll be able to return to work safely. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll see you in two weeks. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you again, Doctor Voytek. I will. .
