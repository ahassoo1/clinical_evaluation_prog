DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. I am Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, thank you. I am here for... a check-up. Before the insurance starts, you understand. Medicare sent me. It is... required.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Medicare can be… particular. A preventative check-up, then. While I appreciate the proactive approach, these appointments are most effective when addressing a specific concern. However, we can certainly proceed. To begin, perhaps you could tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: General health? Well, I work. Very hard. In the food place. It is... physical work. I lift things. I do not... sit around. Is that what you want to know? I eat rice, mostly. And some meat when I can. Not much else, really. I feel... okay. Not sick. But sometimes tired. From the work, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Physical labor. And a… limited diet, it seems. It's good you're active, but “mostly rice” isn’t exactly optimal nutrition. When you say “tired,” can you elaborate?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Hmm. It is... not like being ill. Just... at the end of the day, I do not want to do anything. I go home, I eat, I sleep. And then I wake up and do it again. No energy for… hobbies. Or seeing friends. Just work and sleep. Sometimes my back hurts, from lifting. But I take… something for that. From the store. It helps a little.
DOCTOR: I see. So, fatigue that doesn’t improve with rest, and some lower back discomfort. And you’re self-treating the back pain with an over-the-counter medication?
PATIENT: Yes, that is... correct. It is a painkiller. From the shop. Not a strong one. Just... for the ache. I do not like to go to the doctor unless I have to. It is... a waste of time. But Medicare says I must be checked. So here I am. I hope this will be quick.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will be as efficient as possible. Before we proceed, let’s get a more complete picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? No. Not that I know of. I have never been... seriously sick. A cold, sometimes. The flu, once, a long time ago. But nothing the shop medicines could not fix. My family... we do not go to doctors much. It is... expensive. And usually we just get better on our own. Do you need a list? I do not have a list.
DOCTOR: No, a list isn’t necessary. Just trying to ascertain if there’s anything in your past that might be relevant. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I have all my parts. I work with my hands, you see. I need them. No one has ever cut me open. I would not allow it. Not unless... it was very serious. But I have never been in a hospital. Not even when I was a little boy. We just... deal with things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? They are... fine. My mother, she is old now. She lives in Yemen, still. I send money when I can. My brothers, they work too. Mostly construction. Healthy, I think. They do not get sick often. Everyone works. It is how we are. No one has... important illnesses. No heart problems. No… cancer. Just normal aches and pains from working hard. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Sometimes my stomach feels bad after... spicy food. But that is not an allergy. Just... too much spice. I do not take many medicines, so I do not know about allergies to those. I can handle pain. I do not need many things to feel better. Really. I just work.
DOCTOR: Very well. Finally, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, aside from the pain reliever you mentioned for your back?
PATIENT: Only the pain pill. For my back. When it hurts. I do not like taking things. They make me feel... strange. I prefer to just work through it. It is better. The doctor at the shop said it was okay to take when I need it. It is… ibuprofen, I think. The blue bottle. Is that all you need to know? I really hope this is almost finished.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Barban. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Just to get a baseline. It won’t take long. We'll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll take a look at your back. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Physical examination? You want to… touch me? I do not understand. I told you I am fine. I work. I lift things. You can see I am strong. I do not need you to… check. Is this required by Medicare? Because if it is, I will do it. But it seems… unnecessary. Really.
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, a physical exam is standard procedure, even for healthy individuals. It allows me to establish a baseline and identify any potential issues that may not be apparent. It is, as you correctly stated, a requirement of Medicare for this preventative appointment. It's not about questioning your strength; it's about ensuring a comprehensive assessment of your overall health. It will involve me listening to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope, checking your reflexes, and a quick examination of your back. It’s a simple process. May I proceed?
PATIENT: Fine. If it must be done. Because of Medicare. But be quick, please. I have work. And I do not like being… poked and prodded. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit comfortably and relax your arm. I will start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 135 over 80. Slightly elevated, but not concerning at this time. Now, I will listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, if you could stand up for me, please. I'd like to assess your reflexes. Reflexes are within normal limits. Finally, let’s take a look at your back. Please bend forward and touch your toes, if you can. Range of motion is slightly limited. There appears to be some mild tenderness upon palpation of the lower lumbar spine. Can you pinpoint the exact location of the pain?
PATIENT: Ow… that is… uncomfortable. The pain is… here. Right here. It hurts when I bend. And when I lift heavy things, obviously. It has been like this for… a long time. Not serious, just… an ache. I take the blue pills, and it gets better. A little. It is… work. What else do you need to know? This is very… disruptive.
DOCTOR: There is mild muscle spasm in the lower lumbar region. The pain is reproducible with palpation. Given your description and the physical findings, it appears you're experiencing some degree of lower back strain, likely exacerbated by your occupation. I recommend a course of physical therapy to strengthen your core muscles and improve your posture. Additionally, I would advise you to practice proper lifting techniques at work to minimize further strain. For the pain, I suggest continuing the ibuprofen as needed, but be mindful of the dosage and duration of use. Long-term use of NSAIDs can have side effects. I will also order some basic blood work to rule out any underlying inflammatory conditions. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Physical… therapy? That sounds… expensive. And time-consuming. I do not have time to go to… classes. I have work. And what did you say about… side effects? From the blue pills? I have been taking them for years. And what is “inflammatory conditions?” Are you saying I am… sick? I told you I am fine. I just have a sore back from working hard. Is the blood work also… expensive? This is all very… complicated. And concerning. I just wanted a check-up for Medicare. Not… this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Barban, I understand your concerns. Physical therapy can be an investment, but it’s often the most effective long-term solution for back pain. We can explore options for more affordable programs. And no, I am not saying you are “sick.” However, it’s prudent to rule out any underlying causes for your discomfort. The blood work is a standard precaution. Regarding the ibuprofen, prolonged use can lead to stomach irritation or even kidney problems, though the risk is relatively low with occasional use. I’m not attempting to alarm you, simply to ensure a comprehensive assessment. I'll write a referral for physical therapy and the lab order for the blood work. We can discuss the results at a follow-up appointment. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before I order the blood work?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. I told you. Just… work. Fine. Do whatever you need to do for Medicare. Just… don't make it complicated. And don't expect me to go to a lot of… classes. I have a job. And I need to get back to it. What time can I leave? Is this all finished now?
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab order and physical therapy referral will be sent electronically to your preferred providers. You can schedule the appointments at your convenience. As for your question, this appointment is now concluded. The blood work will take a few days to process, and then we can schedule a follow-up to discuss the results. Here is a summary of today’s visit and the recommendations. Please read it carefully. If you experience any worsening of your symptoms, such as fever, weakness, or numbness, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any final questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No more questions. I think that is all. Just… thank you. I suppose. And… goodbye. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Barban. And please, do try to prioritize proper lifting techniques at work. .
