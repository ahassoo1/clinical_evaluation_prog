DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My… how you say… the place I want to live, for old people? They need me to… check with a doctor first. For papers, you know?
DOCTOR: Ah, you mean a residency or assisted living facility?
PATIENT: Yes! That is it. Assisted… living. Yes. They want to make sure I am… okay for it. My husband, he find it. Very nice place, he says.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Abdollahi. It's very common to need a medical evaluation before moving into an assisted living facility. They just want to be sure we've addressed all your health needs. Let's go through some questions, and then I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… good. Questions first, then you… look at me? Okay. I am ready. My husband, he tell me to write down things, but… I forget where he put it.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Abdollahi, don't worry about it at all. We can take things slowly, and I'll help guide you. We can start with what’s been going on with your health recently. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels, appetite, or sleep?
PATIENT: Hmm… energy… not so good sometimes. Old, you know? But not too bad. I eat… okay. Not much, but I eat. And sleep… sometimes I wake up many times. But I always go back to sleep. My husband, he snores!
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for sleep to change as we get older, and a snoring spouse can certainly disrupt things! Besides the sleep, have you been experiencing any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain… yes. My knees. They hurt when I walk too much. And my back, sometimes. But I take a little… medicine. The white pills. It helps a little. Not every day, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, knees and back pain. And you're taking white pills for it. Do you happen to know the name of those pills?
PATIENT: No, I do not know the name. My husband, he get them for me. He knows everything about pills. I just… take them when it hurts. He says they are for the… how you say… the hurting.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's perfectly alright. We can look that up later. Let's talk about other things. Have you been having any trouble with your memory or concentration lately?
PATIENT: Memory… sometimes. I forget things, like… what I was saying! Or where I put my glasses. But not… all the time. It is just… old age, I think. My daughter, she worry about it sometimes. She says I repeat myself.
DOCTOR: It's common to experience some changes in memory as we age, Ms. Abdollahi. And it's thoughtful of your daughter to be concerned. Have you noticed any changes in your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Vision… not so good. I need glasses, you see. And hearing… sometimes I ask people to speak louder. Especially my husband! He mumbles when he watches the… the sports.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re managing well, despite some changes with your vision and hearing. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold, the flu, or anything more serious?
PATIENT: Hmm… last year, I had the… the cough. Very bad cough. The doctor, he gave me something to drink. Made me feel better. Before that… I don't remember. Old age, you know? Everything gets… mixed up.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Abdollahi. We can look at your records to see what's been documented. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital… yes. Many years ago. When my daughter, she was born. Very difficult. But everything was… okay. I do not remember much else about hospitals. It was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, let’s talk about any medications you're currently taking, besides the white pills for your knees and back. Do you take anything regularly for blood pressure, cholesterol, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I take a little… yellow pill every morning. My husband says it is for my… how you say… the heart. And sometimes, when I am… nervous, I take a small blue pill. It helps me calm down. That is all, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellow pill for your heart and a blue pill for anxiety when you’re nervous. That’s helpful to know. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. I eat everything. My husband, he makes very good food. Sometimes too much! I never had a… reaction to anything. I am not allergic to… cats or dogs. Or flowers.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family… my mother, she had… the sugar. The doctor, he told her to eat less sweets. My father, he had… problems with his heart. He was very strong man, but… his heart. I think that is all. My sister, she is very healthy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of diabetes in your mother and heart problems in your father. That’s good to know. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… I like to sit and watch the television. And I like to cook with my husband. He does the hard work, I help a little. I go for a little walk sometimes, but not too much. My knees, you know? I do not… drink much. Or smoke. Never did.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Abdollahi, that gives me a very good understanding of your health history. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a simple check of your blood pressure, pulse, lungs, and a listen to your heart. I’ll also check your knees. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is okay. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. My husband says I need to listen to the doctors. He is a very smart man.
DOCTOR: He sounds like a wonderful husband. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 142/88. We'll keep an eye on that. Now let me listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. This is not necessarily concerning, especially with your history, but we'll want to monitor it. Lungs sound clear. Now, can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay, deep breath. That felt… good. My lungs always feel a little tight.
DOCTOR: That’s good. It’s common to feel a little tightness, especially with changes in the weather. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Can you bend them for me, and tell me where you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Here. When I bend them too much. And when I walk for a long time. It is… a dull ache. Not sharp. It is just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I feel some mild swelling and tenderness on both sides. There's also a bit of crepitus - that's a grinding sensation – which is common with osteoarthritis. Now, let's check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Alright, Ms. Abdollahi, that completes the exam. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you've told me, and what I've found during the exam… It sounds like you have some mild osteoarthritis in your knees, a slightly elevated blood pressure, and a small heart murmur, which we'll continue to monitor. These are common conditions for someone your age. Would you like me to explain that in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. More detail would be good. I want to understand what is… happening with my body. Is it bad? Will it get worse? And what about the assisted living place? Will they let me in if I have… these things?
DOCTOR: Of course. Let’s start with the osteoarthritis. That’s essentially wear and tear on the cartilage in your knees. It causes pain, stiffness, and swelling, like you’ve been experiencing. It’s very common as we age, and it doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be severely limited in your activities. We can manage it with things like gentle exercise, weight management if needed, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen. We can also discuss physical therapy if you're interested. As for your blood pressure, it's slightly elevated, which puts you at a higher risk for heart disease and stroke. We’ll want to monitor it regularly, and I’d like to start you on a low-dose medication to help lower it. We’ll also talk about lifestyle changes like reducing salt intake and getting regular exercise, if possible. The heart murmur is often harmless, but it's good to know about. We can monitor it with an EKG and potentially an echocardiogram to get a better look. Now, regarding the assisted living facility, these are all very manageable conditions. I don’t foresee any issues with you being admitted. I'll be happy to write a detailed summary of your health, including all of these findings, for them. They may want to see your medication list as well, which I can also provide. Does that answer your questions?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… good. I understand better now. Not so bad, you say? Just… things that old people have? The papers… you will write the papers for the place? That is very helpful. And the medicine… I will try to remember the names this time. My husband will help, of course.
DOCTOR: Exactly. These are very common conditions for someone your age, and they're all very manageable. I’m happy to write the summary for the assisted living facility – I’ll get that done today and have it ready for you to pick up tomorrow. I’ll also include your medication list and a list of follow-up appointments. I'm prescribing a low-dose blood pressure medication called Lisinopril, 10mg daily. It’s important to take it as directed. We'll need to monitor your blood pressure regularly to make sure it’s working effectively. I’d also like you to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in one month to see how you’re doing and to discuss the results of any tests we order. Finally, I recommend you follow up with a cardiologist to evaluate the heart murmur. I can provide you with a referral if you'd like. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Lisinopril… I will try to remember that one. And the cardiologist… yes, please, a referral would be helpful. My husband will make the appointments. He is very good at that. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind. And you explain everything very well. I feel much better now. Is there anything else I need to do? Or pay?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. I’m glad I could help. As for payment, the copay for today’s visit is \$30. My staff will take care of that for you. I’ll also have them print out a summary of our visit, the medication list, and the referral to the cardiologist. I'll also send a copy of the health summary directly to the assisted living facility. Before you leave, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. You have answered everything. Thank you again, Doctor. And thank you for being so patient with an old lady who forgets things. I will see you next month. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don’t worry about forgetting things – it happens to all of us. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Have a wonderful day, and I look forward to seeing you next month.
