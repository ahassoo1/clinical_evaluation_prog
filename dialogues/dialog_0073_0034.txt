DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bonck. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Doctor. I… well, I just moved here. And I need to, like, get set up with a doctor, you know? It's… for my insurance. Medicare, I think it is? I don't really remember all the details. I just needed a check-up to get things started.
DOCTOR: Right, a new patient visit for insurance purposes. Medicare… yes, I see your information here. Well, that's perfectly reasonable. Even if it's just for the paperwork, it’s good to get a baseline. Though frankly, most young women don’t need a full check-up unless they’re experiencing something specific. But we can certainly accommodate. Let’s start with a bit of history, shall we?
PATIENT: History? Like… what kind of history? I don’t… I don’t really remember much about… anything, honestly. I just know I’m married. And I work with machines… fixing them. Is that what you mean? I’m a mechanical… something. Technologist? I think. It's all kinda blurry.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, that’s… not ideal. We need to establish some medical background, Ms. Bonck. It’s important. It’s not just about your current state, but anything that might become relevant. Do you recall any significant illnesses or injuries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Um… I think I broke my arm once? When I was little? Maybe? It’s… really foggy. And I get headaches sometimes, but everyone gets headaches, right? Nothing… serious. I don't think I've ever been really sick, like with the flu or anything. I'm sorry I can't remember more. It's just… always been like this.
DOCTOR: A possible fracture in childhood, occasional headaches… and no significant illnesses reported. Right. Well, “always been like this” is not particularly helpful, Ms. Bonck. But we’ll proceed. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I mean, I think I’m okay with everything? I haven't ever… reacted to anything. I eat pretty much anything. I don’t really pay attention to that stuff, if that makes sense? I just eat when I’m hungry. Does that help?
DOCTOR: It… marginally. A lack of known allergies is good, I suppose. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Um… no? I don't think so. I sometimes take… pain relievers for my head, if it’s really bad. Like, ibuprofen? Is that a medication? Just the regular kind, from the store. But not… often. Like, maybe once a month? If that. It’s not a big deal, right?
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen, as needed for headaches. Fair enough. Alright. And do you have any family history of significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history? Um… my grandma… she was sick for a long time, before she… you know. But I don’t know what she was sick with. And my mom… she’s okay, I think. She just… gets tired a lot. I don’t really talk about that stuff with my family. We don't really… share. I’m sorry. This is all really hard.
DOCTOR: Vague history of maternal fatigue and grandmother’s illness, unspecified. Right. Well, it appears we're working with limited information. Let's move on to some basic physical measurements. I’d like to check your height, weight, blood pressure, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds… good. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have to get back to work later. Is that… is that a long process?
DOCTOR: It won't be extensive, Ms. Bonck. Just a standard check-up. First, if you'll step onto the scale for me, please. Height and weight first.
PATIENT: Okay. Is… is that a lot? I think I’ve put on some weight since I got married.
DOCTOR: 82 kilograms… and your height is 150 centimeters. That puts your BMI at 36.2, Ms. Bonck. Which is… in the obese range. Now, let's confirm your height. If you could stand against the wall, please. We'll just get an accurate measurement.
PATIENT: Obese? Oh. I… I know. It’s just… I really like to eat. And my husband likes to cook. It's hard to say no. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: 150 centimeters, as indicated. Ms. Bonck, it’s not about “good” or “bad”. It’s a medical fact. Your weight does place you at an increased risk for several health conditions. We should discuss lifestyle modifications, including diet and exercise. But first, I’d like to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Please, have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Lifestyle… modifications? I… I don't really have time for exercise. And my husband’s cooking is really good. It would be rude to change it. Is it… is it really that serious? I feel fine. Mostly. I just get headaches sometimes.
DOCTOR: “Fine” is subjective, Ms. Bonck. We need objective data. 145 over 92. Elevated blood pressure. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly rapid. Lung sounds are clear, but diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Diminished breath sounds could indicate reduced lung capacity. We should consider a chest X-ray. Considering your weight, elevated blood pressure, and diminished breath sounds, I recommend we schedule some further tests, including blood work and a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: Chest… X-ray? What… what’s wrong? Is something really bad? I don't like tests. They make me nervous. Can’t we just… forget about the tests? I just wanted to get set up with a doctor. I didn't want all this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bonck, I understand you’re anxious, but avoiding tests won’t make any potential problems disappear. It’s precisely because you’re feeling generally fine that we need to investigate further. These tests are preventative. Look, I’m not trying to frighten you. But your vital signs suggest an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and respiratory issues. A simple blood test can check your cholesterol levels and rule out any underlying medical conditions. And a chest X-ray will allow us to assess your lung health. I strongly advise you to schedule these tests. It's the responsible course of action. If you refuse, I can document that in your chart, but I cannot offer any further treatment without a proper evaluation.
PATIENT: I… I don’t know. I don’t like hospitals. Or doctors. And tests… they always find something wrong. My grandma… she had a lot of tests before she… passed away. I just… I just want to be healthy. But I don’t want all this. Can’t we just… try to eat better? I’ll try. I promise. Please?
