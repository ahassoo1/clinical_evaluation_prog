DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Sink. It is my ear. It... how you say... it is leaking something. It started, maybe... four days ago now? Not much at first, but more today. It is… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Leaking, you say. Four days ago… and more today. Unpleasant. Right. Is it painful at all, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: Not… sharp pain, no. More… a dull ache. And feeling of fullness. Like… water inside. It makes it hard to hear sometimes. Especially when quiet. Like someone is… muffling the sound. It is on the left ear, Doctor. The left.
DOCTOR: Left ear. Dull ache, fullness, muffled hearing. Hmm. Have you had any fever, or noticed any changes in your balance?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. I check myself. No. And… balance is good, I think. I walk normally. Maybe a little… unsteady sometimes, but I think that is just my age. Not new. It is always like this. A little wobble.
DOCTOR: “Always like this,” you say. Okay. Have you had any ear infections before, Mr. Radillo?
PATIENT: Yes. When I was… a boy. In Somalia. Long time ago. It was very painful then. This… is not so bad. But worrying. Because leaking… not good, yes? It is… a sign of something bad, maybe?
DOCTOR: Well, it could be a number of things. It doesn't automatically mean it's anything serious. Do you have any hearing loss besides when it's muffled?
PATIENT: No, not really. I am old man. Hearing is… not perfect anyway. My wife… she always tell me to turn up the television. She say I am deaf! But I can hear fine… most of the time. Except when this ear is full. Then, yes. Very quiet. Is this… is this something I catch? Like a cold?
DOCTOR: Not usually "caught" like a cold, Mr. Radillo. More often, it's related to… other things. Let’s have a quick look at your ear, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is good. Looking is good. Please. I trust you. You seem… very knowledgeable. Do you have the… the little light? I remember they use a little light to look.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. Just lean forward a bit. Okay… now I’m going to take a look inside your ear. It might be a little uncomfortable, just let me know if it hurts. Alright… I see some… fluid in the ear canal. The eardrum is… slightly bulging. It looks like you have an ear infection, Mr. Radillo. It’s not severe, but it is causing the fluid buildup and pressure. I’m going to document my findings.
PATIENT: Infection? Oh. That is… not good, yes? Will I need… the medicine? Like pills? Or… drops in the ear? Is this something serious, Doctor? My wife… she will worry very much. She already think I am getting old and weak! I need to tell her it is okay.
DOCTOR: It’s not typically serious if treated promptly, Mr. Radillo. And yes, we'll need to use medication. Drops are generally the first line of treatment for this type of infection. I’m going to prescribe you some antibiotic ear drops. You’ll need to put them in the affected ear three times a day for seven days. Here's the prescription. Take this to the pharmacy, and they'll explain the proper way to administer them. It’s important to finish the entire course of medication, even if your ear feels better before the seven days are up. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Seven days. Three times a day. Finish all, even if feeling better. I understand. I write it down. Seven… three… all. Good. And… will I need to come back? To check? My wife will want to know that. And… is this… something I did to cause this? Was I not careful enough? Perhaps too much swimming?
DOCTOR: We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week just to make sure it’s cleared up, yes. As for what caused it… it’s difficult to say definitively. Sometimes they just happen. Swimming can contribute, but it’s not always the cause. It’s likely not anything you did or didn't do. Try to keep your ear dry, and avoid getting water in it if possible until it heals. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is all. Seven days, three times a day, finish all. Follow up next week. Keep it dry. Thank you, Doctor Sink. You are very kind. I will go to the pharmacy now. And I will tell my wife… everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get well soon, Mr. Radillo.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
