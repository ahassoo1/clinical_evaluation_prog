DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Al Corta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… adequate to meet you as well. I’m here regarding a… diminishing of my eyesight. It’s becoming quite inconvenient, frankly. It's not as if I have time for these sorts of things, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be very disruptive when your vision starts to change. “Diminishing eyesight” – okay. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It’s been… gradual, you see. Not some sudden event. Perhaps six months, give or take. Though I confess, I don’t keep meticulous records of such… personal failings. It’s just become harder to read things, mostly. And recognizing faces at a distance is becoming… problematic.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of gradual vision changes – mostly difficulty reading and recognizing faces. Is this happening in both eyes, or is it worse in one eye than the other?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor, do you expect me to have analyzed the situation with scientific precision? It's… both, I suppose. Though if I had to venture a guess – and I assure you, I'd rather not – I'd say it's slightly worse in the left eye. But honestly, they both seem… inadequate. It's all rather blurry, if you must know.
DOCTOR: Okay, both eyes affected, slightly worse in the left, and described as blurry. Has anything specific seemed to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Better or worse? As if I’m conducting an experiment. No, Doctor, nothing specific. Perhaps bright light makes it a bit more… difficult. And I find myself squinting quite a lot. Though that hardly constitutes a scientific observation, does it? It's just… bothersome. I do enjoy a good book, you see. Now that is becoming… challenging.
DOCTOR: Okay, bright light seems to make it worse, and you're finding yourself squinting. And it's impacting your ability to read, which you enjoy. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the blurry vision?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… well, now that you mention it, I suppose my eyes do feel a bit… strained. Occasionally. It's not a constant ache, mind you. Just… fatigue. And sometimes, I think I see… little floaters. Like dust motes. Though that could simply be my imagination, I suppose. I do spend a considerable amount of time indoors, reading. Perhaps it's simply a lack of fresh air.
DOCTOR: Okay, eye strain and floaters. And you think it might be related to spending time reading indoors. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Really, Doctor. Must you pry? I assure you, I am perfectly… functional. No, I don't have any… conditions. I used to be quite athletic, actually. Though that was some time ago. I did have a bout of the flu a few years back, but I hardly think that's relevant. A perfectly normal illness. I assure you. And I don't take any… medications. I prefer to maintain a natural state of well-being.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known medical conditions, no medications, and you had the flu a few years ago. Do you have any family history of eye problems – glaucoma, macular degeneration, cataracts, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… good heavens. Do you expect me to have a genealogical chart memorized? My mother… she wore glasses. Rather thick ones, as I recall. And my grandfather… he went blind, eventually. Something to do with… diabetes, I think. Though he wasn’t a particularly… disciplined man. Lived a rather unhealthy lifestyle, truthfully. It's hardly a relevant correlation, is it? I am nothing like him. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother wore glasses, grandfather went blind due to diabetes. That’s helpful information. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor. Are you attempting to ascertain my moral character now? I find that question… rather offensive. No. I do not smoke. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, but only a modest amount. And I most certainly do not engage in… recreational activities. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. I assure you, my lifestyle is… respectable.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a brief eye exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: I suppose. But please be gentle. I have rather sensitive eyes, you understand. And do try to keep it… brief. I have appointments to attend to. And a great deal of reading to catch up on, if this situation ever improves.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be as gentle as possible, and we'll keep it as quick as we can. First, I'm going to check your visual acuity – that's how well you can see at different distances. Could you please sit facing the eye chart over there?
PATIENT: Must I? It looks terribly… blurry from here. But very well. Let’s get this over with. I trust this won’t be… unduly prolonged.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Al Corta, starting with your right eye. Can you read the top line for me?
PATIENT: Goodness. It’s… rather indistinct. Let me see… is that an “E”? Yes, definitely an “E”. And… another “E”. I believe that covers the top line. Though it's hardly a rigorous test, is it? The print is so… small.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let's try your left eye. I'll cover your right eye with this. Can you read the top line for me?
PATIENT: Goodness. It's… barely visible. Let me see… is that an “E”? Perhaps… I think so. Yes, an “E”. But I can’t be certain. It’s… all rather fuzzy. This is most uncomfortable, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, I’m going to check your peripheral vision. I want you to focus on this point here, and I’ll gently wave my hand in front of your eyes. Just tell me when you see it. Tell me when you can see my hand.
PATIENT: I… believe I see something. To the right. Yes, there. But it’s… faint. And indistinct. Is that really necessary, Doctor? It’s quite unsettling. And I still can’t be certain what I’m even looking at.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to briefly shine a light into your eyes to check your pupils. This won't hurt. Just look straight ahead. Alright. And finally, I'll just take a quick look at the back of your eyes with an ophthalmoscope. This will just give me a better look at the retina and optic nerve.
PATIENT: It's… rather bright. And unnerving, having something peered into my eyes. Is this taking long? I have a great many things to attend to, you understand. And I’m starting to feel a rather persistent headache. Is it finished now? Please tell me it’s finished.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Al Corta, that's all for the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Based on the exam, your visual acuity is significantly reduced in both eyes. Your peripheral vision is also diminished, and I noted some mild drusen and slightly pallid optic discs during the fundoscopic exam. These findings, along with your symptoms, are concerning for early stages of age-related macular degeneration and potential glaucoma. Your sluggish pupillary response also warrants further investigation. I need to be clear: I cannot give you a definitive diagnosis without some further testing. I want to order a visual field test, optical coherence tomography of both eyes, and a tonometry test to measure your eye pressure. We will also need to do a comprehensive glaucoma evaluation.
PATIENT: Macular… degeneration? Glaucoma? Good heavens. Is this… serious? I assure you, I've always taken excellent care of my health. And those are… rather alarming terms, wouldn’t you agree? Further… testing? How much further testing? And what will this… all cost? I have… responsibilities, you understand. And frankly, I find this entire situation… rather inconvenient. Perhaps it’s simply a matter of needing new spectacles. Is that not a possibility, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Al Corta. And you are right to ask those questions. Macular degeneration and glaucoma are serious conditions, but they are often manageable, especially when caught early. The severity can vary significantly. Yes, new spectacles could improve your vision to some degree, but they won't address the underlying causes of these conditions. That’s why the further testing is so important. The visual field test will map your peripheral vision, the OCT will provide detailed images of your retina, and the tonometry test will measure the pressure inside your eyes. Regarding cost, I understand that’s a significant concern. As you are uninsured, we can explore options for financial assistance programs and discounted rates at the lab. I will have my billing department contact you with a breakdown of the estimated costs and available resources. I also want to stress that delaying diagnosis and treatment could lead to more significant vision loss. Would you like me to schedule these tests for you?
PATIENT: Financial assistance programs… discounted rates… It’s all rather… undignified, isn’t it? Very well. If you insist. Schedule the… tests. But please, let’s keep it as brief as possible. And do ensure that the… technicians are discreet. I have a reputation to uphold, you understand. And if it turns out to be nothing more than a minor issue with my spectacles, I expect a full refund of all testing fees. Is that understood? And please, have the billing department contact me immediately with a detailed breakdown of these… anticipated expenses. I need to be fully informed. And frankly, I’m not particularly optimistic about this entire situation. It's all rather… distressing.
DOCTOR: Understood, Mr. Al Corta. I will ensure the technicians are discreet, and we will certainly discuss the cost and refund policy. I'll have the billing department contact you within 24 hours with a detailed breakdown of the anticipated expenses. I'm scheduling the visual field test, OCT scan, and tonometry for you next Tuesday at 9:00 AM at the imaging center across the street. I’ll write you a referral. In the meantime, I’d recommend avoiding prolonged reading and bright light if possible. If you experience any sudden changes in your vision, such as new floaters, flashing lights, or a curtain-like shadow, please come to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. I think that covers it. Though I must say, this entire experience has been… less than ideal. Emergency room… flashing lights… It all sounds terribly… alarming. Very well. Tuesday at nine o’clock, then. And please, ensure that the referral is… properly worded. I wouldn't want any… misunderstandings. I believe that’s all for now, Doctor. I trust this will be the only visit required. Good day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Al Corta. I’ll ensure the referral is properly worded. I’ll also have my office staff call to confirm your appointment. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before then. I wish you a good day as well. .
