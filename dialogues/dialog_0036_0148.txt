DOCTOR: Good morning, Noelani. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, um... it’s a bit awkward to talk about, honestly. It’s… pain. Down there. In… well, you know. The… testicular region, I believe the nurse said. It’s been bothering me for a little while now. I don’t really… remember exactly when it started, but it’s definitely been a few weeks, maybe longer.
DOCTOR: Okay, Noelani, thank you for sharing that with me. It's perfectly alright to feel awkward discussing these things—that's what I’m here for. To clarify, you're experiencing pain in the area where the testicles are located?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Exactly. It’s not… constant, you understand? It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s a dull ache, and sometimes… well, sometimes it’s sharper. It doesn’t seem to be tied to anything specific, either. I haven’t noticed it being worse after activity, or anything like that. Though, honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I could be missing something.
DOCTOR: I understand. So the pain is intermittent – comes and goes – and varies in intensity from a dull ache to sharper pain. And you haven’t been able to correlate it with any specific activities or events. You mentioned your memory isn’t what it used to be; that’s alright, we'll work through it. Could you describe the location of the pain more specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, um… that’s difficult. It feels… inside the scrotum, I suppose? Both sides, sometimes. Or maybe just the left? It’s hard to pinpoint. It’s not… radiating, if that makes sense. It stays in that general area. I wish I could be more precise, Doctor, but it’s just… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Noelani. It can be difficult to pinpoint pain accurately. So, it feels within the scrotum, sometimes on both sides, sometimes more prominent on the left, and the pain doesn’t travel elsewhere. Now, have you noticed any swelling, redness, or any changes in the size or shape of your testicles?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I don’t think so. Honestly, I haven’t really… looked, if that sounds strange. I just try to ignore it, you know? Redness… no, I don’t recall any redness. As for changes in size… I really couldn’t say, Doctor. I’m sorry I’m not being very helpful. It’s just… a delicate topic, and my mind isn't cooperating.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Noelani. It takes courage to come in and discuss these things, and it's perfectly understandable that it's a difficult topic. We'll take our time. Okay, let's move on to some other questions. Have you experienced any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever, chills, nausea… no, nothing like that. I’ve been feeling… well, mostly normal, apart from this discomfort. A little tired, maybe, but that’s just… getting older, I suppose. I haven't been sick, if that’s what you mean. No flu symptoms or anything.
DOCTOR: Good. No fever, chills, nausea, or other flu-like symptoms. Just the testicular discomfort and some general fatigue. Now, have you noticed any pain in your abdomen, groin, or lower back?
PATIENT: No, no pain in my abdomen… or my groin, I don't think so. My lower back has been a little stiff sometimes, but I just assumed it was from… gardening, you know? I like to work in my garden. I don't think it’s related to the… pain down there. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to worry it’s something serious. It’s just… a nagging feeling.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re sharing your worries with me, Noelani. It’s always best to address those concerns. It’s good to rule things out, and that’s what we’ll do. You mentioned back stiffness, but you don’t believe it’s related. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. I had a little trouble with my blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s been under control with medication. Otherwise… I don’t really have anything major. No diabetes, no heart problems. Just… the usual aches and pains that come with age. I’m on Medicare, if that’s helpful. I see Dr. Ramirez for my general checkups, but I haven’t mentioned this pain to her yet.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of controlled hypertension, currently managed with medication. No other major medical conditions. Medicare recipient, regular check-ups with Dr. Ramirez. And have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh! Yes. I had my gallbladder removed, oh, must be fifteen years ago now. Everything went smoothly, as far as I remember. And… I was hospitalized for a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Nothing else, I don't believe. It’s been a while since I’ve thought about hospitals, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, and a previous hospitalization for pneumonia. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Just the one for my blood pressure, it’s Lisinopril. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches and pains, but that’s only when I really need it. Nothing regular, you understand? Just over-the-counter stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for hypertension, and occasional ibuprofen as needed for aches and pains. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had any reactions to anything. I eat everything, thankfully. I haven’t had any trouble with allergies, thankfully. It’s one less thing to worry about, isn’t it? But… I do get a little itchy sometimes, but that could just be the weather.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Just occasional itchiness, potentially related to the weather. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or testicular problems?
PATIENT: Oh, um… that’s a good question. My father had heart problems later in life, but he lived to be eighty-five, so it wasn’t too bad. My mother had arthritis, but that’s about it. As for… testicular problems, no, not that I know of. It wasn’t something we talked about much in my family. It's a bit of a sensitive topic, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It is a sensitive topic, and it’s perfectly understandable that it wasn't openly discussed. So, father with late-onset heart problems, mother with arthritis, no known history of testicular issues. Finally, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no smoking, never touched a cigarette in my life. I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I haven't had anything to drink in years. And no, definitely no recreational drugs. I’m a very healthy person, Doctor, apart from this… discomfort. I enjoy gardening, and I try to eat a balanced diet. I believe in taking care of myself.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Noelani. So, no smoking, no alcohol, and no recreational drug use. Okay, thank you for answering all those questions so thoroughly. Now, I would like to perform a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, and a brief examination of your abdomen and, of course, the scrotal area. This will help me to better understand the source of your pain. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. I understand. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment. I just… please be gentle. It’s a little sensitive, as you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Noelani. I will be as gentle as possible. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds normal. No irregularities detected. Now, I'll listen to your lungs. Your lungs sound clear as well. Now, I’m going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels tender. Your abdomen feels normal. Now, I’m going to need to examine the scrotal area. Please let me know immediately if you experience any pain or discomfort. I will be using gloves. Okay. I’m feeling some tenderness on the left testicle, but no obvious masses or thickening. It's difficult to say definitively without further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s where it hurts. It’s not terrible, but it's definitely more sensitive there. Is that… bad? What does it mean? I’m starting to get quite anxious now.
DOCTOR: It's good you pointed that out, Noelani. Mild tenderness isn’t necessarily indicative of anything serious, but it does warrant further investigation. There are several possibilities, including inflammation, a mild injury, or something else. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order a scrotal ultrasound. This is a non-invasive imaging test that will allow us to visualize the testicles and surrounding structures. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… yes, that sounds… reasonable. If you think it's necessary, then yes, please. I just want to know what’s going on. I’ve been worrying about this for weeks now. When can I have it done? And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m ordering the ultrasound now. It shouldn't hurt at all, Noelani. A technician will apply a gel to your scrotum and then use a handheld device to create images. It’s completely painless, although you may feel some slight pressure. The clinic has an appointment available tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… yes, that would be fine. 9:00 AM is perfect. Thank you, Doctor. I’m glad we’re getting this sorted out. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the ultrasound? And… should I stop taking the ibuprofen?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Noelani. No special preparation is needed for the ultrasound. Just come as you are. As for the ibuprofen, yes, please stop taking it for the next 24 hours. It can sometimes interfere with the results of the ultrasound. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe pain, fever, or any other concerning symptoms, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Once the ultrasound results are in, we’ll discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and your patience. I feel much better knowing what's going on, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. I’ll see you tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Noelani. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. I’ll see you tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. Have a good evening, and try to relax.
