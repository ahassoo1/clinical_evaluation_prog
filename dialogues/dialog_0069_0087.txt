DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… lab work, I think? That's what the lady on the phone said, anyway. Honestly, things are a bit fuzzy these days. Just need whatever paperwork needs doing, if you don't mind. The quicker we get this sorted, the better.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. No problem at all. It sounds like you're here for some routine lab work that was scheduled. Just to be sure, and to get a clearer picture of what's going on, could you tell me a little bit more about why the lab work was recommended?
PATIENT: Recommended…? Gosh, that was… a while ago. Honestly, I don't rightly remember who recommended it, or even why. Something about… checking things? I work at the power plant, you see. Lots of… machinery. Maybe it's related to that? I really couldn't say. I just get a notice, and I try to keep up with it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Croonquist. It's perfectly alright if you don't remember the specifics. Things can get a bit overwhelming, and it sounds like you have a lot on your plate with your work at the power plant. Let's see if we can figure it out together. Do you have a primary care physician that you usually see?
PATIENT: A… primary care…? I used to, years back. Doctor… something. Old fellow. Passed away, I think. Haven’t really seen one regularly since. Just go to whoever’s available when I need something. Medicare usually sorts it out. Honestly, I don't bother the doctors much unless I have to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. So, you don't have a regular doctor currently. And you're coming in for lab work that was scheduled through Medicare. Just to be thorough, and since you're here today, could you tell me about any symptoms you've been experiencing recently?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Well, I get tired, easy. More than usual, I suppose. And my knees ache, especially when the weather changes. Old age, mostly. Nothing that keeps me from work, thankfully. I need the money. I get a bit… forgetful, too. You probably noticed. But that's probably just… well, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to experience changes as we get older, Mr. Croonquist, and it’s good you’re aware of these things. Fatigue, knee pain, and some memory changes are all common. Let's try to get a better understanding of what might be going on. When you say you get tired easily, could you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not like I collapse or anything. It's just… at the end of the day, I'm done. Used to be able to putter around the garden, fix things around the house. Now I just want to sit. And I sleep… a lot. More than eight hours, sometimes. But it doesn't feel restful, if that makes sense? Just… long.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Mr. Croonquist. Sleeping a long time but still feeling tired is definitely something we should investigate. And the difficulty with activities you used to enjoy is also important. Do you notice any other symptoms alongside the fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. Sometimes I feel a bit… lightheaded. Not often, but it happens. And my appetite isn’t what it used to be. I used to love a good meal, but now… food just doesn't seem as appealing. I’ve lost a little weight, I think. Not much, but my trousers feel a bit looser.
DOCTOR: Okay, lightheadedness and a decreased appetite with some weight loss. Those are all important things to consider. Just to get a more complete picture, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or urination?
PATIENT: Oh… now you’re asking things I don’t really like to talk about. Look, Doctor, I just came for the lab work. Is that really necessary? I’m an old man. Things are going to be… off, sometimes. Can’t we just get the tests done?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask, Mr. Croonquist. I apologize if I was getting too detailed too quickly. It's important to me that you feel comfortable, and we can absolutely focus on the lab work if that’s what you prefer. However, asking about these things helps me understand the bigger picture and ensure we’re not missing anything important. It’s not about diagnosing anything right now, but making sure we’re being thorough. Would you mind if I just quickly ask about any history of shortness of breath or chest pain?
PATIENT: No shortness of breath, no. And no chest pain, thankfully. My heart’s always been strong, as far as the doctors could tell. Look, I'm just tired of all this. Tired of remembering appointments, tired of filling out forms, tired of… everything. Can we please just get the blood drawn?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Croonquist. I completely understand. We can certainly focus on the lab work. I apologize for pressing you with questions. Before we proceed, just to confirm, you're here today primarily for routine lab work scheduled through Medicare, and you haven't been specifically followed by a primary care physician recently. You've experienced fatigue, some knee pain, decreased appetite with slight weight loss, and occasional lightheadedness. I’m going to order those labs now, and then we can discuss the results when they come back. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s… that’s perfect. Just get the tests done. The quicker I get this over with, the better. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Croonquist. I've ordered a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a Vitamin D level. These will give us a good baseline to start with. The phlebotomist will be with you shortly to draw the blood. It should only take a few minutes. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them, and we can decide if any further investigation is needed. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, severe weakness, or confusion – please don’t hesitate to seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before I let the phlebotomist in?
PATIENT: No… no questions. Just… get it done. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. I understand. I’ll let the phlebotomist know you’re ready. Please don’t hesitate to let us know if you have any concerns during the blood draw. “Phlebotomy to room three, please.” They should be with you any moment now.
PATIENT: .
