DOCTOR: Hi Velda, welcome. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because I’m planning a cruise – a lovely one, actually, to the Mediterranean – and the cruise line requires a bit of medical information before I can confirm my booking. They asked I get it from my doctor, and well, that’s you now, isn’t it? I haven’t been to a doctor in quite some time, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Velda. Many people come in for those types of check-ups before travel. It’s very responsible of you. So, it sounds like this is mostly for the cruise line’s paperwork, but we can certainly use this time to make sure everything is alright with you too. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Mostly paperwork, though a quick check wouldn’t hurt, would it? Let me see… generally, I’m quite well, thank you. I don’t get sick often, and when I do, it's usually just a wee cold. I try to stay active, though I’m not running marathons or anything. I enjoy gardening mostly, and a bit of walking. I do have to admit, my knees aren’t what they used to be, but that’s just age, I suppose. And I lost my husband two years ago, and that was… difficult. But I'm managing. Is there anything specific you need to know?
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband, Velda. That is difficult, and it's good to hear you're managing. It takes strength to get through things like that. And gardening is lovely – good exercise, too, when your knees allow! Let's just go through some things systematically, if that's alright with you. We'll start with any past medical problems you've had. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything – high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, things like that?
PATIENT: That’s very kind of you to say. Yes, well, moving on… let me think. No, nothing major, really. I had chickenpox as a child, naturally, and a bad bout of the flu a few years back, but that’s it, I think. The doctor removed a mole from my back about ten years ago, but it was nothing serious, they said. Just a precaution. I’ve never been told I have high blood pressure or anything like that. I do get a bit of indigestion sometimes, if I eat too much rich food, but I try to avoid that! Is that the sort of thing you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly the sort of thing I'm looking for. So, no serious illnesses, chickenpox as a child, a mole removed ten years ago, and occasional indigestion. That’s helpful. Did you have any problems during the mole removal?
PATIENT: No, not at all. It was quite straightforward. The doctor – a lovely man, Dr. MacIntyre – numbed the area, and it didn’t hurt a bit. A small scar, of course, but nothing noticeable. He sent it off to the lab, as they always do, and everything came back clear. He just wanted to be sure. It was all very efficient and professional. He gave me some ointment to put on it afterwards, and that was that. Is there anything specific about it you need to know? Perhaps the date? I believe it was sometime in… March, 2016, I think. I still have the paperwork somewhere, if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: March 2016, that’s good to know. No need to dig out the paperwork just yet, but it’s good you remember. It’s just helpful for the records. Alright, moving on… have you ever had any surgeries, besides the mole removal?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. The mole removal was the only surgery I’ve ever had, as far as I recall. I had all my wisdom teeth taken out when I was young, of course, but I don’t really count that as surgery, do you? It was just a quick trip to the dentist. Nothing like being properly operated on. No, I’ve been quite fortunate, really. I've never broken any bones or anything like that either. I'm rather careful, you see.
DOCTOR: That is fortunate, Velda. And wisdom teeth removal does count as a procedure, just for the record, but it sounds like you’ve had a very healthy life overall. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s good to know, I suppose. As for my family… well, my mother had arthritis in her hands, quite badly towards the end of her life. And my father had a touch of heart trouble, but he lived to be 82, so it wasn’t too bad. My only brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. He lives in Canada now, and we don't see each other often. There wasn’t much else, I don’t think. No history of cancer or anything like that, thankfully. Is that the sort of information you were after? I always worry I'm forgetting something… it's not that I'm not trying, you understand.
DOCTOR: You’re not forgetting anything, Velda. That’s very helpful information – arthritis in your mother, heart trouble in your father. It’s good to know. And it's completely normal to worry about forgetting things. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: No medications at all, Doctor. Not a single one. I pride myself on that, actually. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. I take a vitamin D supplement in the winter, because we don’t get much sunshine here, but that's it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, or anything like that. I try to eat a healthy diet and get plenty of exercise, so I haven’t needed anything more than that. I've always been lucky with my health, I suppose. Do you think that's a good thing? Not needing medications?
DOCTOR: That is a very good thing, Velda. Maintaining good health through diet and exercise is excellent. And vitamin D in the winter is sensible. Now, just a few more questions and then we can do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies at all, thankfully. Not to penicillin, not to shellfish, not to pollen, nothing. I've always been very fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything and everything, and I haven't had a reaction to any medication I’ve ever taken, which, as I said, hasn't been much. I remember as a child, my mother was terribly allergic to cats, but I never inherited that. No, I’m very lucky. I can’t think of a single thing I’m allergic to. Is that unusual? Perhaps I should be worrying about something… It's just that I've never had any allergies, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s not unusual at all, Velda. In fact, it’s wonderful! It's good you haven't experienced any allergies. Alright, one last thing before the exam. I know we’ve talked about your overall health, but can you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: My lifestyle? Hmm. Well, as I mentioned, I enjoy gardening when the weather is nice. It keeps me active, and I enjoy being outdoors. I live alone now, as you know, since my husband passed. I keep busy with various hobbies - I do a bit of knitting, and I enjoy reading. I'm not much of a television watcher, to be honest. I prefer a good book. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly home-cooked meals. I don't smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with my dinner occasionally. I wouldn’t say it's a particularly exciting lifestyle, but it's a comfortable one. And I enjoy it. Is there anything specific you’re trying to find out?
DOCTOR: No, nothing specific. Just getting a complete picture. It sounds like a very healthy and fulfilling lifestyle, Velda. Alright, if you’re comfortable, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just a listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a quick look in your ears, eyes, and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. As long as it's quick, as you say. I’m not overly fond of doctors’ examinations, to be honest, but I understand it’s necessary. I suppose. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. Do I need to undress, or…?
DOCTOR: No need to undress completely. Just rolling up your sleeves will be fine, and we'll take your blood pressure with your shirt on. We'll just listen to your heart and lungs, so you can sit back and relax. I'll explain everything as I go. First, let’s just check your blood pressure. Could you please sit here and keep your arm relaxed?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Relaxed, you say? That’s usually quite easy for me. I’m not a particularly anxious person, you see. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I do have rather sensitive skin, but I don’t think that will be a problem, will it?
DOCTOR: No, I don’t anticipate any problems. This will just take a moment. Okay… 128 over 76. That’s a good reading, Velda. Perfectly normal. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular and normal. Lungs are clear. Everything sounds good so far. Now, I’ll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Just open your mouth for me, please.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. Just let me know if you see anything untoward. I do tend to get a bit of a tickle in my throat sometimes, but I don’t think it’s anything serious. I’ve never smoked, as I mentioned, so it couldn't be anything related to that. And I don't have any allergies, thankfully. I just hope I'm not distracting you with all my talking… I do tend to ramble on, my friends tell me.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not distracting me at all, Velda. And your throat looks perfectly normal. No redness or swelling. Everything looks clear. Ears are clear as well. No signs of infection or fluid build-up. Everything sounds and looks good, Velda. You’re in good health. This quick exam confirms what you’ve already told me – you’re doing very well. Now, do you have any questions for me, or anything you’d like to discuss?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very reassuring to hear, Doctor. Thank you. No, I don’t think I have any questions, actually. Everything seems to be in order, thankfully. I suppose I was just a bit anxious about the cruise line’s requirements, and making sure I was fit enough to travel. But you've put my mind at rest. Would you be able to provide me with a letter confirming I’ve had a medical check-up and am fit to travel? That’s all the cruise line requires, I believe.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Velda. I can certainly do that for you. I’ll just type up a quick note summarizing our consultation and stating that you are in good health and fit for travel. Is there anything specific about your travel plans I should mention in the letter?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don’t think so. Just a general statement will be fine. The cruise is to the Mediterranean, and it’s for two weeks. I’ll be mostly sightseeing and relaxing, I suppose. No strenuous activities planned. Nothing like climbing mountains or anything like that! Just a pleasant holiday. And perhaps a bit of sunbathing, if the weather is nice. It's a cruise I've always wanted to take, you see. My husband and I had planned it for years, but… well, never mind. Just a general statement will be perfectly sufficient, thank you. I appreciate your help, Doctor. It's a weight off my mind.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Velda. This summarizes our consultation and states you are in good health and fit for travel to the Mediterranean for two weeks. It also mentions the absence of any strenuous activity planned. I’m glad I could help put your mind at rest. Do you have any other concerns at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s perfect. Absolutely perfect. Thank you very much for your time and your kindness. You’ve been very reassuring, and I feel much more confident about my trip now. I believe that’s everything. I do appreciate your help, and I won't hesitate to come back if I have any concerns in the future.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Velda. I’m glad I could help. Enjoy your cruise! And don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future. Have a wonderful time, and safe travels!
