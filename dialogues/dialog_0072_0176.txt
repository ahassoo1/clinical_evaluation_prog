DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I am Dr. Hembrey. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… embarrassing, really. I’ve got the hiccups. And they just won’t stop. It’s been over two days now. It’s not like a few little ones, it’s… constant.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. For… well, since the morning of August 1st, I think. I was at a friend’s barbecue, having a lovely time, and then… hic …they started. I thought they’d go away on their own, you know? But no. hic It's really quite disruptive, Doctor. I manage events, and it's hard to talk to clients when you're… hic …doing that all the time.
DOCTOR: Right. And you’ve tried… what exactly to resolve this?
PATIENT: Oh, everything I could think of! Holding my breath, drinking water really fast… someone told me to swallow a teaspoon of sugar, I tried that. It didn’t help. hic I even had my friend scare me, which usually works, but… nothing. I'm starting to feel a bit silly, honestly. hic It's just… relentless.
DOCTOR: Ms. Redeye, while I appreciate you attempting home remedies, persistent hiccups for this duration are… unusual. Let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you experienced hiccups like this before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this, anyway. I get hiccups sometimes, like anyone, after eating too fast or something. But they always stop quickly. hic This is… different. I’ve never had them go on for this long. I don’t have any… well, I don’t usually get sick. I eat fairly well, I think. hic I’ve had the usual colds and flu over the years, but nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. hic I don't really like them. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, if needed, but that’s it. And I haven't taken anything for a headache in months. hic Honestly, I'm surprised how much a nuisance these hiccups are being when I don’t even take regular medication.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything as a child, my mother always said. hic No reactions to anything, ever. I’ve had no problems with bee stings or anything like that either. hic I'm pretty sure. I mean, I’ve never had a reaction. I suppose you’d know if there was something obvious on my record, wouldn’t you?
DOCTOR: Your record is…sparse, Ms. Redeye. As you stated. Now, let’s move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well… my mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And she had some trouble with her heart later in life. hic My father… he was a healthy man, mostly. Worked outside all his life. He died in an accident, unfortunately. hic I don’t think there was anything major on either side of the family, to be honest. Nothing that I’m aware of, anyway. We weren’t really ones for talking about health much. hic It was more…practical matters, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? hic Oh. Well… I'm divorced. Been divorced for about fifteen years now. hic I manage events, like I said. Mostly corporate functions and weddings. It keeps me busy. I don’t drink alcohol, and I don’t smoke. hic I used to, a long time ago, but I quit years ago. I live alone, in the city. hic And… that’s about it, really. Not much of a social life these days, with work.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Redeye, while I understand this is…annoying, the fact that this has persisted for two days warrants a brief physical examination. Let’s just rule out anything obvious. Please lie down on the examination table. I will listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly palpate your abdomen.
PATIENT: Oh. hic Alright. I suppose so. I hadn’t thought it would come to that. hic It just feels a bit… excessive for hiccups, doesn’t it? But if you think it’s necessary… hic I’ll lie down. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: It will be a quick assessment, Ms. Redeye. Please take a deep breath. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender… no masses palpated. Reflexes appear normal. Everything appears within normal limits. However, persistent hiccups can sometimes be a sign of something more… unusual. Given your history, and lack of any obvious findings, I would like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count, just to be certain.
PATIENT: Oh. hic An X-ray? And blood work? hic That sounds… serious. Is it something to worry about, Doctor? hic I mean, I just have hiccups. I thought it was just… nerves or something. hic Is it possible it could be something… psychological? hic I’ve been a bit stressed with work lately, preparing for a big event next month. hic I don't want to go running around getting tests if it’s just a little anxiety.
DOCTOR: Ms. Redeye, while I appreciate your concern, it is my professional responsibility to rule out any potential underlying causes for persistent symptoms. While stress can certainly exacerbate certain conditions, attributing this solely to anxiety without proper investigation would be… irresponsible. I will order the X-ray and blood work. The lab is located down the hall. Once the results are back, we can discuss them further. It's unlikely to be anything serious, but we need to gather the information to be certain. I will also prescribe a medication to temporarily alleviate the hiccups while we await the results. It is a common muscle relaxant. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. hic Alright. If you think it's necessary. hic A muscle relaxant… that sounds… better than an X-ray, I suppose. hic What are the side effects? hic I don’t want to be drowsy, I have to be alert for the event planning. hic And how long will it take to get the results back? hic It’s just… all a bit overwhelming. hic I thought I was just going to get some advice about holding my breath or something.
DOCTOR: The muscle relaxant, baclofen, can cause drowsiness in some patients, but it is usually mild. We will start with a low dose to minimize that risk. Avoid operating heavy machinery or driving until you know how it affects you. The blood work results typically take 24-48 hours. The X-ray results should be available sooner. I will send the orders to the lab and have a nurse provide you with a prescription. If the hiccups worsen significantly, or you develop any other symptoms, such as chest pain or shortness of breath, seek immediate medical attention. Now, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. hic Just… thank you, Doctor. hic I appreciate you taking the time to look into it. hic Hopefully, it’s nothing serious. hic I’ll go and get the blood work done now. hic And try not to think about it too much. hic It's just… frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Redeye. The nurse will assist you with the lab order. Please follow up with me once you have the results. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
