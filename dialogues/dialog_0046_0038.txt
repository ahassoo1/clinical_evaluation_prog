DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconte. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, it’s a bit difficult for me to explain precisely. I… I understand I need some paperwork completed. Something about making sure my wishes are known, should… should something happen. I believe it’s called an Advance Directive or a POLST form? My solicitor suggested it, but I confess the details are rather hazy.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. An Advance Directive and POLST form are excellent ways to ensure your healthcare wishes are respected, should you be unable to communicate them yourself. It's very thoughtful of you to be proactive about this. To begin, let's clarify what brings you to want to complete these forms today. Is there a specific health concern that prompted this discussion, or are you simply planning ahead?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I’m not entirely sure. My memory… it isn’t what it once was. There haven’t been any recent incidents that spurred this, not that I recall. My divorce was… rather unpleasant, and I believe my solicitor felt it prudent, given… well, given the circumstances. He mentioned it was important to have everything clearly documented, just in case. I suppose it’s peace of mind, isn’t it? Though what I’d want documented… that's where I find myself struggling.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s very common to feel overwhelmed by these forms, especially when trying to anticipate every possible scenario. And it's quite responsible of you to consider this. To help me guide you through the process, could you tell me a bit more about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly. As far as I am aware, I am in relatively good health. I don’t take any regular medication, aside from a vitamin D supplement during the winter months. I try to maintain a healthy diet, though I do confess a weakness for pastries. I’m quite active, I enjoy long walks in the countryside – though my stamina isn’t what it once was, naturally. I had a rather nasty bout of the flu last winter, but recovered fully. Beyond that… I’m afraid I can’t recall any significant medical history. I do have a family physician back in the city, but I haven’t seen him in some time. Does that provide sufficient information?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good start, thank you. No regular medications besides vitamin D, active lifestyle, and a recent bout of the flu. That’s helpful. And you mentioned a family physician in the city?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Dr. Alistair Finch. He’s been my physician for… oh, goodness, I suppose nearly fifteen years now. I haven’t been to see him recently – simply haven’t had the opportunity. It's rather difficult getting back to the city these days. I relocated to the countryside a little over a year ago, seeking a quieter existence, you see. His contact information is with my solicitor, I believe. Should you require it.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. We may reach out to him for your medical records, with your permission, of course. It’s always helpful to have a complete picture. Now, thinking about your health in general, are there any specific concerns you have now?
PATIENT: Specific concerns… not precisely. I do experience occasional bouts of fatigue, but I attribute that to my age, perhaps. And my joints… they ache a little more than they used to, especially after a long walk. Nothing debilitating, mind you. Just… the usual aches and pains that come with getting older. I wouldn't say it worries me, Doctor. It’s simply… a gradual decline. I suppose I'm more concerned about ensuring my wishes are respected, should anything unforeseen occur, than I am about my current health. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. It's very common to focus on planning for the future, especially when you're feeling generally well. Occasional fatigue and joint aches… those are common as well, and it’s good that they aren’t debilitating. To get a clearer picture, and just to be thorough, could you briefly tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don’t believe I have any significant allergies. I used to have a mild reaction to certain pollens as a child, but that hasn’t bothered me for decades. I can eat anything, as far as I am aware. No reactions to any medications, food, or animals. I don’t have any known sensitivities. Though… my ex-husband’s perfume was rather irritating, but I hardly consider that a medical allergy. Is that the sort of thing you meant, Doctor?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not quite what I meant, but thank you for sharing! It's good to know you don't have any known allergies. Now, thinking about your family, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. My family is rather… scattered. I didn’t have a particularly close relationship with my parents, and I’m not in contact with many relatives. My maternal grandmother suffered from… I believe it was a form of heart disease, though the details are hazy. And my uncle, on my father’s side, had diabetes, but he lived a very unhealthy lifestyle, so I doubt that’s relevant. Beyond that… I’m afraid I don’t recall any significant medical history within my family. It’s not something we discussed much, to be honest. Is that unhelpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Not at all. It’s very common for family medical history to be incomplete. Heart disease in your maternal grandmother and diabetes in your uncle… that’s helpful information to have, even if the details are limited. One final question for now. Would you mind briefly describing your social habits?
PATIENT: My social habits? Well, since relocating to the countryside, they’ve become… rather subdued. I live alone, and I don’t have many close friends nearby. I enjoy the occasional visit from my solicitor, but he’s more of a professional acquaintance than a social companion. I attend the local village hall occasionally, for tea and biscuits, but I’m not particularly outgoing. I spend most of my time reading, gardening, and walking in the fields. It’s a quiet life, Doctor, but it’s a life I’ve chosen. Is there a particular reason you ask?
DOCTOR: Just gathering a complete picture of your lifestyle, Ms. Buoniconte. It’s helpful to know. Now, before we move on to discussing the Advance Directive and POLST form, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. It will allow me to assess your overall health and address any potential concerns. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical examination… yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I confess I haven’t had one in some time, so it’s probably a good idea. Though please, do be gentle. My joints aren’t what they used to be. Lead the way, Doctor. I trust your judgement entirely.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Of course, I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’d like to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your abdomen. Finally, I’ll check your reflexes and range of motion. If anything feels uncomfortable at any point, please let me know immediately. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit comfortably with your feet flat on the floor and your arm relaxed?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. As you wish. I must say, this is a rather… clinical setting. It's been some time since I’ve been in a doctor’s office. Do try to be gentle, as you promised. I don’t believe my blood pressure is particularly high, but one never knows. Proceed when you’re ready, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax and breathe normally. Your blood pressure is 138/82. Your pulse is 72 beats per minute, regular and strong. Your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, and your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. Everything seems within normal limits so far. Take nice, deep breaths for me, please. I'm listening for any unusual sounds. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Does this cause you any discomfort?
PATIENT: No discomfort at all, Doctor. Not even a twinge. My abdomen is… rather unremarkable, I’m afraid. I do occasionally experience a little bloating after meals, but nothing of any concern. I used to suffer from rather dreadful indigestion as a child, but that hasn't bothered me for decades. Perhaps I simply ate too many pastries. Proceed with the examination when you're ready, Doctor. You seem to be very thorough.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No tenderness noted on palpation. This might feel a little strange. Just relax your arm, and I’ll tap on your tendon. Good response. Good response there as well. Finally, I’ll assess your range of motion in your joints. Could you please bend your elbows, wrists, knees, and ankles for me?
PATIENT: As you wish, Doctor. Though I must confess, my joints aren't as flexible as they once were. I do experience a little stiffness, particularly in the mornings. Gardening keeps them moving, but it's a constant effort, I assure you. Is this sufficient, Doctor? Or is there anything else you'd like me to do?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's quite sufficient. I notice a slight decrease in range of motion in your wrists and knees, with mild discomfort on extension. This is consistent with age-related changes, and nothing of immediate concern. Alright, Ms. Buoniconte. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits, with some expected age-related changes in your joints. Your vital signs are stable, and your heart and lungs sound clear. Do you have any questions about the findings?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe I do. Your explanation is perfectly clear. It’s… reassuring to hear that everything is as expected, given my age. I suppose one can’t expect to remain perpetually youthful, can one? Now, if you don’t mind, perhaps we could proceed with discussing the Advance Directive and POLST form? I confess I’m still rather vague on the details, and I’d like to ensure my wishes are properly documented.
DOCTOR: Certainly. That’s an excellent idea. The Advance Directive and POLST form are designed to ensure your healthcare wishes are respected, even if you’re unable to communicate them yourself. Essentially, an Advance Directive is a legal document that outlines your overall healthcare preferences. It allows you to designate a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you become incapacitated. The POLST form, on the other hand, is a more specific medical order. It outlines your wishes regarding certain life-sustaining treatments, such as CPR, intubation, and artificial nutrition. It’s typically used for patients with serious illnesses or frailty. Do you have any questions about the difference between the two forms?
PATIENT: That clarifies things somewhat, Doctor. So, the Advance Directive is a more general statement of intent, while the POLST form is a specific set of medical orders? And the healthcare proxy… that’s the person who would actually make the decisions if I were unable to do so myself? Would I need to specify what decisions they’re authorized to make, or is it a blanket authorization? I confess, I’m still rather uncertain about the entire process, and I’d like to ensure I understand everything thoroughly before proceeding.
DOCTOR: You’ve hit upon the key distinctions perfectly. Yes, the Advance Directive is a broader statement of your values and wishes, while the POLST form is a set of specific medical orders. And you’re right to ask about the healthcare proxy. You can absolutely specify what decisions they’re authorized to make. In fact, it's highly recommended. You can outline very specific scenarios and preferences, or you can grant them broad authority to make decisions in any situation. The choice is entirely yours. This form, for example, allows you to specify your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatments, pain management, and end-of-life care. You can also designate your healthcare proxy and outline their authority. We can go through it together, section by section, and I can answer any questions you have along the way. Does that sound like a reasonable approach?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Going through it section by section would be immensely helpful. I confess, the legal jargon is rather daunting, and I’d like to ensure I understand the implications of each clause before signing anything. Perhaps we could start with the section regarding the designation of a healthcare proxy? I believe my solicitor suggested my neighbor, Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth. She’s a retired nurse, and I trust her implicitly. But I’m unsure about the specific language required to formally designate her as my proxy.
DOCTOR: Excellent choice. Having a healthcare proxy with a medical background is very helpful. This line requires you to clearly state your neighbor’s full legal name and address. It’s important to be precise, as this will be legally binding. Here, you need to explicitly state that you are granting Mrs. Ainsworth the authority to make healthcare decisions on your behalf if you become incapacitated. The language is fairly straightforward, but it’s important to understand that this is a significant responsibility. Do you have Mrs. Ainsworth’s full legal name and address readily available?
PATIENT: Yes, fortunately, I anticipated this and jotted it down. Let me see… Eleanor Ainsworth, 14 Willow Creek Lane, here in the village. That’s correct, isn’t it? I’m also rather uncertain about the level of authority I should grant her. Should I specify certain treatments I would or would not want, or is it best to leave it open-ended? I confess, discussing end-of-life care is rather… unpleasant, but I suppose it’s necessary.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Eleanor Ainsworth, 14 Willow Creek Lane. Excellent preparation. And you’re right to ask about the level of authority. It’s entirely up to you. You can be as specific as you like, outlining your wishes regarding every possible treatment scenario. Or, you can grant her broad authority, allowing her to make decisions based on her best judgement, taking into account your values and preferences. This section allows you to outline your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatments, such as CPR, intubation, mechanical ventilation, and artificial nutrition. You can also specify whether you want to be resuscitated in the event of cardiac arrest, and whether you want to be kept alive on life support if you have no reasonable hope of recovery. It’s perfectly acceptable to leave this section blank if you’re not comfortable specifying your wishes. However, the more information you provide, the clearer your wishes will be to your healthcare proxy, and the easier it will be for them to make decisions on your behalf. Do you have any initial thoughts on what you would like to include in this section?
PATIENT: This is rather… overwhelming, Doctor. I suppose I’m most certain about not wanting to be kept alive on life support indefinitely if there’s no reasonable hope of recovery. I’ve seen it happen to others, and it seems… undignified. But specifying when that point is reached… that’s difficult. Perhaps I could simply state that I want Mrs. Ainsworth to prioritize my quality of life, and to make decisions based on what she believes I would want, given my values and preferences? Would that be sufficient? I confess, I’m not comfortable making specific pronouncements about my own mortality. It feels… presumptuous, somehow.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. Buoniconte. It's absolutely fine to leave it open-ended and trust your healthcare proxy to make decisions based on your values and preferences. In fact, many people choose to do exactly that. This is a clear and concise statement, and it provides your healthcare proxy with sufficient guidance to make informed decisions on your behalf. Shall we move on to the next section of the form, which addresses the designation of an alternate healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I suppose so. It’s best to be prepared, isn’t it? Though I confess, I haven’t given much thought to an alternate proxy. My solicitor, Mr. Davies, is a rather sensible man. Perhaps he would be suitable? He’s familiar with my affairs, and I trust his judgement implicitly. But I’m unsure if he’d be willing to take on such a responsibility. He’s a very busy man, you see. Would it be appropriate to contact him without his prior consent?
DOCTOR: That’s a good idea, Mr. Davies sounds like a sensible choice. And you are absolutely right to ask about prior consent. It’s definitely best to ask him if he’s willing to serve as your alternate healthcare proxy before designating him in the form. It’s a significant responsibility, and you don't want to put him in an awkward position. Here, you simply need to provide his full legal name, address, and contact information. You can also add a brief note indicating that you have confirmed his willingness to serve as your proxy. Do you have Mr. Davies’s contact information readily available?
PATIENT: Yes, fortunately, I have his card right here. Let me see… Davies & Finch Solicitors, 12 High Street, here in the village. His telephone number is 01476 854321. It seems rather ironic that his name is Finch, given that my own physician is also named Finch. Perhaps it’s a sign. But I suppose it’s merely a coincidence. Now, if you don’t mind, perhaps we could proceed with the POLST form? I confess, I’m rather anxious to have this completed, and to finally put my mind at rest.
DOCTOR: A rather charming coincidence indeed. Excellent. Now, let’s move on to the POLST form. This form is a bit more specific than the Advance Directive, as it outlines your wishes regarding certain life-sustaining treatments. The first section addresses CPR – cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Here, you can indicate whether you want to be resuscitated in the event of cardiac arrest. The options are “Full treatment,” “Limited treatment,” or “No treatment.” “Full treatment” means that healthcare providers will attempt to resuscitate you using all available methods. “Limited treatment” means that they will only attempt certain methods, such as chest compressions. And “No treatment” means that they will not attempt to resuscitate you. What are your wishes regarding CPR?
PATIENT: This is rather… difficult. I confess, I’ve always been rather ambivalent about CPR. On the one hand, I believe in doing everything possible to preserve life. But on the other hand, I’ve also seen the toll it can take on patients, and the limited success it often has. Perhaps “Limited treatment” would be the most appropriate option? I wouldn’t want to be subjected to aggressive interventions if there’s no reasonable hope of recovery. But I also wouldn’t want to be denied basic life support if there’s a chance of survival. Would that be sufficient? Or is it best to be more specific?
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable position, Ms. Buoniconte. It’s perfectly acceptable to choose “Limited treatment,” and it reflects a thoughtful consideration of the potential benefits and risks. Here, you can specify which types of interventions you want to limit. The options include chest compressions, artificial ventilation, and advanced airway management. Do you have any preferences regarding which types of interventions you want to limit?
PATIENT: Hmm. I suppose I would be comfortable with chest compressions, as they seem relatively non-invasive. But I would prefer to avoid artificial ventilation and advanced airway management, as they seem rather aggressive and uncomfortable. Would that be sufficient? Or is it best to be even more specific? I confess, I’m rather anxious to have this completed, and to finally put my mind at rest. It’s rather overwhelming, you see, and I’m not sure if I’m making the right decisions. Perhaps I should consult with my solicitor before proceeding?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. Buoniconte. It's perfectly reasonable to want to consult with your solicitor before proceeding, especially if you're feeling overwhelmed. He can provide you with legal advice and ensure that your wishes are properly documented. And I want to assure you that we've covered all the essential points. You've thought through your wishes carefully, and you've made informed decisions based on your values and preferences. Would you like me to pause here, and allow you to consult with your solicitor?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I believe that would be best. I confess, I feel much more comfortable having Mr. Davies review the form before signing anything. Perhaps we can schedule another appointment for next week? I'll contact my solicitor and arrange for him to review the form. Thank you for your patience and guidance, Doctor. You've been most helpful. I believe I've covered everything for today. .
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconte. That’s a very sensible decision. We can schedule another appointment for next week, whenever it’s convenient for you. And please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you next week. Have a good day, Ms. Buoniconte.
