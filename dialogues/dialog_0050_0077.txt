DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bigger. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you're 86 years young. That's quite a milestone. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Eighty-six, yes. Still working, you know. Gotta keep busy. The company… they make me come for this check-up. Something about dust. I feel fine. Never felt better, actually. But they insist. Waste of my time, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand your… reservations, Mr. Bigger. While you feel fine, these routine check-ups are often preventative, and your company is rightly concerned about potential occupational hazards. “Dust,” you say?
PATIENT: Hazards! What hazards? I been working in that mine for sixty years. Sixty years! Dust is just… dust. Always been dust. It's not like it's new. They worry too much these days. Back in my time… we didn’t have time for all this fuss. Just got on with it.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your… robust history, Mr. Bigger, prolonged exposure to any particulate matter, even seemingly innocuous “dust,” can have cumulative effects on the respiratory system. Sixty years is a significant duration. To be thorough, and to appease your employer, I'd like to ask a few questions about your work and any symptoms you might be experiencing, however minor. Do you experience any shortness of breath, even with mild exertion?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? No. I walk to the shop every morning! Long walk, it is. And I climb the stairs to my flat. Two flights! You think I’d be climbing stairs if I was short of breath? Rubbish. They think I’m weak, just because I’m old. I still got strength, you know. More than some young fellas.
DOCTOR: Very good. That’s… reassuring. And you haven't noticed any coughing, wheezing, or chest tightness?
PATIENT: Coughing? Sometimes. Everyone coughs! Especially in the… the harmattan season. Dry air, you see. But not from the mine. Just… just the weather. Wheezing… no. Never wheeze. And chest… feels alright. Solid. Like a rock. They think they know better, these doctors. Always looking for something wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Mr. Bigger. However, even a seemingly benign cough can indicate underlying issues, particularly with a work history like yours. Now, regarding your past medical history… have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions – perhaps high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Maybe. Doctor told me something once, long ago. I didn’t listen properly. Too busy working. Diabetes? No. Never sweet things. I like my yam and plantain, but not all those sugary drinks. Heart… feels strong. Always been strong. They gave me some pills, years back. For the blood, I think. Stopped taking them. Didn’t see the point. Waste of money, pills are.
DOCTOR: I see. And you mentioned stopping medication… do you recall the name of the medication, or what it was prescribed for specifically?
PATIENT: Hmph. No. Old doctor, retired now. Small practice in… in the village. Can’t remember names. All doctors look the same to me. Just gave me little white pills. For my… for my pressure, I think. Made me feel a bit dizzy sometimes, so I stopped. Better to feel my own strength, than feel weak from their pills. They don't understand hard work.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for natural strength, Mr. Bigger. However, discontinuing prescribed medication can have consequences. Now, let's move on to family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, lung problems, or cancer, perhaps?
PATIENT: Family? Mostly gone now. My wife… passed a long time ago. Had a bit of trouble with her… with her stomach, I think. Old age, mostly. My brother… he worked in the market. Healthy as a horse. Never sick a day in his life. My sister… she had many children. Never heard of any fancy illnesses. Just… normal things. Old age, mostly. They were strong people. Worked hard. Didn’t need doctors.
DOCTOR: I see. And regarding your current lifestyle… do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Bad for the lungs, you know. Always told my wife, “Never smoke, it’s foolishness.” She agreed. A sensible woman, my wife. Waste of money, too. Just silly habit. My brother smoked a bit, when he was young. Didn't last long. Coughing all the time. That's why I never started.
DOCTOR: Very good. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Occasionally. Palm wine, sometimes. With friends. Just a small glass, to celebrate. Nothing strong. My wife used to make it, very good it was. Not every day, mind you. Just special occasions. A little bit of palm wine never hurt anyone. Besides, it helps with digestion, you know.
DOCTOR: I see. Now, Mr. Bigger, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, just to get a baseline assessment. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, check your blood pressure, and perhaps take a look in your ears and throat. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Examination? Hmmph. What's the point? I told you, I feel fine. But… alright. Do it quickly, then. I haven't got all day. Important things to do. But don't poke around too much. And tell me what you’re doing, as you go along. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will explain everything as I proceed. First, I’ll take your blood pressure. This will give us a reading of how strongly your blood is pushing against your artery walls. Just relax your arm, please.
PATIENT: Hmph. Blood pressure. Always worrying about blood pressure. Back in my day, we didn't have machines for everything. You felt if you were strong or not. This thing… it squeezes too tight. Is it finished yet?
DOCTOR: It is almost finished, Mr. Bigger. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, at 160 over 95. This is not cause for immediate alarm, but it does warrant further attention. Now, I will listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take slow, deep breaths.
PATIENT: Hmph. Elevated? What does that mean? I feel perfectly alright! This thing… it’s cold. And you’re pressing too hard. I can feel it on my ribs. Back in my day, doctors had gentle hands. Not like these… modern contraptions. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: I apologize if the examination is uncomfortable, Mr. Bigger. I am attempting to be thorough. I am hearing some diminished breath sounds, particularly in the lower lobes of your lungs. This could be due to a number of factors, and requires further investigation. Now, I'll just briefly examine your throat and ears.
PATIENT: Hmph. Diminished? What does that mean either? I’m breathing perfectly fine! Don’t poke too hard! It tickles! And my ears are fine. Never had trouble hearing. This is a waste of time, you know. A complete waste of time. I told you, I’m strong. Still got all my faculties. Just tell me when it's finished.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bigger. The physical examination is complete. Based on your history and the findings of the examination – specifically the diminished breath sounds and slightly elevated blood pressure – I would like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of your overall health. These include a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs, and a complete blood count and comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your general health and kidney function. I also recommend an electrocardiogram, or ECG, to check your heart rhythm. Would you be amenable to these tests?
PATIENT: Tests? Hmph. More poking and prodding? Look, I told you, I feel fine. This is all unnecessary. But… if it will get them off my back… alright. Do the tests. But I don’t want any surprises. And I want the results quickly. I haven’t got time to be waiting around. And explain everything to me. No fancy medical jargon. I want to understand what you’re doing, and why.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bigger. I will ensure that all tests are explained to you in plain language, and I will expedite the process as much as possible. The chest X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and identify any abnormalities. The blood tests will provide information about your overall health and kidney function, and the ECG will assess your heart rhythm. We will schedule these tests for tomorrow morning at the imaging center across the street. The results typically take 24-48 hours to return. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to monitor your blood pressure at home, if possible. Do you have any questions at this time?
PATIENT: Home? I don't have one of those fancy machines. I told you, I feel fine. What will this cost me? My insurance… will it cover all this? Back in my day, doctors didn't charge so much for a simple check-up. And you still haven't told me what all this means. Are my lungs bad? Is my heart failing? Don't beat around the bush. Just tell me straight.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bigger, I understand your concerns. Allow me to clarify. The tests are not being ordered because I believe you are immediately in danger, but rather to obtain a more complete picture of your health given your prolonged occupational exposure and slightly elevated blood pressure. I cannot definitively say whether your lungs are "bad" or your heart is "failing" without reviewing the results of the tests. That is precisely why we are conducting them. Regarding cost, I will have the billing department verify your insurance coverage and provide you with an estimated out-of-pocket expense. I assure you, we will do everything we can to minimize the financial burden. In the meantime, let me reiterate: the diminished breath sounds could be caused by a number of benign factors, such as age-related changes or mild inflammation. The blood tests will help us rule out any underlying conditions. We are being thorough, Mr. Bigger, and that is in your best interest. Do you have any further questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Thorough. That's what you say. But I still think it's a waste of time. Just get it over with. Schedule the tests. And make sure they don't poke too hard. I'm an old man, you know. And I want the results quickly. Don't make me come back here again. And tell them I don't want any surprises. Modern medicine… all poking and prodding and expensive machines…
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bigger. I will schedule the tests for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM at the imaging center across the street. I will ensure that the technicians are aware of your concerns regarding discomfort, and I will personally review the results as soon as they become available. I will also have the billing department contact you regarding insurance coverage. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Bigger. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms before your appointment, please do not hesitate to contact the clinic. And one final point, Mr. Bigger: while I respect your skepticism, it is important to remember that preventative care can often identify and address potential problems before they become serious. Have a good day, Mr. Bigger.
PATIENT: Hmph. We'll see. Waste of time… all a waste of time…
