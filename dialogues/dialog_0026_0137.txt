DOCTOR: Good morning, Lindra. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It's lovely to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. My... how you say... the place I want to live, for old people? They want me to... check with doctor first. For stay there.
DOCTOR: Ah, I understand. You're looking into a residential facility, and they've requested a medical evaluation first. That's very common, and a good idea. Let's get some information to make sure everything goes smoothly. To start, can you tell me a little bit about why you're considering a place like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. My husband, he... not so good anymore. I try to take care, but is hard now. And the house... is big. Too much for me alone. I think is better place where people help, yes? He stay with me now, but... is not safe sometimes. He forget things.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’ve been doing a lot of caring for your husband, and it’s becoming more challenging. It's very thoughtful of you to consider a place where you both can receive the support you need. It’s perfectly alright to ask for help, Lindra. To help me understand the situation a bit better, could you tell me a little about your husband’s health?
PATIENT: He... old too, you know? Eighty-five. He get confused sometimes. Like... he not remember where he is. Or what day is. And he fall down a few times. Not break anything, but… scare me. He have the… sugar sickness? Diabetes, I think the doctor say. He take pills for that. And for the… pressure, yes, blood pressure. He see the doctor, but… not so much help now. He just… quiet.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Lindra. So he's 85, experiences some confusion and has had a few falls, and he’s being treated for diabetes and high blood pressure. And you mentioned he's become quieter recently. Now, thinking about you, Lindra, how are you feeling?
PATIENT: Me? I… okay. Tired, maybe. Old too, you know? My bones… ache sometimes. And I… forget things now too. Not so bad like him, but… things. Names, mostly. I walk okay, but… slow. I see the doctor sometimes for the… the aches. And for my eyes. They not so good anymore. But I eat good. And I sleep okay. Mostly.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're doing your best to stay healthy, and it's perfectly normal to experience some aches and memory changes as we get older. It’s good you’re seeing a doctor for those things. To get a clearer picture, would you mind if I ask about any medications you or your husband are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, okay. He take… a white pill for the sugar. And a little blue one for the pressure, I think. Sometimes the doctor change them. I take… a yellow pill for my bones. And drops for my eyes. I think that is all. I not remember the names, sorry. The bottles… they have many numbers.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lindra. Numbers are confusing! Don't worry about the names. Knowing you both are taking something for those conditions is helpful. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, just to get a better understanding of your overall health. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I have the babies, yes. That is surgery. Many years ago. And… oh! I have the gallbladder out. A long time ago too. Maybe twenty years. And… I think that is all. Nothing else. I not like surgery. Too scary.
DOCTOR: Alright, so you’ve had a cesarean section for your children and had your gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. Good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she have the heart trouble. And my father… he have the sugar sickness too, like my husband. And… my sister, she have the trouble with her mind, when she get old. Forget everything. Like… the place where she is. Is scary. That is why I worry.
DOCTOR: I understand. So a history of heart trouble, diabetes, and dementia in your family. That gives me some helpful information. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so. Not to food. And not to… plants. Sometimes the dust make me cough, but… that is not allergy, I think. I breathe okay. No trouble with… the pollen. I not remember ever have allergy. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when the bugs bite me, but that is all.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your heart, lungs, and a few other things. It won’t take long. Would you like to change into a gown, or is that okay as you are?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, okay. The exam is good. I… is okay as I am. I not like to change. Is cold in there, you know? I have this sweater. Is warm. You can listen with the sweater, yes?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Lindra. We can definitely work with the sweater. That’s perfectly fine. Okay, take a nice, deep breath for me… and another one… Good. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit of a murmur. Not concerning at this point, but something we’ll keep an eye on. Your lungs sound clear. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/85, and your pulse is 78, which is within a normal range. Some mild swelling in your hands, and a little tenderness when I touch your joints. That could be arthritis. Your reflexes are a little slow, but that’s common with age. Your ears look clear, and your eyes… they show some signs of cataracts, which is also very common with age. Overall, everything seems consistent with your age and what you've told me.
PATIENT: Oh. That is good. The cataracts… they bother me sometimes, when I drive at night. The doctor say I need glasses, but… I have many glasses already. Is hard to see. So… what you think? Is okay for me to go to the place? For stay with my husband?
DOCTOR: Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, there’s no medical reason why you and your husband couldn’t consider a residential facility. It sounds like you both have some manageable health conditions, and it’s clear you’re very proactive about your care. However, I do want to be thorough. Because of your husband’s confusion and falls, and your own memory concerns, I think it would be beneficial to have a more comprehensive evaluation of his cognitive function, just to get a clearer understanding of what's going on. I’d also recommend a fall risk assessment for both of you. This would involve looking at things like your balance, gait, and medications, and making recommendations to prevent falls. Finally, given your cataracts, it might be helpful to revisit that with an ophthalmologist. They may be able to offer a solution that helps improve your vision, especially for driving at night. Would you be open to me scheduling those assessments for your husband?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, okay. The assessments… for my husband, that is good. If it help him, yes. And maybe the eyes, if I have time. Is hard to go to many doctors, you know? But… if it help. So… you think is okay? For us to go? To the place? Is safe? I worry about safe. I not want to fall. Or… get lost. Or… be alone.
DOCTOR: Lindra, it sounds like it could be a good option for both of you, especially considering the support and safety a residential facility can provide. It's completely understandable to worry about those things – falling, getting lost, feeling alone – and those are all very valid concerns. A good facility will have staff available around the clock to assist with those things, and they’ll be able to create a safe and supportive environment for you and your husband. They also have activities and programs to keep you both engaged and connected with others. Before you make a final decision, I strongly recommend visiting the facility, asking lots of questions, and seeing if it feels like a good fit for both of you. You can also ask about their safety protocols, staffing levels, and the types of activities they offer. I can provide you with a list of reputable facilities in the area, if you’d like. And I’m happy to discuss any concerns you have. In the meantime, let's get those assessments scheduled for your husband. That will give us a clearer picture of his cognitive function, and we can address any potential concerns. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. The list… for the places, that is good. And the assessments… for my husband. You think is good idea? Is not… scary? He get upset sometimes, when you ask him too many questions.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright if he gets upset. We can take it slow and gentle, and I can explain to him why we’re doing the assessments. They’re not meant to be scary, just to help us understand how his brain is working and how we can best support him. We'll focus on things he's comfortable with. I’ll have my nurse, Maria, schedule those assessments for you. She’ll call you tomorrow to find a convenient time. I think taking this step is a positive one, Lindra, and I’m here to support you both through it. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
