DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Krahn. I'm Dr. Noordin. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, well… it’s about a… a check-up, I think. For… work. Something about needing to be cleared for… performances? It’s all a bit hazy, honestly. I just got a notice and they told me to come here. It’s probably for the theater. I used to… work at the theater. A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Right. A performance clearance. Well, we can certainly do that. It's good you're being proactive. Even if it is a bit hazy, let’s try to get some clarity. Just to be sure, what kind of performances are we talking about?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. I mostly… showed people to their seats. And sold tickets. Sometimes I helped with… coats? It wasn't on stage, exactly. More like… around the stage. In the lobby. Years and years ago, though. I really don’t remember the specifics. Everything feels so… distant. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Krahn. The physical demands of selling tickets are… different than, say, a physically strenuous stage performance. It helps me understand what sort of assessment we need to do. So, you’re currently working at the theater, then?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no. Not currently. Not for… a very long time. I did… for many, many years. But… now? No. I… I don’t have a regular job, exactly. Things are… different now. They just sent me this form. I think someone from the old theater must have remembered me. Perhaps they needed a favor? It’s all very confusing.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, you received a form requesting a performance clearance, despite not being currently employed at the theater. And this is just a formality to appease someone?
PATIENT: Yes! That sounds… right. A formality. Yes. That’s it. A favor. Or… someone being overly cautious. It’s… it’s just a lot of bother, if you ask me. I’m an old man, Doctor. Mostly I… well, mostly I keep to myself these days. I don't do much… performing anymore. Though I did enjoy helping people find their seats. It was… rewarding. But that was a long time ago. Is this going to take long? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, even if it's a formality, we still need to make sure you're fit enough to handle something. It doesn't necessarily have to be strenuous, but we have a responsibility to ensure your health and safety. Just a quick check-up, then. Have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Generally well… hmm. Yes, I suppose so. I get a little… stiff sometimes. Especially in the mornings. And my memory… well, you’ve noticed, I’m sure. But nothing… serious. I haven’t been to the doctor in… oh, goodness, I couldn’t even tell you how long. Probably… years. Decades, even. I mostly just try to stay out of trouble. Is there a questionnaire? I’m better at writing things down than… remembering them.
DOCTOR: Yes, a questionnaire would be helpful. It’s a standard review of your health history. It will take some time, but please, take your time and answer to the best of your ability. We’ll go over it together afterwards. Here you go. And if you have any questions, don’t hesitate to ask.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s… much better. Writing things down… yes. Much easier. Hmm. “Do you have any chronic illnesses…” Now, what counts as chronic? This is… complicated. Is there a definition somewhere?
DOCTOR: A chronic illness is a long-lasting health condition that generally can’t be cured but can be managed. Things like heart disease, diabetes, arthritis… that sort of thing. If you haven't been diagnosed with anything like that, just mark "no." Don't overthink it. It's a fairly straightforward question.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, in that case… no. I don’t think so. My joints ache a bit, as I said, but… that’s just old age, isn’t it? Not an illness. “Have you ever had surgery…” No. Never. I’ve always been… lucky, I suppose. Or maybe just… avoided things that would require surgery. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly. Is this form very long?
DOCTOR: It's a standard form, Mr. Krahn, and it is fairly comprehensive. It’ll help me get a good overall picture of your health. It shouldn't take too much longer. Just focus on answering truthfully to the best of your recollection. We'll get through it. Now, let’s move on. "Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That’s a difficult one. I used to sneeze a lot in the spring, I think. But maybe that was just… dust? Or… the blossoms? I never went to the doctor about it. My mother always said it was just a cold. Is that good enough? I really don’t remember specifics. Everything feels so… distant. Are we nearly finished?
DOCTOR: "Possible seasonal allergies" is… not particularly helpful, Mr. Krahn. Do you have a reaction to any specific things?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specific things… Well, there was that time… at the theater. A woman was wearing a very strong perfume. I think it made my eyes water. But it could have been the dust again. Or… the lights. Everything was very dusty and bright at the theater. This is hopeless, isn’t it? I’m just an old man with a bad memory. I don’t know anything specific. Maybe I should just… stop trying? I’m probably just wasting your time. Is this going to be on a test? Because I’m terrible at tests.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, we are not taking a test. I am simply trying to gather information about your medical history. The perfume incident is helpful; do you have any other reactions to strong smells, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: No… nothing else comes to mind. Honestly, Doctor, my memory is just… gone. I remember the theater… vaguely. Faces… gone. Names… gone. Even… what year it was… gone. It’s all just… a blur. Maybe… maybe I’m not fit enough for anything. Maybe I should just go home. This is all very stressful. I haven’t felt this… flustered in years. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. Let’s set the form aside for a moment. I understand this is frustrating for you. It appears we're having difficulty obtaining a thorough history, which isn't ideal. Before we proceed, let’s just do a brief physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, heart rate, and listen to your lungs. It's a quick assessment and may provide some useful information. Would that be alright?
