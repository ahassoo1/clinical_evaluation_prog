DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Guilds. Oreste Guilds. Well, I been… short of breath, see? Not all the time, but… happens. And my mouth… feels like the Sahara desert in there. Eyes too, kinda scratchy. It’s… bothersome. Don't remember when it started, exactly. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. Short of breath and dry mouth and eyes… Okay. And you said it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Yeah. Not like… wheezing or nothing. Just… harder to get the air. Not a big deal, really. Probably just need a good drink of water. Though that don’t seem to help much these days. You know? Things ain't workin' like they used to.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's frustrating when things change. And you mentioned your eyes are scratchy too. Any pain with them?
PATIENT: Pain? Nah, not pain. Just… dry. Like sand. Feels like little bits of sand in ‘em sometimes. And I gotta blink a lot. Not much fun, let me tell ya. Used to be able to see a mile, now… well. Don’t get me started on how things change.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry eyes, feeling of grittiness… Alright. Let's see… have you noticed any changes in your other symptoms, anything else that comes to mind?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kinda symptoms? I told ya, I’m short of breath and dry. What more ya want? I ain’t a doctor, ya know. Things just… are. I ain't been feelin’ great, but who does at my age? Everything hurts a little, one thing or another.
DOCTOR: You're right, you're not a doctor, and I shouldn't expect you to be. I just want to get a full picture of what's going on. It helps me figure out the best way to help. So, aside from the breath and the dryness, have you had any cough, fever, chest pain, or swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling? Now that ya mention it… maybe a little. Hard to tell. I got… big legs, always have. Ain’t been payin’ attention to no swelling. Cough? Nah. Fever? Don't think so. Chest pain… sometimes a little ache, but that’s probably just… old age. Like I said. Everything aches. Is this gonna take long?
DOCTOR: Alright. No cough, no fever…possible slight swelling in the legs. And the chest ache, which you attribute to age. I'm just trying to rule things out. Let's do a quick exam, just listen to your lungs and check your heart. It shouldn't take more than a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Listen to my lungs? What’s wrong with my lungs? They've been workin' just fine for eighty-three years, thank you very much. But… alright. Do whatever ya gotta do. Just be quick about it. I got things to do, ya know. Though what those are, I forget.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Guilds. Just a routine check. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse… and take a look at your eyes. Take a deep breath for me… and again… Okay. Lungs sound a little diminished, but not overly concerning at this point. Blood pressure is a bit elevated… 148 over 92. Pulse is regular, but a little fast at 88. Now, let me just take a look at those eyes… Hmm. Eyes are quite dry, as you mentioned, and a little bit of redness. Not a lot, but it's there.
PATIENT: Diminished? What’s diminished mean? Sounds bad. And elevated blood pressure… is that bad too? See, this is why I don't like doctors. Always tellin' me somethin's wrong. My eyes just get tired, that's all. It's the sun, probably. I used to work outside… a long time ago. Though what I did… I forget. Mostly just aches these days. Are ya gonna give me somethin' for the dry mouth? That's the worst part.
DOCTOR: Diminished just means they don’t sound as full as they used to be, which can be normal with age. We want to make sure they remain clear. Elevated blood pressure… well, it's something we want to keep an eye on. It's not an emergency right now, but it's good to know. We can discuss ways to manage that. And yes, we can definitely address the dry mouth. It's likely contributing to the discomfort in your eyes as well. Let’s see… do you have any allergies to medications that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? I dunno. Never really paid much attention to that. I take… somethin' for my knee, I think. But what it is… I forget. Can’t remember what I had for breakfast, let alone what I’m allergic to. Just give me somethin’ for the dryness, alright? My mouth feels like sandpaper. And those eyes… terrible. Don’t need no fancy talk about allergies or blood pressure. Just fix the dryness. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guilds. Since you're unsure of any allergies, we'll proceed cautiously. I’m going to recommend some artificial tears for your eyes, to help keep them lubricated. And for your dry mouth, I'll suggest a saliva substitute. We can start with those and see if they provide some relief. I'm also going to write you a prescription for a mild blood pressure medication. We'll start with a low dose and monitor your levels. How does that sound?
PATIENT: More pills? Great. Just what I needed. But… alright. Fine. If it’ll shut you up about the blood pressure… and maybe help this desert in my mouth. Just make it quick, and tell me where to pick these up. I got no energy for runnin’ around. Is that all? Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Alright, here you are. This is a prescription for Lisinopril, a low dose blood pressure medication. And this summary explains the artificial tears and saliva substitute. You can pick these up at the pharmacy inside the clinic, or at any pharmacy you prefer. I'm also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, just to check your blood pressure and see how you’re responding to the medication and the other recommendations. Does that work for you?
