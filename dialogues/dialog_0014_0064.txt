DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s my chest. It’s been… hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me. It feels like… a tight squeezing. Like someone is sitting on my chest, maybe? It started a few days ago, I think. August 1st, maybe? I keep good track of dates.
DOCTOR: August 1st… right. And this squeezing… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. Mostly when I walk. Or… when I get excited, a little. Like, my grandson was showing me a new video game yesterday, and it started then too. When I’m sitting still, it’s okay. Mostly. Sometimes I feel it a little even then, but not bad. It's hard to explain. Is this… bad? I don’t want to make a fuss, but… well, my husband, he worries.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. So, it’s brought on by exertion or… strong emotions. And you say it feels like a squeezing sensation. Does it radiate anywhere – down your arm, to your jaw, your back perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes it goes down my left arm. Not all the way to my fingers, but… in my elbow, mostly. And… now that you mention it, maybe a little in my jaw. Not much. It’s hard to tell if that's the chest or… just my teeth. I have a little trouble with my teeth, you see. Old age! But the arm… yes, definitely the arm sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… I get a little short of breath when I walk, like I said, but I’m not a young woman anymore! And… I’ve been a little tired, but who isn’t? Maybe a little heartburn now and then. I had empanadas last night, and those can be a little spicy. Does that count? I don’t know… am I telling you too much?
DOCTOR: Empanadas… right. Okay. And this shortness of breath – is it new, or have you been experiencing that for a while?
PATIENT: It’s… newer, I think. The tiredness is always there, a little. But the breath… maybe a week or so. Not terrible, just… I have to stop and catch my breath sometimes. It's not like I’m running a marathon, you know! Just walking to the mailbox. Or upstairs. Nothing crazy. But I didn't used to have to stop. Does that make sense? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get some basic information. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Doctor, I've had lots of shots over the years, for travel and… everything. Never had a reaction. My husband always checks, he’s very careful. He’s a retired pharmacist, you know. Very good with medicines. He would know if I was allergic to something. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, that’s it. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. He manages that for me.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril… right. And how long have you been on that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Maybe… five years? Six? It was after my sister, Maria, had a little trouble with hers. My husband said I should get checked, and… well, here we are. It's a small dose, he says it’s just to be safe. He keeps track of everything. And he would know the exact date, but he’s at the grocery store right now. He’s making a special sauce for the empanadas!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs. Can you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, that’s fine. Just tell me what to do. It’s a little high, isn’t it? But I can manage. Just let me know when you’re ready. Is everything okay, Doctor? You seem… hurried.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just breathe normally for me. Okay… and breathe deeply. Hmm. And one more deep breath. Your heart sounds… regular, but there is a slight murmur. Your lungs sound a little… congested, but nothing too concerning. I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse now. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically. Pulse is normal.
PATIENT: Okay. Elevated? Congested? That doesn't sound good, does it? Is that… serious? My husband always said my heart was strong. He used to listen to it with that little tube thing… just like you. Is it my lungs? Did I catch a cold? I haven’t been feeling very well lately… but I just thought it was… old age. What does this mean, Doctor? Please, tell me straight. I don’t like guessing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Chelberg. Given your symptoms – the chest pain, the shortness of breath, and the findings on the exam… it could be a number of things. It's unlikely to be “just old age”. Given your age and history, and the fact that the pain radiates down your arm, we need to rule out any cardiac issues. I’m going to order an EKG and a chest X-ray to get a better look at your heart and lungs. We’ll also do some blood work to check for any cardiac enzymes. I’m also going to give you a referral to a cardiologist for further evaluation. It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially with chest pain. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A cardiologist? That sounds… serious. An EKG? Blood work? My husband… he’s going to be worried. He always worries. Will I have to stay in the hospital? I have to make him dinner tonight! And… what are cardiac enzymes? Is that… bad? Please, Doctor, tell me… what do you think it is? Even if it’s not good, I need to know. I don’t want to just wait and see. I need to understand. And… can I still make dinner?
DOCTOR: Ms. Chelberg, please try to remain calm. I understand your anxiety, but panicking won’t help. As I said, it could be a number of things. These tests will help us determine the cause. An EKG looks at the electrical activity of your heart. Blood work will show if there’s any damage. As for the cardiologist, it’s standard procedure given your symptoms. It doesn’t necessarily mean you have a serious problem, but it’s best to get a professional opinion. As for dinner… I can’t tell you definitively if you’ll be able to make dinner tonight. It depends on the results of the tests. The nurse will get you scheduled for an EKG right away, and we’ll get the blood work ordered. I’m going to write a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a very good cardiologist in the area. His office will call you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any specific questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Tests… and a cardiologist. Dr. Ramirez… I’ll write that down. Will it… hurt? The tests, I mean. Will they have to poke me a lot? I don’t like needles very much. And… how long will it take? I have to take my little pills tonight, you know. And my husband… he likes me to be home for dinner. It’s just… important to him. Is there anything… anything I can do right now? To make it better? I just want to go home and make dinner. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: The EKG is painless, Ms. Chelberg. It involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. No needles. The blood work… yes, there will be a needle, but it’s a quick prick. You might feel a little discomfort, but it shouldn't be significant. As for making things “better”… try to relax. Avoid any strenuous activity. If you experience chest pain, stop what you’re doing and sit down. The nurse will explain everything in more detail before the tests. Honestly, Ms. Chelberg, the best thing you can do is let us run the tests and get a proper diagnosis. Worrying won't help, and frankly, you're making this more difficult than it needs to be. The nurse will be in shortly.
PATIENT: Oh. I… I see. Well… thank you, Doctor. I’ll just… wait for the nurse then. I hope it doesn’t take too long… my husband… he gets worried if I’m gone too long.
