DOCTOR: Alright, Brendan Ferneding, 53 years old. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor... Havird, is it? Yes, it's this itching, really. All over. It started a couple weeks ago, I guess. Not terribly bad at first, just a little annoying. But it's gotten worse, you know? It's driving me a bit crazy, honestly. It’s not like a rash, just…itchy skin. Everywhere.
DOCTOR: Itching all over, started a couple weeks ago and progressively worsening. Okay. And when you say "everywhere," is it truly everywhere – even on your palms, soles of your feet, and in skin folds?
PATIENT: Hmm, good question. Let me think… yes, I believe so. Palms… yeah, I’ve noticed it on my palms. And my feet, too, a little. And… yes, even in the creases of my elbows and knees. It’s pretty widespread, Doctor. It doesn’t burn or anything, just… constant itchiness.
DOCTOR: Constant itchiness, including palms, soles, and skin folds… alright. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed recently… well, not really. My wife, bless her, passed away about six months ago. That was… a big change, of course. But as far as… daily things? No, not that I can think of. Same soaps, same laundry detergent… I haven’t started any new hobbies or anything like that. I've been trying to keep my routine as normal as possible, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I see. And you said it’s been about six months since your wife passed. I’m very sorry for your loss, Brendan. Sometimes stress and grief can manifest in physical ways. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It’s… still difficult, to be honest. But I'm managing. And allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little seasonal sniffles sometimes, but nothing serious. No food allergies, no reactions to plants, nothing like that. I haven’t been stung by a bee in… well, I can’t even remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of loratadine for the occasional sniffles, like I said. Usually only during the spring. And… oh, I take a daily multivitamin. Nothing else, Doctor. I try to stay away from too many pills, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Loratadine occasionally, daily multivitamin. Okay. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions – things like diabetes, kidney problems, liver disease, thyroid issues, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… No, not really. I had high blood pressure for a bit, maybe ten years ago, but it came down with diet and exercise. The doctor took me off the medication for that a long time ago. Otherwise, I've been pretty healthy, knock on wood. No diabetes, no kidney problems... I don't think so, anyway. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, of course, but nothing major.
DOCTOR: No major diagnoses. Okay. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than a routine procedure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And I was in the hospital for a few days once with a bad case of pneumonia, maybe twenty years ago. But other than that, no. No other surgeries or long hospital stays. I’ve been lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy as a child, pneumonia twenty years ago. Alright. Now, family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like skin problems, allergies, autoimmune diseases, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… my mother had eczema when she was younger, I think. Not terrible, but she used a lot of creams for it. And my father had… well, he had heart trouble, but that was later in life. As far as anything else… not that I’m aware of. My siblings are both healthy, as far as I know. No autoimmune diseases, no major skin problems… nothing that jumps to mind, anyway.
DOCTOR: Eczema in mother, heart trouble in father. Okay. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. My heart’s been fine for years, but feel free to check. And please, take your time with the skin. It’s driving me a bit mad, as I said.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brendan. Your heart and lungs sound good. Your skin doesn’t show any signs of a rash or obvious infection. It does appear a bit dry, though. I don't see any evidence of hives or anything like that. Now, let's take a look at your palms and soles, as you mentioned the itching is present there as well.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s good to hear about my heart and lungs. And yes, it does feel dry, doesn’t it? I haven’t really been using lotion much lately, I suppose. Just… haven't thought about it. It's hard to explain, Doctor. It's not a burning itch, more of a… nagging one. Constant, you know? And it’s the same everywhere.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. Nagging, constant itch, no burning sensation. Skin feels dry to the touch, normal temperature. Given your history – the recent loss of your wife, the absence of any rash or obvious skin abnormalities, and the dryness – my initial thought is that this could be related to stress and possibly a mild form of eczema exacerbated by dry skin. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, just to be on the safe side. The CBC will help us rule out any underlying infection or inflammation, and the TSH test will check your thyroid function.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. I appreciate you thinking about everything. Stress… yes, well, that makes sense. It’s been a difficult few months. And the blood tests… if that’s what you think is best, then go ahead. I trust your judgment. Will those tests take long to get back? And is there anything I can do in the meantime? Like, for the itching?
DOCTOR: The tests should take about 2-3 business days to come back. In the meantime, I recommend using a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer several times a day, especially after showering. Avoid harsh soaps and detergents. Also, try to manage your stress levels as much as possible – whether that’s through relaxation techniques, spending time with loved ones, or engaging in activities you enjoy. You can also try an over-the-counter antihistamine like cetirizine to help with the itching, but be aware that it can cause drowsiness. If the itching becomes severe or you develop any other symptoms – like fever, rash, or swelling – please contact the office immediately. We’ll get you in to see someone right away. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that all makes sense. Moisturizer, gentle soaps, try to relax… I can definitely try that. And I’ll keep the antihistamine in mind. Cetirizine… I think I’ve heard of that. And yes, I’ll be sure to call if anything changes. Actually, one question. You mentioned eczema. Is that… contagious? I don’t want to worry my grandkids if I’m visiting them.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. No, eczema is not contagious. It’s a chronic skin condition caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. You can’t “catch” it from anyone. It’s perfectly safe to visit your grandkids. It’s understandable to be concerned, though. So, to recap: we’ve ordered a CBC and TSH test to rule out other potential causes. In the meantime, focus on moisturizing, using gentle soaps, managing your stress, and consider an over-the-counter antihistamine if needed. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in about a week. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That’s a relief to hear about the grandkids, thank you. And yes, that sounds perfect, Doctor. A week is fine. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. It's… good to know what's going on, even if it's just a waiting game right now. Thank you again. I’ll see you next week.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Brendan. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. And please, try to take care of yourself. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next week.
PATIENT: .
