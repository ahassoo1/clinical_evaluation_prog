DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide, good to see you. Or, well, good meeting you. I’m Dr. Gorga. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doc, I don't have all day. It's this… shaking. My hand, see? It just… trembles. Been happening for a while now. Honestly, I don't even remember exactly when it started. It’s just annoying, alright? Makes it hard to hold a glass. And I used to have a steady hand, you know. Directed some important films with it. Important ones.
DOCTOR: Right, a tremor. Okay. And it’s primarily in your hand?
PATIENT: Mostly. Though sometimes I think… maybe it’s my whole arm? It’s hard to say. Look, I'm eighty years old, Doc. Things shake. What do you need to know exactly? Are you going to poke me with needles or something? Because I really don't like needles.
DOCTOR: No needles right away, Mr. Baide, I promise. Just trying to get a better picture of what’s going on. Is the shaking constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go... hmm. I suppose it's worse when I’m trying to do something. Like, if I’m reaching for something, or trying to… well, you know, use cutlery. It’s not awful all the time. Sometimes I don't even notice it. Honestly, it's just a nuisance. A big nuisance. And it's getting worse, I think. Though, maybe that’s just my imagination. Everything feels worse when you get old.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently that might be linked to this?
PATIENT: Changed? What do you mean, changed? My wife passed away a few years back. Does that count as a change? Everything changed then. I don’t know… I haven't been doing anything different. Same routine. Wake up, have coffee, watch the news... try to avoid looking at the awful things on the news... it's all just… the same. Really, I just want this shaking to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any other symptoms along with this shaking?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I get tired, alright? I'm eighty! I get tired. My joints ache. My memory isn’t what it used to be, clearly. Is that what you mean? Look, Doc, I’m not a doctor. I just know something isn't right with my hand. And frankly, I don't have the patience for a twenty-question game.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No twenty questions. Just… trying to rule things out. Has there been any stiffness in your muscles, perhaps?
PATIENT: Stiffness… maybe? In the mornings, sometimes. My back feels… creaky. Like an old door, you know? But that's just old age! Everyone gets stiff when they get old. Honestly, Doc, are you going to examine me or just keep asking questions? This is a waste of my time. I have better things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, alright. Let's take a look. Just a quick check of your reflexes and coordination, alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just be quick about it. I haven’t got all day, you know. And don't poke me with anything sharp. I mean it. Really. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay. At rest, I'm noting a resting tremor in your right hand, approximately 4-6 Hz. When you reach for that glass, the tremor seems to increase in amplitude. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Your gait is slightly unsteady, but stable. I don’t see any signs of focal weakness.
PATIENT: Tremor… Hertz… amplitude… What does all that mean? Look, Doc, just tell me if it’s serious or not. Is this something terrible? Am I going to fall over and break my hip? That’s what I want to know. Skip the fancy doctor talk. Just give it to me straight. And please, don't tell me it's "age-related." I already know I'm old!
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Baide. It could be a few things. The tremor itself doesn’t necessarily mean something terrible, but we need to figure out the cause. One possibility is essential tremor, which is very common, especially as people get older. It tends to run in families, and it's not usually associated with any other serious medical condition. However, since you mentioned the memory issues, and given your age, we need to rule out other possibilities. Parkinson's disease can also cause tremors, but typically it’s more rigid and on one side. To be safe, I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any other underlying causes. And I think a referral to a neurologist would be a good idea, just to get their expert opinion. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Neurologist… More doctors. More tests. Wonderful. Look, Doc, I’m eighty years old. How many tests do I need? I’ve had a lifetime of tests. Blood work, fine. I guess. But I don't want any brain scans or anything ridiculous. And honestly, if it's just some… tremor thing, I don't want any medication. I've read about the side effects. Horrible side effects. Just tell me what I need to avoid, alright? Falling, maybe? And don’t tell me to “exercise more.” I get enough exercise getting out of this chair. Just… give me something simple. Is that too much to ask? .
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Baide. Blood work it is. I understand your hesitation with medication, and we absolutely won't start anything without a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits. For now, focus on safety. Make sure your home is well-lit and free of tripping hazards. Use assistive devices, like a cane or walker, if you need them. And be cautious when standing up or walking. As for avoiding falling, that’s good advice for anyone, really. I'll get the lab order sent to the front desk. And I’ll get a referral to a neurologist forwarded to you. They can do a more detailed neurological exam and help us determine the best course of action. Does that sound alright?
