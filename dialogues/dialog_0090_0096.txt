DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It’s... well, it’s about the sun, really. I’ve been getting really bothered by it lately. Like, way more than usual. My eyes feel super sensitive, and my skin gets red really quickly, even with sunscreen. It's a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hm. Sensitive to the sun, you say. And this is a recent change?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely recent. It started… let me think… probably about three months ago, maybe a little longer. Before that, I could be out in the sun for a bit, you know, normal stuff. Now, even just walking to the car feels like too much sometimes. It’s… different.
DOCTOR: “Normal stuff,” you say. Could you elaborate on what “normal stuff” entailed?
PATIENT: Oh, sure. Well, I used to be able to garden for a couple of hours in the afternoon, no problem. Or go for a walk, maybe an hour or so, without needing to hide in the shade constantly. I didn't wear a hat every time, you know? Just sunscreen. I'm not someone who avoids the sun completely, I like being outdoors. But now… now even those things feel hard. And it’s not just burning, it’s like… everything feels brighter, too. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Right. And you’ve been consistently using sunscreen?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I've actually started being more careful with it, because of this. I try to put it on about thirty minutes before going outside, and I reapply it every couple of hours, like the bottle says. I’m using SPF 30, I think. It’s the one my wife used to buy, so I just kept getting that one. She… well, she always reminded me to be careful.
DOCTOR: And do you notice any other symptoms alongside the sensitivity?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My eyes sometimes feel gritty, even after I’ve washed them. And… now that you mention it, I’ve been a little more tired than usual. Not like, sick tired, just… worn out. And maybe a bit of a headache sometimes, but that could just be the heat, you know? It’s been pretty warm. I haven’t really connected it to the sun thing, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… not really, I don’t think. Everything looks pretty much the same. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I wear glasses, so that’s not unusual. I got a new prescription about six months ago, so it shouldn’t be that. No floaters, no double vision, nothing like that. Just the regular… needing my glasses to see clearly. It’s more the brightness that bothers my eyes, not what I’m actually seeing, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: And any family history of eye problems, skin cancer, or autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had… cataracts, I think. She needed surgery for them when she got older. And my brother, on my father’s side, he had some kind of skin thing on his nose, a few years back. They cut it off, and he was fine after that, but I don't know exactly what it was. As for autoimmune… not that I’m aware of. No one ever talked about anything like that. It’s a big family, so keeping track of everything is hard. My wife… she didn’t have any major health problems, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to do a quick examination of your eyes and skin. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on. I'm happy to let you take a look. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat and look straight ahead. I'm going to check your pupils and visual acuity first. Follow my pen tip with your eyes… don’t blink. Now look at my finger…
PATIENT: Okay, I'm looking at your finger. It's a little hard to see clearly, even with my glasses on, but I'm trying. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s alright. Blinking is natural. Now, could you read the letters on this chart for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay… um… F, P, T, O… uh… L… and… D. Is that right? It’s a little blurry. I can see them, but they aren’t very sharp.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. Please, remove your shirt and shoes. I'm going to examine your skin for any abnormalities. This won't take long.
PATIENT: Okay. Sure. It’s a bit warm in here, so I don’t mind too much. I’ll just stand here… ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Do these moles feel any different than others you've noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me see… They don’t really feel different, not that I’ve noticed. They’ve always been there, I think. Maybe a little itchy sometimes, but I just figured it was the heat. I haven’t really paid much attention to them, honestly. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Komarov. I’m going to order some blood work. We need to rule out a few things. I’d also like you to see a dermatologist. Your skin needs a more thorough evaluation.
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work and a dermatologist… That sounds… serious. Is it something I should be really worried about? What are we trying to rule out? I know you probably don’t want to scare me, but it's hard not to think the worst.
DOCTOR: Mr. Komarov, I understand your concern. It's better to be thorough. The blood work will help us assess for any underlying autoimmune conditions or infections that could be causing your symptoms. The rash and changes in your moles warrant evaluation by a dermatologist to rule out any pre-cancerous or cancerous changes. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but skin cancer is a possibility, and early detection is crucial. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and an ANA test. I'll also provide you with a referral to Dr. Ellis, a highly-regarded dermatologist in the area. We need to get these tests done as soon as possible. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Autoimmune… and skin cancer… Okay. That’s… a lot. Dr. Ellis… I haven’t heard of him. Is he covered by Medicare? And… how long will it take to get the blood work done? Will I need an appointment, or can I just walk in? I also… is the rash something I should be covering up in the meantime? I’m trying to stay out of the sun as much as possible, but…
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Ellis accepts Medicare. His office number is on the referral slip; you’ll need to schedule an appointment. As for the blood work, you can go to any lab that accepts your insurance. There should be a lab a few blocks away on Elm Street. No appointment is necessary, but I recommend calling ahead to confirm their hours. Regarding the rash, keep it covered as much as possible to minimize sun exposure. Wear protective clothing and continue using sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. While it’s unlikely to be anything serious, it’s best to err on the side of caution. I know this is a lot to take in, Mr. Komarov. But we’re being proactive. The sooner we get these tests done, the sooner we’ll have a clearer picture of what’s going on. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay. Elm Street… Dr. Ellis… covered up, sunscreen… I think I can manage that. Just… how likely is it to be something serious? I know you said early detection is important, but… is it likely to be skin cancer? I just need to know, even if it’s not good news. I'd rather be prepared. And… will the blood work tell us if it's autoimmune, or will I need more tests after that? I'm sorry for all the questions, I just… I’m a bit scared.
DOCTOR: Mr. Komarov, it is impossible for me to tell you the likelihood of it being skin cancer or an autoimmune condition at this stage. That is precisely why we are running these tests. Many things can cause skin sensitivity and rashes. A change in moles requires investigation, but it does not automatically mean cancer. Similarly, the blood work will provide initial clues, but further testing may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis. I understand your anxiety, but I want to avoid speculation. Worrying prematurely will only exacerbate your stress. Let's focus on getting these tests done and then discuss the results. I will call you with the lab results in approximately five to seven business days. Dr. Ellis’ office will schedule your appointment, and we’ll go from there. Is there anything else I can clarify for you today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Five to seven business days… Dr. Ellis… Elm Street… Okay. Thank you, Doctor. For… being thorough. And for trying to explain everything. I'll schedule the appointment and get the blood work done as soon as possible. I appreciate it. I guess… I’ll see you in a week or so. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Komarov. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a good day.
