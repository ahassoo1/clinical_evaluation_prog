DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, morning, Doctor. Just need a check-up, really. Trying out for a team, gotta make sure I'm still alright to go, you know? Getting a bit older now, gotta be sure.
DOCTOR: A team, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah. Local basketball team. Not professional or anything, just a good league. Keeps me active. Don't want to pull a muscle first five minutes, ha!
DOCTOR: Active is good, of course. Though at your age, “active” requires a certain… prudence. So, tell me more about this desire for a “check-up.” Are you experiencing any specific symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, nothing like that. Just… wanting to be sure. Maybe a little stiffness in the knees sometimes, but that's just getting old, right? No pain, no swelling, just… precaution. I don’t want to waste the team’s time if I’m gonna be a liability.
DOCTOR: “Precaution.” Right. And how long have you been experiencing this… stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes. Hard to say exactly… few months, maybe? Worse when it's cold, definitely. Doesn't stop me, though. I just warm up a bit longer. Still got a good range of motion.
DOCTOR: A “good range of motion” is subjective, Mr. Kingan. We’ll need to assess that objectively. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – arthritis, heart problems, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing diagnosed. Never really been to the doctor much, to be honest. Always felt alright. Just the usual colds, maybe. Nothing serious. No heart problems, no arthritis… I think. I don't feel like I have arthritis. I'm not insured, so I haven’t really had much checking up done.
DOCTOR: Uninsured. Understandable, though unfortunate. And no previous diagnoses… alright. Have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never needed any. Broken a bone or two when I was a kid, running around being foolish, but they healed up fine. Nothing that'd bother me now. Look, is this gonna take long? I got things to do, you know? Just need a quick thumbs-up, really.
DOCTOR: A “quick thumbs-up” is not a substitute for a proper medical evaluation, Mr. Kingan. However, we can proceed with a focused physical exam. I’ll need to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we’ll assess those knees. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Sounds alright. Just… try to be quick, okay? Blood pressure and knees are the important bits, I guess. Don't need to waste time on lungs, I can breathe just fine. Let's get it done.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a seat. I'll start with your blood pressure. Remove your shirt and lie down.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Just…try not to poke me too much, alright? And is it warm in here? I'm getting a little hot.
DOCTOR: It is a standard room temperature, Mr. Kingan. I assure you, I am not intentionally attempting to make you uncomfortable. Now, remain still. 140 over 90. A bit elevated. Do you typically monitor your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Like I said, not insured. Never had a reason to. Is that bad? Is it just because I'm nervous being here? Maybe I should’ve had a coffee.
DOCTOR: It's slightly elevated, yes. And while nervousness can contribute, it warrants further attention. Now, let's examine those knees. Please bend your knees one at a time, and tell me if you experience any pain or discomfort.
PATIENT: Hmm… a little creaky, that's all. No sharp pain. It feels…tight, maybe? Like it needs a good stretch. See? Still works alright. It’s just not what it used to be. Can we get this over with? I really do need to be going soon.
DOCTOR: There is mild crepitus with flexion and extension, as you mentioned. No significant swelling noted. And I do detect some tenderness along the medial joint line. Similar findings on the left knee – crepitus and tenderness medially. Now, can you perform a squat for me?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez… There. Happy? It’s a bit…uncomfortable, yeah. Don't expect me to be winning any Olympic medals. It's the knees, obviously. Can we just agree that I need some physical therapy and be done with this?
DOCTOR: Your range of motion is limited, and there is visible discomfort with the maneuver. It appears you have some degree of osteoarthritis in both knees, likely contributing to the crepitus, tenderness, and limited range of motion. Physical therapy would be beneficial. However, before we proceed, I recommend an X-ray of both knees to assess the severity of the condition and rule out any other underlying issues. And frankly, given your blood pressure, a full cardiac evaluation is also advisable.
PATIENT: X-rays?! Cardiac evaluation?! Look, I just want to play basketball, not become a science project! I told you, I don’t have insurance! This is getting ridiculous. I just wanted a quick check-up, not a whole medical overhaul. Forget it. Never mind, I can manage. Thanks for nothing. . I’m leaving.
DOCTOR: As you wish, Mr. Kingan. However, I must strongly advise against participating in strenuous physical activity without a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Ignoring these concerns could lead to further injury and complications. I can provide you with information regarding low-cost clinics in the area that may be able to assist you. It is your health, after all. .
