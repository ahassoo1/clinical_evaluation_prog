DOCTOR: Good morning, Aeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to put it simply… I feel like I need a reset. Or a jumpstart, perhaps. I’m just… not feeling quite myself lately, and I was hoping you could help me figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: I understand. “Not feeling quite yourself” is a good place to start. It’s very common. Can you tell me a little more about what that means for you?
PATIENT: Hmm. It’s difficult to explain… it’s not one specific thing. Just… low energy, mostly. And I’ve been having trouble sleeping, even though I am tired. It feels like… everything is just a bit harder than it used to be. Like wading through water, if that makes sense? I used to be very active, and now… not so much. I still work, of course, but even that feels draining sometimes.
DOCTOR: That does sound draining. Wading through water is a good way to put it. Low energy and trouble sleeping… those often go hand-in-hand. And you said it's been harder to do things you used to do easily?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. The work itself isn’t harder, it just… takes more out of me. I sculpt, you see? Molders, shapers, and casters – that’s what I do. It requires a lot of focus, and standing for long periods. It used to invigorate me, but now… I need to sit down frequently. And I find myself less inspired, if you understand. Less… creative spark, perhaps. It’s a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I do understand. A loss of inspiration is definitely concerning, especially with a creative pursuit like sculpting. It sounds like this has been a gradual change, not something that came on suddenly?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It wasn’t an overnight thing, no. It’s been… creeping up on me for maybe six months, or so. At first, I just thought I was tired, you know? A little stressed with a large commission. But it hasn’t gone away. And honestly, I’m starting to worry it’s something more than just stress. My husband… he’s been encouraging me to come see someone for a while now.
DOCTOR: Six months… that’s good information. And it’s good that your husband is supportive. Sometimes it helps to have someone else notice these things. Let’s talk a bit more about your day-to-day. Besides sculpting, what does a typical day look like for you?
PATIENT: Well, I wake up around 7, though I haven't been sleeping through the night so I'm often up a bit earlier than that. My husband, Ricardo, and I have breakfast together – usually just coffee and toast. Then it's to the studio. I work most of the day, with a break for lunch. I try to take a walk in the evenings, but… as I said, I’m often too tired. We have dinner around 7:30, and then I usually read for a bit before bed. It's… fairly quiet, I suppose. We don’t have children, so it’s mostly just the two of us. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. A quiet routine... that's good to know. And you mentioned trouble sleeping… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not that I can’t fall asleep, exactly. It’s more… I wake up several times during the night. Sometimes just once, sometimes three or four times. And then I have trouble getting back to sleep. I’ll lie there for a while, thinking. Or just… staring at the ceiling. I’ve tried a little chamomile tea, but it doesn't seem to make much difference. And I don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, waking frequently and trouble falling back to sleep. No chamomile tea helping… and you prefer to avoid medication. That's good to know, we can certainly explore other options. Let’s move on to some more general health questions, if that’s alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. Ask away. I’ll do my best to answer.
DOCTOR: Good. First, do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I haven't had any allergic reactions that I can remember. I’ve never had to carry an EpiPen or anything like that. My husband is allergic to cats, but I'm fine with them. We don't have any pets at the moment, precisely because of his allergy. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, as I mentioned, I try to avoid them when I can. I don’t take anything regularly. Occasionally, if I have a headache, I’ll take an ibuprofen, but that’s it. Perhaps once or twice a month, if that. I really prefer natural remedies, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, that’s the only surgery I can recall. And I had a pretty bad case of the flu a few years ago, but nothing else major. I’ve been quite healthy, thankfully. I try to eat well, and I’ve always been active, until recently, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s a little… complicated. My mother had some heart problems when she was older, and my father had diabetes. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, had Alzheimer’s. But otherwise, not much that I’m aware of. My siblings are both healthy, as far as I know. It wasn’t a very close family, so we don’t share much medical information. I hope that’s not too vague.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. It's common for family medical history to be incomplete. Heart problems, diabetes, and Alzheimer's... I'll make a note of those. Now, one last thing before we do a quick physical exam: do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I’ve never smoked. Ricardo enjoys a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I don’t drink at all. And definitely no recreational drugs. I'm a very… sensible person, I suppose. I prefer a quiet evening with a good book, as you know. Is that… satisfactory?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very satisfactory. Thank you for being so open and honest. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly fine. Please proceed. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just loosen your shirt, please. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. A little elevated, but not concerning at this moment. Now, let's take a look in your ears... Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Now, say “Ah” for me. Throat is clear, no inflammation. Everything looks normal so far. I'd like to check your reflexes, and a quick neurological exam. It's pretty standard. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Please proceed. I understand it's standard procedure.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. I’ll test your coordination now. Can you touch your nose with your finger?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Is that alright? I’m not very good at these things, I’m afraid. I've never been very athletic.
DOCTOR: Perfectly alright. You're doing great. That’s exactly what I was looking for. It seems your coordination is normal as well. Okay, one last thing: I’d like to check your pulse in your feet. Pulses are present and strong. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears normal. However, given your symptoms of low energy, trouble sleeping, and loss of inspiration, I’d like to order some blood work. It will help us rule out any underlying causes, such as thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible. Blood work is a good idea. I’d like to know what’s going on, if possible. What kind of blood work are we talking about? And will it be a lot? I dislike needles, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your dislike of needles. We’ll only need a standard vial of blood, about 10 milliliters, so it shouldn’t be too bad. We'll check your complete blood count – that looks at your red and white blood cells, and platelets. We’ll also check your thyroid levels, vitamin D, vitamin B12, and iron levels. And I'll add a basic metabolic panel, to check your kidney and liver function. It's a pretty routine set of tests. Do you have any questions about any of those?
PATIENT: No, that doesn't sound too bad. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly. Thyroid, vitamins… yes, that makes sense. I have been feeling rather cold lately, come to think of it. And I suppose it's possible I'm not getting enough Vitamin D. We don’t go outside much. So, yes, all of that sounds… reasonable. Where will I go to get the blood drawn? And when should I expect the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll send an order to the lab at St. Luke’s Hospital – it’s just down the street. You can go anytime during their business hours – they're open from 7 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday. You don’t need an appointment. Just tell them Dr. Iuzzolino sent you. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. I’ll have the nurse call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, I recommend trying to get some sunlight exposure when possible, even just for 15-20 minutes a day. And ensuring you're getting enough Vitamin D in your diet, or considering a supplement if you aren’t. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Sunlight, Vitamin D… I can certainly try that. Thank you very much, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful and… reassuring. I feel much better knowing we’re looking into this properly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aeisha. I’m glad I could help. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your results come back. We'll get to the bottom of this. The nurse will come in shortly to go over the lab orders with you. Have a good day, and try to get some sunshine!
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You too.
