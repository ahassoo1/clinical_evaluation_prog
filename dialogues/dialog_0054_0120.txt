DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, okay? It’s about… having a baby. I want to make sure everything works before I even try. My husband… well, he’s gone now, and I don’t want any surprises. Just want to get it over with, you know? No complications.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's very responsible of you to want to get a check-up beforehand, especially given your circumstances. We can definitely do some testing to assess your reproductive health and give you peace of mind. To start, could you tell me a bit about your menstrual cycle?
PATIENT: Menstrual… cycle? Honestly, doc, I don’t really keep track of all that. It comes, it goes. It’s… red. Every month-ish. Is that enough? I mean, it's never been regular, if that's what you're asking. More like… whenever. It’s not like I need a calendar to know that’s happening.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Carmaleta. Many people don’t regularly track their cycles, and it doesn't change anything about how we can proceed. “Every month-ish” is a good starting point. And you're right, you certainly don't need a calendar! When you say it’s not regular, could you give me a sense of the range?
PATIENT: Range? Ugh. Look, some months it's… normal. Like, four, five days. Other months, it's shorter. Sometimes it skips altogether for a couple of months. It’s… unpredictable. Honestly, I stopped even bothering to pay attention after… well, nevermind. It’s just been a hassle. Is this important? Can’t we just do a test and tell me if I can or can’t?
DOCTOR: It is important, Carmaleta, but not in a stressful way. Irregular cycles can be caused by a lot of different things, and understanding your pattern helps us choose the right tests and interpret the results accurately. We want to be thorough. Skipping months is something we’ll definitely want to investigate. And yes, we can absolutely do tests. We can start with a blood test to check your hormone levels, and a pelvic exam to assess your reproductive organs. Before we proceed, do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Not that I know of. I take a multivitamin, does that count? Honestly, I’m not one for popping pills. My mother always said too much medicine is worse than not enough. I’ve been lucky so far, haven’t needed much. Is that good enough? I really just want this done, doc. I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Carmaleta. No known allergies is good. A multivitamin doesn’t count as a medication allergy. Before we move forward with the exam and bloodwork, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Ugh, history? Honestly, not much to tell. I had the usual childhood things, you know? Chickenpox, measles… nothing serious. I broke my arm once falling out of a mango tree as a kid, but that was a long time ago. I've been generally healthy, really. No major illnesses, no surgeries... just the usual aches and pains as you get older. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: It's good to hear you've been generally healthy, Carmaleta. Even without major illnesses, it’s important for me to have a complete picture. It helps me understand your overall health and potential risks. Have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: No. Never. That’s… why I’m here, remember? I've always been careful. And… well, now it’s just me, and I want to be sure. Just want to make sure everything’s still… working. Honestly, it’s a little embarrassing even talking about it.
DOCTOR: There’s absolutely no need to be embarrassed, Carmaleta. It's perfectly natural to want to be prepared and understand your body, especially given your circumstances. It’s responsible, not embarrassing. Okay. And how about your family history?
PATIENT: Ugh, family history… Look, my mother lived to be 80, so that's good, I guess. She had high blood pressure towards the end, but otherwise… mostly just the usual aches and pains. My sister's fine, as far as I know. No one really talked about… health stuff, you know? We weren’t a close family. No one had any… complicated pregnancies that I know of. Honestly, doc, I’m really bad with remembering stuff like that.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Carmaleta. We'll work with what you remember. Knowing your mother had high blood pressure is helpful. Okay. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. I barely drink a cup of tea, and I certainly don’t smoke or do… that. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. I like my mangoes, of course, but everything in moderation. I'm a sensible woman, doc. I take care of myself.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Carmaleta. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is very important. Alright. Now, to move forward, I'd like to perform a pelvic exam and take some blood samples. This will help us assess your reproductive health and hormone levels. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Honestly, I have a million things to do today. The sooner this is done, the better. Just… don't take too long, okay? And please, be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Carmaleta. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I’ll explain each step as we go. I'll have you change into a gown in the private changing room just down the hall. Please let me know if you're feeling any discomfort at any point during the exam. I'll be right outside when you're ready.
