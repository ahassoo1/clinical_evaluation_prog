DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this fever. Keeps comin' back. It’s been botherin’ me for a bit now. Honestly, I just wanna figure out what’s goin' on so I can get back to work.
DOCTOR: A recurring fever, alright. And how long has this been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe six weeks ago? On and off, you know? A couple of days feelin’ fine, then bam, fever again. It’s never real high, just enough to make me feel crummy and tired. It was worse last week, though. I had it for almost four days straight.
DOCTOR: “On and off” is… not particularly helpful, Mr. Brege. Can you recall when these episodes typically begin and end?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. You're right. It's hard to pin down exactly. Last one… started Sunday, I think. Woke up feelin' kinda achy, then by afternoon I had a temp. It broke Tuesday mornin’, mostly. Before that… maybe four weeks ago? Started a Friday, gone by Monday. See? It's always around the weekend, seems like. But not every weekend.
DOCTOR: Interesting. And besides the fever and aches, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Just… tired. Real tired. More than usual, and I’m a retired chiropractor, so I should have plenty of energy! And maybe a little bit of a cough sometimes, but nothin' bad. Just a tickle in my throat. No chills, no sweats, no… nothin’ else really. I eat like normal, sleep okay when I can sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get a bit more detail about this cough. Is it a dry cough, or are you bringing anything up?
PATIENT: It's mostly dry, yeah. Sometimes, if I really push it, there’s a little… phlegm. Clear, usually. Nothing colored or… gross. It doesn’t keep me up at night, just annoys me when I'm tryin' to relax. I haven't really paid it much mind, honestly. It's the fever that’s botherin' me.
DOCTOR: And have you traveled anywhere recently, Mr. Brege?
PATIENT: Nope. Not since… well, since my wife and I went to Florida last winter. That was February. Been stayin’ right here in town ever since. I haven’t got the energy to go anywhere anyway with this fever keepin’ me down. You think it could be somethin’ serious?
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say without a proper examination, Mr. Brege. We’ll need to check your vitals and listen to your lungs. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, none that I know of. My wife usually handles all that. I take a little ibuprofen for aches sometimes, but that's about it. Never had a reaction to anything. Is this gonna take long? I got a patient waitin’ on me, even if I am retired, I still fill in at old man Henderson's office when he needs help.
DOCTOR: We’ll try to be as efficient as possible, Mr. Brege. Just let me listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll take your temperature and blood pressure. Then we can discuss possible causes. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just get it done quick, please. Honestly, gettin' old ain't for the faint of heart.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 78, regular. Temperature is 100.4 Fahrenheit. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Have you had a flu shot this year?
PATIENT: Nope. Haven't gotten one in… years, probably. Never really been one for needles, and I usually skip it. Didn’t get sick much, so I figured I was okay. My wife gets one every year, though. Is that temp high? I feel kinda warm, but I didn’t think it was that bad.
DOCTOR: 100.4 is elevated, Mr. Brege. While it may not feel severe, it's persistent, which is concerning. We should rule out some common causes. Do you have any underlying medical conditions—diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Nope. Clean bill of health, mostly. Had a bad back when I was workin’, naturally, but that's why I retired. Cholesterol's a little high, the doctor told me last time, but they just said watch my diet. That was… oh, five years ago? Other than that, nothin'. What do you think it is? .
DOCTOR: Given your age and lack of significant medical history, and the persistent, though low-grade, fever, we need to consider some possibilities. It could be a viral infection, but the recurrence is unusual. We will need to draw some blood work—a complete blood count and a metabolic panel—to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Also, I’m going to order a chest X-ray to rule out any pulmonary issues. .
