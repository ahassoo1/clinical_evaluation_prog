DOCTOR: Hi Jase, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. DeCosta, nice to meet you too. Um... well, it’s my stomach, I think. It's been… not great, lately. Like, a lot of… well, you know. Diarrhea. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s just… annoying, mostly. I honestly can’t really remember when it started, exactly. It feels like a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Annoying is a good way to put it – dealing with constant diarrhea is frustrating. And you’re right, pinpointing when it started is helpful, but not always easy. So, let’s try to get a better picture of what’s been going on. When you say “a lot,” how many times a day are we talking about?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? It varies. Some days it's just a few, and I can kinda manage. But other days… like, six or seven times, maybe even more. It's hard to keep track, I'm not gonna lie. And it’s… watery, if that makes sense. Not… solid. I feel like I’m always near a bathroom, which is… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, six or seven times a day is definitely more than usual. And watery is helpful to know. It sounds like you're experiencing quite a bit of disruption to your daily life, which is completely understandable. Are you having any pain or cramping with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Yeah, sometimes. It's not, like, awful pain, but it's definitely uncomfortable. Mostly in my lower stomach, you know? Like, a sort of ache, and then it gets sharper when I… well, when it happens. It comes and goes, though. Not constant.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower abdominal pain that's sharper during bowel movements – good to know. Is there anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I… honestly, not really? I don’t think so. I’ve tried eating bland food, but it doesn’t seem to help much. Maybe dairy makes it a bit worse, but I’m not totally sure. I eat a lot of rice, though. That seems to… not hurt, at least. It's just… random, mostly. It’s been so long, I haven't really kept track of what makes it better or worse, if anything does.
DOCTOR: Okay, so bland food isn't providing much relief, and you suspect dairy might worsen it, but it's not definitive. Rice doesn't seem to aggravate it. That's helpful. Now, let's talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any fever, nausea, vomiting, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No fever, definitely not. No vomiting either. And… um… I think I saw a little bit of blood once, maybe a couple of times, but it wasn’t a lot. It was more like… streaks, I guess? It hasn’t happened in a while, though. Honestly, it scared me a bit, so I tried not to look too closely after that.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, even though it’s understandably a little scary. Seeing blood, even a small amount, is something we need to investigate. It's good you noticed it, and it’s helpful to know it hasn’t been recent. Now, shifting gears a bit – have you traveled anywhere recently, or been around anyone who's been sick?
PATIENT: No, no travel. And I don’t think anyone I’ve been around has been sick. My husband’s been fine, and I haven’t seen much of anyone else lately, to be honest. Oh! My friend’s kid had a stomach bug a few weeks ago, but I didn’t get close to him when he was actually sick. Just saw him after he was feeling better. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Seeing your friend's kid after he was feeling better is unlikely to be related. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… I think I've always just been generally healthy, honestly. Oh! Wait. I think the doctor told me a few years ago I might have… something with my stomach? Like, something that makes it harder to digest food? I don’t really remember the name of it. It was something my husband’s aunt has too, apparently. They told me to watch what I eat, but… I haven't really paid much attention to it. Does that sound familiar?
DOCTOR: Okay, that does sound familiar. It’s possible you’re referring to Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS, or possibly a lactose intolerance. It's common to have a family history with either. Do you know if you've ever been tested for lactose intolerance?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I mean, they ran some tests when they first mentioned the stomach thing, but I don't remember what they were for. Honestly, it was a long time ago, and I was pretty stressed about other things at the time. I just remember the doctor saying I might be sensitive to certain foods. I don’t really know what they tested for, though. It all feels a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's understandable. It sounds like further investigation into those possibilities might be a good idea. Let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… just my birth control pill. And sometimes I take ibuprofen if I have a headache. Oh, and a multivitamin, just a basic one. Nothing else, really. I try not to take too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, birth control, ibuprofen as needed, and a multivitamin – that’s helpful to know. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. Just… a lot of stomach trouble lately. That's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Jase. It gives me a much better understanding of what’s been going on. Based on what you’ve told me – the persistent diarrhea, the abdominal pain, the occasional blood in your stool, and the history of possible digestive issues – I think we need to investigate a few things. The possibility of IBS is certainly there, but we also need to rule out other causes, like a bacterial infection or inflammatory bowel disease. I'd like to order a stool sample to check for any infections, and some blood tests to rule out inflammation and check for any nutritional deficiencies. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. I mean, whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on and get it fixed. A stool sample… okay. And blood tests. That’s fine. Will the blood tests be… bad? Will they tell me something scary?
DOCTOR: Okay, that's completely understandable to be nervous, and I’ll explain everything. The blood tests are pretty standard, and they're not meant to scare you. They'll give us more information about what might be causing your symptoms. We'll be looking at things like your white blood cell count to check for infection, and some markers of inflammation. It’s likely everything will be fine, but if something is off, it’s better to know so we can address it. I’ll give you the requisition forms for the stool sample and blood tests. The stool sample kit will have instructions on how to collect it. You can go to [local lab name] for the blood tests – they’re open [lab hours]. Do you have any questions about collecting the sample or getting the blood tests done?
PATIENT: Okay… [local lab name]. I think I know where that is. And I guess I can figure out the instructions. Um… will the blood tests need me to fast beforehand? And how long will it take to get the results? I have work, so I need to know if I need to take time off.
DOCTOR: Yes, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood tests. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. And no chewing gum or mints! The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. I’ll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they're available. We can then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. You can try eating smaller, more frequent meals and avoiding dairy, to see if that helps. If your symptoms worsen – if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or notice blood in your stool – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay, 8-12 hours fasting. No dairy. Plenty of fluids. Got it. Um… no, I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Dr. DeCosta. You’ve been really helpful. I appreciate you explaining everything. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. I'm glad I could help. It was nice meeting you. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Get well soon, and I’ll see you in a few days to discuss the results. .
