DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, try to be concise. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my legs. They just… don’t work like they used to. Been getting weaker for a while now, and it worries my wife. She said I should come see someone. It’s not a sudden thing, you understand. More of a slow fade, like an old photograph.
DOCTOR: A “slow fade,” you say. Yes, well, those are rarely helpful descriptions. When did you first notice this… fading?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think… it must be… oh, maybe six months ago now? Started with just a little stumble here and there. Thought I was just getting old, you know? But it’s gotten worse since then. Now I need help getting up sometimes, and walking isn’t as easy. I don’t want to be a burden, but… it's becoming difficult.
DOCTOR: “Difficult.” Again, not particularly informative. Do you experience any pain with this weakness?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. It’s more… heavy. Like trying to lift something very, very dense. Sometimes a little… tingling, in my feet. But no sharp pain, Doctor. Mostly just… tired. My legs feel tired all the time, even when I haven’t done much. It's a strange feeling. Like they don't want to move. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Tingling and heaviness… acceptable. Have you noticed any changes in your balance?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I have. I… I wobble a bit more now. Especially when I turn my head quickly. My wife has been holding my arm when we walk, just in case. I haven’t fallen yet, thank goodness, but I feel… unsteady. Like a boat on choppy water, maybe? It’s a little embarrassing to admit, but that’s the best way to describe it, I think.
DOCTOR: Metaphors are… colorful. Let’s move on. Any numbness?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. Not all the time, but sometimes my feet feel… distant. Like they’re not really mine, if that makes sense. I can still feel things, but it's not as sharp as it used to be. It’s hard to explain. Like wearing gloves, maybe? A very thin pair of gloves. Mostly in my toes, I think. My hands are okay though, thank goodness. I still like to work with them.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any difficulty with bowel or bladder control?
PATIENT: Oh… um. That’s a… personal question, Doctor. Well, yes. A little. I… sometimes have trouble starting. And… sometimes I don’t quite make it to the restroom in time. It’s not often, but it’s been happening more lately. It's very bothersome, and I don't like talking about it, if you don’t mind. But yes, there's been some trouble. Is that what you were asking?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is precisely what I was asking. Now, let’s discuss your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything at all?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… the doctor told me years ago my blood pressure was a little high, but they put me on some pills and it went down. I took them for a while, but they made me feel… funny, so I stopped. I haven’t been back to see a doctor regularly since then. And… oh, years ago I had a bad infection in my leg. They said it was just cellulitis. But that was a long time ago. Other than that, I’ve been pretty healthy, for an old man. I eat my vegetables, I go for walks when I can… though, that’s getting harder now. Does any of that help?
DOCTOR: Discontinuing medication is… unwise. Did you experience any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any. My wife wanted me to get my knee fixed years ago, but I didn’t want to. Didn’t like the idea of being cut open. Besides, it never bothered me that much. Just a little creaky sometimes. But no surgeries, Doctor. Never. Just the pills for my blood pressure, and I stopped taking those like I said.
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… Well, my mother, she had… problems with her balance when she got old. She fell a lot. My sister, she had something with her nerves, they said. Something that made her weak. But I don’t know what it was, exactly. We didn’t talk about it much. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t have the same doctors like you folks have today. She was in a wheelchair towards the end. That’s… that’s about all I know, Doctor. It wasn’t a very talkative family, if you understand. Mostly kept things to ourselves.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little bit of fish oil, Doctor. My wife says it's good for my brain. And I take a multivitamin sometimes, when I remember. But that's it. Nothing for my blood pressure anymore, and nothing else. Just the fish oil and the occasional multivitamin. Mostly, I just try to eat healthy and get a good night's sleep. But lately… well, sleep hasn’t been very good either. But that’s probably just old age.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astore. If you’ll excuse me, I’m going to need to conduct a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the table. We'll start with your reflexes. I need to see how your body is responding. Do try to relax.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need. Relax, you say? I’ll try my best. It’s been a long morning already, and my legs aren’t cooperating much. Do what you need to do. Just tell me if it will be… unpleasant. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Now, just let your leg fall relaxed. No need to resist. Yes… yes, very weak. And now the other leg… Both diminished. And your feet… Reduced sensation here as well. Yes, significantly reduced. This is consistent with peripheral neuropathy, Mr. Astore. It appears to be affecting both legs. It is likely causing the weakness, tingling, and reduced sensation you described. We will need to run some blood tests to determine the underlying cause and rule out other possibilities. There are many potential causes, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, and certain medications.
PATIENT: Neu… what now? Peripheral… what was it? Weakness, I understand. That's what brought me here. But… is it bad? Is it something serious? And what about my wife? She’s been worried sick. She will want to know what’s happening, but I don't want to scare her. And blood tests? I don’t like needles, Doctor. Is there… is there anything we can do about it? Just tell me the truth, please. And speak slowly. My brain isn’t working as fast as it used to.
DOCTOR: Mr. Astore, “serious” is a relative term. It can be managed, but it requires investigation and treatment. Peripheral neuropathy simply means there is damage to the nerves in your extremities – your legs and feet, in this case. As I mentioned, it can be caused by various factors, and determining the root cause is the first step. The blood tests will help us identify potential causes such as diabetes, vitamin B12 deficiency, and other underlying medical conditions. I understand you dislike needles, but they are necessary. It’s a small discomfort for potentially significant information. Regarding your wife, I will explain everything to her in a clear and compassionate manner. It’s important to be informed, but there's no need for undue alarm. For now, we’ll proceed with the blood tests. I will also prescribe a multivitamin with B vitamins, which may help support nerve health. We'll discuss further treatment options once we have the results. Do you have any further questions at this moment?
PATIENT: Vitamin deficiencies… that could be it. My wife always says I don't eat enough greens. And I haven’t been feeling myself lately, just… tired all the time. So, could it be something simple like that? Just not eating properly? And what about… will I end up in a wheelchair, like my sister? That’s what I’m really afraid of. I still like to walk, Doctor. I like to feel the sun on my face. I don’t want to lose that. And… what kind of blood tests are we talking about? How much blood will they take? I get… lightheaded easily. Just tell me the truth, please. And thank you… for being patient with an old man. My wife will be so relieved you’re taking the time to explain things.
DOCTOR: Mr. Astore, it is possible a vitamin deficiency is contributing to your symptoms. However, we cannot assume anything without the blood tests. It could be something far more serious. Regarding your concern about a wheelchair, it is unlikely you will reach that stage immediately. Most cases of peripheral neuropathy can be managed with appropriate treatment and lifestyle modifications. However, if left untreated, it can worsen over time. The blood tests will require a standard amount of blood – approximately two vials. We will monitor your blood pressure and ensure you are comfortable throughout the procedure. If you feel lightheaded, please inform the nurse immediately. I assure you, we are taking your concerns seriously. My priority is to determine the cause of your symptoms and develop a treatment plan to improve your quality of life. Now, let’s proceed with the blood tests. The nurse will be in shortly. Do you have any further questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I think that's all. Just… please be gentle. And tell my wife… tell her I’m not giving up. I still want to walk with her. That’s all. Thank you… for everything. I’ll just… try to relax, like you said. But it’s hard when you don’t know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Astore. The nurse will be with you presently. Try to remain calm. We will do everything we can to determine the cause of your symptoms. And, if I may offer some unsolicited advice… perhaps encourage your wife to prepare a more balanced diet. It can make a significant difference. .
