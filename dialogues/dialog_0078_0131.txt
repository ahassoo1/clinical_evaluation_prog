DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Solero. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Dr. Solero! Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my blood pressure. It’s been a bit high lately, and my sister told me I really should get it checked out. She worries about me, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're taking your sister's advice – family concerns are often right on the mark. And it’s definitely a good idea to get it checked out. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed your blood pressure being high?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I guess it started… maybe three or four months ago? I didn’t really notice at first, you know? It wasn't like I was feeling bad or anything. My sister actually checked it when I was visiting her, and that’s when she told me it was a bit high. Then I checked it at the pharmacy a couple of times, just to be sure, and it was still up there.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So it wasn’t something you were experiencing symptoms with, but rather discovered during checks with your sister and at the pharmacy. Do you happen to know what those readings were, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, I wish I remembered exactly! I’m terrible with numbers, honestly. I think the first time my sister checked it, it was… something like 140 over… 90, maybe? And at the pharmacy, it was around that same area, give or take. I didn’t write it down, I shoulda, shouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: It's alright, don’t worry about it. Many people don't remember those numbers. Around 140/90 gives us a good starting point. Have you experienced any symptoms at all since discovering your blood pressure was elevated – things like headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath, or vision changes?
PATIENT: No, not really. That’s the weird thing! I feel perfectly fine, most of the time. I mean, sometimes I get a little bit of a headache, but I usually just put it down to being tired, or not drinking enough water. Nothing major, you know? And definitely no dizziness or blurry vision. I did feel a little breathless walking up the stairs last week, but that could just be because it’s so hot outside, right?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. It’s not uncommon for high blood pressure to have no symptoms, especially early on. And you’re right, the heat can definitely cause shortness of breath. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Not much to tell, really. I don’t have any major health problems. I had the flu a couple of times, and I broke my wrist when I was a teenager, but that’s about it. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. My mom had high blood pressure when she was older, if that matters?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, and yes, your mother's history of high blood pressure does matter. It suggests there might be a genetic component. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope, never. Nothing like that. I’ve always been pretty lucky, I guess! Just the broken wrist, and that was a long time ago. They just put a cast on it, and it healed up fine. I try to stay healthy, you know? I eat alright, mostly. And I walk when I can.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. It’s good you’re proactive about your health. Now, let's talk about your family history a bit more. Besides your mother's high blood pressure, are there any other health conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My grandfather on my dad’s side had a heart attack when he was pretty young, I think. And my aunt, my mom’s sister, has diabetes. She had it for a long time before she knew, though. Other than that… not really that I know of. We don’t really talk about health stuff much in my family, if I’m honest. It’s kinda seen as bad luck to talk about illnesses.
DOCTOR: I understand. That's not uncommon. Knowing about those conditions – your grandfather's heart attack and your aunt's diabetes – is helpful, though. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work… well, I do a bit of everything, really. Mostly helping people with little things. It’s not a stressful job, thankfully. I live alone, so I do my own cooking and cleaning. I try to eat healthy, like I said, mostly fruits and vegetables. I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I don’t smoke. I do like sweets, though, I gotta admit. That’s my weakness!
DOCTOR: That sounds like a reasonably healthy lifestyle overall. The sweets are perfectly alright in moderation. Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Not really "regularly," no. I walk when I can, like going to the grocery store or visiting friends. But I don’t have a set exercise routine or anything. Sometimes I’ll put on some music and dance around the house, but that’s about it. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That definitely counts! Dancing is good exercise. Now, just a few more questions about your allergies and medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I haven’t taken any medication in ages, either. Maybe some pain relievers for a headache sometimes, but that’s it. I try to avoid taking pills whenever I can, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Alright, Mykeisha, that gives me a good understanding of your health history and lifestyle. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement, Dr. Solero.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm going to start by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. I'll also feel your abdomen. It won't take long. Your blood pressure is 148 over 92. Your pulse is 78 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your ears, nose and throat appear normal. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. No masses or organomegaly detected. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, your blood pressure is elevated. This confirms your sister’s and the pharmacy's readings. It's important to investigate this further. Do you have any questions about what I’ve found so far?
PATIENT: Oh, 148 over 92… that is high, isn't it? I guess I shoulda listened to my sister more closely. So, what does this mean? Is it something serious? And what do we do now? I’m a little bit worried, if I’m honest. Is it something I can fix with diet and exercise, or…
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re asking questions, and it's perfectly normal to be worried. 148/92 is considered stage 2 hypertension, which means it is higher than we would like. While it's not an immediate emergency, it does require attention. It can often be managed with lifestyle changes like diet and exercise, and that’s where we’ll start. However, given the reading, we also need to rule out any underlying causes and assess for any organ damage. I’d like to order some blood tests and a urine test. These will help us check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and look for any signs of other health problems. I’d also recommend an electrocardiogram to check your heart’s electrical activity. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, blood tests and a urine test… and that ECG thing. That sounds… a bit scary, but I guess if it’s important, I’ll do it. I just… I don’t like needles, you know? But if it helps figure out what’s going on, I’ll try. Will the tests tell me if it’s something really bad? And how long will it take to get the results? And… will I have to come back here again?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to be anxious about needles, many people feel the same way. We'll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. The tests will help us identify if there's an underlying cause for your high blood pressure, like kidney problems or hormone imbalances. They will also help us assess whether your heart has been affected by the high blood pressure. It’s important to remember that these tests don't necessarily mean something is wrong, they just give us more information to work with. The blood and urine tests should take a couple of days to come back. The ECG results are usually available right away. Yes, you will need to come back to discuss the results, likely within a week. Once we have those results, we can develop a treatment plan tailored to your specific needs. That might include lifestyle changes, medication, or a referral to a specialist if necessary. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves, or anything else we’ve discussed so far?
PATIENT: Okay, a week to get the results… that doesn’t sound too bad. And just lifestyle changes and maybe medication… that sounds manageable. I guess I’m mostly worried about what the tests will show, you know? Like, what if something is really wrong? And… where do I go to get these tests done? And do I need to fast beforehand? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried about what the tests might reveal, but try not to jump to conclusions. Many people with high blood pressure live long and healthy lives with proper management. We'll take everything one step at a time. You’ll need to go to the lab here at the clinic. I’ll give you a requisition form with instructions. Yes, you do need to fast for 12 hours before the blood tests. That means no food or sugary drinks. You can drink water. The lab technician will explain everything to you when you arrive. Here’s the form with the lab instructions. The lab is open from 7 AM to 4 PM, Monday through Friday. Just let them know you’re here for tests ordered by Dr. Solero. Before you go, do you have any allergies to latex or other materials we should be aware of before the tests?
PATIENT: No latex allergies, thankfully. Just… needles. Okay, no food for 12 hours, and bring this form to the lab. I think that’s everything. Thank you, Dr. Solero. You’ve explained everything so clearly. I feel a little bit better now, knowing what to expect. I'll go schedule those tests first thing tomorrow. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime, like watching my salt intake or something?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I'm glad I could help ease your concerns. In the meantime, reducing your salt intake is a good idea. Also, try to incorporate some stress-reducing activities into your daily routine, like deep breathing exercises or gentle stretching. And stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water. If you experience any severe headaches, chest pain, shortness of breath, or vision changes before your test, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Here's a handout with information about managing high blood pressure, including dietary recommendations and exercise tips. Do you have any other questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Dr. Solero. I really appreciate your help. I’ll see you next week.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mykeisha. Take care, and I’ll see you next week. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then.
