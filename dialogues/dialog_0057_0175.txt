DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. I’m Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this pain… it’s been bothering me for a little while now. Mostly in my… well, I’ll try to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, take your time. “A little while” can mean different things to different people. Could you tell me roughly how long you’ve been experiencing this pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably about three months now? Maybe a little longer. It started off kinda subtle, just a little ache here and there, but it’s gotten worse over time, you know? It’s definitely not going away on its own.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months. And you said it’s gotten worse over time. Can you describe the pain to me?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It’s not like a sharp, sudden pain. More of a dull ache, a constant throbbing, really. And it feels deep inside, not on the surface. Sometimes it radiates down my leg a bit, too. It's worst when I'm walking for a long time, or if I've been standing up a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull, throbbing ache that radiates down your leg, and is worse with walking or standing. That’s helpful. Can you point to where you feel the pain most intensely?
PATIENT: Right here, in my lower back. And it goes down… about here, on my thigh. Not all the way to my knee, usually, but sometimes it does. It's mostly right here in my back though.
DOCTOR: Alright, so lower back with radiation down the right thigh. Do you notice anything that improves the pain?
PATIENT: Well, sitting helps, usually. Or lying down. When I’m resting, it’s not too bad. And if I take it really easy, like not doing much at all, it calms down a bit. Honestly, not much really makes it go away completely though. It’s just… less when I’m not moving around.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sitting or lying down provides some relief. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, yeah, a little. My right foot sometimes feels kinda… numb? Not all the time, just every now and then. And like a pins and needles feeling, you know? It doesn't last long though. I just figured it was from sitting too long. I haven't really thought much of it, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent numbness and tingling in your right foot. That’s good information. Now, let's talk about your overall health. Do you have any other medical problems that you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was under control with diet and exercise. I try to walk when I can, but with this pain, it's been hard lately. Nothing else, though. I've been pretty healthy my whole life, to be honest. No major surgeries or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, well controlled hypertension with diet and exercise. That's good to hear. And no surgeries. What about medications?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pills, like I said. Lisinopril, I think it’s called? I’ve been taking it for about five years now. It's a small dose, and I take it every day. Other than that, nothing. I try to avoid taking too many pills if I can, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, no problems with pollen or anything like that either. My wife always checks when she gives me something new, just in case, but I've never had an issue.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And just to be thorough, could you tell me a little about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My mother had arthritis, I think. And my father had something with his heart, but I don’t remember exactly what it was. It was a long time ago. My wife's family, they've had some diabetes, I believe. But other than that, not much that I can think of. It wasn't really something we talked about a lot, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. That gives me a little bit to work with. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking, and I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a blue moon. And definitely no recreational drugs. Never been interested in those things. I like my peace and quiet, you know? I try to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. We’ll check your range of motion, reflexes, and strength in your legs, and I’ll palpate your spine to see where the pain is most prominent. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could lie down on your back for me, please. I'll start by just feeling along your spine. Let me know if anything is particularly tender.
PATIENT: Okay. Just let me know if I need to adjust or anything. And yes, I’ll tell you if something hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright. Can you tell me where you feel the most pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch… right there. Just a little to the left of my spine. Yeah, that’s where it really hurts. Not all the time, but when you press on it like that, definitely. It's a sharp pain, but it fades pretty quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness at L4-L5 on the left side. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. I’m going to ask you to relax your legs, and then I’ll tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. Your reflexes are a little diminished on your right side compared to your left, but not significantly. Now, I’d like you to try to lift your right leg straight up while keeping it straight. How is that?
PATIENT: It’s… hard. I can’t lift it as high as I used to be able to. It feels weak. Like it’s giving out. It doesn't hurt that bad, just… weak. It feels like I’m putting in a lot of effort for not much movement. Much easier with my left leg, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, diminished strength and a positive straight leg raise test on the right side. These findings, combined with the tenderness I felt, suggest possible nerve compression. Given your age and medical history, the most likely cause is a lumbar disc herniation or spinal stenosis. However, we'll need to get some imaging to confirm. I'm going to order an X-ray and an MRI of your lower back. The X-ray will help us rule out any fractures or other structural abnormalities. The MRI will give us a much clearer picture of the discs, nerves, and spinal cord. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. An MRI and X-ray sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on, and hopefully get this pain sorted out. Is it covered by… anything? I don’t have insurance, unfortunately. I’m worried about the cost.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost. Unfortunately, without insurance, both the X-ray and MRI can be quite expensive. I’ll have my staff check the cash prices for both and provide you with an estimate. We can also explore options like a payment plan, if that's something you're interested in. We may also be able to direct you to facilities that offer discounted rates for self-pay patients. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and a mild pain reliever to help manage your symptoms while we wait for the imaging results. I'll also recommend a course of physical therapy, which can help strengthen your back muscles and improve your range of motion. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. A muscle relaxant and pain reliever would be very helpful. And I’ll definitely look into the physical therapy. I’ve heard good things about that. And thank you for checking on the cost, I appreciate that. Hopefully, it won't be too expensive. Let me know what the cash prices are. And, um… how long should I wait before scheduling the MRI?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I’ll have my staff reach out to you with the cash prices within 24 hours. As for the MRI, we’ll need to get it done as soon as possible to determine the best course of treatment. I’ll write you a referral, and my staff will schedule it for you. Ideally, within the next week, if possible. We'll also give you instructions on what to expect before, during, and after the scan. In the meantime, avoid any heavy lifting, twisting, or bending. If you experience any new symptoms, such as numbness or weakness in your legs, or loss of bowel or bladder control, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think you've covered everything, Doctor. Thank you so much for your time and explaining everything so clearly. I really appreciate it. I’ll wait for the staff to call me about the prices and scheduling. And I’ll definitely be careful with my back.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Way. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. My staff will be in touch shortly. Have a good day, and take care.
