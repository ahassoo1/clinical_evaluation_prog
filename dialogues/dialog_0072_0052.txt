DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I'm Dr. Hembrey. I see you’re here today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to ye, Doctor. Well, it's this nausea, see. Been happening most mornings now for... oh, maybe a month or so. It's not sharp pain, more like a queasy feeling that just won't go away. And it seems to be worse after I've had a bit of food, which is a bit odd, isn't it? I was diagnosed with heart failure a few years back, and the nurse thought it might be connected.
DOCTOR: I see. Nausea, present most mornings for approximately one month, exacerbated by food intake. And you mentioned a prior diagnosis of heart failure. That is relevant. Now, when you say “worse after food,” could you elaborate?
PATIENT: Aye, well, it's not like I'm throwin' up or anything. It’s more...the feeling gets stronger, ye ken? Like a bit of seasickness, maybe? It doesn't matter what I eat, really – a piece of toast, a full breakfast, doesn’t seem to make a difference. It just… builds. And it lasts a good couple o’ hours, usually. It’s wearin’ me down a bit, to be honest. I try to eat somethin' 'cause I know I should, but then I feel worse. It's a bit of a catch-22, really.
DOCTOR: So, the sensation isn't accompanied by emesis, and it's not related to a specific food type. It persists for approximately two hours after eating. I see. And besides the nausea, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Aye, let me think... Well, I've been a wee bit more tired than usual, if I'm bein' honest. Just generally feelin' run-down. And... I've been a bit short o’ breath, even with just gentle activity. Not like I'm wheezin’ or anything, just feelin' like I can't quite get enough air, especially when I'm walkin' up the stairs. I thought it might just be my age, mind ye, but now I'm wonderin' if it’s connected to the nausea. I’ve also been swellin’ up a wee bit in my ankles, but that comes and goes, ye ken? It’s been worse lately, though.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, dyspnea with exertion, and lower extremity edema... These are certainly symptoms that warrant further investigation, particularly given your history of heart failure. Now, let's delve a bit deeper into your medical history. Besides the heart failure, are there any other medical conditions you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Aye, well, I had a touch o' arthritis in my knees a few years back, but it's mostly managed with some over-the-counter pain relief. And I had a bout o' pneumonia a good ten years ago, but I recovered fully, thank goodness. I've also got high blood pressure, which I take tablets for – amlodipine, I think it's called. I can't rightly remember the dosage, though, it's the wee white ones. I’ve not been seeing a specialist for the heart failure in a good while, to be honest. Just the regular check-ups with my GP. Oh, and I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Amlodipine for hypertension, remote pneumonia, and a cholecystectomy twenty years ago… And you haven't been under the care of a cardiologist recently. The gallbladder removal is less pertinent at this point. Now, are you currently taking any other medications or supplements – anything at all, even over-the-counter remedies or herbal products?
PATIENT: Aye, well, I take a multivitamin every day, just somethin' I picked up at the chemist. And… oh, yes! I take cod liver oil for my joints. An old remedy my mother swore by. Just a teaspoonful every morning. Other than that… nothin’ really. I try to stay away from too much medication if I can, ye ken? I believe in keepin' things natural whenever possible. I do have a wee dram o' whisky now and then, but I wouldn’t call that medicine!
DOCTOR: Multivitamin and cod liver oil... I understand your preference for natural remedies, Mr. Benic, but it’s important to be aware of potential interactions with other medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Aye, let me think… I don't think so. I’ve never had a proper allergic reaction, not that I can recall. I’ve been stung by a wasp a couple o’ times, but just had a bit o’ swelling where it stung me, nothin’ serious. And… oh, I once had a wee rash after eatin’ strawberries when I was a bairn, but I haven’t touched them since. I don’t believe it was a proper allergy, just a bit o’ irritation, maybe. I'm generally alright with most things, to be honest. Not much bothers me.
DOCTOR: No known drug allergies or significant reactions… Very well. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Aye, let me see… My father had heart trouble in his later years, needed a pacemaker, as I recall. My mother, she had diabetes, developed it when she was older. My brother, he’s got high blood pressure, like myself. And... my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had breast cancer. And my uncle, he had prostate cancer. So, there's a bit o' both, really. Not a very healthy bunch, I'm afraid. It makes ye wonder what ye're gonna get, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Family history significant for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and malignancy... That is helpful to know. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Nay, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and it wasn’t a pretty sight, so I stayed well clear o' them. And I don’t drink heavily, just a wee dram o’ whisky now and then, like I said. I try to eat fairly healthy, though it’s gettin’ harder with this nausea makin’ it difficult. I used to walk a good bit, but I’ve not been doin’ much lately. I live alone, ye see, and sometimes it’s just easier to stay indoors.
DOCTOR: Non-smoker, minimal alcohol consumption... Now, Mr. Benic, I’m going to conduct a brief physical examination. I will listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your abdomen. This will help me get a better understanding of your condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m used to a bit o’ pokin' and proddin', mind ye. I've had a fair few check-ups over the years. Just let me know if ye need me to do anythin'.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is regular, but I do detect a faint S3 gallop. That’s not unexpected, given your history of heart failure, but it's something we need to monitor. Lungs are clear bilaterally, but there is some mild basilar crackles. Your abdomen is soft, but there is some mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant, though no significant guarding or rebound tenderness. Blood pressure is 150/90. Your blood pressure is elevated. Now, given your history, symptoms, and these findings, I suspect this nausea could be related to your heart failure and possibly some fluid retention. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function tests, and BNP – that's a marker for heart failure. I'd also like to order a chest X-ray to assess for pulmonary congestion. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Aye, that's a fair bit o' information, Doctor. BNP, ye say? That tells ye about the heart, does it? And the X-ray's for the lungs, to see if there's fluid? Sounds sensible enough. I trust yer judgement. Will these tests tell us if it is the heart causin’ the nausea, or if there's somethin' else goin' on? And how long will it take to get the results? I'm not one for fussin', but I'd like to get to the bottom o' this sooner rather than later. It’s wearin’ me thin, this feelin’.
DOCTOR: Yes, the BNP levels can help us determine the severity of your heart failure and whether your symptoms are related to fluid overload. The chest X-ray will assess for pulmonary congestion, which is a common sign of heart failure. The blood work will also help us rule out other possibilities, such as kidney problems or infection. The lab results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a low-sodium diet and a mild diuretic to help reduce fluid retention. This may alleviate some of your symptoms while we wait for the results. I’m also going to recommend you follow up with a cardiologist as soon as possible. They can perform a more comprehensive evaluation of your heart function. Do you have any difficulty obtaining transportation to appointments?
PATIENT: Aye, a low-sodium diet and a water tablet, sounds right enough. I can manage that. I’ve always been careful with my salt, mind ye. A cardiologist, ye say? I haven’t seen one in years. I’ll need to ask my GP for a referral, will I? Transport... well, I manage. There's a bus stop just down the road, and I've got a wee bit o' savings if I need a taxi. It's not ideal, mind ye, but I'll get there. I just hope this isn’t somethin' too serious. This heart failure… it does worry me sometimes.
DOCTOR: Yes, please do ask your GP for a referral to a cardiologist. It’s important to have ongoing monitoring of your heart condition. I understand your concerns about the heart failure. It’s perfectly natural to feel anxious. We’re going to investigate this thoroughly and get to the bottom of it. I’m writing you a prescription for furosemide, a diuretic, 20mg once daily in the morning. It’s important to monitor your fluid intake and watch for any signs of dehydration – dizziness, excessive thirst, or decreased urination. I will also send the lab results directly to your GP. I want you to call the office if your symptoms worsen before your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions about the medication or anything else we discussed today?
PATIENT: Aye, furosemide, 20mg in the mornin'. Watch for dizziness, thirst... right enough. It's all a bit to take in, mind ye, but I’ll write it down. And I will call if things get worse, promise. No, I think that covers it for now, Doctor. Thank you for listenin' and takin' the time to explain things so clearly. It puts my mind at ease a wee bit, knowin' ye're lookin' into it. I appreciate yer kindness. I suppose I'll be seein' ye again, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. We will follow up once we have the results. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, prompt follow-up with your GP and a cardiologist is essential. I’ll have the nurse print out a summary of our discussion and the medication instructions for you. Take care of yourself. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Aye, thank ye kindly, Doctor. I will. And I shall see to it I get that referral sorted. You take care as well. Goodbye now. .
