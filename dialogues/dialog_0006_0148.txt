DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepro. Or, is it Steprow?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor... Gorga, is it? It’s Stepro, actually. S-T-E-P-R-O. It gets misspelled quite often, I've found. Though, honestly, I don’t recall ever correcting anyone specifically… It’s just… a little hazy, you see.
DOCTOR: Stepro, right. Yes, well… things get lost. That’s alright. So, Ms. Stepro, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… a rather embarrassing thing, to be honest. And I apologize if this is…unusual for you. It's a pain… down there. In… that area. A man might call it testicular pain, I believe my… acquaintance mentioned. But I’m a woman, of course. It’s just… a discomfort, really. A dull ache, mostly, but sometimes sharper. It started… a while ago now. I truly can’t pinpoint when, exactly. Everything feels a bit… distant, these days.
DOCTOR: Right. Pelvic pain. And you’re having trouble remembering when it began?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it, pelvic pain. That sounds… correct. And you are quite right, the timing… it escapes me. I think it was after… a trip? Perhaps. Or maybe a fall? Oh dear, this is dreadful. I wish I could be more helpful. It feels like trying to grasp smoke, trying to recall it. It’s not a sudden pain, thankfully. It’s not like that. More… persistent. A constant companion, almost. Is that… informative at all?
DOCTOR: Persistent pain is useful information, yes. And a fall… that’s good to know. Okay. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse, Ms. Stepro?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. I don’t believe so, not that I've consciously noticed. Walking doesn’t seem to aggravate it. Sitting… no. Lying down… perhaps a little? But that could just be because I’m… thinking about it more when I’m still, you see? It’s difficult to separate what makes it worse from simply being aware of it. Oh, and I do a fair bit of woodworking, but that hasn’t seemed to… impact it either. It’s just… always there, at a low level.
DOCTOR: Okay. No specific aggravating factors, just a consistent, low-level pain. Have you had any changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a rather personal question, Doctor. I… I suppose… no. Not that I’ve noticed. Everything seems to be… functioning as it should. Though, I must admit, I don’t pay as close attention to such things as I used to. It’s… embarrassing to discuss, truthfully. I do apologize. Is that important? Should I be… more observant?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Stepro. It is a personal question, and you’re right to be cautious. I just ask because pelvic pain can sometimes be related to those systems. No, you don’t need to be more observant right now. And you're doing fine. Now, have you experienced any unusual vaginal discharge, or bleeding?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… that’s… a little difficult to say. I… haven't really checked. I suppose… no. Not that I am aware of. I should be more attentive, I know, but… it’s not something I’ve actively looked for. Everything feels… normal in that regard. It’s… a bit shameful to admit, perhaps. I just… haven't been paying attention to such things. I truly apologize for being so vague. Is this… a problem?
DOCTOR: Alright. No noticeable discharge or bleeding. It’s alright, Ms. Stepro, it's not something you need to apologize for. Now, have you had any fever, chills, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no fever or chills. And I haven't lost any weight, I don't think. My clothes feel the same, if that's worth anything. Actually… now that you mention it, perhaps a little? But that could be… the stress, you see? I've been feeling rather anxious lately. It’s hard to keep track of these things. I think I’m eating normally. But everything feels a little… hazy. It's difficult to say definitively. I do apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Stepro. We're getting somewhere. Now, can you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. I don’t… remember much, to be honest. I’m on Medicare, so I’ve seen doctors, of course. But specific illnesses… it’s all a bit of a blur. I believe I had… the flu, a few times? And a bad fall, years ago. But nothing… serious? I did have a… surgery, a long time ago, but I can’t recall what for. It’s all very distant. I truly apologize for being so vague. I wish I could be more helpful. Do you have access to my records? Perhaps that would be easier?
DOCTOR: Let's see… Yes, Ms. Stepro, I do have access to your electronic health record. Okay. It appears you had an appendectomy in 1998, and… hypertension diagnosed in 2010. Currently managed with Lisinopril. Any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, Lisinopril, yes! I do take that, you're right. And allergies… hmm. I don't think so. Not to any medications, anyway. I recall a bit of a rash once, years ago, but it wasn't serious. It could have been anything. And… I believe I'm sensitive to… strong perfumes, perhaps? I get a bit of a headache. But nothing life-threatening, I assure you. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, no known drug allergies, sensitivity to perfumes. Okay. Now, regarding your family history... are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… another difficult question. My family… it was quite large, and we didn't… discuss these things much. I recall my mother… she had some heart trouble, I believe. And my father… he had diabetes, perhaps? But honestly, it's all very hazy. I wasn't particularly close to them, and… I wasn't paying much attention to their health. I truly apologize for being so vague. It feels like trying to remember a dream, you see? It's all… fragmented and distant. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Possible family history of heart trouble and diabetes. Now, one last few questions. Can you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… I live alone. I’ve been single for… a very long time. I enjoy… woodworking, as we discussed. It keeps my hands busy, you see. I don’t… go out much. I prefer the quiet of my own home. I used to travel, a long time ago, but… not anymore. I don’t… drink alcohol, and I don’t smoke. I used to have… acquaintances, but we’ve lost touch. It’s a rather solitary life, truthfully. But I’m content. Is that… relevant? I apologize for being so… uninteresting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you, Ms. Stepro. Now, let's do a brief physical exam. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. We'll just start with abdominal and pelvic exam. Let me know if anything is uncomfortable. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, alright. That’s… perfectly alright. But I must warn you, Doctor, I’m a little… self-conscious. I haven’t had one of those in… a very long time. And, as you’ve gathered, I’m not always the most… aware of my surroundings. But I’ll try to be… cooperative. Just please be… gentle? And let me know what you’re doing, if you don’t mind. I appreciate your… patience.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stepro. We'll take things very slowly. I will explain everything as I go along. And please, let me know immediately if anything is uncomfortable. I'm just going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Your bowel sounds are normal. No abnormalities detected. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Do you feel any pain here?
PATIENT: Oh. Ooh… yes. There. That’s… a little tender. Not sharp, exactly. Just… a discomfort. A dull ache. It's… familiar, unfortunately. It’s the same area where I've been feeling the… general pain. Is that… significant? I apologize for being so vague, but it's hard to describe. It’s just… an ache. A low, persistent ache. And… it’s a little difficult to relax. I’m afraid I’m a bit… tense.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen. We’ll continue the exam, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. Now, I'm going to perform a pelvic exam. I'll need you to bend your knees and relax your muscles. I know it's not comfortable, but it’s important for me to assess the source of your discomfort. I’m just going to insert a speculum to visualize your cervix and vagina. This may cause some pressure, but should not be painful. Let me know if you feel any sharp pain or discomfort. Your cervix appears normal. No visible lesions or abnormalities. The vaginal walls appear thin, but no signs of infection or inflammation. Now, I'm going to perform a bimanual exam to assess your uterus and ovaries. This involves inserting two gloved fingers into your vagina while gently pressing on your abdomen. Again, let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Your uterus feels normal in size and position. Your ovaries feel… difficult to palpate. There’s some tenderness on the left side, but no obvious masses or abnormalities.
PATIENT: Oh. Ooh… yes. That side… the left side. That’s… definitely tender. Not sharp, exactly, but… a discomfort. A deep ache. It feels… different than the other side. And it’s a little difficult to… breathe. I apologize. I’m not trying to be difficult, Doctor, it’s just… uncomfortable. And I’m a little… anxious. Is that… normal? Is something wrong? I truly apologize for being so vague and unhelpful. But it's just... a discomfort, a deep ache on the left side, and it’s making me anxious. And… it’s a little difficult to relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Stepro. You’re doing fine. I appreciate your patience and cooperation. Based on the physical exam, there is tenderness in your lower abdomen and particularly on the left side during the pelvic exam. The ovaries were difficult to palpate. Given your history of chronic pelvic pain and the tenderness on the left side, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. It could be musculoskeletal pain, perhaps related to muscle strain or inflammation. It could also be related to ovarian cysts, which are common and often cause pain. Less likely, but we need to rule it out, it could be endometriosis or pelvic inflammatory disease. To help determine the cause of your pain, I recommend a pelvic ultrasound. It will allow us to visualize your uterus, ovaries, and surrounding structures. We will also need to order some blood work to check for inflammation and other potential causes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh. An ultrasound… and blood work. Yes, that sounds… alright. Anything to find out what's causing this, truthfully. I just… want it to stop. This constant ache… it’s wearing me down. Ovarian cysts… endometriosis… those sound… frightening. But if that's what it takes to find out what's wrong, then yes, please. Let's do the ultrasound and the blood work. Will it… will it be painful? I apologize for asking, but I'm a little… apprehensive. And… will the results take long? I just… want this over with. And I want to feel better.
DOCTOR: The ultrasound itself is not painful, Ms. Stepro. It involves using a wand-like device on your abdomen, and it's completely non-invasive. The blood work will involve a simple blood draw, and may cause some minor discomfort. We will schedule the ultrasound as soon as possible, and the results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. The blood work results may take a little longer, perhaps 2-3 days. In the meantime, you can continue taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen to manage your pain. I will also write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant to help ease any muscle tension. I will also give you a referral to a gynecologist. They are specialists in women’s health and can provide further evaluation and treatment if necessary. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… reassuring. And a muscle relaxant… that sounds… helpful. I do appreciate it, Doctor. A gynecologist… yes, that sounds… sensible. Someone who specializes in… all of this. Um… yes, I do have a question, actually. It’s… silly, perhaps. But… what if it’s something… serious? I apologize. I’m just… anxious. And… I don’t have anyone to… talk to about this.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Ms. Stepro. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious, especially when you’re facing something unknown. While it's important to be prepared for all possibilities, it’s also important to remember that the vast majority of chronic pelvic pain cases are not caused by something serious. Musculoskeletal pain and ovarian cysts are very common and often manageable with conservative treatment. However, it's crucial to rule out any underlying causes, which is why we are ordering the ultrasound and blood work. We will discuss the results thoroughly when they come back, and I will answer any questions you may have. And you are not alone, Ms. Stepo. I am here to help you through this, and we will work together to find a solution. I will also provide you with some resources for support groups and counseling services, if you are interested. Do you want me to write down the information for those resources for you?
PATIENT: Oh. That’s… very kind of you, Doctor. Resources… yes, please. That would be… helpful. I just… I feel a little… lost. And… alone. I haven't really… talked to anyone about this. It's just… a constant ache. And the anxiety… it's wearing me down. Thank you. Truly. For… everything. Is there anything… anything I should be doing? Any specific symptoms I should be watching out for? Before the ultrasound?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stepo. It’s perfectly normal to feel lost and overwhelmed in these situations. In the meantime, before the ultrasound, please monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any sudden, severe abdominal pain, heavy vaginal bleeding, fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting, please seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, continue taking over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, and try to rest and relax as much as possible. Avoid strenuous activities that may aggravate your pain. I’m going to write you a prescription for the muscle relaxant now. You can fill it at your local pharmacy. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh. Sudden, severe pain… yes, I’ll remember that. Thank you. And rest… yes, that sounds… sensible. It's difficult, though. No, I don’t think I have any other questions, Doctor. You’ve… answered everything. Truly. Thank you. For your… patience. And your kindness. I appreciate it more than you know. I think… I think that’s all. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stepro. I'm glad I could help. We’ll schedule that ultrasound for you as soon as possible, and we will discuss the results thoroughly. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you soon. .
