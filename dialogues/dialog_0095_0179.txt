DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gyamfi. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It is… a pleasure, I think. It is about… the words. They do not come so easy now. It is… difficult to find them, you understand? Not all the time, but… often enough to be troubling.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty with your speech – finding the right words. How long has this been going on, Mr. Gyamfi?
PATIENT: Oh, that is… a good question. Time… it feels strange now. Perhaps… six months? Maybe a little longer. It started slowly, you see. I would… pause, sometimes, when speaking with friends. Now… it is more often. I do not remember when it started exactly. It is… frustrating. I used to be very… precise with my words. As my job requires. Compensation… benefits… yes.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or so. And it's been gradually getting worse. You mentioned your job requires precision with your words – what do you do, Mr. Gyamfi, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. I am… a specialist. Compensation, benefits… and job analysis. It is… paperwork, mostly. And talking to people, explaining things. Making sure everyone… understands. It is important work. But now… sometimes I struggle to explain. It is… embarrassing, to be honest. My wife… she always helped me with this. But she… is no longer with us.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Gyamfi. That must be incredibly difficult. And I can certainly understand how frustrating this would be for your work and, frankly, for everyday life. So, to clarify, this difficulty with finding words… does it happen all the time, or are there certain situations where it's worse?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It is… kind of you to say. Certain situations… yes, that is a good question. When I am tired, certainly. And when I am… stressed. Thinking too much, perhaps. Or… when there are many people around. It is easier to speak when I am alone, or with just one friend. Also… when I try to explain complicated things. My job… yes, it is harder now. Simple things I can still manage. But… details? No. Those are… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be worse with fatigue, stress, when you’re speaking to groups, and when explaining complex topics. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this difficulty with words?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmmm. Let me think. I… I have been forgetting things more easily, perhaps. Small things. Where I put my glasses, for example. Or the name of a… a flower. Not important things, usually. And… sometimes I feel a little… unsteady on my feet. Not falling, but… a little wobbly. And my wife… she noticed I was a little… quieter. More withdrawn. But that could be… everything, you understand? It has been a difficult time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some memory issues, feeling unsteady, and your wife noticed you were quieter and more withdrawn. These are all important things to know. Now, do you have any medical conditions that you’re aware of, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… The doctor… he told me I had… high blood pressure, some years ago. I take pills for it, every morning. And… I had a small operation on my knee, perhaps five years ago. Nothing serious. Otherwise… no, I do not think so. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly for check-ups. But they do not… they do not ask about words, you understand? They ask about blood pressure, and cholesterol… but not… this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, well-controlled with medication, and you had a knee surgery five years ago. Good. And you’re right, sometimes these things can slip through the cracks during routine check-ups. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I do not think so. Not that I am aware of. I can eat anything, and I have never had a… a reaction to any medicine. My wife… she always made sure of that. She would ask every time the doctor prescribed something new. She was very… careful. I… I miss her. I am sorry, Doctor. I did not mean to… ramble. It is just… hard.
DOCTOR: You’re not rambling at all, Mr. Gyamfi. It’s perfectly understandable that you’re feeling this way. And it sounds like your wife was a wonderful advocate for you. Alright, let's move on to your medications. You mentioned taking something for high blood pressure. Can you tell me the name of that medication and the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me see… the bottle is at home. It is… a small white pill. I take one every morning with my breakfast. The name… it begins with an 'A', I think. Amlodipine? Is that correct? Five milligrams, I believe. Yes, that is it. Amlodipine, five milligrams, every morning. I have not changed the dosage, and I have been taking it regularly. As the doctor instructed.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine 5mg daily. Good. Now, just to get a clearer picture, can you describe what happens exactly when you have difficulty finding your words?
PATIENT: Yes, I will try. It is… like the word is there, on the tip of my tongue. I know what I want to say, and I can almost… feel it. But when I try to speak, it comes out wrong. Or… nothing comes out at all. Sometimes I will say a word that is… similar to the one I want, but not quite correct. It is… frustrating, and embarrassing. My friends… they are very patient. But I can see it in their eyes. They are trying to understand, but… it is difficult. It happens most often when I am… thinking too much, perhaps. Trying to be too precise. And when I am tired, of course. Then it is… much worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it feels like the word is on the tip of your tongue, you know the meaning but struggle to articulate it, and you might substitute a similar word. And it’s exacerbated by fatigue and overthinking. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological exam—check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. That will give me a better idea of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment. Please, do whatever you think is necessary. I want to understand what is happening, and I want to… feel better. Blood pressure, lungs… yes. Please, go ahead. I will try to be… still. It is… a little difficult, sometimes, to sit for long. My knee, you see. But I will manage.
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll take it slow. If you're uncomfortable at any point, please let me know. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Just relax your arm. “Reflexes are normal.” Now, let's check your balance. Could you please stand up and try to balance on both feet for about 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… a little difficult. I feel… wobbly. I do not fall, but… I need to concentrate very hard to stay upright. My knee… it is not helping, you see. But it is… mostly my balance. It is not as good as it used to be. I am… sorry, Doctor. I am probably making a fool of myself.
DOCTOR: You’re not making a fool of yourself at all, Mr. Gyamfi. This is all very helpful information. I see you are indeed a bit unsteady, and it's understandable that your knee might be contributing to that. Now, let’s try a quick cognitive test, just a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking. Do you mind?
PATIENT: No, no. Please, go ahead. I will try my best. I am… a little worried, perhaps. But I want to understand what is happening, you see. Memory… yes. It is not as good as it used to be. But I will try. Ask your questions, Doctor. I will do my best to answer them honestly. It is… a little difficult, sometimes, to concentrate. But I will try.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to ask you three words, and I want you to repeat them back to me, and then I’ll ask you to repeat them again later. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I am ready. Please, tell me the words. I will concentrate very hard. I will try to remember them. Go ahead, please. I am listening.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: table, penny, orange. Repeat those back to me, please.
PATIENT: Table… penny… orange. Is that correct? I hope I remembered them. It is… a little difficult to hold them all in my mind at once. But I think I have them. Table, penny, orange.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. Now, I’m going to ask you a few other questions, and then I’ll ask you to repeat those three words again. This is just to get a better overall picture. Okay, now, can you tell me those three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… Table… I remember table. And… penny, I think. Yes, penny. But the third word… oh dear. It is… on the tip of my tongue. It begins with… an 'o'? No… it is… something round? Oh, I am sorry, Doctor. I cannot remember. Table… penny… and… I just cannot recall the third word. It is very frustrating. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Gyamfi. Don't worry about it. It’s not a test to pass or fail. The difficulty recalling that third word is a relevant piece of information. Based on your history, the physical exam findings, and the brief cognitive assessment, there are several possibilities we need to consider. Given the difficulty with word-finding, memory issues, and some unsteadiness, it's important to rule out any underlying neurological causes. It could be something as simple as medication side effects or vitamin deficiencies, but it's also important to consider conditions like mild cognitive impairment or early stages of dementia. I would like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and rule out any other underlying medical conditions. I also recommend a brain MRI to get a clearer picture of your brain structure and rule out any potential issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious, Doctor. A brain MRI… Is it… is it something to worry about? I… I am not sure I understand. I just want to feel better, you see. Medication side effects… vitamin deficiencies… those sound… manageable. But dementia… that is… frightening. Blood tests, yes. That I can do. But the MRI… I am not sure. Is it absolutely necessary? Can we not… try something else first? Perhaps adjust my medication? Or take some vitamins? I am… a little worried, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gyamfi. It’s completely natural to feel worried when we talk about things like MRIs and dementia. It’s important to remember that an MRI is just a tool—it doesn’t give you a diagnosis, it just helps us rule things out or identify potential areas of concern. And, to be clear, I’m not saying you definitely have dementia. It’s just one possibility we need to consider, and it's best to investigate it thoroughly, especially given your symptoms. Adjusting your medication or trying vitamins is certainly something we can do, and it's a good first step. However, if the symptoms persist or worsen, we need to have a baseline MRI to rule out other, more serious causes. We can start with the blood tests and discuss adjusting your medication. I'll also give you a referral to a neurologist, who can help us interpret the MRI results if we decide to proceed. Would that be a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests, yes. And adjusting my medication. A neurologist… yes, I suppose. If you think it is necessary. I… I trust your judgment. I just want to… understand what is happening, you see. And I want to feel better. So, blood tests first, and see how I feel. And then… we can talk about the neurologist and the MRI. Is that correct? Thank you, Doctor. You have… reassured me somewhat. It is… a little frightening, but I am glad we have a plan.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Blood tests first, and we’ll see how you respond to medication adjustments. I’ll also write you a referral to see Dr. Evelyn Reed, a neurologist specializing in cognitive disorders. She's excellent. I’ll order the blood tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they’ll be expecting you. I’ll also print out a list of potential side effects of your current medication, and some information about vitamin deficiencies that can cause similar symptoms. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the results and how you’re feeling. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that is all. Thank you for your time, and for… explaining everything so clearly. You have been very kind. Blood tests… and the neurologist. I will remember. And… thank you for not dismissing my concerns. It is… a relief to feel listened to. I suppose I will… go to the lab now. Is there anything I need to bring with me?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gyamfi. I’m glad I could help. You don't need to bring anything with you to the lab—just your insurance card and a photo ID. They’ll handle everything else. Please, take your time, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions at all. I’ll see you in two weeks. And remember, we’re taking this one step at a time. Have a good day, Mr. Gyamfi.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. And… thank you again.
