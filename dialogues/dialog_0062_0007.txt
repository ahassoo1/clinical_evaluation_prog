DOCTOR: Hi Lakiya, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. My back… it is painful. Has been for some time now. I would like to get it looked at, if you please. I do not want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Back pain can be really disruptive. No worries at all about taking up my time, that’s what I’m here for. When you say “some time now,” could you tell me roughly how long you’ve been experiencing this pain?
PATIENT: Roughly… six months, I believe. It started slow, a little ache after work. Now… it is constant. Even when I am resting. I work with fences, you see. A lot of bending and lifting.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months is a good timeframe to start with. Working with fences sounds physically demanding, and that bending and lifting definitely could be contributing. And it's helpful to know it's become constant, even at rest. Could you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: It is… a dull ache, mostly. But when I move certain ways, it sharpens. Like a… a hot knife twisting. Mostly in my lower back, but sometimes it goes down my leg. Not always, though. It depends. It is hard to explain.
DOCTOR: No, that’s a very good description, actually. Dull ache with sharp, twisting pain with movement – that gives me a better picture. And the pain radiating down your leg is important to know. Does that pain go all the way down to your foot, or is it more in the thigh or calf?
PATIENT: Mostly in the thigh. Sometimes a little in the calf, but not often. It does not go all the way to my foot, no. It is worse after I have been working, of course. And… if I sit for too long. Is this… taking too long?
DOCTOR: No, not at all! You're giving me exactly the information I need. It's good to know it's triggered by activity and prolonged sitting. Let's talk a little more about your overall health. Have you had any previous back problems, like injuries or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no broken bones. I… I have always been strong. Worked hard all my life. This… this just started. Like I said, six months ago. I do not understand it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know – no prior history of back issues. It does sound frustrating when something comes on suddenly like this. And you’re right, it's important to figure out what's going on. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the back pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. I… I am tired, sometimes. But I work hard. That could be anything. No numbness, no tingling. No problems with… with going to the bathroom. Just the pain. And being tired.
DOCTOR: Alright, no numbness, tingling, or bowel/bladder changes, that’s good. And fatigue is common with physical work, as you said. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam if that's okay with you. We'll check your range of motion, reflexes, and do some gentle palpation to see where the pain is most intense. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… acceptable. As long as it does not take too long. I have things to see to. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible. If you could lie down on your stomach on the table for me, that would be great. I'll start by feeling along your spine to check for tenderness and muscle spasms. Then we'll do a few simple movements to see how your range of motion is. Just let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Okay, can you tell me where it hurts the most right now?
PATIENT: Right… there. And… when you press there. It is not a sharp pain, but… it is uncomfortable. It feels… tight. Like a knot.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel a definite tenderness and some muscle guarding right here on your right lower back. And you’re right, it does feel quite tight. Now, I'm going to ask you to slowly lift your right leg straight up while keeping it straight. Just as high as you comfortably can. How does that feel?
PATIENT: It… hurts. Not terrible, but… a pulling pain in my back. And down my leg, a little. I can’t lift it very high. It feels… strained. Is this… significant?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. That limited range of motion and the pain radiating down your leg with that maneuver is certainly something we need to pay attention to. It's suggestive of possible nerve involvement, potentially sciatic irritation. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes in both legs. Just relax your legs, and I'll tap on your tendons. Your reflexes are a little diminished on the right side compared to the left, which further supports the possibility of nerve compression or irritation. Let me quickly review your EHR information to see if anything stands out. Okay, I see you've had routine checkups with no major concerns noted previously. No history of diabetes, which is good. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may have a lumbar strain with possible sciatic radiculopathy. Essentially, a muscle injury in your lower back that is irritating the sciatic nerve. It's common with physically demanding work. However, to get a clearer picture and rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order an X-ray of your lower back. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… yes, that is… acceptable. As long as it does not take too long to get the results. And… if it finds nothing, will we be doing anything else? I do not want to waste time with tests that do not matter.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about wasting time. The X-ray will help us rule out any structural issues like fractures or significant arthritis. We'll get the results back relatively quickly, usually within 24-48 hours. If the X-ray comes back normal, we can move forward with a trial of conservative treatment. That would include: Physical therapy: To strengthen your core and back muscles, and improve your flexibility. Pain management: Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help with the inflammation and pain. We can discuss prescription options if those aren’t enough. Activity modification: Avoiding heavy lifting and bending for a while is important to let your back heal. If those measures aren’t effective after a few weeks, then we might consider an MRI to get a more detailed look at your soft tissues, like your discs and nerves. But let’s start with the X-ray and see what that shows. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: That… sounds acceptable. Physical therapy… I can try that. And the pain relievers. I do not want anything stronger unless absolutely necessary. Activity modification… that will be difficult, but I will try. So, the X-ray first. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad you're willing to try those options. Okay, I'm going to write you an order for the X-ray. The radiology department is just down the hall to your left. The receptionist there will help you schedule it. They usually can do it today, if not tomorrow. Here’s the order. They will likely ask you about any pregnancy possibilities, and if you have any metal implants. Just let them know. Once you’ve had the X-ray, you can bring the images, or have them sent directly to us. We’ll review them and schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a more specific treatment plan. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds good. I will go to radiology now. Is there anything else I need to know before I go? I do not want to forget anything. And thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, I don’t think so. Just let the radiology technician know if you experience any pain during the X-ray. Otherwise, you’re all set. And you’re very welcome, Lakiya. I'm glad we could talk through this. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or if your pain worsens while you're waiting for the X-ray results. Take care, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will.
