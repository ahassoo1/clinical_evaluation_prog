DOCTOR: Alright, Brad, good to meet you. Thanks for coming in today. So, to get started, can you tell me a bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, it's… not good. Been throwin' up blood, mostly. Not a ton, but enough to worry a fella. It started a couple days ago, and it hasn't let up. Honestly, it’s kinda freakin’ me out.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. That is concerning, and I understand why you're freaked out. Vomiting blood is never normal. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. First, when you say “a couple of days ago,” can you recall roughly when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It was… Tuesday, I reckon. Yeah, Tuesday morning, after my coffee. Usually, I can handle my coffee just fine. Strong stuff, you know? But this time… not so much. It started kinda slow, just a little bit of red in it. Thought it was just somethin' I ate, but then it kept happenin'.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tuesday morning after coffee. And it's continued since then. You said a "little bit of red" at first - has the amount of blood changed at all since Tuesday?
PATIENT: Yeah, it’s gotten…worse. Not a flood, mind you, don't want you thinkin’ that. But more than a little bit. Wednesday was bad, and today… well, today I didn't even bother with breakfast. Didn't fancy riskin’ it. It’s mostly just…darker now, kinda like coffee grounds.
DOCTOR: Okay, darker, like coffee grounds – that’s important information, Brad. And you haven't had anything to eat since this morning, correct?
PATIENT: Right. Didn't want to tempt fate. Look, I ain’t one for fancy hospital food anyway. Besides, what's the point? Just gonna throw it up again, ain’t it?
DOCTOR: You’re right to be cautious, Brad. It's good you're listening to your body. And no, there’s no point in forcing food down if you're just going to be sick. Now, aside from the vomiting blood, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… I've been feelin' kinda weak, tired all the time. More tired than usual, and I'm always tired. And my stomach’s been hurtin’, kinda a dull ache, nothin’ sharp. Oh, and I've been...well, paler than usual, I suppose. My wife used to say I was always a bit pasty, but even I notice it now.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness, fatigue, a dull stomach ache, and paleness. That’s all helpful information. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: Fever? No, nothin’ like that. Chills, maybe a little bit yesterday, but I figured it was just the air conditionin’ bein’ too strong. And night sweats…nah. I always sleep warm, but it's not been any different than usual.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any change in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Now you’re askin’… Look, doc, do we really need to talk about that? Fine. It’s…dark. Darker than usual, I mean. Like…tar, almost. And kinda…sticky. Happy now?
DOCTOR: It's important information, Brad, and I appreciate you being honest with me. Dark, tarry stools are something we definitely need to investigate. Okay, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Not much, really. Had my appendix out when I was a kid, that's about it. And high blood pressure, Doc told me a few years back, but I ain’t been takin’ any pills for it. Didn't see the point, honestly. Made me feel awful. My wife… she was always on me about it, but… well.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy as a child, and a diagnosis of high blood pressure that you haven’t been treating with medication. Anything else?
PATIENT: Nah. I've always been a strong fella. Never really needed much doctorin' up. I used to smoke, back in the day, a pack a day for twenty years. Quit about ten years ago, though. Best thing I ever did, that.
DOCTOR: Okay, former smoker – that's important to know. And about how much alcohol do you drink, Brad?
PATIENT: Not much anymore. Used to enjoy a few beers with the lads on a Friday night, back when… well, you know. Now, I maybe have a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a week. Just to relax, that’s all. Nothing fancy, just somethin' cheap from the supermarket.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like aspirin or ibuprofen?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a fan of pills, as you might have noticed. I'll tough things out, usually. Always have. Don't believe in relyin' on doctor stuff if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or bee stings?
PATIENT: Nah. Never had any trouble with allergies, thankfully. Can eat anything, touch anything, never bothered me none. Always been lucky like that, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, Brad. It'll just involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine by me. Get it over with, then. I got things to do, you know? Just… be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie back for me, please. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Okay. Your heart sounds a little fast, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is tender in the upper left quadrant, but no significant guarding or rebound tenderness. Your blood pressure is elevated – 160 over 90. Temperature is normal at 98.6. Given your symptoms – vomiting blood, dark stools, fatigue, paleness, abdominal pain, and elevated blood pressure – and your history, I'm concerned about a possible upper gastrointestinal bleed. It could be caused by a number of things – an ulcer, gastritis, or even something more serious. We need to investigate further. I'm going to order some blood tests to check your hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, which will tell us how much blood you've lost. I also want to order a stool test to confirm the presence of blood. And I think we need to get an endoscopy – a procedure where we insert a thin, flexible tube with a camera into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum to look for the source of the bleeding. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An endoscopy? You mean stickin' a camera down my throat? Look, doc, I don't like the sound of any of that. Isn't there somethin' else? Pills? Something? I really don't fancy havin' a camera poked around inside me. And blood tests are fine, I suppose, but… an endoscopy? What are the risks?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Brad. An endoscopy doesn’t sound pleasant, and it’s natural to be worried. However, it’s the best way to find out exactly what’s causing your bleeding and to stop it. Regarding risks, they are generally low. There's a small chance of bleeding, perforation – a tear in the lining of your esophagus, stomach, or duodenum – and a very small risk of infection. We take precautions to minimize these risks, and we’ll be monitoring you closely throughout the procedure. As for alternatives… we could try medication to reduce the stomach acid and see if that helps, but without knowing the source of the bleed, it’s like shooting in the dark. And if the bleeding continues, we’ll end up back where we started, potentially with a more serious situation. Given your symptoms and the severity of the potential underlying cause, I strongly recommend proceeding with the endoscopy. We can discuss the procedure in more detail, and I'll be happy to answer any questions you have. Would you like me to explain it in more detail?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But you gotta promise me you’ll be careful. I don’t want no holes poked in me. And what about… the cost? I ain’t got insurance, you know. My wife…she handled all that stuff. I don’t want a huge bill showin’ up.
DOCTOR: I promise we’ll take every precaution to ensure your safety, Brad. We have experienced endoscopists, and we'll be monitoring you closely throughout the procedure. Regarding the cost, that’s a valid concern. Because you are uninsured, the cost can be significant. Let me talk to our billing department and see what options are available. We may be able to offer a discount or a payment plan. I also know of some local resources that may be able to help with the cost of medical care. I’ll get you some information about those as well. In the meantime, I'm going to order the blood tests right away. We’ll need a sample from you. And then, we can schedule the endoscopy as soon as possible. Do you have any allergies to any medications, as we may need to use some sedation during the procedure?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any trouble with anythin’ like that. Just… get it over with, doc. I ain’t got time for this. I got things to do. Let’s just… get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brad. I understand. Let's get you down to the lab for those blood tests, and then we’ll talk about scheduling the endoscopy. A nurse will come in shortly to take you down. And I’ll have the information about payment options and local resources for you as soon as possible. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?
PATIENT: Nah. Just… try not to poke any holes. And keep the bill down, if you can. That’s all. Let's just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brad. I will do my best. A nurse will be with you in just a moment to take you to the lab. I'll be here when you get back.
PATIENT: .
