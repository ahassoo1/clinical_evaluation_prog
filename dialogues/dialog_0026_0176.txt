DOCTOR: Good morning, Ivette. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it's these hiccups. They just won’t stop! It's been… oh, let me think… more than two days now, I think. It’s really getting annoying.
DOCTOR: More than two days, alright. That is quite persistent. And annoying, I can imagine. Can you tell me a bit more about them?
PATIENT: Well, they started… hmm… Tuesday, I believe. I was having lunch with a friend, just a normal sandwich, nothing fancy, and then hic… one started. And it just hasn't gone away since. They come and go, you know? Not constantly, but several times an hour, easily. And they’re… pretty strong, actually. It makes it hard to talk sometimes. See?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. Strong hiccups can be very disruptive. And Tuesday… that's a few days now. You said you were having lunch with a friend when they started – did anything unusual happen during lunch?
PATIENT: Unusual? Not really… we were just chatting, catching up. Oh! Wait… she ordered that really spicy sauce with her fries. It smelled very strong, even I could smell it. I didn’t have any myself, but she used a lot. Maybe that had something to do with it? I don't know. It's a bit of a stretch, isn't it? But it was the only different thing that happened.
DOCTOR: It's not a stretch at all, actually. Sometimes irritation can trigger hiccups. It's good you’re thinking through possible causes. Now, aside from the hiccups, have you noticed anything else going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I’ve been a little… tired, maybe? But honestly, I’m always a little tired. It’s probably just work. I manage a small entertainment center, you know? Lots of things going on. No fever, no stomach pain, no heartburn… just the hiccups. And the annoyance, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness but nothing else significant. No fever, no stomach upset. And you manage an entertainment center – that sounds busy. Now, have you tried anything to get rid of them yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Everything people told me, really. Holding my breath, drinking water quickly, getting someone to scare me… you know, the usual tricks. None of it worked. My friend even tried to startle me, but it just made her laugh, not me stop hiccuping! It’s really frustrating.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you've tried quite a few things. And it's good to know they haven't been responding. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat, just to rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Go ahead, please. Hopefully, you can figure out what's going on. These hiccups are driving me mad!
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just take a deep breath in and out for me, that would be great. Breathing sounds clear… heart rate is normal. Throat looks clear as well, no signs of irritation or infection. Now, can you try to swallow?
PATIENT: Like that? It doesn’t really feel… different. Just normal swallowing, I guess. Honestly, Doctor, I feel perfectly healthy other than these hiccups. It’s just… so weird! It’s like my body is doing this on purpose.
DOCTOR: Everything does seem normal, physically. That's good. And I understand your frustration – when things don’t have an obvious cause, it can be very unsettling. Now, have you had hiccups this persistent before?
PATIENT: No, never. I get hiccups sometimes, like anyone, but they always go away quickly. Usually after a glass of water or something. But never for this long. It’s… concerning, actually. Is it something serious, Doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re voicing your concerns, Ivette. Persistent hiccups can be a sign of something underlying, though it’s often nothing serious. Prolonged hiccups – and more than 48 hours is considered prolonged – can sometimes be related to nerve irritation, metabolic imbalances, or, rarely, more serious conditions. However, given your otherwise normal exam and lack of other symptoms, I’m not overly concerned at this point. I would like to run a few basic blood tests, just to rule out any metabolic issues and get a baseline. We can check your electrolytes, kidney function, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. If it will rule things out, then yes, please go ahead. I’d rather be safe than sorry, especially if it’s something I can easily fix. Electrolytes, kidney function… okay. Where do we go from there? Will I need to come back another day for the results?
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll need a little bit of blood, just a standard draw. And yes, you'll need to come back another day to discuss the results, usually within a week. In the meantime, let's focus on some supportive care. Continue to drink plenty of fluids, and try to avoid anything that seems to trigger the hiccups, if you can identify any. If they become significantly worse – if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or if you start vomiting – please seek immediate medical attention. But for now, let’s get these tests done and see what they tell us. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a good plan. Avoid triggers, drink fluids, come back next week… and seek help if it gets worse. Okay, I can do that. Thank you, Doctor Finco. I feel much better knowing we’re actually looking into it. Where do I go to get the blood tests done?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ivette. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease a bit. Here is a lab request. You can get the blood tests done at the lab just across the street, at 123 Main Street. They are open until 5 PM today. Just bring this form and your insurance card, if you have one. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Insurance… Oh, never mind. I don’t have insurance, sadly. That’s alright, though. I’ll just pay out of pocket. 123 Main Street, got it. Thank you again, Doctor Finco. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ivette. Don't worry about the insurance; the lab will work with you on payment options. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Get well soon, and I’ll see you next week.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
