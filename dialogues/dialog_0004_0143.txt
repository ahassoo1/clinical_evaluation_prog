DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um… well, it’s a bit… complicated. My, uh, my daughter, she’s thinking about having a baby. And she asked me to come. Something about… making sure everything is okay first? I don’t really know much about it, to be honest. I just want to be helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, your daughter wants you to have a medical evaluation before she attempts to conceive. That’s… unusual, but not unheard of. We want to make sure there aren’t any inherited conditions or factors on your side that could potentially affect a pregnancy or the baby’s health. It’s a responsible, if somewhat… roundabout, approach. Let's start with you, Mr. Verrall. Could you tell me about your overall health?
PATIENT: My health… hmm. Well, I’m… sixty-six. Things are starting to ache a bit, you know? Nothing serious. I try to walk when I can. I used to be a Sales Engineer, traveling a lot, but I’m… retired now. Just taking it easy. I don't really go to the doctor much. When something really bothers me, I… well, I deal with it. I don't have any big illnesses that I know of.
DOCTOR: "Taking it easy" and "dealing with it" aren't exactly a comprehensive medical history, Mr. Verrall. We need specifics. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High blood pressure… I think the doctor mentioned something about that, years ago. Maybe. He gave me a pill, I think. I stopped taking it after a while, it made me feel… funny. No diabetes, I don't think. My wife, she had… something with her sugar, but not me. Heart… I had some chest pains once, but it went away. It was just stress, probably. All that traveling, you know? I really don’t remember much about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, potentially a history of hypertension, poorly controlled, and a vague report of chest pain. We'll need to address both of those. And before we go further, have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything other than the chest pain?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was a boy. And… I broke my arm once, when I was playing football. They put a cast on it. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. Hospitalized… hmm. Not that I recall. Maybe for the arm? It was a long time ago. I honestly don’t remember the details, Doctor. Everything is a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications… right now, I take a pill for my water. The doctor said my kidneys weren’t working as well as they used to. And… sometimes I take something for my aches and pains. Just over-the-counter, you know? Ibuprofen, or something like that. Nothing regular. The water pill is the only thing I take every day. Oh! And vitamins. My daughter makes me take vitamins.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a diuretic – that’s the water pill – daily, and ibuprofen as needed. Vitamins, per daughter’s insistence. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I don’t break out in rashes or anything. Sometimes my eyes get a bit itchy in the spring, but I think that’s just the pollen. Nothing serious. I eat everything. My wife, she was allergic to… shellfish, I think. But not me. I've never had a problem with anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Verrall. Now, let's talk about your family. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… family. My father… he had heart problems, I think. He died when he was… not very old. My mother… she lived a long time, but she had… arthritis, maybe? Bad joints, anyway. My brother… he was healthy as a horse. He didn’t have any problems. My sister… she had… I don’t remember. It was something with her… stomach, I think. It was a long time ago. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not very good with remembering these things. Everyone lived to be… old enough, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, before we move on to a physical exam, can you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, like I said, I’m retired. I mostly stay home. I watch TV. I read the newspaper. Sometimes I go for a walk, but not very far. I used to travel a lot with my job, but not anymore. I don't drink much. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. I don’t smoke. Never have. Pretty quiet life, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Verrall. Thank you for that information. It’s… a starting point. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam. Just routine things – checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I trust your judgment. Go ahead. I hope I’m not too much trouble. My memory isn’t what it used to be, so if I forget something, just tell me.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could sit up here for me, please. Let's start with your blood pressure. I’ll need to remove your sleeve. Blood pressure is a little elevated. We’ll discuss that. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Okay. Heart sounds are regular, but there's a slight murmur. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. A little tenderness in the upper right area, but nothing alarming. Alright, that’s a basic examination. Based on this initial assessment, Mr. Verrall, there are a few things we need to address. Your blood pressure is elevated, and we need to investigate the cause. The murmur requires further evaluation. And given your history, we’ll want to run some blood tests to get a clearer picture of your kidney function and overall health. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. Blood tests… and murmurs… I just wanted to help my daughter. I didn’t expect all this. Is it… serious, Doctor? Should I be worried? I really don’t like going to the doctor, you see.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, it’s understandable to be concerned. However, "complicated" doesn’t necessarily mean "serious." Elevated blood pressure, if left untreated, can lead to serious health problems – heart attack, stroke, kidney damage – but it’s often manageable with medication and lifestyle changes. The murmur needs to be investigated to determine its cause and potential impact. It could be harmless, or it could indicate a valve problem. We’re not making any diagnoses at this point. We’re gathering information. We’ll run some blood tests – a complete metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a CBC – to assess your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and overall blood health. I’ll also order an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm and an echocardiogram to get a closer look at your heart structure and function. These tests will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: EKG… echocardiogram… oh dear. That sounds like a lot. I don’t even know what those are. And I don’t really understand about cholesterol or… metabolic panels. It’s all a bit… overwhelming, Doctor. Will they hurt? I really don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Alright, let me explain. An EKG – or electrocardiogram – is a simple, painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. We simply place a few small stickers – electrodes – on your chest, arms, and legs. It doesn't involve needles. It takes only a few minutes. A metabolic panel is a blood test that checks the levels of various substances in your blood, including glucose, electrolytes, and kidney function markers. It will require a blood draw – yes, that does involve a needle – but it's a routine procedure. We’ll minimize any discomfort. And a lipid panel measures your cholesterol levels – again, a blood draw. We need to get this information, Mr. Verrall, to determine the best course of action. It's not about scaring you, it’s about being thorough. Would you like me to explain each test in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. Stickers aren’t so bad. But the needles… I really don't like needles. Is there… is there any way to avoid them? Maybe just… take some pills instead? My daughter always says pills fix everything.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verrall, while medication can be very effective in managing certain conditions, we can’t simply assume what’s going on and start taking pills. That would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous. We need to know your baseline kidney function, your cholesterol levels, and the underlying cause of the murmur before we can determine the appropriate treatment plan. The blood draw is necessary to obtain this information. I understand your aversion to needles, and we’ll do everything we can to make the process as comfortable as possible. The phlebotomist is very skilled, and we can use a topical anesthetic to numb the area beforehand. Furthermore, we can discuss potential alternatives to manage your blood pressure – lifestyle modifications like diet and exercise – after we have the results of the blood tests. But we can’t proceed without them. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… I suppose you’re right. I don't want to make things worse. And I do trust your judgment, Doctor. It’s just… I’ve never been good with hospitals and doctors and… all that. All right. Blood tests, then. What do I need to do? When do I get them? And… will it hurt a lot?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verrall. I’ll write you a lab order for the blood tests. You can go to the lab at Suburban General Hospital – it's conveniently located on Main Street. You don’t need an appointment, but it’s best to go in the morning before you eat or drink anything – a fasting blood draw. As for the discomfort, it’s usually minimal. You might feel a brief pinch when the needle goes in, but it’s over quickly. The phlebotomist will use a small needle and will be as gentle as possible. They will also provide you with a bandage afterward to protect the site. I’ll also schedule an appointment for you with a cardiologist for the echocardiogram. They’ll call you to arrange a time that’s convenient. Once you have the blood test results, I’d like to see you again to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. That sounds… manageable. Suburban General, in the morning, no food. And they’ll call me about the… echo… thing. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. I still don’t understand much of it, but… it’s good to know someone is looking after things.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Verrall. That’s my job. Remember, if you have any questions or concerns between now and your next appointment, don't hesitate to call the office. And try not to worry too much. We’ll take things one step at a time. Here’s the lab order and a pamphlet explaining the tests in more detail. I’ll also have my nurse schedule the cardiology appointment for you before you leave. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I just hope these tests don’t show anything too bad. I really just want to help my daughter.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verrall. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of things. Remember, early detection is key. Don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much. The nurse will be right with you to schedule your cardiology appointment. .
