DOCTOR: “Hi Annelle, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, well… it’s my skin, you see. It’s gotten… quite yellow. Not a good color at all. And I’ve been feeling… poorly. It’s something about my liver, I believe? The young man at the front desk mentioned something… but my memory isn’t what it used to be. I just want to get this sorted quickly, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: “Of course, Annelle. We’ll get this sorted. Yellowing of the skin – that’s what we call jaundice – can definitely be concerning, and it's good you came in to get it checked out. And feeling poorly is vague, but important. We’ll figure out what's going on. Let’s start with a bit more detail about how you’ve been feeling. When did you first notice the yellowing of your skin?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did I first notice? That’s… difficult. It feels like weeks, maybe a month? It was gradual, not sudden. I thought it was just the lighting at first, you understand. Old age does strange things to your eyes. And feeling poorly… just tired, mostly. And a bit of discomfort… around my stomach, I suppose. Not sharp pain, just… uneasy. I truly wish I could be more precise, Doctor. I apologize.
DOCTOR: “No need to apologize at all, Annelle. It’s perfectly understandable. Memory can be tricky, and a gradual change is harder to pinpoint. So, about a month ago, you started noticing the yellowing, and you've been feeling tired and have some general discomfort in your stomach. Is the tiredness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's… mostly constant, I think. Though some days are worse than others, naturally. Mornings are the hardest. I struggle to get out of bed. And even after I do, I feel… drained. Like I haven’t slept at all. It doesn't really improve much throughout the day, to be honest. Just a… dull weariness. I haven’t been doing much, admittedly. It’s too hot to be active.
DOCTOR: “Okay, constant tiredness, worse in the mornings. That’s helpful. And you haven’t been doing much activity because of the heat, which makes sense. Now, about that discomfort in your stomach… can you describe it a little more?
PATIENT: Oh… it’s not a pain, really. More like a… fullness? And a bit of pressure. Especially after I eat. Not every meal, but most. It’s… uncomfortable, but I wouldn’t call it agonizing. It just feels… heavy. And sometimes… a little nauseous, perhaps? But I haven’t actually been sick. I hope that makes sense. It's a very vague feeling, Doctor. I'm terribly sorry for not being more helpful.
DOCTOR: “You’re being perfectly helpful, Annelle. It’s good you’re describing it as vague, because that tells me something. Fullness, pressure after eating, sometimes a little nausea… all right. Have you noticed any changes in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh… my stool? Goodness. I… I haven’t paid much attention, if I'm honest. Old ladies don't discuss such things. But… now that you mention it… it seems paler than usual, perhaps? And… softer. But I could be imagining things. Really, Doctor, I try not to look. It's unpleasant.
DOCTOR: “No need to be embarrassed, Annelle. It’s very important information, and you’re doing great just by telling me. Paler and softer stools are definitely something we need to consider. Okay. And have you noticed any itching anywhere on your skin?
PATIENT: Itching? Hmm… not particularly. My skin is dry, naturally. Old age, you know. I use lotion, but it doesn’t seem to help much. But actual itching… no, I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed. Sometimes a little discomfort, but not proper itching. I hope that’s useful. I really would like to get this sorted out, Doctor. I have… commitments.
DOCTOR: “It is useful, Annelle, thank you. Dry skin is common, and we can certainly address that. So, no significant itching. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a difficult question. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. I’ve seen many doctors over the years. I believe I had… something with my gallbladder, many years ago. But it was treated, and I don’t recall the details. And… I had a touch of pneumonia once, but that was decades ago. Mostly, I’ve just been… resilient. I haven’t been a frequent visitor to hospitals, if that’s any consolation. I truly don’t remember specifics, I’m afraid. It's a rather hazy past.
DOCTOR: “That’s perfectly alright, Annelle. We can work with what you remember. Something with your gallbladder a long time ago and a bout of pneumonia. We'll try to get records if possible, but that's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I believe I had my appendix removed when I was quite young. A very common thing, I was told. And… possibly some minor things for cataracts, as I got older. But nothing major, I assure you. It was a very long time ago, and the details are… blurry. I apologize for not being more precise, Doctor. I wish I could offer more assistance.
DOCTOR: “No need to apologize at all, Annelle. Appendix removal and cataract surgery. That's very helpful. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. Family… That’s a complicated question. My mother… she had… something with her heart, I believe. But she passed away many years ago. And my brother… he had diabetes, I think. But he lived far away, and we didn’t keep in close contact. It was a very large family, and I don’t recall the specifics of everyone’s ailments. A rather… distant past, I'm afraid. I truly wish I could be more helpful, Doctor. It’s just… so long ago.
DOCTOR: “That’s alright, Annelle. Heart condition in your mother and diabetes in your brother. We’ll note that. Now, just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Let me see. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medication, as far as I recall. But… I haven’t taken many medications over the years. Just the occasional pain reliever for arthritis, and some vitamins. I don't recall any specific allergies to food or anything else, either. But… I suppose it's possible. My memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s a rather hazy past, I'm afraid. I truly wish I could offer more assistance. This is exhausting, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “You’re doing wonderfully, Annelle. No known allergies. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… just the vitamins, I believe. A multivitamin, mostly. And sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it’s particularly bad. But it's just an over-the-counter pain reliever, nothing prescribed. I don’t really take much, I assure you. I prefer natural remedies, when possible. But… I’m not very good at remembering names, I'm afraid. It's a rather hazy past, I’m afraid. I truly wish I could offer more assistance. Is this almost over, Doctor? I’m rather tired now.
DOCTOR: “Yes, Annelle, we’re almost finished. Just a few more moments. Multivitamin and over-the-counter pain reliever for arthritis. That’s very helpful. Okay. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. But please be gentle, if you don’t mind. My old bones aren’t what they used to be. And… please don’t take too long. I have… commitments. I truly wish I could be more helpful, but I’m rather tired now. Let’s just get this sorted quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: “Of course, Annelle. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We’ll take our time. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. But my breathing isn’t very good, you know. I get… winded easily. And my heart… it sometimes flutters. It’s just old age, I suppose. But please, be quick. I truly wish this was over. It's exhausting, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “Alright, Annelle. Your heart sounds a bit fast, and I can hear a slight murmur. Your lungs sound a little diminished, but clear. I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Please tell me if anything feels painful. I'm just checking for tenderness or any masses.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… uncomfortable. It’s not painful, exactly. Just… sensitive. It’s always been a bit tender, to be honest. I believe it’s just… gas. And maybe a bit of constipation. Old age, you know. Everything slows down. Please be gentle, Doctor. It's rather unsettling. I truly wish this was over. This is exhausting.
DOCTOR: “Alright, Annelle. I do feel some firmness in your upper abdomen, particularly on the right side. It’s not sharply painful, but you’re right, it’s tender. Now, I'm just going to look at your skin again. As you mentioned, there is definite jaundice present. And your skin does feel a bit dry. I don’t see any rash or other concerning changes. “Okay, Annelle. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, I’m concerned about the jaundice and the tenderness in your abdomen. It could be a number of things, but it sounds like there may be an issue with your liver or gallbladder.”
PATIENT: Oh dear. My liver… I suspected as much. But what does that mean, Doctor? What’s going to happen? Is it serious? I truly wish I hadn’t come. This is all very upsetting. Please, just tell me… what are my options? And how long is this going to take? I have… commitments, you know. I need to know. I truly wish I could be more helpful, but I'm exhausted now.
DOCTOR: “I understand your concern, Annelle. It’s definitely unsettling to hear something might be wrong, and I’ll do my best to explain everything clearly. Jaundice, as we discussed, means there’s a buildup of bilirubin in your blood, which causes the yellowing of the skin. That can happen for many reasons. It could be a blockage of the bile ducts, inflammation of the liver, or even certain medications. Given your history and the tenderness in your abdomen, I'm concerned it might be a gallbladder issue or something affecting your liver. To figure out exactly what’s going on, we need to do some further testing. I’d like to order some blood tests to check your liver function, bilirubin levels, and other markers. I also think a scan of your abdomen – either an ultrasound or a CT scan – would be helpful to visualize your liver and gallbladder. These tests will help us determine the cause of the jaundice and the extent of any liver or gallbladder problems. Depending on the results, we may need to consult a gastroenterologist – a specialist in digestive health – for further evaluation. I know this is a lot to take in, and I understand you’re concerned about time. We’ll get these tests scheduled as quickly as possible. The blood tests can be done right here in the clinic, and the scan can usually be scheduled within a few days. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh dear… scans and specialists… It’s all so… overwhelming. Will these tests be painful? And expensive? I… I don’t have insurance, you see. I truly wish I hadn't come. And… what if it’s serious? What if it’s… cancer? I’ve heard such terrible stories. Please, Doctor, just tell me… what are the chances? And how long will it take to get the results? I have… commitments, you know. And I truly wish I could be more helpful, but I'm exhausted now. This is all very upsetting.
DOCTOR: “I understand your concerns, Annelle. It’s perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed and anxious when facing uncertainty. Let’s address your questions one by one. The blood tests are very straightforward – just a small sample of blood taken from your arm. They shouldn’t be painful at all, just a brief pinch. As for the scan, it’s non-invasive – you’ll lie on a table, and a technician will use sound waves or X-rays to create images of your abdomen. It shouldn't be painful either, but you may need to drink some fluids beforehand. Regarding the cost, I understand you don't have insurance. We do have a financial assistance program here at the clinic, and we can explore options to help reduce the burden. We can also discuss which tests are absolutely essential to start with, to keep costs down. Now, about the possibility of cancer… It’s important not to jump to conclusions. Jaundice can be caused by many things, and cancer is just one possibility. We need to do the tests to get a clear diagnosis before we can know for sure. It’s too early to worry about that right now. As for how long it will take to get the results, the blood tests usually come back within a few days. The scan results may take a little longer, depending on the radiologist’s schedule. We’ll do our best to get them back to you as quickly as possible. I will personally follow up with you as soon as I have them. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests scheduled. And please, don’t hesitate to ask any questions you have along the way. We’re here to support you through this. Do you want me to help you schedule those tests now?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you insist. But please, make it quick. And as inexpensive as possible. I truly wish I hadn't come, but… I suppose I have no choice now. Here. This is my information. And… please, don’t tell me anything terrible. I’m not sure I could handle it. I have… commitments, you know. And I truly wish I could be more helpful, but I'm exhausted now. Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: “Of course, Annelle. I understand. I will do everything I can to make this as quick and easy as possible, and I promise to be honest and compassionate every step of the way. Okay, I’m scheduling the blood tests for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. They’ll just need a small sample, and it shouldn’t take long. And I’m also scheduling an ultrasound for Monday afternoon at 2:00 PM. The technician will let you know what to expect beforehand. I’ve also made a note for our billing department to contact you about the financial assistance program. They’ll go over your options and see what assistance is available. Here's a printout with all the information. You can also find it in the patient portal. For now, just try to rest and take care of yourself. We’ll get these tests done, and then we’ll have a better idea of what’s going on. And remember, I’m here to support you through this. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. I just… want to go home now. I truly wish I hadn't come. This is all so… upsetting. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. But please… don’t expect me to be cheerful. I have… commitments, you know. And I truly wish I could be more helpful, but I'm exhausted now. Good day.
DOCTOR: “Of course, Annelle. You take care of yourself. I understand this is difficult, and you don’t need to be cheerful. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. .
