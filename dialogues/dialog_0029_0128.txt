DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Voner. I’m Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Hmm… let me think. It’s my joints, mostly. They get really stiff in the mornings. It’s… well, it’s been happening for a while now. Not terrible, just… annoying, you know? It takes a bit for them to loosen up.
DOCTOR: Okay, “annoying” is good to know. And you said this has been going on for a while… roughly how long would you say?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a while… I really don’t keep track of those things very well. Maybe… six months? A year? It feels like a long time, honestly. It's not new, that's for sure. I just thought it would go away on its own, but it hasn't.
DOCTOR: Alright, six months to a year. And is it all your joints, or are some worse than others?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My knees bother me the most, I think. And my hands, when I’m trying to… well, when I’m doing things with them! Like, opening jars is harder than it used to be. My shoulders feel a little stiff too, but not as bad as the knees. It’s just… makes everything a little more effort, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, knees and hands being the most affected. And you mentioned it takes effort… is there any pain associated with it?
PATIENT: Pain… not really pain, exactly. More like… a dull ache? And a lot of creaking. It sounds awful, honestly! Like an old house. It doesn’t keep me up at night or anything, but it’s definitely there when I move. Especially in the mornings, like I said. I don't think it's bad pain, just...uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache and creaking, worse in the mornings. Have you noticed any swelling in your knees or hands?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. Sometimes my knees feel a little bigger, maybe? But I put that down to… well, I don't know. I’m a bit bigger these days, so it’s hard to tell. No real swelling, I don't think. Definitely not like a big bump or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant swelling. And have you tried anything to help with it – over-the-counter pain relievers, creams, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! My daughter, Eleni, she gave me some… pills, I think? White ones. I took them for a bit, but they didn’t seem to do much, honestly. And I use this lotion sometimes, for my hands, but it mostly just smells nice. I can't remember the names of anything these days… Eleni knows. She's very good with those things.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll try to figure out what those pills were later. And just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history… that’s a long time ago. I had… the usual, I suppose. Childhood things. Flu, colds. Nothing major. My husband, Dimitri… he had some heart trouble, a long time ago. I… I don’t really remember much else. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Just for checkups, mostly. Nothing serious. I'm not a sickly person, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any surgeries or hospitalizations you recall?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a very long time ago! That’s all I can really remember. And I was in the hospital when I had my first baby, Eleni, of course. But that wasn't a surgery, just… having a baby! I’ve been very lucky, really. No serious illnesses or anything like that. Just getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child, and delivery of your daughter, Eleni. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Dimitri, my husband, he passed away about ten years ago now. It was a shock, poor man. Eleni, my daughter, she’s doing very well. Lives in the city with her husband and two children. Wonderful girl. And… I had a brother, but he lives in Greece. We don’t see each other much. He's healthy, I think. We write letters sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. And did anyone in your family have arthritis, or any similar joint problems?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. Hmm… my grandmother, on my mother’s side… she had some trouble with her hands, I think. Always complaining about them being stiff and achy. But I don’t know if it was… arthritis, exactly. She just said she had “old lady hands”. Everyone did, back then! My brother, maybe? He’s always been very active, so he had a few injuries, but nothing like this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just a couple more questions, then we'll do a quick exam. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… I don't think so. I haven’t had any problems with any medicines before. Eleni always checks, though, she's very careful. But as far as I know, no allergies. I get a bit of a sniffle with dust, but that's not an allergy, is it? Just the dust!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter things or vitamins?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Just that lotion for my hands, like I said. And… sometimes I take a little something for my stomach, when it’s upset. But it's not regular, just when I need it. I can't remember the name, though. Eleni buys it for me. Nothing else, really. Just the lotion and… the stomach pills, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Voner, thank you for that information. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what's going on with your joints. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. I trust your judgment. Go ahead. It’s all just a bit… stiff, you know. But I'm sure you'll figure it out.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Voner, I'm just going to gently feel around your knees. Let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Oh, that's...a little tender, yes. Not sharp pain, just... a dull ache, like you said. It's worse when you press down like that, though. It feels a bit… warm, maybe? I don't know. It's hard to tell. It doesn't feel swollen, though, does it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And your right knee feels similar. Now, let’s take a look at your hands. Can you open and close your hands for me, please?
PATIENT: There we go... It’s a bit… stiff, you see? Especially when I first get up in the morning. It’s hard to make a fist. And it feels a little achy when I squeeze. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. Just… uncomfortable. It feels a bit creaky, too. Like an old door.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to gently move your wrists, elbows, and shoulders. Let me know if anything causes you pain. Any discomfort with this movement?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a little stiff, yes. Not painful, just… restricted. Like it needs a bit of oiling, you know? It doesn’t hurt, but it doesn’t move as easily as it used to. It feels… tight. Especially in the mornings, it’s much worse.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Voner. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you likely have osteoarthritis. It’s a common condition, especially as we get older. It’s caused by wear and tear on the joints. It's not something that will go away completely, but there are ways to manage it and make you more comfortable.
PATIENT: Oh… osteoarthritis? Is that… bad? Wear and tear, you say? I’ve been doing things all my life… I haven’t been sitting around! But… if it’s just wear and tear, is there anything you can do about it? I don’t want to be stuck like this forever, you know? I just want to be able to open a jar without struggling!
DOCTOR: It's not bad in the sense that it’s not life-threatening, Ms. Voner. It's a chronic condition, meaning it's long-lasting, but we can definitely manage the symptoms. There are several things we can try. First, we can focus on lifestyle modifications. That means things like staying active – gentle exercise like walking or swimming can help keep your joints mobile and strengthen the muscles around them. Losing even a little bit of weight can also reduce the stress on your knees. We can also consider over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help with the pain and inflammation. I can recommend specific dosages. And there are also topical creams you can use. If those aren't enough, we can discuss prescription medications or even injections. But let’s start with the simpler things first. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… reasonable. Gentle exercise… I used to walk a lot, before… well, before Dimitri passed. I could probably manage that. And losing a bit of weight wouldn't hurt, I suppose. I do enjoy a good sweet, though! Acetaminophen and ibuprofen… I think those are the pills Eleni gave me? They didn't seem to do much, but maybe I didn't take them long enough. And topical creams… that sounds nice. Something to rub on, at least! So… let’s start with the walking and the pills, then? And maybe I’ll ask Eleni about the dosage. She's very good with those things. Is that alright, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that sounds like a good plan, Ms. Voner. Start with the walking and the over-the-counter pain relievers. I recommend walking for 30 minutes most days of the week, if you can. As for the pain relievers, you can take acetaminophen 500mg every 6 hours as needed, but no more than 3000mg in a 24-hour period. Ibuprofen, 200-400mg every 4-6 hours as needed, but no more than 1200mg in a 24-hour period. It’s important to take them with food to avoid stomach upset. And if you don't see any improvement after a couple of weeks, or if your pain gets worse, please let me know. I’m going to write you a handout with all of this information, including some exercises you can try. I also recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment in about a month to see how you’re doing. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very thoughtful, Doctor. A handout… that’s perfect! I always forget things, you know. And a follow-up appointment… yes, that’s a good idea. I’d like to know if it’s actually helping, or if I’m just… walking in circles! A month sounds good. And thank you… for explaining everything so clearly. It’s not as scary as I thought. Is there anything else I should be doing? Anything I should avoid? I don't want to make it worse, you know.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Voner. Glad I could put your mind at ease. As for things to avoid… try to avoid activities that put a lot of stress on your knees, like heavy lifting or high-impact exercises. And if you’re doing something that causes pain, stop immediately. Listen to your body. It will tell you what it can and can’t handle. Maintaining a healthy weight is also important, as we discussed. And finally, try to stay positive. Managing a chronic condition can be challenging, but it’s not impossible. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything so well! I'll try to be good and listen to my body, and I’ll ask Eleni about the pills. And I’ll definitely try to walk more. I think that’s all. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your kindness. It’s nice to know someone is listening.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Voner. I’m glad I could help. And remember, if you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here to support you. Here’s that handout with the exercises and medication information. And I’ll see you in a month. Have a good day, Ms. Voner.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too. I will see you next month.
