DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s about this…problem. It's been going on for weeks now, and nothing seems to help. I've tried… things. I don't really want to go into details, but it's just…constant. And embarrassing. Can we just get right to figuring out how to stop it?
DOCTOR: I understand you’d like to get straight to a solution, Ms. Woodring, and I appreciate your directness. However, to properly assist you – and ensure I don’t miss anything important – I do need some details. "Constant" and "embarrassing" are not diagnoses, unfortunately. Could you perhaps describe the problem itself?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. It's…diarrhea. Okay? Constant diarrhea. I’ve had it for, like, three weeks. Maybe a little longer. I’ve tried those things you can buy at the store – Imodium, Pepto-Bismol, all of it. They work for, like, an hour, maybe, and then it’s back. Worse, even. I really don't want to talk about what I've been eating, or where I've been. Is that enough detail for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Woodring, “diarrhea” is certainly more specific. Three weeks is a considerable duration. And it's good you’ve attempted over-the-counter remedies, though as you've noted, their limited effect isn't surprising after this length of time. To better understand what might be causing this, let’s go through a bit of a review. Firstly, are you experiencing any fever, abdominal pain, nausea, or vomiting alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: No fever. My stomach… it cramps sometimes. Not terrible, just…uncomfortable. And I’ve felt a little queasy a few times, but haven't actually thrown up. Look, I’m a painter. I’m on ladders, I’m bending over, I’m around dust and fumes all day. It’s probably something I’m breathing in or something. I really doubt it's anything serious. Can we just get a prescription for something stronger?
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your assessment, Ms. Woodring, dismissing a three-week case of diarrhea as simply something “you’re breathing in” is rather…optimistic. Ladders, dust, and fumes certainly could contribute, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Regarding your symptoms, can you describe the abdominal cramps?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. They're…all over, really. Like, my whole stomach hurts, not just one spot. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s just a dull ache, and sometimes it feels like… knots. And it’s worse after… well, you know. After it happens. Is that specific enough for you? Honestly, I'm starting to feel ridiculous talking about this. I have work to get back to.
DOCTOR: "All over" and "knots" are helpful, Ms. Woodring, thank you. It does sound generalized. And I understand your discomfort, truly. However, I need a complete picture. Now, let's discuss your bowel movements. Besides the increased frequency, have you noticed any changes in the appearance of your stool?
PATIENT: Ugh. Seriously? You need to know about the… the details of that too? Look, it's… watery. That's it. Very watery. Sometimes there's… stuff in it. I'm not going to elaborate. It’s just… not normal. Is that enough information? I’m a practical person. I deal with paint, not… this. I really need to get back to work. This is wasting my time, and frankly, it's a little demeaning.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, while I appreciate your pragmatism, your reluctance to provide details is hindering my ability to provide adequate care. "Watery" is a start, but changes in stool consistency and the presence of "stuff" – as you put it – can be quite telling. To be clear, I'm not attempting to be deliberately invasive. I simply need to gather sufficient information to determine the cause of your symptoms. Have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Are you trying to gross me out? No! There is not blood or mucus. I would know if there was. I'm not completely oblivious. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I came here for a quick fix, not a… a colonoscopy interview. Just give me something that will stop it, and let me go back to work. My clients are waiting. I really don't have time for this. I think I'm done answering questions.
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I understand your frustration. However, given the duration of your symptoms and your limited willingness to provide essential information, a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan are difficult, if not impossible, to establish at this time. I’m concerned that dismissing this as simply something you’re exposed to at work is potentially dangerous. We need to rule out infectious causes, inflammatory bowel conditions, and other possibilities. Given your reluctance to cooperate with a thorough examination and history-taking, I recommend a referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation. They are best equipped to perform the necessary tests and provide specialized care. Would you like me to arrange that for you?
PATIENT: A gastroenterologist? Absolutely not. Look, I appreciate your…concern, but I think I'll just deal with it on my own. I've got things to do. Thanks for nothing. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Woodring. However, I must strongly advise you that delaying proper diagnosis and treatment could lead to complications. If your symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop – such as fever, severe abdominal pain, or signs of dehydration – please seek immediate medical attention. Here is a list of local gastroenterologists, should you change your mind. . Have a good day. .
