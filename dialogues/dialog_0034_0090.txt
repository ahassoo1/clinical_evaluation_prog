DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Brightful. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, I’m here for a check-up before a surgery. A cosmetic one, that is. To be cleared, you understand. It's… a bit difficult to recall all the specifics, honestly. My husband… he arranged everything.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Brightful. It's common to feel that way when someone else handles the arrangements. We'll take things at your pace. So, you're here for pre-operative clearance for a cosmetic surgery. Do you recall what type of surgery it is, if that’s alright to share?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. It’s… face-lifting, I believe? Though, honestly, it feels like a very long time ago when we discussed it. He… my husband… he wanted me to feel better about myself, you see. I suppose I just… trusted him to choose something suitable. Is that… strange? I don't mean to be vague, it’s just… my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Not strange at all, Ms. Brightful. It's very thoughtful of your husband, and it's completely understandable to rely on him for details, especially if it was some time ago. We'll go through everything together and make sure you're comfortable and well-informed. To start, could you tell me about your general health?
PATIENT: Certainly. Um… I believe I’m generally quite healthy. I try to eat well – lots of fruits and vegetables, you know? And I… I do a fair bit of gardening, actually. It’s… very therapeutic. As for any illnesses… I had the flu a couple of times, naturally, and a bad cold last winter, but nothing serious. No chronic conditions, if that’s what you mean. I do get a bit tired sometimes, but I attributed that to the work. Oh! And I had my gallbladder removed about five years ago, I think.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Brightful. Gardening is excellent – good for both the body and the mind. And thank you for letting me know about your gallbladder removal. That's important information. Do you recall approximately when you had that surgery – the month and year, if possible?
PATIENT: Oh dear… the month and year… that's… difficult. It was definitely… summer, I think. It was very hot. And… maybe 2020? Or was it 2019? It feels like a lifetime ago, truly. I was still living in Bogotá then, before I moved here. It was… a simpler time, perhaps. I apologize for my lack of precision, Doctor. It's truly frustrating to not be able to recall these details.
DOCTOR: Don't apologize at all, Ms. Brightful. It's perfectly understandable. Memories can be tricky. We can look it up in your records if you’d like. Before we do that, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That's… easier. I take a low dose of losartan, for my blood pressure. My husband… he was quite proactive about my health. And… a multivitamin, just to supplement things. That’s it, I believe. I don’t take anything else regularly. Except for ibuprofen occasionally, when my back aches after a long day in the garden. But that's only as needed.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Brightful. That’s helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard, thankfully. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My husband always double-checked before giving me any new medications, just to be safe. He was very thorough. He always… looked after me. I apologize for rambling; I seem to be drifting off a bit.
DOCTOR: Please, don't apologize at all, Ms. Brightful. It’s perfectly alright to share. It sounds like your husband was a very caring man. Now, let’s move on to your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… family history. That’s… a bit difficult. My mother had… arthritis, I believe. In her hands, mostly. And my father… he had high blood pressure, like me. But beyond that… I don’t recall anything particularly significant. My family wasn't very forthcoming about health issues, to be honest. They didn't really… talk about those things. And… it’s been a long time since I’ve seen them.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Ms. Brightful. It’s common for families to not discuss health history openly. We can work with what you remember. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh. Um… well, as you know, I’m widowed. I moved here about two years ago, after my husband passed away. Before that, I lived in Bogotá, Colombia, my whole life. I don’t… I don’t have much family nearby. Mostly just… acquaintances. And… I enjoy gardening, as we’ve discussed. It keeps me busy, and… it’s peaceful. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. It’s… a quiet life now.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing, Ms. Brightful. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it’s admirable how you’ve found peace and purpose in gardening. Before we proceed to a physical exam, could you describe your current physical activity level?
PATIENT: Oh, well, as I mentioned, I garden quite a bit! It’s not a sedentary life, certainly. I’m out there most days, weeding, planting, pruning… it’s quite strenuous, actually. I lift bags of soil, carry tools… I’d say I get a good amount of exercise. Maybe… four or five hours a week? It depends on the weather, of course. It keeps me mobile, and it's a good distraction. Does that answer your question, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Ms. Brightful. That gives me a good idea of your activity level. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. We’ll start with your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs and briefly examine your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment completely. I’m ready when you are. It's… good to know everything is being checked, you know? Just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. And again? It’s… a bit strange having someone listen to my chest. I haven’t had a proper check-up in quite some time. But… I appreciate you being thorough, Doctor. It puts my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are normal, regular rate and rhythm. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, crackles, or rhonchi. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly detected. Everything appears within normal limits so far, Ms. Brightful. Do you have any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that's perfectly comfortable. Not at all. As I said, I do get a bit of backache from the gardening, but that's… just muscle strain, I think. Nothing serious. It usually goes away with a bit of rest and some ibuprofen. Honestly, Doctor, I feel… reasonably well, considering everything. I’m just glad to be getting this cleared, so I can… move forward.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Ms. Brightful. Based on the physical exam, there are no immediate concerns that would prevent you from proceeding with your scheduled surgery. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and I would like to discuss some lifestyle modifications and potential monitoring. Do you have a home blood pressure monitor?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. My husband… he always checked my blood pressure at his office. I never thought to get one for home use. It… never seemed necessary. I suppose I should have, though. It would be good to keep track of it myself. Is it… expensive? Would you recommend a particular type?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Brightful. It's a good idea to get one, even if it's just for peace of mind. They aren’t expensive – you can find reliable ones for around $40 to $60. I recommend an automatic upper arm monitor – they are generally more accurate than wrist monitors. I can write you a prescription for one, and your insurance might cover a portion of the cost. For now, I’d like to also discuss some general recommendations to help manage your blood pressure, such as reducing salt intake and regular exercise. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Anything to help. Reducing salt intake… I believe I can manage that. I don’t add much to my cooking anyway. And I already get plenty of exercise with the gardening, as we've discussed. I’m happy to follow your recommendations. Perhaps you could provide me with a written list? It's… easier for me to remember things that are written down. My memory… it's not always reliable, as you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Brightful. I’m happy to provide you with a written list of recommendations. I’ll also include some resources on healthy eating and exercise. Here you are. This includes information on DASH diet, sodium reduction, and some low-impact exercises. It also contains instructions on how to properly monitor your blood pressure at home. Do you have any questions about this handout?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. This is… very helpful. DASH diet… that’s something I’ve heard of before. And yes, it does explain how to monitor my blood pressure properly. Um… perhaps just one question. It mentions reducing stress. How does one reduce stress, exactly? It’s… easier said than done, I imagine. My life has been rather… unsettled lately.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. Brightful. And you are absolutely right – it's easier said than done. Stress management is highly individual. Some techniques that people find helpful include mindfulness exercises, deep breathing techniques, yoga, spending time in nature, or engaging in hobbies you enjoy. For you, gardening already seems to be a good stress reliever. If you find yourself struggling with persistent stress or anxiety, I can provide you with a referral to a therapist or counselor. Would you be interested in that?
PATIENT: Oh… a therapist. I… I haven't really thought about that before. I’ve always been quite independent, and I’ve never really… talked to anyone about my feelings. But… perhaps it wouldn’t hurt. If you think it would be beneficial, I suppose I’m willing to try. My husband… he always encouraged me to seek help if I needed it. Yes, perhaps a referral would be good. Just… to have someone to talk to.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Brightful. I completely understand. I will prepare a referral for Dr. Eleanor Vance, a licensed therapist in the area. She specializes in grief and stress management. I'll have my nurse fax it over to her office, and they will contact you to schedule an appointment. Now, to summarize, everything appears to be in order for you to proceed with your scheduled surgery. We discussed monitoring your blood pressure at home and reducing salt intake. I have provided a referral to Dr. Vance, should you choose to seek therapy. Do you have any further questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything. You’ve been… incredibly thorough and kind. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my concerns, and for providing me with such helpful information. I feel much more… reassured now. And thank you for the referral. I’ll… I’ll give Dr. Vance a call. I appreciate everything you’ve done. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Brightful. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day, and best of luck with your surgery. .
