DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I’m Dr. Chora. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a…reset, you know? A jumpstart to feeling like myself again. I haven’t been feeling quite right for a while now, and I thought it was time to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand. "Not feeling quite right" can mean a lot of things. Can you tell me more about what you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, to be honest. It’s not one specific thing. More…a general lack of energy. And I’ve been having trouble sleeping, even though I’m tired. My appetite isn’t what it used to be either. Just a bit…off, all around. I’m still able to do my work – I’m a molder, you know, shaping things with clay and resin – but it takes more effort than it should.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, fatigue, sleep disturbance, decreased appetite…and it’s impacting your ability to do your work, requiring more effort. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: It’s definitely been gradual, Doctor. Not something that woke up with one morning. I’d say…over the past six months or so, it's slowly gotten worse. At first, I just thought I was a little stressed with a big project, but it hasn’t really gone away. I just kept hoping it would resolve on its own, you know? But it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Six months of gradual onset…Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside those?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Not really, not that I've noticed. Maybe a little more…forgetful than usual, but I’m 45, Doctor! Is that even worth mentioning? I do sometimes misplace my glasses, but that’s happened for years. Nothing new there. I suppose I've also been feeling a bit…down, but I wouldn't call it sadness, exactly. More just…lacking motivation, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, some increased forgetfulness, and a lack of motivation…That’s helpful. Now, let’s go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I’ve been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, of course – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing – but nothing major. No chronic conditions, no surgeries. My husband always jokes that I’m too stubborn to get sick! I do have Medicare, of course, so they have most of my records, I imagine.
DOCTOR: Okay, Medicare confirms no significant past medical history. No surgeries documented either. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Nothing at all. I can eat whatever I want – and I enjoy that! No reactions to any medications I’ve ever taken, which hasn’t been much, thankfully. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. Just a bit of an aversion, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t really believe in taking things unless I absolutely have to. I try to get everything I need from my food, and from…well, just living a good life, I suppose. My husband tries to get me to take a multivitamin, but I always refuse.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, I’d like to ask a little about your family history, if you don’t mind. Any significant medical conditions in your parents, siblings, or other close relatives?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. My mother…she had high blood pressure when she was older, and she eventually had a stroke, I think it was about ten years ago. My father was mostly healthy, but he did have some trouble with his heart later in life. And my older brother…he has diabetes, type 2, I believe. That's the most significant, I think. Aside from that, nothing major that I can recall. We weren't a family that talked much about health, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. High blood pressure and stroke in your mother, heart issues in your father, and type 2 diabetes in your brother. That's helpful to know. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve been married to my husband, Ricardo, for 25 years now. He's a retired carpenter. We live here in the suburbs, quiet life, mostly. I don’t smoke, I drink maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, and I don’t do any recreational drugs. I enjoy my work, shaping clay and resin, as I mentioned before. It keeps me busy. And I try to get some fresh air when I can, although with the clay dust, I don't always succeed.
DOCTOR: Okay, 25 years of marriage, retired carpenter husband, no smoking, occasional alcohol use, clay work… I’m going to ask a few clarifying questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Does your clay work involve any fumes or other potential irritants besides the dust?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. The resin I use…it does have a bit of a smell, a chemical odor. I try to work in a well-ventilated space, but it's not perfect. And I sometimes use a solvent to clean my tools, which also has a strong smell. It hasn't bothered me before, but now that you mention it… perhaps it’s contributing to how I’ve been feeling? I hadn't really thought about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Exposure to resin fumes and solvents… That's important. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'll check your vital signs – blood pressure, heart rate, temperature – and listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also do a basic neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and coordination. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel. Relax your arm for me… Good. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let’s listen to your heart… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation, no wheezes or crackles. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes… Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Coordination appears good… Alright, everything seems within normal limits so far, Ms. Pitzel. However, given your fatigue, lack of motivation, and family history, I’d like to order some blood work.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work seems like a good idea. What exactly will it be testing for? And… is it something serious, do you think? I’m not overly worried, but I always like to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Understandably. We’ll be checking a complete blood count – to rule out anemia or infection – as well as a thyroid panel, to see if your thyroid is functioning properly. We'll also check your vitamin D levels, as deficiency can cause fatigue, and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. And finally, given your family history, we’ll check your blood sugar and HbA1c to screen for diabetes. It's unlikely to be anything serious, Ms. Pitzel, but we need to rule out some common causes of your symptoms. It could be a vitamin deficiency, a thyroid issue, or, as a precaution, early signs of diabetes. I want to be thorough. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…very thorough, Doctor. And I appreciate that. It's better to be safe, as they say. All of that sounds perfectly reasonable. So, where will I go to have the blood drawn? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll send an order to the lab at St. Joseph's Hospital – it's just down the street, at 123 Main Street. They take walk-ins, but I recommend calling ahead to schedule an appointment, just to avoid a wait. The number is 555-1212. The results usually take about 48-72 hours to come back. Once I have them, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and formulate a plan. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest, stay hydrated, and eat a balanced diet. Avoid any excessive exposure to the fumes and solvents at work, if possible. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that's all very clear. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. I'll call the lab first thing tomorrow and schedule an appointment. And I will certainly try to limit my exposure to those fumes at work. I feel much better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Pitzel. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care. .
