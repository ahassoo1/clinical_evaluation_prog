DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a problem with my ear. It is leaking something. I notice it… maybe two days ago? It is not… comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Leaking from the ear, you said, and it’s been happening for about two days. And you’re experiencing discomfort. Can you describe the leakage for me?
PATIENT: Yes, two days, maybe a little more. The… liquid is clear, I think. Not blood. And a little bit… smelly. Not a strong smell, but… there is a smell. It is… difficult to explain. Like… old water, perhaps? I am sorry. I am not good with… describing things.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Radillo, you're doing fine. "Old water" is a perfectly acceptable description, actually. And it is important to note the smell. Is the discomfort a pain, a pressure, or something else?
PATIENT: It is… a fullness, mostly. Like… when you go up high in airplane, and your ears… pop? But it does not pop. It just… feels full. And a little bit… itchy inside. Not always, but sometimes. It makes me… want to put something in my ear, but I know I should not.
DOCTOR: Right, fullness, like pressure, and some itching. And you're wise to avoid putting anything in your ear. Have you noticed any hearing loss or ringing in your ears at all?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A little. Things… sound quieter, maybe? I ask my wife to… speak up sometimes. She says I am always… quiet myself, so maybe I do not notice. And… yes, a little ringing. Very soft. Only when it is… very quiet, like when the television is off. It is not… bothersome, but it is there.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, some decreased hearing and a faint ringing in your ears, more noticeable when it’s quiet. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or any dizziness along with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever. I check myself. No chills. And no… spinning. Not dizzy. Just… this ear. And the… feeling of fullness. It is… frustrating. I need to hear well for my work, you see. I am a teacher.
DOCTOR: Alright. A teacher, so hearing is important. And no fever, chills, or dizziness. Have you had any ear infections previously, that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. When I was… a boy, maybe ten years old. My mother… she take me to doctor. I remember the pain. It was… very bad. They give me… drops for ear. And it get better. I have not… had problem with ear since then. Not until now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a childhood ear infection treated with ear drops, and nothing since then until now. Do you recall any injury to the ear recently, even a minor one?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No injury. I am… careful. I do not put things in my ears, and I try not to… bump my head. My wife… she always say I am clumsy, but I try to be careful. No injury. It just… started. This leaking.
DOCTOR: Alright. No injury. And it began spontaneously. Do you have any allergies to medications, or have you had any adverse reactions to medications in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. I take a small pill for my blood pressure, but my wife, she take care of that. I have not… had problems with pills. No allergy. I am… mostly healthy. Just this ear. It is… worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you take medication for blood pressure, managed by your wife. Now, I'd like to take a look at your ear. I'm going to use an otoscope to examine the ear canal and eardrum. It won't be painful, but it might be a little uncomfortable if the area is sensitive. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… alright. I trust you. Please, look at my ear. I hope you… find the problem. I want to… hear again, properly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo. I can see some fluid in your ear canal, and your eardrum is a little red, but it doesn’t appear to be perforated – meaning it hasn't ruptured. It looks like you may have an outer ear infection, also known as otitis externa, or swimmer’s ear. The discharge and inflammation are consistent with that. However, to be certain, I would like to collect a sample of the fluid from your ear canal for analysis. This will confirm the diagnosis and help determine the best course of treatment. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… sounds good. If that can… find what is wrong, and get me… better, please, do that. A sample. I do not… mind. I trust your judgement. What will you… do with the sample?
DOCTOR: We’ll send the sample to the lab. They’ll culture it – meaning they’ll try to grow any bacteria that might be present – and identify what’s causing the infection. This helps us determine which antibiotic will be most effective. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you some antibiotic ear drops. It’s important to use them exactly as directed, even if your symptoms start to improve before you finish the course. I will also give you some pain drops to use if needed. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Antibiotic drops… and pain drops. Yes, Doctor. That is… good. Two days? For the results? What… if I cannot hear properly in those two days? Can I… still teach? It is… important.
DOCTOR: Yes, two to three days for the lab results, typically. As for teaching, it depends on how your hearing is. If you are able to hear well enough to effectively communicate with your students, you should be able to continue. However, if you’re experiencing significant hearing loss, you may want to consider taking a sick day. We can write a note for your school if necessary. The antibiotic drops should start to improve your hearing within a day or two. If your hearing doesn’t improve or if your pain worsens, please call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions before we proceed with the prescription and work note?
PATIENT: A work note… yes, that is… very helpful. Thank you, Doctor. No, I think… that is all my questions. I will… take the drops, and wait for the results. And call if… it gets worse. Thank you… very much. You have… been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I’m glad I could help. Let me just get these prescriptions and the work note prepared for you. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all. We’ll get you hearing properly again as quickly as possible.
PATIENT: .
