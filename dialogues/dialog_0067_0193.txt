DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Pfennig. It is very nice to meet you as well. Well, it is…a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I have…too much gas. A lot of it. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, and it is…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to be embarrassed at all, Mr. Goodstein. Digestive issues are very common, and we can definitely figure out what’s going on. A few weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. Perhaps…five, maybe six weeks now? It started slowly, just a little more than usual, but it has gotten…more frequent. And, sometimes, quite loud. It's affecting…things. Everyday things.
DOCTOR: I understand. And it sounds like it’s impacting your daily life, which is important to address. Let's try to get a clearer picture of what's happening. Could you describe the gas itself?
PATIENT: Hmm. Describe it? Well, it doesn't…hurt, exactly. It's more of a…fullness. A pressure. And then…it just comes out. It doesn't smell particularly bad, not always, anyway. Sometimes it does, but mostly…it just is. It's very…unpredictable. I cannot always tell when it will happen.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s not painful, mostly just a feeling of fullness and pressure, and the odor varies. Unpredictability is definitely frustrating. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the gas?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… Well, my stomach does…gurgle. A lot. More than it used to, definitely. And sometimes I feel a little…bloated. Like I ate too much, even when I haven’t. That’s about it, I think. No pain, no…other problems. Just the gurgling and the bloating. And the…gas, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gurgling and bloating accompany the gas. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. I think… beans. Yes, definitely beans. And…cabbage. Cabbage is bad. Also, fizzy drinks. I like a little soda sometimes, but that always makes it worse afterwards. Those are the three things I have noticed, anyway. Perhaps there are others, but those are the most obvious.
DOCTOR: Alright, so beans, cabbage, and fizzy drinks seem to be triggers. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk about your diet in general. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone, Doctor. So, I mostly eat simple things. For breakfast, usually toast with a little jam. Sometimes cereal. Lunch is often a sandwich, maybe ham and cheese. And for dinner…well, it varies. Sometimes I cook, sometimes I get something from the store. Frozen dinners, things like that. I do not eat a lot of fruit or vegetables, to be honest. Mostly…easy things.
DOCTOR: Okay, I appreciate your honesty. It sounds like your diet is fairly basic, and perhaps lacking in some fiber-rich foods. Now, have you experienced any changes in your bowel movements recently?
PATIENT: Bowel movements… Yes, actually. They are…less regular. Not constipation, exactly, but…not as often as they used to be. And sometimes they are a little…loose. Not diarrhea, but…softer. It is hard to explain. It has all happened around the same time as the gas, so I assumed it was related.
DOCTOR: Okay, so less frequent and softer stools along with the gas and bloating. That does point towards a digestive issue. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I have Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly for check-ups. They always say I am…healthy enough for my age. I had my gallbladder removed many years ago, maybe fifteen years now. Other than that…no. No diabetes, no heart problems, nothing like that. Just the gallbladder. And a little bit of arthritis in my hands, but that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gallbladder removal fifteen years ago and some arthritis in your hands. No other significant medical conditions. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a little something for the arthritis. It's called… naproxen, I think. A small pill, once a day. And sometimes I take something for heartburn, if I eat something spicy. But that is only occasionally. Otherwise…no. No other medications.
DOCTOR: Okay, naproxen for arthritis and occasional heartburn medication. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think. No, I don't think so. I have never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. I can eat all sorts of foods. No trouble with peanuts or shellfish or anything like that. And I haven’t had any trouble with medications either. No rashes, no trouble breathing…nothing. No, I do not have any allergies that I am aware of.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Absolutely not. I do not smoke. I used to drink a little beer sometimes, but I stopped a long time ago. And I certainly do not use any…recreational drugs. I just live a quiet life, mostly. I enjoy reading and watching television, things like that. Nothing exciting.
DOCTOR: Okay, a quiet lifestyle, no smoking, no alcohol, and no recreational drugs. That’s good. Now, before we do a physical exam, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any digestive issues, like irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease, that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. My mother…she had some trouble with her stomach sometimes. Always complaining of indigestion, but I don’t think it was anything serious. My father…he was healthy, as far as I know. No, I don’t think there is any history of…irritable bowel or anything like that. No, not that I am aware of. My family is not…a very healthy family, but it's usually heart problems, not stomach problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly heart problems in the family, with your mother having some indigestion. Alright, Mr. Goodstein, thank you for answering all of those questions. It gives me a good picture of what's going on. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm listening to your bowel sounds now. They seem a little… hyperactive, louder than usual. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or tenderness. It doesn't seem like there's any major tenderness, but your abdomen is a bit distended. There's some tympany, which suggests some trapped gas. Alright, Mr. Goodstein, everything seems normal on initial examination, but the hyperactive bowel sounds and distension suggest a possible issue with gas production or intestinal motility. Now, based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, possibly triggered by your diet. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a stool sample to check for any infections or inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: IBS? I have heard of that. A stool sample… yes, that sounds alright. If that is what you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better. What will the stool sample tell us? And what will happen after that? Will I need…medicine? I do not like taking a lot of medicine, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's understandable. The stool sample will help us rule out any infections, like bacteria or parasites, and also check for inflammation in your gut, which can be a sign of other conditions. It's a routine test, and we can get the results in a few days. As for medicine, it depends on the results of the stool sample. If everything comes back normal, we can try dietary changes first, focusing on avoiding those trigger foods – beans, cabbage, and fizzy drinks. We can also discuss strategies for managing stress, as stress can sometimes worsen IBS symptoms. If those things don't help, there are medications available that can help with bloating, gas, and bowel motility, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. We’ll start with the least invasive options first, if possible. I’ll give you the instructions for collecting the stool sample. It’s a simple process. And then we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Dietary changes first… that is good. I can definitely try to avoid those foods. And I do not mind scheduling a follow-up appointment. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little better knowing what we are going to do. Please, give me the instructions for the sample. I will do my best to follow them carefully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here are the instructions. It’s important to follow them carefully to ensure an accurate result. Basically, you’ll collect a small sample in this container and bring it to the lab within 24 hours. The lab is located… Do you have any questions about the instructions?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. No special food to avoid, just collect the sample and get it to the lab within a day. And it says to wash my hands thoroughly afterwards, which is good. I do not think I have any questions at the moment. Thank you again for your help, Doctor. I will collect the sample as soon as I can. I appreciate your time and your patience.
