DOCTOR: Good morning, Zelina. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, it's probably nothing you can fix, but my ex-husband keeps complaining about my breath. Honestly, it’s ridiculous, he always finds something. But he's making a big deal out of it, so here I am. Waste of a perfectly good Saturday, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Zelina. While it may be irritating, it’s always best to rule out any underlying medical causes for a concern like this. It's good you’re addressing it. To get a better understanding, could you describe when you first noticed this becoming an issue, and how frequently it occurs?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t really keep track of these things. He just started… mentioning it more, I guess? A few weeks ago, maybe. It's not like it's constant, and it's not like I'm some kind of slob. I brush my teeth, okay? I just… don’t see what the fuss is about. Look, is he just trying to get under my skin? Is that what this is? Because I swear, if that man…
DOCTOR: I understand your feelings, Zelina. It sounds like this is more than just a medical concern for you. However, let's approach this systematically. Regardless of the reason behind his comments, we want to ensure there isn’t a treatable medical cause for any changes in your breath. To help me assess things, could you tell me a little bit more about your typical daily routine?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. What do you even need to know? It's not like I’m doing anything special. I wake up, go to work – highway maintenance, so it’s… outside. Lots of physical labor. Come home, eat, watch TV, go to bed. Sometimes I have a beer, or two. Is that what you want to hear? Honestly, it’s pretty boring. And again, I brush my teeth. Twice a day!
DOCTOR: Thank you, Zelina. That's helpful. Highway maintenance can be quite demanding. The physical labor is relevant, and the fact that you are working outside is as well. You mentioned having a beer or two sometimes. Do you drink alcohol every day, and if so, approximately how much?
PATIENT: No, not every day. Maybe three or four times a week. A couple of beers, nothing crazy. Look, I'm not an alcoholic or anything if that's what you're implying. It helps me relax after a long shift, okay? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. You're asking me about my drinking now? Is this even relevant? He’s just being difficult.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions seem intrusive, Zelina. I assure you, I am not making any judgements. I'm simply gathering information to understand all possible contributing factors. Alcohol can sometimes contribute to dry mouth, which can affect breath odor. It's important to consider all possibilities. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I’m perfectly healthy, thank you very much. I haven’t been to a doctor in… years. Honestly, I don't even like doctors. I work outside, I’m active. I eat okay, mostly. And like I said, I brush my teeth. I'm not sick. He's just trying to find something to complain about. It's always something with him. Honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you are generally very healthy, which is excellent. Let’s proceed on that assumption for now. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No! Nothing like that. Never. Broken a nail once, does that count? Seriously, I’ve been pretty lucky. I just… don’t understand why he's suddenly so obsessed with my breath. It’s not like it smells that bad. And if it does, a mint solves the problem. This is a waste of my Saturday.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: What about them? Look, my family… it's complicated. I haven't spoken to my mother in years. And my ex… well, he was my ex for a reason. What does any of that have to do with my breath? Are you going to actually do something, or are you just going to grill me about my personal life?
DOCTOR: You’re right to question the relevance, Zelina. I apologize if my line of questioning seems unrelated. I was simply trying to establish if there's a family history of anything that might be contributing, such as certain digestive issues or conditions that can affect oral health. However, if you’re uncomfortable discussing your family history, we can certainly skip that for now. Let’s move on to something else. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t take pills. I don’t believe in them. And I don’t need vitamins, I eat fine. Honestly, this is pointless. Can we just get this over with? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. In that case, perhaps a quick examination would be helpful. I'd like to take a look at your mouth and throat, and listen to your lungs, just to rule out any obvious causes. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I don’t like having people stick things in my mouth. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Zelina. I'm going to use a light to examine the inside of your mouth. Just open wide and say “ah.” Okay, good. Now, I'm just going to listen to your lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me. Finally, I’m going to check your throat. Okay. All clear. I don’t see anything immediately concerning. Your mouth appears generally healthy, and your lungs sound clear.
PATIENT: So? What does that mean? Is something wrong? Or is this just… nothing? Honestly, I told you it was a waste of time. Is he just making things up? Because I’m going to go back there and…
DOCTOR: It means, Zelina, that based on my examination, there's no obvious physical cause for your concern. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean your ex-husband is making things up. Sometimes, breath odor can be caused by factors that aren't immediately apparent, or by something relatively minor. Given that you’re otherwise healthy and not experiencing any other symptoms, my initial impression is that this may be related to a buildup of bacteria in your mouth, possibly due to dry mouth, especially if you're not drinking enough fluids throughout the day. It could also be related to certain foods you eat. To rule out other possibilities and to give you some peace of mind, I recommend a few things. First, ensure you’re drinking at least eight glasses of water a day. Second, maintain excellent oral hygiene – brush twice a day, floss daily, and consider using a tongue scraper. Finally, I would recommend scheduling a cleaning with a dental hygienist. They can thoroughly remove any plaque and tartar buildup and assess your overall oral health. Would you be open to trying these recommendations?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Water and brushing… I already do most of that anyway. And a cleaning… I guess I can schedule a cleaning. But if it turns out to be nothing, I'm sending him the bill. And I’m not apologizing for anything. Can I go now? I have better things to do than worry about this.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Zelina. I understand your frustration, and I’m happy to provide documentation for the cleaning visit if you wish. I’ll write a referral for a dental cleaning with a reputable hygienist in the area. Here's the information. I’m confident that these steps will help. If the problem persists after these measures, we can revisit this and consider further investigation. In the meantime, remember to stay hydrated, maintain good oral hygiene, and don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. Thank you for your patience today. Have a good rest of your weekend, Zelina.
