DOCTOR: Good morning, Reneisha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Thank you for having me. I… well, I’ve been gaining weight, and I don’t understand why. It’s rather troubling, to be honest. It’s not like I’ve changed my eating habits, and I’m certainly not less active.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s certainly concerning, and we can definitely look into that. It’s good you’re proactive about it. When you say you haven’t changed your eating habits, could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, for breakfast, I usually have a small bowl of oatmeal with a bit of fruit – usually berries if they’re in season. Lunch is often a sandwich – turkey or sometimes cheese – with a salad. And dinner… my husband usually cooks, it's often potatoes with some sort of meat – chicken, pork, occasionally beef – and vegetables. I do enjoy a small biscuit with tea in the evening, but truly, nothing excessive. It's been like this for years.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds like a fairly balanced diet. And how much water would you say you drink in a day, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh… water. That's a good question. I probably don't drink enough water, to be honest. Perhaps… six or eight glasses? It varies. I drink a lot of tea, though. Black tea, mostly. Does that count? I always thought the tea would offset it, but perhaps that’s foolish thinking.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re recognizing that water intake is important. Tea does contribute to hydration, but water is still best. Six to eight glasses isn’t bad, but we ideally want to aim for closer to eight to ten. Now, you mentioned you haven't been less active. Can you tell me a bit about your typical activity level?
PATIENT: I do a lot of walking. I walk to the market most days, and I help my husband in the garden – weeding, planting, that sort of thing. It’s not strenuous exercise, but it keeps me moving. I also do a bit of housework, of course. Dusting, sweeping, laundry… Nothing too exciting, I assure you, but it’s not as though I sit all day. I suppose I'm moderately active.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds like a reasonable level of activity. It’s good you’re staying mobile. Now, let's talk a bit about your overall health. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the weight gain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I’ve been a little more tired lately, perhaps, but I attributed that to the summer heat. And… now that you mention it, my skin has been a bit dry. And I feel cold more easily than I used to, even when others are comfortable. But that’s all, truly. No aches, no pains, no… anything dramatic.
DOCTOR: Okay, those are helpful details – the fatigue, dry skin, and feeling cold more easily. It sounds like we need to investigate a bit further. Do you have any known medical conditions currently?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I haven’t had any serious illnesses. Just the usual colds, of course, but nothing a good rest and some tea couldn’t cure. I haven’t been diagnosed with anything, and I haven’t had any major surgeries. My husband always says I’m as sturdy as an oak tree.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear! Being generally healthy is a good starting point. And I appreciate your husband’s description – that’s lovely. Let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like thyroid problems, diabetes, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well… my mother had some trouble with her joints when she was older, arthritis, I believe. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had something with his heart, but I don’t know the specifics. It was a long time ago. No one, as far as I know, had thyroid problems or diabetes. My family tended to… just get old, quietly. Nothing particularly dramatic. It's not a very helpful answer, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly helpful, Reneisha. Knowing what isn't in your family history is just as important. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I prefer to avoid medication if possible. I believe in a good diet and plenty of rest. That’s always been my philosophy. I might take a vitamin C tablet during the winter, but that’s the extent of it. Absolutely nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything and everything, thankfully. My husband jokes that I have a cast-iron stomach. Though perhaps that’s contributing to the weight gain!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Alright, Reneisha, it sounds like we have a good baseline. To get a clearer picture of what might be going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It’ll just involve checking your heart rate, blood pressure, listening to your lungs, and feeling your thyroid gland. It's a standard procedure, and shouldn't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, go ahead. I trust your judgment completely. I want to understand what’s happening, and if an examination will help, then I'm happy to cooperate. I just… I would appreciate it if you could explain what you’re doing as you go, if you don’t mind? I don’t want to be startled.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Reneisha, absolutely. I will explain everything as I go. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Your blood pressure is 130/85, which is slightly elevated but not drastically so. Your pulse is 72, which is normal. Temperature is 98.6, also within normal range. Respiration is 16 breaths per minute. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to palpate your thyroid gland. This just means I'm gently feeling your neck to check for any enlargement or nodules. Hmm… Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, and I can feel a few small nodules. It's not necessarily cause for immediate alarm, but it is something we need to investigate further. I’ll also check your reflexes, and listen to your abdomen. Your reflexes are normal, and your abdomen sounds normal. Based on this initial examination, the slightly enlarged thyroid with nodules, along with the fatigue and feeling cold, suggests we should run some blood tests to check your thyroid function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests, of course. I trust your assessment. It’s… a relief to have some direction, to be honest. I’ve been worrying about this weight gain for months, and it’s good to know we're finally getting to the bottom of it. What kind of tests will they be? And… will it be painful? I do dislike needles, I must confess.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Reneisha. It's completely understandable to be worried, and I'm glad we're making progress. The blood tests we'll be running will primarily check your thyroid hormone levels – TSH, T4, and T3. These tests will help us determine if your thyroid is functioning properly. We’ll also check a complete blood count, to rule out any other potential issues. As for the needle, it will be a quick pinch, and most people don’t find it terribly painful. The phlebotomist – the person drawing the blood – is very skilled, and they’ll do their best to make it as comfortable as possible. We can also use a numbing cream if you’d like, but it takes some time to work. Would you prefer the numbing cream?
PATIENT: Oh… perhaps the numbing cream would be best. Yes, please. Just to be on the safe side. It’s foolish, I know, but I’ve always been rather… sensitive. And the thought of needles does make me a bit faint. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you accommodating my… anxieties. How long will it take to get the results back? And will I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Absolutely no need to apologize, Reneisha. It’s perfectly normal to have anxieties, and we’re here to make you as comfortable as possible. We’ll definitely use the numbing cream. It will take about 20-30 minutes to take effect. As for the tests, you do need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. We’ll schedule the blood draw for first thing in the morning. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back from the lab. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as rapid heartbeat, excessive sweating, or unexplained weight loss, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You've been very thorough and… kind, actually. I was quite nervous before, but I feel much better now, knowing we're taking steps to figure this out. Thank you. So… eight hours fasting, morning appointment. I will make sure to remember. And I will contact the clinic if anything changes. Perhaps… perhaps you could send me a reminder about the fasting? Just to be absolutely certain? My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Reneisha. I’m glad I could ease your mind. Absolutely, I will send you a reminder about the fasting. Our scheduling assistant will include that in the appointment confirmation email. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Here’s a pamphlet with some basic information about thyroid disorders. Take your time to read it over, but don’t self-diagnose. We’ll discuss everything in detail once the results are back. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
