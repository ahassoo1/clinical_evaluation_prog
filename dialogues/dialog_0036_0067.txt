DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ruocco. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It's August 2nd, and I see you're 80 years old. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, 80... feels like yesterday, honestly. Hmm... what brings me in? It's this pain, you see. When I take a deep breath. It… hurts. Not all the time, just when I really try to fill my lungs, I guess. It’s been… a little while now. I don't remember exactly how long. Things aren’t so clear these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain with deep breaths. I understand. And you said it’s been going on for a little while – do you remember if it started suddenly, or did it come on gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. Yes, that feels right. It didn't just boom one day. It was more like… slowly getting worse. I didn’t pay much attention at first, to be honest. Old man stuff, you know? But it’s… bothersome now. Hard to do things when you can’t even take a good breath.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in to get it checked out. “Old man stuff” can still be important stuff. Can you point to where it hurts exactly?
PATIENT: Right… around here. It's not a sharp pain, more like a… ache. Deep inside. Sometimes it feels like it’s on both sides, sometimes just… here. It’s hard to say exactly. It’s not like pointing to a broken bone, you know?
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. It can be difficult to pinpoint. Does anything make the pain better or worse besides taking a deep breath?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Worse… well, if I try to lift something heavy, definitely worse. And if I get… excited, maybe? Like, if I'm talking fast, or… I don’t know. Better? Laying down sometimes helps a little. But not much. It's mostly just… there. It doesn’t really go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s worse with exertion or excitement, and slightly better when lying down. Have you had any cough, fever, or shortness of breath along with the pain?
PATIENT: Cough… yes, a little. Not a bad cough. Just… an old man’s cough, you know? Happens every now and then. Fever? No, I don’t think so. I haven't felt warm or anything. Shortness of breath… well, I get tired easily, but that’s just… getting old. I don’t think it’s any different than usual.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever smoked, or been around a lot of smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? When I was younger… yes, a little. When I was building things, with the other guys. It wasn't much, but we smoked sometimes on the job. Haven't smoked in… oh, goodness, 40 years, maybe more? Not since my wife… well, a long time ago. Not much smoke around these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some past exposure to smoke, but you haven't smoked in a very long time. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions, like heart problems, lung problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Medical history… oh, goodness. It’s been a long life, Doctor. I had… something with my heart, a long time ago. They gave me some pills, and I took them for a while. Can’t remember what it was called. And… my wife, she always took care of the medical stuff. I just… did what she told me. I don't really know about any other problems. No diabetes, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, some past heart issue that you took pills for, but you’re unsure of the details. That's alright, we can try to get those records if that’s okay with you. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Yes… I had my appendix out when I was young. And… something with my knee. It was bothering me, so they fixed it. A long time ago. And… that’s all I can remember. They don't tell you much these days, you know? Everything happens so fast.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix and a knee surgery. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. They gave me some pills for my heart, like I said, and I didn't have any problems. My wife always double-checked everything, though. She was very careful. I can't remember anything specific… I just took what she gave me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not right now. Haven’t taken anything in… a long time. Since my wife… They took me off everything when she… well, I just haven’t bothered getting refills.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Now, I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart, and I'll also check your oxygen levels. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Do what you need to do. Just… try not to take too long, alright? I have… things to do. It’s just been a long morning already.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Ruocco. Take some nice, deep breaths for me when I tell you. Your heart sounds a little… distant, and I can hear some mild crackling in the lower parts of your lungs on both sides. Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low. I'm going to feel your legs to check for swelling. There’s a little bit of swelling in your ankles. Do you notice that yourself?
PATIENT: Swelling… Yes, actually. Now that you mention it. I thought it was just… getting old. My feet have been a little puffy lately. Doesn’t really bother me, but… it’s there. Does that mean something bad? I just want to know what’s going on, Doctor. And… if I can go home soon.
DOCTOR: It’s good you noticed it. The swelling, along with the crackling in your lungs and the lower oxygen levels, suggests there might be some fluid buildup. It's hard to say exactly what's causing it without further testing, but it could be related to your heart, lungs, or kidneys. To get a better understanding, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work. The X-ray will help us see if there’s fluid in your lungs, and the blood work will check your kidney function and look for other potential causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood work… More tests… Honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel better. Is it serious? I don’t like tests. But… if you think it’s necessary… alright. Do what you need to do. Just… tell me what it means, alright? And… how long it will take.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Ruocco, and I want to assure you we’ll take things one step at a time. It’s not necessarily serious, but it's important to find out what’s causing these symptoms. These tests will help us get a clearer picture. The X-ray will be quick – just a few minutes. The blood work will take a little longer, and we’ll need to send the sample to the lab. We should have the results back within a couple of days. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a diuretic—a water pill—to help reduce some of the fluid buildup. It’s a low dose, but it might help you feel a little better. I'll also ask the nurse to take your blood pressure and weight. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A water pill… alright. If it helps me breathe easier… yes, that sounds good. Just… not too strong, alright? I don’t want to feel weak. And… yes, the nurse can take my weight and blood pressure. Anything to get this figured out. Just… let me know what the tests show, Doctor. And… how long until I can go home. I have… things waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Ruocco. We’ll start with a low dose of the diuretic, and we’ll monitor you closely. We’ll make sure it doesn't make you feel weak. The nurse will be in shortly to check your vital signs and get the order for the X-ray and blood work started. The X-ray can be done right here at the clinic. It shouldn’t take long. Once the blood work is sent to the lab, we should have the results in a couple of days. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available to discuss them. For now, let’s just focus on getting these tests done. I understand you have things waiting for you, and we’ll do everything we can to get you home as soon as it’s safe. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… thank you. For listening. It’s just… hard to keep track of everything these days. And I appreciate you not rushing me. Just… let me know what the tests show. That’s all.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ruocco. It's my job, and I’m happy to help. I understand it can be overwhelming, and I want you to feel comfortable asking any questions you have along the way. The nurse will be in shortly. I’ll see you soon, and we'll get you feeling better.
PATIENT: .
