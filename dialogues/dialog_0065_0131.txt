DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sladen. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s S-L-A-V-E-N, actually. Mykeisha S-L-A-V-E-N. Um, well, the nurse told me to come in ‘cause my blood pressure’s been a little high at my check-ups. She said I should get it looked at properly.
DOCTOR: S-L-A-V-E-N, right. Apologies for the mispronunciation. "A little high" is rather vague, Ms. Sladen – or S-L-A-V-E-N. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, no worries ‘bout the name, Doctor. It happens all the time! Um… well, I don’t really know numbers, to be honest. The nurse just said it was over 140 something, usually. And sometimes over 90 for the other number, I think. She showed me the machine reading, but it just looked like a bunch of digits to me! I don't really pay attention to that stuff. It was at the community center check-up, and then again last week at my friend’s place when she got one of those blood pressure cuffs.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, consistently over 140/90 is considered elevated, Ms. Sladen. It’s good you’re getting it checked out, even if you don’t follow the numbers closely. Let's get a proper reading here to start. Have you been experiencing any symptoms—headaches, dizziness, vision changes, chest pain, shortness of breath—anything at all that you've noticed accompanying these readings?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No chest pain or shortness of breath, definitely not. Headaches… I get headaches sometimes, but I think that’s just from looking at screens all day. I do a lot of online stuff for work, you know? And dizziness… maybe a little bit when I stand up too fast sometimes, but I always figured that was just ‘cause I’m a little quick! I haven't noticed anything different lately, if that makes sense. Nothing I’d connect to my blood pressure, anyway.
DOCTOR: “A little quick,” right. Okay. And what sort of work do you do online, Ms. Sladen?
PATIENT: I do… well, a bit of everything, really. Mostly I help people with little tasks online. Like, scheduling appointments, booking travel, that sort of thing. And some customer service emails. It’s all freelance, so it keeps me busy. It's Personal Care and Service Workers, All Other, is what they call it. It's a bit of everything, really. Not very stressful though, not usually. Mostly just sitting and typing.
DOCTOR: Right. Freelance work. And you mentioned sitting for long periods. Do you have any family history of hypertension – high blood pressure – or heart disease?
PATIENT: Let me see… My grandmother, on my mom’s side, she had high blood pressure, I think. She was always a bit frail, and the doctors told her to watch her salt intake. And my uncle, he had a heart attack a few years ago, but he wasn’t very healthy, if you know what I mean. He smoked a lot and didn’t really take care of himself. But other than that, not really. My mom’s pretty healthy, and my dad passed away when I was young, so I don’t really know much about his health. Does that help?
DOCTOR: It’s… something. And what about any allergies, Ms. Sladen?
PATIENT: Um, not that I know of. I can eat pretty much anything. No reactions to any medications I’ve ever taken, either. I haven’t been on much medication, thankfully! Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, that’s it. No food allergies, no skin allergies, nothing like that. I'm pretty lucky, I guess!
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s good. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Sure, that’s fine. Whatever you need me to do, Doctor. Just let me know.
DOCTOR: Please have a seat and lie back. I’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. And I'll check your pulse and blood pressure, of course. Heart sounds are regular, but a little rapid. Lungs are clear. Pulse is 88 and bounding. 152 over 94. Hmm. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. No masses. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Okay. We’ll need to run some labs to get a better understanding of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Labs? Like, blood work? What are you looking for, Doctor? Is it something serious? I haven’t been sick in ages, and I feel perfectly fine, apart from maybe a little tired sometimes. Is my blood pressure really that bad? I just… I don’t want to have to take a bunch of pills if I don’t need to.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sladen, elevated blood pressure is something to take seriously. It can lead to heart disease, stroke, kidney problems – a whole host of complications. It doesn’t mean you’re immediately facing any of those, but it does mean we need to investigate. The blood work will check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, cholesterol, and blood sugar. It will also rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your hypertension. And yes, you may need medication. It depends on what the results show. We aren’t jumping to conclusions here. We’re gathering information. Do you consent to the blood work?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Kidney problems… that sounds scary. I didn’t even think about that. Um… yeah, okay. If it’s important, I guess I consent to the blood work. But… will it hurt? And how long will it take? And what if I faint? I don’t really like needles.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sladen, it’s a standard blood draw. It will be a brief discomfort—a quick pinch. As for fainting, it’s rare, but if you’re prone to it, just let the phlebotomist know. They're trained to handle those situations. The blood work itself will take about ten minutes to complete, and the results should be back in a few days. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, I recommend reducing your sodium intake and engaging in regular physical activity. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any other… anxieties I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Regular physical activity… okay. I guess I could try to walk more. I mostly just sit at my computer all day. Um… no, I don’t think so. Just the needle thing. And… worrying about what the results will be, I guess. Is there anything I should be specifically looking out for in the meantime? Like, if I get a really bad headache or something? Should I go to the emergency room?
DOCTOR: Ms. Sladen, I understand you’re anxious, but you're catastrophizing. If you experience severe chest pain, sudden vision changes, difficulty speaking, or weakness on one side of your body, then go to the emergency room. A routine headache is not an emergency. The nurse will explain the process. I’ll see you in a few days to discuss the results. Try to remain calm.
PATIENT: Okay…severe chest pain. Got it. I think. Thank you, Doctor.
