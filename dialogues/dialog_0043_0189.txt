DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about my… situation. Not something a man likes to talk about, you understand. But here I am. It’s… blood. In my stool. Happened a couple of times now. Not a good sign, I reckon. Never had this happen before, and I’ve lived a long life. A long life.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s certainly not easy discussing these things, and you’re right to be concerned. It’s good you came in to have it checked. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe the blood to me?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you mean, describe it? It’s… red. Blood is red, isn't it? Look, I’m not a doctor, I fly planes. Or used to fly planes. It wasn’t a little dab, mind you. It was… noticeable. Mixed in with everything else. And it smelled… well, it smelled like you'd expect. Not pleasant, that’s for sure. Is there something wrong with my eyes? Am I supposed to be able to see different colors of blood?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Rowbottom, you're not failing an eye exam! That was a fair question. What I was trying to ascertain is whether it was bright red blood, dark and tarry blood, or if there was any mucus present. Bright red blood usually indicates bleeding closer to the rectum, while dark, tarry stools suggest bleeding higher up in the digestive tract. The presence of mucus can also be helpful information. Could you tell me if the blood was mixed throughout the stool, or was it coating the outside?
PATIENT: Coating the outside, I think. Yes, that's it. Definitely coating. Not mixed in, like stirred up. More like… a layer. A nasty layer. And it wasn't a huge amount, but enough to make a man take notice. Honestly, I’ve seen cleaner things come out of an airplane engine after a long flight. And that says something, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. That’s helpful. And I appreciate your… descriptive analogy. Now, has this happened more than just a couple of times?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. It's happened three times now. Three times in the last… oh, about a week. First time, I thought it was something I ate. You know, a beet or something. But then it happened again. And again. A man can't ignore something like that three times, can he? And it's not getting better. That’s the problem.
DOCTOR: No, three times in a week is certainly concerning, and the fact that it hasn't resolved is important. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Other than the… unpleasantness? Let me see. My stomach's been a bit… rumbly. Not a sharp pain, just… unsettled. And I've been a little tired, I suppose. But I'm eighty-eight years old, Doctor. What isn't tired? I chalked it up to getting older. But now that you mention it, maybe it’s not just old age.
DOCTOR: That’s good you’ve been aware of those changes, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s important to consider everything. Now, have you experienced any weight loss recently, or any changes in your bowel habits – such as diarrhea or constipation – besides this bleeding?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. Now that is a good question. My daughter’s always telling me I need to eat more. She says I’m too thin. I haven’t been weighing myself regularly, though. Can’t be bothered with all that. And as for… habits. Well, they’ve been a bit… irregular. Sometimes easy, sometimes… not so much. Just what you'd expect at my age. Everything slows down, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s understandable, Mr. Rowbottom. Now, I’m going to ask about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. Had that for years. Doc put me on pills for it. Take ‘em every day, mostly. Sometimes I forget, but mostly. Diabetes, no. Never had that. And my heart… well, it’s still ticking, isn't it? Had a bit of a flutter now and then, but nothing serious. Never needed any fancy operations or anything. I've been lucky, I suppose. Until this, of course. This is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. That’s helpful. And it’s good that you’ve been managing your blood pressure. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, there's a little something for my arthritis. Hands get a bit stiff, you know? Can't grip things as well as I used to. And sometimes I take something for sleep, if I'm really restless. But that's it, I think. Just the blood pressure pills and the arthritis stuff. And the sleep aid when I need it. I don’t take a lot of pills. I’m not one for relying on medicine unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not really. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to be a pretty rugged fella, you know? Travelled all over the world. Ate all sorts of things. Didn’t bother me none. A little heartburn now and then, but that’s it. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Although my daughter always said I was allergic to common sense sometimes… but that’s a different story.
DOCTOR: I understand. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Do you know of any family members who have had colon cancer, stomach cancer, or any other digestive problems?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… that’s a tough one. My mother died young, heart trouble. Father lived a long life, but he wasn’t one for talking about his ailments. My brother… he had some kind of trouble with his stomach, years ago. But I don’t remember the details. Nothing serious, I don’t think. We weren’t a family for discussing these things, you see. Just… kept to ourselves.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Any information is helpful. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched the stuff in my life. Disgusting habit. My father smoked, and he always smelled awful. Ruined his lungs, as far as I could tell. No, sir. Never smoked. And I don’t approve of it.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… well, I used to enjoy a little scotch now and then. After a long flight, you know? A little something to unwind. But I haven't had a drink in… oh, must be ten years now. Doctor told me to cut back, and I did. Mostly. A little glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, maybe. But nothing regular. I'm not a big drinker. Never was.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and then I'd like to do a rectal exam. This will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on.
PATIENT: A… a rectal exam? Now hold on a minute. I don’t know about that, Doctor. That sounds… intrusive. Is that absolutely necessary? I'm an old man. I've lived a long life. Surely, there’s another way? I’m not comfortable with that. Not at all.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize if that was abrupt. It’s not something anyone enjoys, but it's a very important part of evaluating the source of bleeding, particularly given your symptoms. It allows me to check for any abnormalities, masses, or signs of blood in the rectum. I want to assure you I will be as gentle and quick as possible, and maintain your privacy and dignity throughout. However, without it, it's difficult to determine the cause of the bleeding and ensure we are on the right path for diagnosis. We can start with listening to your heart and lungs and feeling your abdomen, and then reassess whether the rectal exam is needed, though I strongly advise against delaying it if we want to get to the bottom of this quickly and accurately. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Well… I suppose you're the doctor. And I do want to find out what's going on. I don't like the thought of it, not one bit. But I understand what you're saying. If it's really necessary… then I suppose I'll let you. But be quick about it, Doctor. And gentle. Very gentle. And no unnecessary poking around. I’ve lived a long life, and I’m not about to be humiliated now.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. I appreciate your trust, and I assure you I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I will explain everything as I go, and you can let me know if you feel any discomfort at any time. Alright, if you could please lie on your side, with your knees bent… we'll begin with the abdominal exam first. I'm just going to listen for any unusual sounds and feel for any tenderness. After that, we can proceed with the rectal exam. Everything seems normal here, Mr. Rowbottom. No tenderness or unusual masses. Now, let me know if anything feels uncomfortable as I move onto the rectal exam.
PATIENT: Just get it over with, Doctor. The sooner it's done, the better. Don't dawdle. And warn me before you… before you do anything. I don't want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m going to gently insert a lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum. I’ll be feeling for any abnormalities, masses, or signs of blood. It may feel a little pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. I'm just starting now… Okay, I’m finished. I did feel a small, somewhat tender area on the left side of your rectum. There was no obvious blood on my finger. It’s difficult to determine the significance of this without further investigation, but it could be a hemorrhoid or a small polyp. It's too small to assess the full extent of it during a manual exam.
PATIENT: A polyp? Is that… bad? Hemorrhoids I understand, but a polyp… that sounds serious. Is it cancer? My brother… he had some trouble with his stomach, you said. Could it be something like that? I don’t want any fancy operations, Doctor. I’m too old for that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom, let’s take a deep breath. A polyp doesn't automatically mean cancer. Most polyps are benign – harmless growths – but some can develop into cancer over time. That’s why it’s important to investigate it further. And while your brother’s stomach trouble could be relevant, it’s difficult to say without knowing the specifics. However, a polyp in the rectum is a different issue than stomach trouble, and it’s important to address it directly. As for fancy operations, we’re not talking about surgery right now. The next step is a colonoscopy. It’s a procedure where a thin, flexible tube with a camera is inserted into your rectum to visualize the entire colon and remove any polyps for biopsy. This will allow us to determine if the polyp is benign or cancerous, and develop a treatment plan accordingly. It’s the gold standard for diagnosing and preventing colon cancer. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… That sounds… invasive. And expensive, I imagine. I'm not insured, Doctor. Never could afford it. And a camera… going inside? I don’t know… I don’t like the sound of that at all. Can’t we just… leave it alone? Maybe it will go away on its own? I've been lucky so far. Why bother with all this trouble?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Rowbottom, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel anxious about a colonoscopy, especially given your lack of insurance. It's not a pleasant procedure, but it's the most effective way to rule out cancer and prevent serious complications. Unfortunately, polyps rarely go away on their own, and ignoring them can lead to more serious problems down the line, including colon cancer. I know the cost is a major concern, and I want to assure you I will do everything I can to help you explore options. We can look into financial assistance programs, charity care, or potentially lower-cost facilities. I also have a referral to a gastroenterologist, Dr. Chen, who has experience working with uninsured patients. She may be able to offer more affordable solutions. We can discuss those options, or if you prefer, we could at least start with a fecal immunochemical test, or FIT test. It's a stool test that can detect hidden blood, and if it's positive, it would be a stronger indicator that further investigation is needed. It's less accurate than a colonoscopy, but it’s a good starting point. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: A stool test… that doesn’t sound so bad, I suppose. Better than a camera going inside. And if it’s negative… then maybe I don't need to worry about all this trouble. But if it is positive… then what? Then I'm back to the colonoscopy, and the expenses, and all the hassle. Alright, Doctor. Let’s start with the stool test. But please, don’t push me into anything I’m not comfortable with. I’m an old man. I just want to live out my days in peace.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rowbottom. I completely understand. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I will never push you into anything you’re not comfortable with. Your peace of mind is my priority. Alright, I have a fecal immunochemical test kit here. It's a simple test – you’ll just need to collect a small stool sample at home and bring it back to the clinic. The instructions are straightforward, and my nurse, Sarah, will be happy to walk you through it if you have any questions. It will take about a week to get the results back, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any changes in your bowel habits, such as persistent diarrhea, constipation, or noticeable bleeding, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… a stool test. Seems a bit undignified for an airline pilot, but… alright. Thank you, Doctor. For not pushing me too hard. I suppose I'll be seeing you in a week. Stop.
