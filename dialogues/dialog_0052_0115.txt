DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's...well, it's my skin, you see. It’s become rather yellow. A friend suggested I come see someone. Something about my liver? I don't recall all the details, truthfully. I just feel a bit tired, and this yellowing...it's quite alarming.
DOCTOR: I see. Yellowing of the skin is certainly something we should investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me when you first noticed this yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a difficult question. Time… it slips away, you know? Perhaps… a few weeks ago? It started subtly, I think. I didn't pay it much mind at first, dismissing it as a trick of the light. But it’s become more noticeable lately. I really can't be certain, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Durig. We’ll do our best to figure it out. And it's good you came in to have it checked. Has the yellowing been getting worse steadily, or has it come and gone?
PATIENT: Steadily, I believe. It hasn't really gone away at all, if that makes sense. It just… deepened, perhaps? It’s a bit unsettling to look at, truthfully. And I’ve been feeling a bit… unwell. Not terribly sick, mind you, just… off. A lack of energy, mostly. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. A gradual change and accompanying fatigue are important details. Besides the yellowing and tiredness, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I've had a bit of an upset stomach, now and then. Nothing severe, just… indigestion, perhaps? And my appetite hasn't been quite the same. I don’t feel hungry, exactly. But nothing that I would have immediately brought to a doctor's attention, if you understand. It’s all rather vague, I’m afraid. I truly wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. Durig. Even vague symptoms can provide important clues. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as liver problems, gallbladder issues, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's another thing I struggle with remembering. I've seen… many doctors over the years. I believe, a long time ago, something about… hepatitis? But it was so long ago, and I don’t recall the specifics. It wasn't a recent diagnosis, I can assure you. And I don’t believe I've ever been told I have problems with my gallbladder or… that other thing you mentioned. It all blurs together, Doctor. I apologize. Is it important? Perhaps my previous records could be helpful?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, and yes, your previous records would be very beneficial if we can access them. Let me check our system. Ah, here we are. It appears you were diagnosed with Hepatitis A approximately 40 years ago, and it resolved on its own. No other significant liver or gallbladder issues are noted. Do you recall anything about that episode?
PATIENT: Forty years… Goodness. That was a long time ago. I… vaguely remember being quite ill. A fever, I think. And feeling terribly nauseous. But the details… they are lost to time, Doctor. It was a stressful period in my life, and I’ve tried not to dwell on unpleasant memories. So, it resolved on its own, you say? That's… reassuring, I suppose. Is it possible this yellowing is related to that old illness?
DOCTOR: It’s possible, though less likely given the timeframe. Sometimes past infections can have long-term effects, but 40 years is a considerable time. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any family members – parents, siblings, children – who have had liver problems, jaundice , or any other serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… That's another tricky one. My family… we weren’t terribly forthcoming about such things. My mother… she was a very private woman. I believe my father had some sort of… stomach trouble, but I don’t recall the specifics. And my siblings… I haven’t seen them in many years. I truly don’t know if anyone in my family suffered from those conditions you mentioned. I apologize for my lack of information, Doctor. It’s not that I won’t tell you, it’s simply that I don’t know. Is there anything else I can offer? Perhaps a list of medications I take? Though I don’t take much…
DOCTOR: You’re providing all you can, Ms. Durig, and that’s perfectly alright. Knowing what you don’t know is helpful as well. Yes, let’s talk about medications. Could you please tell me all the medications you currently take, including any over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Well, let me see. I take a small dose of… this. It’s for my blood pressure, I believe. My doctor prescribed it a few years ago. And… Oh, and a multivitamin, every morning. Just a standard one, nothing fancy. And… I sometimes take an antacid, if I’m feeling indigestion. That’s all, Doctor. Truly. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. It always makes me feel… unwell. Is that sufficient? I do hope I haven’t forgotten anything…
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Durig. The blood pressure medication and multivitamin are noted. Now, let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had a severe reaction to anything. I might get a slight itch sometimes, but nothing that would require medical attention. I used to be allergic to pollen as a child, but that seems to have subsided with age. Truly, I don’t believe I have any significant allergies. I’m rather fortunate in that regard, I suppose. Is there anything else you need to know before… well, before you begin the examination? I must admit, I’m eager to be finished, if that’s not too forward of me. I have a few errands to run, and time… well, it slips away, as I mentioned earlier.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Durig. No, no allergies. And I understand your eagerness. Let’s proceed with a brief physical exam. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check the color of your skin more closely. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Though I must warn you, I’m not particularly fond of examinations. I’ve always been rather… sensitive. But if it’s necessary, then I suppose I can endure it. Please be gentle, if you would. And do let me know if you’re going to touch me in a… unexpected place. I apologize for my apprehension, but I’ve had unpleasant experiences in the past. Let’s get it over with, shall we? The sooner it’s finished, the sooner I can be on my way.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Durig. I will be as gentle and thorough as possible, and I will explain everything I am doing before I do it. Your comfort is my priority. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the upper right quadrant. I notice the jaundice is quite pronounced in your sclera - the whites of your eyes - and your skin has a yellowish tinge. I don’t feel any masses or enlarged organs. Based on my examination, the jaundice is evident. The tenderness in your upper right quadrant is also concerning. Given your history of Hepatitis A and these findings, I’m concerned about a potential issue with your liver or gallbladder. However, we need further testing to confirm.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound very pleasant. A problem with my liver… Is it serious, Doctor? Will I need… surgery? I truly hope not. I’m not a young woman anymore, and recovery… well, it takes much longer these days. What sort of tests do you have in mind? And how long will they take? I have a bridge club meeting next week, and I wouldn't want to miss it. It’s the only social engagement I have, you see. I apologize for my concerns, but I’m easily agitated by medical matters. Just tell me what needs to be done, and I’ll try to cooperate. Let’s get it over with, shall we? The sooner it’s finished, the better.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Durig, and I will do my best to address them. It's too early to say definitively whether it's serious or if surgery will be necessary. We need to run some tests first to determine the cause of the jaundice and the extent of any potential liver issues. I'm going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your liver function, a complete blood count to check for infection, and a bilirubin level to confirm the jaundice. We’ll also need to order an abdominal ultrasound to visualize your liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts. These tests will require a blood draw and the ultrasound will take about 30-45 minutes. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Once we have those results, we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: A blood draw… and an ultrasound. Oh dear. Is the blood draw going to be painful? I’ve always been rather faint-hearted when it comes to needles. And the ultrasound… will it be uncomfortable? Will I need to undress? I truly hope not. I’m not comfortable exposing myself to strangers. And 24-48 hours… that seems like an eternity! What if it’s something terrible? What if I need… hospitalization? Oh dear, oh dear. I apologize for my incessant questioning, Doctor. It's just that medical matters… they frighten me so. Is there anything I can do to prepare for these tests? Any medications I should avoid? Perhaps a calming tea? Or a strong drink? No, no, that’s probably not advisable. Just tell me what I need to do, and I’ll try to cooperate. But please be gentle, if you would. And please hurry, if you would. The sooner it’s finished, the better.
DOCTOR: You’re not being at all troublesome, Ms. Durig. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about medical tests. I’ll address your concerns as best I can. The blood draw will be a quick pinch, and our phlebotomist is very experienced. We can have you lie down during the draw to minimize any lightheadedness. As for the ultrasound, you will not need to undress completely. You will likely be asked to wear a gown, and you’ll lie on a table. The technician will apply a gel to your abdomen and move a probe over your skin. It’s painless, though you may feel a little pressure. You don’t need to do anything special to prepare for the tests. You can eat and drink normally, and you can continue taking any medications you currently take unless I specifically advise you otherwise. I’m going to write an order for these tests and have my nurse come in to draw your blood and schedule the ultrasound. Once we have the results, we will discuss them in detail and develop a plan of action. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. It seems I have no choice but to proceed. A quick pinch… and a little pressure. I suppose I can endure that. And I can continue taking my blood pressure medication. That’s… reassuring. Please do be gentle, if you would. And please hurry, if you would. I have a bridge club meeting next week, and I wouldn't want to miss it. It’s the only social engagement I have, you see. Perhaps… perhaps you could explain the results to me in simple terms? I don’t understand all the medical jargon. And please be honest with me, if you would. I’d rather know the truth, even if it’s not what I want to hear. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. Now, let’s get it over with, shall we? The sooner it’s finished, the better.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Durig. I understand your concerns, and I will do my best to make this as comfortable and straightforward as possible. I will explain the results to you in plain language, and I will be honest with you every step of the way. I will also ensure that you have time to ask any questions you may have. You are an active participant in your care, and I want you to feel informed and empowered. Nurse Emily, could you please come in and draw Ms. Durig’s blood and schedule an abdominal ultrasound for her?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be back with you as soon as we have the results of your tests. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to let my staff know if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you for your patience, Ms. Durig. And please try to relax. .
