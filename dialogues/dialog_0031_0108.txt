DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It's a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Gentz is the name. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, to be honest. But… well, I’ve been throwing up blood. Not a ton, mind you, but enough to be… concerning. It started a couple days ago. Just… came up. Not pleasant.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Gentz. It’s good you came in, even if it wasn’t something you typically do. Vomiting blood is concerning, and we want to figure out what’s causing it. When you say a couple of days ago, can you recall anything specific that might have triggered it?
PATIENT: Triggered it? What do you mean, like… did I want to throw up blood? No, of course not. I just… eat. I eat what I eat. Mostly lamb, honestly. Good quality stuff, though. Not that cheap, processed garbage. I don’t know. Nothing different happened. Same as always. Maybe… maybe I had a bit too much spice the night before it started? But I eat spicy food all the time.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question was unclear, Mr. Gentz. I simply meant were you feeling unwell beforehand, or did anything unusual happen around the time the vomiting started?
PATIENT: Unusual? Look, my life is unusual. I work in a crematory. What do you expect? Perfectly normal days are rare. Before the… incident? I felt fine. A little tired, maybe. Work's been busy. Lots of… business, you know? But nothing that would make me think I’d be hacking up my insides. Honestly, doc, I’m a pretty sturdy guy. It takes a lot to get me down.
DOCTOR: I understand your line of work is demanding, Mr. Gentz. It sounds like you’re generally quite resilient. To clarify, when you say a little tired, was that a new level of fatigue, or your usual state?
PATIENT: Usual. Definitely usual. I don't sleep great. Never have. Too much… thinking, I guess. It's a quiet job, you get time to… reflect. Not that anyone cares about that. Tired, achy, the usual. Look, is this going somewhere? Are you gonna tell me I need to take a vacation? Because frankly, I can’t afford a vacation. And who would run the place?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mr. Gentz. We're trying to gather as much information as possible to understand what might be causing the vomiting of blood. It’s important to rule out any serious underlying causes. Let's move on to some other questions, if you don't mind. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, or diarrhea alongside the vomiting?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain? A little. Just… general discomfort. Like I ate something that didn’t quite agree with me. Which happens. Lamb isn't always perfect, you know? Nausea, yeah, before I actually… well, you know. Diarrhea… no. Not really. Solid. Everything else is… well, it’s been bad enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. And have you noticed any other symptoms, such as black, tarry stools, weakness, dizziness, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Black stools? No. Everything's... normal colored, if you want to call it that. Weakness, a little, but that's the job. Lifting things, the heat... it takes it out of you. Dizziness… not really. I’m a pretty tall guy, I get lightheaded sometimes if I stand up too fast. Short of breath? No, I haven’t been running marathons or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or liver problems?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Doc, I barely have time to eat, let alone go to doctors. No. Nothing. Never been diagnosed with anything. A little arthritis in my hands, maybe, from the work. But that's it. I'm a simple man. And I've been perfectly healthy… until this, obviously.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. I've broken a few bones over the years – nothing serious, just work accidents. Sprains, strains, that sort of thing. But no surgeries. No hospitals. I avoid those places like the plague. Too many… sick people.
DOCTOR: Understood. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Look, I take a multivitamin sometimes. When I remember. And I take some ibuprofen for my hands when they're really acting up. That's it. Nothing else. I don't like relying on pills. They just mask the problem, they don't fix it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had an allergic reaction to anything. I eat everything. Lamb, spices, you name it. I'm pretty resilient, remember? My wife… she was the one with the allergies. All sorts of things. But me? Nope. Solid as a rock.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Gentz. Now, could you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? That's… complicated. My wife’s family, they had… heart problems, mostly. Lots of early deaths. My side? My father was Yemeni, came over here a long time ago. He… didn’t talk much about his family. Tough life, I imagine. Lots of… hardship. Nothing specific I can tell you. Lots of early deaths overall, I suppose. It wasn’t a family that… celebrated good health.
DOCTOR: I understand. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol? Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Nothing heavy. Recreational drugs? Don't insult me. I have a business to run. I don't have time for that nonsense. I need a clear head.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Gentz. That gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and look for any signs of bleeding or other abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I got things to do. Just… be quick about it, alright? And try not to poke too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. I'll be as efficient as possible. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is slightly tender in the upper right quadrant, but there's no rigidity or guarding. I don't see any signs of bruising or jaundice on your skin. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72. I’d like to check your stool for occult blood. It’s a simple test that can help us determine if there’s any hidden bleeding in your digestive tract. I'll also order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests. These tests will give us a more detailed picture of your overall health and help us rule out any underlying medical conditions. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Occult blood? Hidden bleeding? Look, I already told you, I threw up blood. What more do you need to know? Fine, check the stool. Whatever. And the blood tests, sure. Just… get it done. The sooner I know what's wrong, the sooner I can get back to work. But frankly, I think I just ate something bad. Probably the lamb.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Gentz. While you've already vomited blood, it's important to determine the source and extent of any bleeding. The stool test will help us confirm if there’s ongoing bleeding in your digestive tract, even if it’s not visible to the naked eye. The blood tests will help us assess your overall health and rule out other possible causes of your symptoms. I'll have the nurse draw the blood samples now, and I’ll give you a container for the stool sample. Please collect a small amount of stool and bring it back to the clinic as soon as possible. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding spicy foods and lamb until we get the test results back. I'll also prescribe a medication to help reduce the acid in your stomach. It may help alleviate some of your symptoms. If you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, dizziness, or black, tarry stools, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Emergency room? You think I’m gonna end up in the emergency room? Look, I’m a sturdy guy. I don’t need any emergency rooms. Fine, I’ll avoid the spice and the lamb. But frankly, I think this is all a waste of time. And what about the medication? What’s it for, exactly? What are the side effects? I don’t like taking pills I don’t understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Gentz. I'm not saying you will end up in the emergency room, but it's always best to be prepared for the worst-case scenario. I want to ensure you receive prompt medical attention if your symptoms worsen. The medication I'm prescribing is a proton pump inhibitor, called Omeprazole. It reduces the amount of acid your stomach produces, which can help heal any irritation in your digestive tract and prevent further bleeding. Common side effects are mild, such as headache, diarrhea, or nausea. Serious side effects are rare, but you should contact me immediately if you experience any severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or changes in your stool. I understand you prefer not to take unnecessary medications, and I respect that. However, in this case, I believe the potential benefits outweigh the risks. Do you have any other concerns I can address at this point?
PATIENT: Omeprazole… sounds like something they give to sick people. Fine. I’ll try it. But if I start feeling worse, I'm stopping it. And I’m not coming back here. Honestly, I think I just need to rest. Maybe I’m working too hard. But frankly, I got bills to pay. Rest isn’t an option. Get me the prescription, doc. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gentz. I’ll have the nurse prepare the prescription for Omeprazole now. She will also provide you with instructions on how to take it and what to watch out for. I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that I'm here to support you throughout this process. If you experience any worsening symptoms, or have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Here's a summary of our plan: 1. Take Omeprazole as directed. 2. Avoid spicy foods and lamb until we get the test results back. 3. Collect a stool sample and bring it back to the clinic as soon as possible. 4. Contact the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms. I wish you a speedy recovery, Mr. Gentz. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. That's it. Just... get me out of here. I got things to do. And frankly, I don't like being poked and prodded. .
