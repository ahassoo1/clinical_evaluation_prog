DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, Doctor… Donate, is it? Yes. It’s my vision, you see. It's… fading. Not all at once, thankfully, but it’s concerning. It’s just… not as sharp as it used to be. And frankly, I’ve always had excellent eyesight, so this is quite a bother.
DOCTOR: Excellent eyesight, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, indeed. Never needed glasses a day in my life until… well, recently. My grandfather, he had a similar issue, though he was much older when it started. A proud Cherokee man, he was. Always said good eyes were a gift from the land. Not that his fading meant anything, of course. People change. But my vision… it’s different.
DOCTOR: Right. Family history is…relevant. So, how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question. It's been… gradual. Perhaps six months? Maybe longer. It's hard to pinpoint. I didn’t initially pay it much mind. Just figured it was fatigue, spending too long at the computer. Though I do have a rather important position at my office, you understand. Not everyone can handle the responsibility. It’s only gotten… noticeably worse in the last month or so, I’d say. Enough to be… disruptive.
DOCTOR: Disruptive how?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, let’s just say reading reports isn’t as… efficient as it once was. I have to hold things further away, squint… things of that nature. And the colors aren't as vibrant, you see. It impacts my ability to… properly assess things. Important things. I wouldn’t expect you to understand the nuances, of course. It requires a certain… discerning eye. A quality that seems to be… diminishing. It's quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned colors being less vibrant. Is that affecting everything you see, or just certain things?
PATIENT: Just certain things, I believe. Blues and greens seem particularly… muted. Reds are still quite strong, thankfully. Not that it matters much, really. It’s not as if I’m an artist. Though I do have an appreciation for fine things, when they’re done correctly. I suppose it's just… a general dulling of the world, if you will. Though I wouldn't expect you to grasp the gravity of that. Some people simply aren't attuned to such subtleties.
DOCTOR: Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. No… not really. No pain, no floaters, no double vision. Just the… fading and the dulling. Though, now that you mention it, I have been feeling… rather tired lately. But that's likely due to the… stresses of my position. And the general… decline in the quality of people these days. It’s exhausting, frankly, trying to maintain standards. I can't imagine what you deal with. But no, nothing directly related to my eyes, as far as I can tell.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look at your eyes. I'm going to check your visual acuity, your peripheral vision, and examine the back of your eye. It will just take a few moments. Please look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Though I must say, I find the whole process rather… undignified. Staring at letters, having things shone in my eyes… Still, if it’s necessary, I suppose. Just… try to be gentle. I have sensitive eyes, you understand. And please, no unnecessary poking and prodding. I have a very important schedule to maintain. Proceed, Doctor. But with care.
DOCTOR: Starting with your right eye. Cover your left eye with your hand, please. Read the smallest line you can see.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this chart is rather… poorly designed. The letters are so… uniform. No artistic flair whatsoever. But very well. Let's see… I can make out the larger letters, of course. But the smaller ones… hmm. It's blurry. Quite blurry. I can perhaps discern… the first few on the second line, but beyond that… it's all rather indistinct. I'd say my vision is… significantly diminished. Though I suspect you already knew that. A trained professional, after all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, cover your right eye and read the smallest line you can see with your left eye.
PATIENT: Goodness. This is… worse. Considerably worse. The letters are practically swimming. I can barely make out the first line at all. Perhaps… a few indistinct shapes on the second. It's… quite alarming, actually. I hadn't realized it had deteriorated this much. This is unacceptable. Utterly unacceptable. Is there something wrong with your equipment, Doctor? Perhaps a faulty chart? A dim light source? It's simply not possible that my vision is this poor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Let's take a look at your pupils. Just follow my light with your eyes. I'm just checking your reaction to light and the size of your pupils. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. No obvious afferent pupillary defect. I'll now check your peripheral vision. I'm going to ask you to focus on this point, and I'll present some objects in your side vision. Just let me know when you see them.
PATIENT: Very well. Though I must say, this whole process is rather… invasive. Shining lights in my eyes, testing my peripheral vision… It’s quite unsettling. I trust you’re maintaining proper hygiene? One can never be too careful. Proceed, Doctor. But with a degree of… discretion. And please, no sudden movements. I have a sensitive disposition. I’ll do my best to cooperate, but I can’t promise much. My attention span is… limited.
DOCTOR: Focus on this point straight ahead. Now, tell me when you see something in your left peripheral vision… and then in your right. Alright. Your peripheral vision appears intact, though slightly diminished on the far edges. I'll now perform a quick fundoscopic exam to look at the back of your eye. This will involve looking through a special lens. It won't be comfortable, but it's important.
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens. More poking and prodding? This is becoming quite unbearable. "Slightly diminished," you say? That sounds… ominous. I trust you're a highly qualified optometrist? I wouldn't want to entrust my vision to just anyone. This whole experience is rather… distressing, actually. A perfectly good afternoon wasted on… indignities. Proceed, Doctor, but I warn you, I have a very low tolerance for discomfort. And please, be gentle. Very gentle. I expect a full explanation of your findings afterward, you understand. None of this… medical jargon. Plain English.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. The fundoscopic exam reveals mild optic disc pallor bilaterally, and some early signs of drusen. The rest of the retina appears normal. No hemorrhages, exudates, or macular degeneration. Now, in plain English, what this means is that there's some slight fading of the optic nerve in both eyes, and some small deposits in the macula. This is consistent with early signs of age-related macular degeneration, although it's still quite early. It's also possible this is related to glaucoma, but we'd need further testing to determine that. The vision loss you're experiencing, along with the color changes, can be explained by this.
PATIENT: “Age-related macular degeneration?” Good heavens. That sounds… dreadful. I’m not that old, you know. I maintain a very active lifestyle, despite the… decline in societal standards. And "slight fading of the optic nerve?" That sounds… concerning. Is it serious? Will I go blind? I have important things to see, Doctor. Important reports to review, important people to… assess. And "further testing?" What does that entail? More lights in my eyes? More poking and prodding? I sincerely hope this won’t involve any… invasive procedures. I have a very busy schedule, you understand. A full explanation, Doctor. And a clear prognosis. None of this… vague terminology. What are my options? Can it be fixed? And what will it cost? I expect transparency, you understand. Complete and utter transparency.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Let’s address your concerns. First, age-related macular degeneration is common, and doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll go blind. It progresses at different rates in different people. The early stage we're seeing now often responds well to treatment. Regarding your concern about blindness, we’re a long way from that point. But it is important to monitor it. Further testing would involve a visual field test to assess your peripheral vision in more detail, and an optical coherence tomography, or OCT, scan of your macula. The OCT scan gives us a detailed cross-sectional image of the retina and can help us determine the extent of the damage. These tests aren’t invasive, just more detailed imaging. As for treatment, options include AREDS 2 supplements, which contain vitamins and minerals shown to slow the progression of the disease, and, in some cases, injections into the eye. The injections are the more aggressive treatment, and are reserved for more advanced cases. The cost of the tests varies. A visual field test is around $150, and an OCT scan is around $300. Supplements are around $50 a month. I recommend we proceed with the visual field test and OCT scan to get a clearer picture of what we’re dealing with. Then we can discuss treatment options in more detail. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: “Supplements?” Good heavens. I eat a perfectly balanced diet, thank you very much. Though the quality of produce has certainly declined in recent years. And “injections into the eye?” Absolutely not. That sounds… barbaric. I will not permit anyone to inject anything into my eye. Absolutely not. “Barbaric,” I say. And $300 for a scan? That seems… excessive. Are you certain there aren’t more affordable options? I’m not inclined to spend a fortune on… imaging. Very well. The visual field test, perhaps. But only if it’s… minimally invasive. And no injections. Absolutely none. I trust you understand. I’m not interested in any… aggressive treatments. I simply want a clear explanation of my condition and some… sensible advice. And no unnecessary prodding. Understood? Arrange the test, Doctor. But keep it brief. I have important matters to attend to. And I expect a full report afterward. In plain English, of course. None of this… medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. I understand. No injections. We'll proceed with the visual field test. I’ll get the order scheduled for you. It typically takes about 20 minutes and doesn’t involve any poking or prodding. Here's the referral for the visual field test. The appointment is scheduled for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM at the imaging center across the street. You can find the address and phone number on the form. They'll contact you to confirm. Once you have the results, please bring them back to me, and we can discuss them. I’ll do my best to explain everything in plain English. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Hmm. No, I suppose not. Just… ensure the technician is… competent. I wouldn't want any errors in the results. And please, make a note in my file that I am… highly sensitive to discomfort. And… is there anything I should do in the meantime? Any lifestyle changes I should be aware of? Aside from… avoiding stress, which is rather difficult in these trying times. Very well. I trust you've documented my aversion to injections. And my… sensitivity. Thank you, Doctor. Though I must say, this has been… less than enjoyable. But necessary, I suppose. Good day.
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ve documented your concerns, Mr. Alcorta. In the meantime, I recommend a diet rich in leafy green vegetables and omega-3 fatty acids, and protecting your eyes from excessive sunlight. And I'll refrain from mentioning injections again. Have a good day.
