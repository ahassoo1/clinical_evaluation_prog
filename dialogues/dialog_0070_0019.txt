DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Is... Abady, you say? Yes. Nice to meet you too. Um… my wife and I… we are thinking about… a baby. She is… not so young anymore, and I… well, I want to make sure everything is okay. Before… you know. It's a little… complicated to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Carlotta. It’s perfectly alright to take your time. It is a significant decision, and it's wise to be thorough. So, to clarify, you and your wife are considering starting a family, and you'd like me to assess your overall health to ensure you're fit for parenthood?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… right. Fit for… yes. I make things with my hands, little… models. Metal and plastic. But… making a baby is… different, yes? I want to be strong. For her. And… the baby. Is that… what you do? Check if I am… strong enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Carlotta, that’s precisely what I do. We’ll assess your overall health, review your medical history, and perform a physical exam to get a good understanding of your current condition. We can also discuss any potential risks or concerns based on your age and lifestyle. You mentioned you work with your hands, making models—that’s excellent, but as you say, starting a family does present different demands on your body. To begin, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past… medical? Hmmm. That is… a long time ago. I remember… when I was small, in Somalia, I was very sick. Fever, very high. But I got better. After that… not much. I have… aches sometimes. Old man aches, you know? My wife, she takes me to the doctor for my blood pressure. That is all I remember. I have Medicare. Does that… help you?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Carlotta, your Medicare information is very helpful. Thank you. So, you had a significant fever when you were a child, and currently you’re being treated for high blood pressure. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medications… yes, pills. Small, white ones. Every morning. And… sometimes a different one if my pressure is too high. My wife, she gives them to me. I don't… remember the names. So many pills! She keeps them all organized. I just… take them.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Carlotta, it's very common to have difficulty remembering medication names. We can easily confirm the specifics with your wife. Knowing you take medication for your blood pressure is a good starting point. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reasons besides that childhood illness?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I think… once. Long, long ago. In my leg. I… broke it. Playing football, when I was young. But it healed very well. I walk okay, yes? It was a long time ago. No other… hospital visits. Just the fever when I was a little boy. And… the blood pressure doctor now, but that is not… a hospital. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: No, that’s very helpful, Mr. Carlotta. So, a broken leg in your childhood, and currently managed for high blood pressure. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that is… difficult. I don’t see my family anymore. I came… very far away. My wife’s family… they are all healthy, I think. She has… a sister with some trouble with her… heart, maybe? But she is old. And… my wife’s father, he had… problems with his sugar. That is all I remember. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Carlotta. It's perfectly alright if you don't have a lot of information. So, to summarize, your wife’s sister had some heart trouble, and her father had issues with his sugar levels. That's helpful to know. Now, before we move on, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no. I don't think so. I eat everything my wife makes me! She is a very good cook. Sometimes my skin… gets a little itchy. But that is just… dry skin, I think. Old man skin. No… I don’t think I am allergic to anything. No, definitely not.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, which is good. Now, Mr. Carlotta, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… hmm. I wake up, drink tea with my wife. I work in my workshop. I make models. I like to watch television sometimes. I walk… not very far. My legs… they get tired. I eat what my wife cooks. She makes very healthy food. I don’t… drink much alcohol. Maybe a little wine with dinner sometimes. That is my lifestyle. Simple.
DOCTOR: That sounds very peaceful, Mr. Carlotta. A simple and healthy lifestyle is excellent. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and just do a general assessment. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… fine. Whatever you need. Blood pressure… you already know about that! But… yes. Go ahead. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Carlotta. I appreciate your trust. If you could please have a seat here, we'll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is currently 145/88. That’s a little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, although I do detect a very faint murmur. It's likely benign, but we may want to investigate further with an EKG. Your lungs are clear, with good breath sounds bilaterally. Your reflexes are normal. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any tenderness or masses. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits, although the slightly elevated blood pressure and faint murmur warrant further investigation. Alright, Mr. Carlotta. Now that I’ve completed the physical exam, we can discuss some potential next steps.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. So… what does this mean? Is… everything okay? The murmur… is that bad? I don't want anything to… happen to me. My wife… she will be very worried.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Carlotta, and it's perfectly natural to be worried. The good news is, everything appears to be stable. The slightly elevated blood pressure is something we can manage with medication adjustments, if necessary. As for the murmur, it's quite common, especially as we get older. Often, it's harmless – what we call an "innocent murmur." However, to be absolutely certain, I would like to order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart's electrical activity. This will give us a more detailed picture of your heart function. We can also run some routine blood tests to check your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and sugar levels. These tests will help us get a comprehensive understanding of your overall health. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: EKG… blood tests… yes. That sounds… sensible. If it makes you sure. I want to be sure too. For my wife. And… if we are thinking about… a baby. I want to be strong. Can… can my wife come with me for the tests? She is better at remembering things. And… she asks good questions.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Carlotta. Your wife is very welcome to accompany you for the tests, and I encourage her to come. It’s always helpful to have a second pair of ears and a supportive partner during these appointments. She can certainly ask any questions that come to mind. I’ll have the nurse schedule those tests for you right away. They typically take about an hour to complete. Once the results are back, we’ll review them together and discuss a plan moving forward. In the meantime, please continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. You explained everything very well. Just… make sure my wife gets the appointment information. She is very good at organizing. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. I am happy to help. I will make a note for the nurse to contact your wife directly with the appointment details. It was a pleasure meeting you both. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. We will take good care of you.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Good bye.
