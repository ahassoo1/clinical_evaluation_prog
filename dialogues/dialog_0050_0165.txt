DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Just call me Clide. It’s this fever, keeps comin’ back. It’s been…well, a few times now over the last month or so. Gets me feelin’ pretty wiped out, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here that you’ve presented to the clinic on a few occasions recently. “Fever” is rather broad, Mr. Brege. Could you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate…right. Okay. It usually starts kinda slow, just feelin’ a little warm, achy. Then it really hits, you know, shivers, sweats… I take some Tylenol, usually knocks it down for a bit, but it always comes back. Usually lasts a day or two, then gone for a week or so, then…bam, it’s back again. It's been happening since...oh, around July 10th, I think. July 12th maybe. I keep track of these things, believe it or not.
DOCTOR: July 10th or 12th… commendable diligence, Mr. Brege. A fluctuating fever over the course of a month is… concerning. Now, when you say “achy,” can you pinpoint the location of the aches?
PATIENT: Well, it ain't just one spot, Doc. It's mostly my back, lower back mostly, but it goes into my legs sometimes. And my shoulders get stiff, too. It feels like I’ve been workin’ in the garden all day, even when I haven't. Just…all over, really. Like a really bad flu, but it ain’t a cold or nothin’. No cough, no sniffles, just the fever and the aches.
DOCTOR: I see. And has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think... well, I've been a little more tired than usual, even after I sleep. And… now that you mention it, I haven't been as hungry as I normally am. Everything just tastes… kinda bland. No real weight loss, I don't think. My wife makes me eat, keeps me goin’. Oh! And sometimes I get a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. That’s been happening more lately, too. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is… more informative. The fatigue, diminished appetite, and postural dizziness are pertinent. Now, Mr. Brege, have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… you mean, like… goin’ to the bathroom? Look, Doc, I don't usually talk about that kinda stuff. But… no, not really. Same as always, I guess. Maybe a little softer than normal sometimes, but nothing major. Why are you askin’? Is this somethin’ serious? My wife is gonna kill me if I get somethin’ serious. She just wants me to feel better, you know?
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Brege, I am simply gathering a comprehensive medical history. These questions, however personal they may seem, are crucial for accurate assessment. Now, have you noticed any skin changes – any rashes, sores, or unusual discoloration?
PATIENT: No rashes, Doc, nothin’ like that. My skin's been… well, old, I guess. I got a few age spots, but that’s about it. No new ones, no itchin’, no nothin'. I spend a bit of time outside, workin' on the yard, but I try to wear a hat. Mostly just the usual wrinkles and sun spots. Is this fever somethin’ I caught from someone? Are other people gettin' sick around here? I don't want to be spreadin’ anything around.
DOCTOR: That is a reasonable concern, Mr. Brege. We have seen a moderate increase in upper respiratory infections in the area, but your symptoms do not align with the typical presentation. Now, let's delve into your past medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Nah, Doc. Nothin’ like that. I was lucky, always been pretty healthy. A little arthritis in my knees, but that’s just gettin’ old. And my back's been botherin’ me for years, but that’s from liftin’ stuff when I was younger. No doctor's ever told me I had somethin’ serious. Just the usual check-ups and vaccinations. I take a multi-vitamin sometimes. My wife is always tellin’ me to take my vitamins. Oh! I had my gallbladder taken out… must be twenty years ago now? Is that important?
DOCTOR: Twenty years ago… yes, that is relevant. And any previous surgeries other than the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don't think so. Maybe a tonsillectomy when I was a kid, but that was a long, long time ago. Back when they gave you popsicles after. Nothing else that I can recall, Doc. I’ve been pretty fortunate. Mostly just bumps and bruises over the years. No serious accidents or anything. And I don’t take any regular medications, except for an occasional Tylenol for the fever. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible. They just make me feel worse, usually.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Let me see... My mother had high blood pressure, but she lived to be 85, so it didn't bother her too much. My father… he died of a heart attack when he was in his 60s. That's probably the biggest thing. My sister has arthritis, like me, but she lives in Puerto Rico, and I haven't seen her in years. No cancer, no nothin’ like that, as far as I know. It's a pretty healthy family, all things considered. Mostly just old age gettin' to 'em. Is this gonna take much longer, Doc? I promised my wife I’d be back for lunch. She makes a mean arroz con gandules.
DOCTOR: We are nearing completion, Mr. Brege. Just a few more questions regarding your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nah, Doc, never touched 'em. Never had the taste for it. My wife, she likes a little wine with dinner sometimes, but I stick to water. Never been much of a drinker, never felt the need. And drugs? No way. Never even been tempted. I work hard, and I like to keep things clean and simple. Is this all? I really need to get goin'. My wife's a good cook, but she gets… particular if I'm late.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Brege. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. I'll check your temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also palpate your abdomen and examine your joints. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine, Doc. Whatever you gotta do. Just…try to be quick, okay? My wife is gonna be lookin' for me. And please don't make me take off my pants. I'm not exactly in beach body shape, you know?
DOCTOR: Certainly not, Mr. Brege. Entirely unnecessary. Let’s begin with your temperature. Your temperature is 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. Pulse is 88 and regular. Your heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the lower quadrants. No masses are detected. Your joints exhibit some mild crepitus, consistent with arthritis. No acute inflammation is noted. I also note some tenderness in your lower back, as you mentioned.
PATIENT: Okay, Doc. Sounds… normal, I guess. Crepitus? Is that bad? So, what's wrong with me? Is it the fever? Is it somethin' serious? I really don't want to be stuck in a hospital bed, my wife would never let me live it down. And I promised her I'd help with the garden this weekend. What do we do now? Are you gonna give me some pills? I was hopin' to avoid that. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Brege, your symptoms – the fluctuating fever, fatigue, diminished appetite, and lower back tenderness – are concerning and warrant further investigation. While a simple infection cannot be entirely ruled out, the persistence of these symptoms suggests a more complex underlying etiology. I am hesitant to provide a definitive diagnosis at this juncture without additional testing. I would like to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a urinalysis to assess your overall health and identify any potential sources of infection or inflammation. I also recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any pulmonary involvement. I understand your reluctance regarding medication, but I may prescribe a short course of a mild analgesic to manage your back pain and fever while we await the results of these tests. .
