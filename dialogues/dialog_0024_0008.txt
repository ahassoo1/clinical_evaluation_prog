DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Guerrerolopez. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, please, state the reason for your visit today. Be concise, if you would. My schedule is…demanding.
PATIENT: Right, yes. Sorry to bother you, Doctor. It’s my ear. Feels…full. Like something’s blocked. It’s been on and off for a bit, now. Not painful, exactly. Just…there. I suppose that’s it.
DOCTOR: “On and off for a bit.” A remarkably unhelpful descriptor, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Oh, dear. Dates are…difficult. Maybe a few weeks? No, wait… a month? Longer? It comes and goes… worse when it’s humid, I think. Honestly, I’m not good with remembering things these days. It’s just… annoying, mostly.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, “mostly annoying” is not a diagnosis, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Let’s attempt some actual medical history. Have you experienced any hearing loss with this fullness?
PATIENT: Hearing loss… Now that you mention it… maybe? My wife used to tell me I didn’t listen. Sorry. Old habits. But… yes. I suppose things are a little muffled sometimes. Not a lot, though. Just… quieter.
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing. Excellent. And have you noticed any ringing in your ear – tinnitus, as it’s medically termed – accompanying this fullness and hearing loss?
PATIENT: Ringing…? I do hear things sometimes. Like… a very faint hum. But I live near the highway, you see. So it could be that. It's hard to tell what's real and what's just…noise.
DOCTOR: A convenient excuse, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Nevertheless, we must be thorough. Have you experienced any dizziness or balance problems in conjunction with these symptoms?
PATIENT: Dizziness… No, not really. Maybe a little unsteady sometimes, but I'm not a young man anymore. That’s probably just getting old. Or… well, you know. It's been a while since… since my wife passed. Things don't feel as steady as they used to, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Emotional stability is not within my purview, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Let's focus on the ear. Have you experienced any pain, discharge, or bleeding from the ear?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Nothing coming out of it, thankfully. Just… full. Like cotton wool. And… sometimes, when I swallow, it feels… weird. A sort of popping sensation. I don't know if that's important. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: “Probably nothing” is, again, not a medical assessment, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Have you attempted any self-treatment for this, such as ear drops or over-the-counter remedies?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, my neighbor, Mrs. Gable, she suggested some… something with garlic? Said it was good for infections. I tried it for a day or two, but it smelled terrible and didn’t seem to help. So, no. I haven’t really done anything. I figured it would go away on its own.
DOCTOR: Garlic. Of course. Very well. I’m going to perform a brief examination of your ear now. Please remain still. And, Mr. Guerrerolopez, could you please state your date of birth for verification?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Dates… I think it’s… October 12th. 1976? Yes, I believe so. It was a Tuesday. My wife always remembered things like that.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There is some cerumen impaction, as I suspected. And slight redness of the tympanic membrane. The other ear is similarly affected, though less pronounced. Mr. Guerrerolopez, you have bilateral cerumen impaction and mild tympanitis. Likely viral, given the lack of significant pain or discharge. I recommend cerumen removal, which I can perform today. Do you consent?
PATIENT: Cerumen… what now? And… tympa-what? Viral? Look, Doctor, I just want the fullness to go away. If taking something out will help, then yes, please do. As long as it doesn’t hurt. And it’s quick. I have… things to attend to.
DOCTOR: Very well. This will be slightly uncomfortable, but brief. Please remain perfectly still. And, for the record, Mr. Guerrerolopez, I strongly suggest you refrain from self-treating with… garlic in the future. It is not conducive to effective medical care.
PATIENT: Oh, that is a bit… odd. Feels like a tiny tickle. Yes, just… get it over with, please. I’m sure my wife would have known exactly what to do about this.
DOCTOR: There. Complete. Much improved. The tympanic membranes appear clearer now, though still slightly inflamed. I'm prescribing a topical steroid ear drop to reduce the inflammation. Use twice daily for one week. Avoid getting water in your ears during this time. And I advise against using any… unconventional remedies in the future. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Feels… lighter, I suppose. Still a bit strange, but not as full. Yes, that’s good. No, Doctor, I think that’s all. Just… thank you. And I’ll… try to remember all that. I really must be going now.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Guerrerolopez. If the symptoms persist or worsen after one week, please schedule a follow-up appointment. And do attempt to adhere to standard medical advice. Good day. .
PATIENT: Right. Yes. Thank you, Doctor. Good day to you, too.
