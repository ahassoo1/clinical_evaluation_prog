DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, things have been… painful, lately. It’s mostly in my back, but it’s been shooting down my leg a bit too.
DOCTOR: Painful, alright. And it’s been… how long has this been going on, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It started maybe a month ago? Just a little twinge at first, but it’s gotten worse over the last couple of weeks, definitely. It’s making it hard to sleep sometimes.
DOCTOR: A month, with it worsening recently... and affecting your sleep. Okay. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Well, it's not really a sharp pain, you know? More like a dull ache most of the time. But then, if I move wrong – like bending over or twisting – it’ll shoot a really bad pain down my leg. It feels like… electricity, almost. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. “Shooting” pain, like electricity… we call that radiating pain. And it’s worse with certain movements, bending and twisting. Is it just one leg, or both?
PATIENT: Just the right one, Doctor. My left leg is fine. It's always the right one that bothers me. And it feels worse after I've been sitting for a long time, too. Like when I'm driving.
DOCTOR: Right leg only, worse after sitting… Alright. And when you’re sitting, where exactly do you feel the pain?
PATIENT: Well, it’s mostly low in my back, right around where your belt would be. But like I said, it goes down my leg, mostly the back of my thigh and then kinda down to my calf. Sometimes I feel a little tingling in my foot too, but not always.
DOCTOR: Okay, low back pain radiating down the right leg, tingling in the foot… I see. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just so I can get a better idea of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine with me, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if it's going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll let you know before each step. First, could you just lie down on your back for me?
PATIENT: Sure thing. There you go. Is this okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. Just going to gently feel along your spine and the muscles around it. Let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Hmm… a little tightness here on the right side. And how about if I lift your right leg straight up?
PATIENT: Okay, I can feel a bit of pressure when you’re touching that spot. Ooh, yeah, that makes it hurt a little more when you lift my leg up. It's not terrible, but I definitely feel it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And does that pain radiate down your leg when I lift it like that?
PATIENT: Yeah, it kinda does. Not as bad as when I move, but I definitely feel it shooting down my leg a little bit when you lift it up. Like a stretching feeling, almost.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you point to where that tingling in your foot is located?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my toes, Doctor. The little toe and the one next to it. It's not constant, though. It comes and goes. Sometimes I don't feel anything at all.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just going to check your reflexes now. This is a normal part of the exam. And now the other side. Alright. Your reflexes seem… a little diminished on the right side, but not significantly. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like we might be dealing with some irritation of the sciatic nerve, possibly a slight disc issue. It's difficult to say for certain without some imaging, though. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Sciatic nerve? Oh, my wife had something like that. Is that serious? And no, I don't have any allergies, thankfully. Not that I know of, anyway.
DOCTOR: It can be serious if left untreated, but it’s often manageable with conservative treatment. We'll start with that. And that's good to know about no allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just some vitamins. A multivitamin and some Vitamin D. My doctor said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. That’s it. Nothing for pain or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, just vitamins. Good. So, let’s talk about a plan. I'd like to start with some physical therapy. That can help strengthen your core and back muscles, and improve your flexibility. I'm also going to recommend an over-the-counter anti-inflammatory, like ibuprofen, to help with the pain and swelling. Do you have any trouble swallowing pills?
PATIENT: That sounds good to me, Doctor. Physical therapy, I can handle that. I'm pretty active, usually. And no, I don't have trouble swallowing pills. I take my vitamins every day, like clockwork.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll start with a trial of ibuprofen, 600 milligrams three times a day with food. If that doesn’t provide enough relief after a week, we can discuss other options. I’m going to give you a referral to a physical therapist nearby, and a handout with some exercises you can start at home. I'd also like to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you’re progressing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds like a plan. Two weeks is good. Should I be doing anything now? Like, is there anything I should avoid while I’m waiting for the physical therapy?
DOCTOR: That's a good question. For now, try to avoid any heavy lifting or twisting motions. Listen to your body—if something causes pain, don’t do it. Gentle walking is fine, and actually encouraged, but nothing strenuous. Also, try to maintain good posture when you're sitting. I can show you a few simple stretches before you leave, if you'd like. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good advice about the lifting and twisting. I tend to overdo it sometimes. And yeah, if you could show me a couple of stretches, that would be great. I always forget them! I think that covers everything for now, Doctor. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Way. Happy to help. Alright, let’s try this one. Gently pull your right knee towards your chest, holding it for about 20-30 seconds. You should feel a stretch in your lower back and hamstring. And then this one. Sit up straight and gently rotate your torso to the right, holding for 15-20 seconds. Again, listen to your body and don't force anything. These are just to get you started. The physical therapist will give you a more tailored program. Here’s the referral and the handout. Feel free to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. Have a good day, and take it easy. .
