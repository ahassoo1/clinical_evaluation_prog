DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudeney. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don’t even know why I had to come in. It’s just… a number, right? My husband insisted. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: A "number," as you put it, is a vital sign, Ms. Dudeney. And consistently elevated vital signs require investigation. Your husband may be demonstrating appropriate concern. Now, let’s start with the basics. When were you first informed of this elevated blood pressure?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t remember the exact date. Maybe a couple months ago? It was at the grocery store pharmacy, one of those machines. I just figured it was a bad day. I was hauling a lot of stuff, you know? It probably just spiked then. I don’t make a habit of checking my blood pressure. Seems like a waste of time if everything feels fine.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, relying on a single reading at a grocery store, while carrying groceries, is not a reliable method of assessing your cardiovascular health. And “feeling fine” is often irrelevant. Hypertension frequently presents without symptoms. Has anyone in your family – parents, siblings – been diagnosed with high blood pressure or heart disease?
PATIENT: My grandma, on my mom’s side, had something… with her heart, I think. But she lived to be pretty old, so it couldn’t have been that bad. My mom’s okay, as far as I know. She doesn’t talk about health stuff much. My dad… he was a rancher. Worked hard his whole life. Probably just wore his body out. Honestly, I don’t keep track of everyone’s ailments. It’s depressing.
DOCTOR: Very well. And you state your mother is currently in good health?
PATIENT: As far as I know, yes. She's...particular. Doesn't like doctors. She says they just try to sell you things you don't need. She's doing okay, she still gets around. Look, are we almost done here? I have things to do. It’s just blood pressure, right? A pill will fix it?
DOCTOR: “Just blood pressure,” as you continue to phrase it, is a significant risk factor for stroke, heart attack, and kidney failure. It requires a proper evaluation, not a dismissive attitude and a quick fix. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I haven’t even been sick with a cold in years. I eat pretty healthy, mostly. And I don’t drink or smoke. My husband worries about everything, but I really take care of myself. I'm a civil engineering technician, I need to be on top of things. I can’t be laid up in bed.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I've never had a reaction to anything. Seriously. My husband always asks if I’m sure, and I always tell him the same thing. I’m pretty tough. Are we still on this? It feels like an interrogation.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, I assure you, this is not an interrogation. It is a necessary part of a medical assessment. Now, please, sit on the examination table and we will take a look at your vitals. It will only take a moment. I need to listen to your heart and lungs and check your reflexes. Perhaps then we can determine the extent of the “number” you seem so eager to dismiss.
PATIENT: Fine. But don’t take all day. I told my neighbor I’d help her with her sprinklers. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is slightly elevated, but within acceptable parameters. Lung sounds are clear. Reflexes are normal. Blood pressure is, unsurprisingly, elevated. 148/92. We will need to repeat this reading a few times to confirm. Consistent. Now, I'd like to order some basic blood work. A complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and EKG. This will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and rule out any underlying causes for your hypertension.
PATIENT: Ugh. Blood work? Seriously? I hate needles. Can’t we just…try a pill? A low dose? My husband has some old stuff in the medicine cabinet, maybe I could just... I really need to get going. I'm sure it's nothing. Just stress, probably.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, self-treating with medication prescribed to someone else is extremely dangerous and irresponsible. And relying on guesswork is not a substitute for proper medical diagnosis and treatment. The blood work is necessary. It is standard procedure. We need to establish a baseline before considering any medication. I will have my assistant draw the samples. Do you have any known history of bleeding disorders, or are you currently taking any blood thinners?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I told you, I don't take anything. And I never bleed much. Just a little scratch and it stops right away. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I don't understand why we can’t just write a prescription and be done with it. This is wasting my time, and frankly, it's making me anxious. Which, I'm sure, is raising my blood pressure. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudeney, your anxiety is duly noted, but it does not negate the need for a thorough medical evaluation. I understand your reluctance, but I must reiterate the importance of the blood work. Refusal of recommended testing is your prerogative, but I will not prescribe medication without a proper diagnosis. If you refuse the blood work, I recommend a consultation with a cardiologist. They may have a different approach, but I am unwilling to proceed without further information. Do you wish me to schedule that consultation for you, or will you be obtaining a second opinion on your own?
