DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I’m Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's a bit embarrassing to talk about, but I've been having trouble... going to the bathroom. It's getting harder to start, you know? And it takes a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. It's not embarrassing at all, Ms. Yadao. These things happen. So, you're experiencing difficulty initiating urination, and it's taking you longer than usual to empty your bladder?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s not a sudden thing, it's been building up for… oh, maybe a month or so. Not every time, but more and more often. And sometimes it feels like I don’t quite get everything out, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Ms. Yadao. Thank you for explaining. A month, gradually worsening… and a feeling of incomplete emptying. Do you find yourself straining to urinate at all?
PATIENT: Yes, I do, actually. I have to push a little. Not terribly hard, but definitely more effort than it used to be. And sometimes... well, sometimes it just starts and stops. It’s very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay. Straining, intermittency… I see. And are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not burning, not anything like that. It's just… difficult. And a little worrying, to be honest. I don't want to end up with an infection or something. I had one of those years ago, and it was awful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. No pain or burning is good. We'll try to figure out what’s going on, and rule things out. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. No, I don’t think so. The color seems normal, nothing cloudy or anything. I haven’t seen any blood, thank goodness. I try to drink plenty of water, you know, so it’s usually pretty clear.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No changes in color, no blood, and you stay hydrated. Now, let’s talk about other medical issues. Do you have any other health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, that’s why I walk with a cane sometimes. And my blood pressure runs a little high, but I take a pill for that every day. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy for my age, I think. I had a gallbladder removed years ago, but that’s not bothering me now. Oh, and I have Medicare, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: Okay. Arthritis in your knees, hypertension managed with medication, and a history of gallbladder removal. Medicare is good to know for billing. And are you currently taking any medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Just the one for the blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it's called. And sometimes I take something for the arthritis pain, but that’s just ibuprofen, when it flares up. Nothing else regularly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril for blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. My mother was allergic to penicillin, but I haven’t had any trouble with it myself. I’ve had all my shots, too, you know, everything the doctor recommended.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies, up to date on vaccinations. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, I'm going to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my father had heart trouble, and my sister had diabetes. And… oh, my aunt on my mother’s side had something with her kidneys, I think. But that was a long time ago, and I don't remember the details. Mostly, everyone lived to be pretty old, so I guess they were pretty healthy overall.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble in your father, diabetes in your sister, and a family history of kidney issues. That’s good to know. And finally, just a quick question about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or engage in regular exercise?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke. Never have. I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I haven’t had any in a long time. And exercise… well, I try to walk around the house as much as possible. My knees don’t allow for much more than that these days, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, limited alcohol, and limited exercise due to your knees. Okay, Ms. Yadao, this is all very helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just a quick check of your abdomen and a neurological exam to assess your bladder function. It will only take a few minutes. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Ms. Yadao. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. I’m not feeling any masses. Neurologically, your reflexes are intact, and sensation is normal. I did note some mild swelling in your ankles bilaterally. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Breath sounds are clear. Now, I'd like to check a urine sample. We'll send that off to the lab to rule out infection and check for other abnormalities. Would you be able to provide one now?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. I actually came prepared, knowing I might need to. I brought one with me. It's right here. Hopefully, I can manage okay getting to the restroom.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Yadao. That will save us some time. Thank you. Okay, so we’ve sent the urine sample to the lab. While we wait for those results, which should take about 15-20 minutes, I’m going to review your EHR to see if there is anything else that may be relevant. I want to get a complete picture of your health history. Just one moment. …Okay. It looks like your last blood pressure check was a little elevated, but otherwise everything seems to be stable. Given your symptoms - difficulty initiating urination, straining, intermittency, and incomplete emptying - and no signs of infection on initial exam, I suspect we are dealing with either benign prostatic hyperplasia – although that's much less common in women – or a potential issue with bladder function or a mild obstruction. To rule out obstruction, we may need to consider further imaging. But let’s see what the urine sample reveals first. I’ll be right back with the results as soon as they are available. Do you have any questions in the meantime?
PATIENT: Oh my. That sounds… complicated. Benign what-now? And imaging… does that mean x-rays? Or something worse? I suppose I should just wait for the results. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just hoping it’s not something too serious.
DOCTOR: It can sound complicated, Ms. Yadao, but we’ll take it one step at a time. Benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, is an enlargement of the prostate gland, which can cause urinary problems in men. It's rare in women, as we don’t have a prostate, but sometimes similar issues can occur. Imaging could be an ultrasound, which is completely painless and non-invasive. We won’t jump to any conclusions until we have the urine sample results. I assure you, we’re ruling things out before considering anything more serious. The lab should be finished shortly. I’ll be right back. Please just relax.
