DOCTOR: Hi Jailenne, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Amussen, nice to meet you too. Well, I've been getting chills, and it’s been bothering me for a few days now. It's not like a cold, just…chills.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills for a few days. And you said it doesn’t feel like a cold, that's helpful. Can you tell me a little more about these chills?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. It's hard to explain. They just come on suddenly, and then they're gone. Not constantly, you know? Like, I was perfectly fine this morning, then I felt a shiver for maybe ten minutes, and now I’m okay again. It's just…random. And I haven’t been feeling sick otherwise, no fever or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, random chills, coming and going, no fever or other cold symptoms. That is a little unusual. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger them?
PATIENT: Hmm…that's a good question. I don’t think so. I’ve been trying to pay attention, but nothing jumps out. I’ve been doing pretty much the same stuff as usual – work, hanging out with friends, normal stuff. Maybe when I’m tired? But honestly, I’m always a little tired. It's hard to say for sure.
DOCTOR: Right, okay. And how is your energy level generally?
PATIENT: It's...okay. I mean, I work full time, so I'm usually pretty wiped by the end of the day. But this feels a bit more than just regular tired, you know? Like, I could sleep for ten hours and still feel…not quite right. It's just a general feeling of being run down, I guess. And sometimes the chills happen even when I have had enough sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, so general fatigue alongside these random chills. Let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all – even something small?
PATIENT: Let me think... Hmm. My appetite hasn't been great, maybe? I haven’t been trying to eat less, but I just haven't been as hungry as usual. And... oh! My muscles have been a little achy, especially in my legs. Not like, sore from working out, just…a dull ache. Is that helpful? It's probably nothing, honestly.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. So, decreased appetite and muscle aches along with the chills and fatigue. Do you have any trouble sleeping, other than just feeling tired?
PATIENT: No, not really trouble staying asleep. I fall asleep pretty easily, and I usually sleep through the night. It's just…when I wake up, I don't feel very rested, even if I've had a good amount of sleep. Does that make sense? Like, the quality of sleep isn't great, even though the quantity is fine. And sometimes I wake up feeling a little…stiff, I guess. Especially my legs.
DOCTOR: Okay, so difficulty with restorative sleep and morning stiffness. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your muscles and joints. Just to get a better picture of what's going on.
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. No problem at all. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, heart and lungs sound clear. Your muscles feel a little tense, especially in your legs, and there’s some tenderness when I press here. No obvious swelling or redness. Blood pressure is 120/80, pulse is 72, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. I'm going to check your reflexes now.
PATIENT: Okay, good to know it wasn't anything obvious with my heart and lungs. And yeah, my legs do feel a bit tight sometimes. Go ahead with the reflexes, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are normal. Everything seems… fairly normal physically, which is a little puzzling, honestly. Given your symptoms – the chills, fatigue, muscle aches, and decreased appetite – and the fact that a physical exam isn’t revealing anything concrete, I’m thinking we should run some blood tests. Just to rule out a few things. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible. If nothing's showing up on the exam, blood tests make sense. I'd rather be sure. What kind of things are you looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We’ll do a complete blood count – that checks for things like anemia or infection. We'll also check your thyroid levels, as thyroid problems can cause fatigue and muscle aches. And I’ll order a Vitamin D level, as a deficiency can also cause similar symptoms. And just to be thorough, we'll do a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds pretty thorough. All of that sounds good to me. So, how do we go about getting those tests done? Do I need to come back another day, or can we do them now?
DOCTOR: Great. We can actually do them right here in the clinic today. I'll just need to draw a little bit of blood. It'll only take a few minutes. Once we have the results—usually takes a couple of days—we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and figure out the next steps. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s perfect. Doing them today is much easier. I'm not crazy about needles, but... I guess it has to be done. Let’s get it over with then!
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, all done. Just keep that bandage on for about fifteen minutes. The lab will contact us with the results. We'll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as we have them, likely within a couple of days. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as possible, and stay hydrated. If your symptoms worsen significantly—like developing a high fever or severe muscle pain—please don’t hesitate to contact us right away. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Okay, great, thank you. No, I think that covers everything. Rest and hydration… I can do that. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and run the tests. Hopefully, we can figure out what’s going on soon. Thank you, Dr. Amussen.
