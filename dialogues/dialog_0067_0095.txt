DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have all day to explain. I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of one ear, and half my face feels… droopy. It’s quite inconvenient, really. Is that enough for you to start figuring out what’s wrong?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's certainly enough to start. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping are concerning symptoms, and we’ll definitely want to investigate those. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed these symptoms?
PATIENT: I told you, this morning. When I woke up. Do you need a precise time? It was… around 7:15, I suppose. I had my tea, and that’s when I realised I couldn’t hear the news. And then I looked in the mirror, and… well, you see it, don’t you? It’s not exactly subtle. Honestly, I’ve never experienced anything like this before. Though, to be fair, I generally avoid mirrors.
DOCTOR: Okay, 7:15 this morning. And it happened suddenly, as you woke up?
PATIENT: Yes! Suddenly. As in, one minute I was… perfectly functional, and the next, this. It wasn’t a gradual thing. Do you always ask so many questions? It's rather… irritating. It feels quite obvious, doesn't it? I woke up different.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Stephane. I apologize if my questions seem repetitive, but it's important for me to get a clear picture of what's happening so I can determine the best course of action. It is obvious something is different, and we'll certainly investigate. To help me rule out other possibilities, can you tell me if you experienced any other symptoms alongside the hearing loss and facial drooping?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No dizziness, if that's what you're angling for. No headache. No fever. I haven’t been sick. I had a perfectly normal dinner last night – grilled fish, if you must know. Honestly, I live a rather… regimented life. I don’t just randomly develop symptoms. It’s quite unsettling, actually. Are you suggesting I imagined this? Because that would be preposterous.
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not, Stephane. I’m not suggesting you imagined this at all. It’s good to know you haven’t had any dizziness, headache, or fever. And thank you for letting me know about your dinner – sometimes seemingly unrelated things can be helpful. Now, have you noticed any weakness in any other parts of your body?
PATIENT: Weakness? No. I can move all my limbs perfectly well. Look, I’m a radiologist. I’m quite aware of my own body. This is confined to one side of my face and my ear. It’s not spreading. Frankly, I’d hoped you'd have some idea what’s going on by now. Are you going to examine me, or just continue interrogating me? Because my time is valuable.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask. I apologize for the delay in physically examining you. It's important to gather as much information as possible first, but a physical exam is certainly the next step. Would you mind if I take a closer look at your face and ear?
PATIENT: Fine. Get on with it. But be gentle, alright? I don’t need any additional discomfort. And please, try to be quick. I have appointments, you know. This is rather disruptive.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. I’m going to start by looking at your face. I’ll assess your facial symmetry and check for any signs of drooping. Then, I’ll examine your ear to see if there's any visible inflammation or obstruction. Okay, I do see some noticeable drooping on the left side of your face, particularly around your mouth and eye. And your left ear canal appears clear, but there's some slight redness behind the ear. It doesn't seem to be causing any obstruction, though. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes and do a quick neurological assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Reflexes? Really? This is getting ridiculous. Must we go through every possible test? Fine. But if you find nothing, I expect a referral to someone who actually knows what they’re doing. I’m a busy woman. Do what you have to do. But please, be efficient.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Stephane. I assure you I'm trying to be as efficient as possible. Checking your reflexes and doing a quick neurological assessment will help me rule out certain possibilities and determine the best course of action. It will only take a few moments. Okay, your pupillary response is normal, and your facial sensation appears intact. Your limb strength and coordination are also good. However, I am noting some diminished strength on the left side of your face when you smile. Given your symptoms - sudden hearing loss, facial drooping, and now diminished facial strength - and the timeline of onset, I’m concerned about the possibility of Bell's Palsy, or potentially something more serious like a stroke.
PATIENT: Bell’s Palsy? Stroke? Honestly. I’m a perfectly healthy woman. I eat well, I exercise… I’m a radiologist, for goodness sake! We’re trained to recognize these things. You expect me to believe I suddenly have a stroke? It’s preposterous. What's the next step? An MRI, I presume? Because I’m not leaving here without a definitive answer. And frankly, I expect a referral to a neurologist immediately. This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: You are right to be concerned, and your assessment is valid given your medical background. While Bell’s Palsy is a possibility, given the sudden onset and your symptoms, we need to rule out a more serious cause, such as a stroke. An MRI of the brain is the next appropriate step to get a definitive answer. I completely agree that a referral to a neurologist is warranted, and I will facilitate that immediately. I'm also going to order a stat CT scan of the head to rule out any acute event. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a course of high-dose prednisone, which is commonly used in the treatment of Bell’s Palsy. It's important to start it as soon as possible if that is the diagnosis. However, we need the imaging results before we can confirm anything. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Prednisone? Fine. No allergies, though I detest swallowing pills. And please, ensure the referral is to a competent neurologist. I won’t settle for just anyone. Get the tests done quickly. I have a life, you know. Honestly, I suspect this is just a viral thing. But I need a definitive answer, and I need it now. And can I get a copy of the results when they’re available? I’d like to review them myself.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll make sure the referral is to a highly-regarded neurologist in the area, and I'll include all of my findings in the referral note. I understand your concern about waiting, and I'll do everything I can to expedite the imaging and the specialist appointment. I’ll also ensure you receive a copy of all the imaging results and my consultation note as soon as they're available. We’ll get the CT scan done immediately, and I’ll call you as soon as we have those results. In the meantime, please monitor your symptoms closely and report any changes to the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before we get the CT scan scheduled?
PATIENT: No. Just get the tests done. And make sure someone competent is reading them. Honestly, I'm trusting you to handle this efficiently. I don't have time for incompetence. Now, where do I go for this CT scan? And how long will it take? I have appointments this afternoon, you know. This is quite inconvenient. .
DOCTOR: Of course. Here is the order for the CT scan and detailed directions to the imaging center. It’s located just a few blocks from here. The scan itself should take approximately 15-20 minutes. Please arrive at least 15 minutes early to complete any necessary paperwork. I will call you as soon as the results are available, likely within a few hours. I understand your frustration, and I assure you I'm doing everything I can to expedite the process. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Thank you for your patience, Stephane. And I’ll speak with you soon. .
