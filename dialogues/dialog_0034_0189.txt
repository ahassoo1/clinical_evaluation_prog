DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. My name is Dr. Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about time someone got around to seein’ me. Been waitin’ a while. It’s… well, it’s my stool. There was blood in it. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to notice. It's… unsettling. And I don't like unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. It's certainly unsettling to notice blood in your stool, and I apologize for the wait. We do our best to accommodate everyone in a timely manner here. To help me understand what's going on, could you describe the blood a bit more?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you want me to do, paint you a picture? It was… red. Obviously. Blood is red. Not bright red, like a fresh cut, more… dark. Like old pennies, maybe? And it wasn't mixed in so much as… on top. You know, coating things. Honestly, it’s a bit much to discuss. I’ve seen things in my life, flown more miles than you’ve probably driven, and I don’t need to be detailing my bathroom habits to a young man.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize if I was being insensitive. You are right; it’s not pleasant to discuss. “Dark, like old pennies, and coating things” is very helpful, thank you. That description gives me a better idea. Just to clarify, has this happened before?
PATIENT: Hmph. Once. Maybe twice. Years ago. Didn't bother me much then, figured it was somethin' I ate. Bad clams, maybe. But now… now I'm eighty-eight years old, and things don't just go away on their own, do they? And my digestion ain’t what it used to be, that’s for certain. Though, truthfully, it wasn’t good even when I was younger. Always a bit… delicate.
DOCTOR: That's good information, thank you. So, it’s happened a couple of times in the past, but not recently, and you’ve noticed a change now that you’re eighty-eight. And you describe your digestion as generally delicate. To get a better picture of what might be going on, could you tell me if you've experienced any other symptoms alongside the blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I feel old. Is that a symptom? Everything aches. My knees, my back… Don't tell me you need a list of my ailments. Let's just say I'm not spring chicken anymore. I've been a bit tired lately, I suppose. More tired than usual. And… now that I think about it, my stomach's been rumbling a bit more. But that could be anything. I had a piece of that rhubarb pie my niece made. That stuff’ll give anyone the runs.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. It sounds like you're experiencing some typical aches and pains for someone your age, and that fatigue could be related to a number of things. The rumbling could be the pie, as you said. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits besides the blood and the rumbling?
PATIENT: Bowel habits… Honestly, young man, you’re asking a lot. Let’s just say I don’t spend hours in the bathroom anymore. It’s… quicker. And not as… solid. More… loose. And sometimes I feel like I haven't gotten everything out, you know? Like there’s still somethin’ left. Not painful, mind you, just… incomplete. And it happens more often than it used to. Is that what you wanted to know? Honestly, I'm startin' to feel like I'm givin' you my life story. A rather unpleasant one, at that.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the personal nature of these questions, Mr. Rowbottom, but these details are important for me to understand what might be going on. It sounds like you've noticed a change in frequency and consistency, and that feeling of incomplete evacuation. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Well… now that you mention it… my pants are a bit looser. Not a lot, mind you, but I had to tighten my belt a notch or two a few weeks back. I figured it was just the summer heat makin' me sweat more, or somethin'. But… yes. A little bit. I haven’t been eatin’ as much either, to be honest. Don't have much of an appetite these days. Everything just… tastes bland. Even that rhubarb pie. And that pie is usually excellent. Though, as I said, it did give me the rumbles… So maybe I just wasn't hungry because of the pie. This is gettin' ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. The unintentional weight loss, decreased appetite, and change in taste, along with everything else you’ve described, is helpful information. Now, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diverticulitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or colon polyps?
PATIENT: Diverticulitis… Inflammatory bowel disease… colon polyps… Look, I flew planes for fifty years. I wasn’t sittin’ around collectin’ medical diagnoses. I went to the doctor when somethin’ hurt, got a shot, and got back in the air. I remember havin’ my gallbladder out, years ago. That was unpleasant. And I broke my wrist when I was a boy, fallin’ out of a tree. But… no, I don’t recall any fancy names for illnesses. I’ve just been… old. And achy. And occasionally constipated. Is that what you need to know? Honestly, I think this is a waste of both our times. You're askin’ me about things I haven’t even thought about in decades.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize for the line of questioning. It’s difficult to recall details from the past, especially if you haven’t needed to focus on them. Knowing you had your gallbladder removed is helpful. Let’s shift gears a bit. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… hmph. Not that I know of. I took penicillin as a boy, for strep throat, I think. Didn’t kill me, did it? I avoid taking pills whenever possible. They always make me feel… sluggish. And my stomach doesn’t handle them well, as you already know. No, I don't have any allergies. I'm a tough old bird. Been through worse than a little pill. Though, I did have a reaction to some sort of cream the last time I had a rash. It made my skin all red and itchy. But I don't recall the name of it. It was years ago. Honestly, the less I have to do with doctors and their potions, the better.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. A history of a skin reaction to a cream is good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just my arthritis cream. Rub it on my knees every night. And occasionally some Tums, if my stomach's botherin’ me. That’s it. I don’t believe in fillin’ my body with chemicals. It’s just… not natural. My wife, God rest her soul, always tried to get me to take vitamins, but I refused. Said I got enough vitamins from my rhubarb pie. Though, as we've established, that pie hasn’t been agreein’ with me lately. Honestly, I think I’m done answerin’ questions. You’ve got my life story, you know about my bowels, my weight, my diet… what more do you need? Are you gonna poke me now?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize for taking up your time. I assure you, I don't intend to "poke you" unless it's necessary for a physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me – the blood in your stool, the change in bowel habits, the unintentional weight loss, and your age – I think it’s important to investigate this further. The symptoms you're describing could be caused by a number of things, and it’s best to rule out anything serious. Would you be willing to let me perform a brief physical exam, and possibly order some tests?
PATIENT: Tests? A physical exam? Look, I’ve lived a long life. Eighty-eight years. I’ve had enough poking and prodding to last several lifetimes. I’m not keen on bein’ stuck with needles or… or whatever else you doctors do. Honestly, I'm startin' to regret comin' in here. I should have just stayed home and suffered in peace. I’m not sure I want to know what’s wrong with me, if it means bein’ subjected to… tests. Can’t I just take some more arthritis cream and hope for the best? Is that an option? Really, young man, I’m not sure this is worth it. I’m a stubborn old bird, and I don’t like bein’ told what to do. And I really don't like bein’ poked. .
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Rowbottom, and I respect your feelings. You are absolutely right to prioritize your comfort and make choices that feel right for you. I apologize for making you feel pressured. Given your strong feelings about tests and a physical exam, and your concerns about further intervention, I won’t push you to undergo anything you're not comfortable with. However, I do feel a responsibility to advise you that the symptoms you've described could indicate a serious condition, such as colon cancer. While it may not be that, it’s important to be aware of the possibility. Without further investigation, it's difficult to say definitively what’s going on. I strongly recommend consulting with a gastroenterologist for a second opinion. They can discuss your concerns and explore alternative options for diagnosis, potentially including non-invasive tests. I can provide you with a referral if you'd like. Regardless of your decision, if your symptoms worsen, such as increased bleeding, severe abdominal pain, or a significant change in your bowel habits, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before we wrap up?
