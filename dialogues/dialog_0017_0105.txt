DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste time. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, good morning, Doctor. Right. Well, it’s about getting… surgery. For my weight, you know? I think my wife set this up. She’s the organized one. I just… want to get healthier, I guess. It’s pre-surgery, she said. Something about getting checked out before I… do it.
DOCTOR: Surgery is a rather… drastic measure, Mr. Kochubey. And frankly, a preemptive examination is simply good practice. Your wife sounds sensible. Now, let's clarify. What specifically are you hoping to achieve with this surgery?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, I want to be able to… move easier. It’s hard to, you know, keep up with my kids. And my knees… they bother me a lot. And I guess just… feel better about myself. It’s hard to explain. I just want to… not be so big, I think. Is that… okay to say?
DOCTOR: “Not be so big.” A rather vague ambition, Mr. Kochubey. We need specifics. Let's start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems… anything at all?
PATIENT: Uh… hmm. That's a good question. I... don't really remember. I think… maybe high blood pressure? The doctor mentioned something about it a while back, but I don’t really keep track of those things. I take some pills, I think… a little white one. And a yellow one? My wife usually handles all that, honestly. I just… take them. Sorry, I'm not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: Not particularly. A little white pill and a yellow one… exceedingly informative. Do you, at the very least, recall why you are taking these medications?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not really. She just says, “Take this one with breakfast, and this one with dinner.” I think… maybe the white one is for my… stomach? I get heartburn a lot. And the yellow one… I really don't know. I really am sorry. It’s just… a lot to keep up with.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kochubey, we are attempting to determine if you are a suitable candidate for a potentially major surgical procedure. Vague recollections and reliance on your wife's memory are… insufficient. Let's move on. Allergies – to any medications, foods, anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh! Allergies… yeah, I think I’m allergic to… penicillin? I got a really bad rash once when I took it. It was years ago, though. And… dust? Sometimes my nose gets itchy when I’m cleaning. That’s about it, I think. I don't really have much trouble with stuff like that. Mostly just… the penicillin.
DOCTOR: Penicillin. Noted. Now, family history. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer…?
PATIENT: Oh… hmm. That's a tough one. My dad… he had some kind of heart trouble, I think. He died when I was pretty young, so I don’t remember a lot about it. And my mom… she has arthritis, really bad. She's always complaining about her joints. And… uh… I think my uncle had something with… sugar? Like diabetes, maybe. But honestly, I’m not sure. We don't really talk about those things much.
DOCTOR: Remarkably little clarity, Mr. Kochubey. Now, let’s discuss your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife would kill me if I did. She’s very… health-conscious. I do… drink sometimes. A beer with dinner, maybe a glass of wine on the weekend. Nothing crazy, though. Really.
DOCTOR: Alcohol in moderation. Acceptable, I suppose. Now, regarding your weight… when did you first notice it becoming a problem?
PATIENT: Oh… gosh. That's a hard question. It just… kind of happened, you know? After the kids were born, I think. I used to be pretty active, played soccer in college, but then… life got busy. Work, family… I just… stopped exercising, I guess. And I started eating… more. I don't really know a specific time, it just… slowly got worse and worse. It’s been years, I think. Many years.
DOCTOR: Years of gradual weight gain with a decline in physical activity. And you believe bariatric surgery is the solution?
PATIENT: Well, my wife thinks it is. She’s been researching it a lot. She says it’s the best way to… get my health back. I trust her, you know? I just want to be able to… do things with the kids again. Play catch, go hiking… I get tired just thinking about it now. And she says this will help me live longer, be around for them. That's the important part, right?
DOCTOR: Your wife's motivations are… commendable, I suppose. However, surgery is not a panacea. Before we even consider that, we need a comprehensive understanding of your current health status. Let's conduct a brief physical exam. Please step onto the scale. And, if you wouldn’t mind, remove your shirt.
PATIENT: Oh. Uh… okay. Remove my shirt? Right. Yeah, sure. Is it… cold in here?
DOCTOR: The room temperature is perfectly adequate. Please proceed. Heart rate is… elevated. Lung sounds are clear. Blood pressure is 150/90. Slightly elevated, not surprising given your weight. Some… abdominal adiposity, as expected. No obvious tenderness. Reflexes are normal. Well, Mr. Kochubey, this preliminary examination confirms your weight is indeed a concern. I recommend a full blood panel – cholesterol, glucose, liver function – and an EKG to assess your cardiovascular health. We will also need to schedule a consultation with a cardiologist.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… good. A lot of tests, though, huh? My wife will be glad I’m finally getting it checked out. When… when can we schedule those tests? And… the cardiologist? I hope it's not too long of a wait. I’m just ready to get this over with, you know?
DOCTOR: The lab can accommodate you tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. The cardiologist, Dr. Al-Nasir, has the earliest availability on August 12th. That’s two weeks from today. It’s… not ideal, but frankly, that is the best we can do with short notice. Here are the necessary documents. The lab is located on the third floor, and Dr. Al-Nasir’s office is across the street. Please bring all your medications – the little white pill and the yellow one – to both appointments. And, Mr. Kochubey, please make an effort to recall any other relevant medical information before your next visit. This process will be significantly more efficient – and productive – if you are able to provide a comprehensive medical history. Now, do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: Oh. August 12th… okay. That’s… a little while. But okay. I’ll try to… remember more. I really will. And… no, I don’t think so. Not right now. Thank you, Doctor. I guess I’ll see you… later? Or my wife will probably call with questions.
DOCTOR: Very well. Ensure your wife contacts my office if any concerns arise. I trust this will be a… productive endeavor. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again, Doctor.
