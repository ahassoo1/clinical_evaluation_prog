DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m an Internal Medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a little embarrassing, honestly. I’ve noticed a change in… how I smell, I guess. My body odor. It’s different than usual, and it started a couple of weeks ago. I can’t really describe it, just… not right.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's not embarrassing at all to discuss changes in your body, and it's good you brought it to my attention. Changes in body odor can sometimes indicate an underlying issue, so it’s wise to investigate. Could you tell me a little more about this change?
PATIENT: Well, before it was… normal, you know? Like everyone else. Now it’s… stronger, and kind of… sweet? Not like perfume sweet, but… a bit off. It's mostly noticeable after I’ve been working, which is a lot these days. Floor laying is hard work. I shower every day, though, like always. I just… noticed it even after a shower.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's a change in the quality and intensity of the odor, and it persists even after showering. And you mentioned it's more noticeable after work – so with physical exertion. That’s helpful information. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Okay, good. I’m glad that’s helpful. Let’s see… medical history. Not much, really. I had the usual childhood things – measles, chickenpox – but nothing serious. No big illnesses, no surgeries. I had a hysterectomy about ten years ago, that's probably the biggest thing. And I’ve got a little bit of high blood pressure, but I take medication for it. Otherwise, pretty healthy, I think. I get regular check-ups with my primary care doctor, but she just said to keep an eye on the pressure. Oh, and I’m divorced. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: No, your marital status doesn’t matter, Ms. Purtee. I just want to have a complete picture of your health. So, to recap: childhood illnesses, hysterectomy ten years ago, and managed hypertension. Are you currently taking any other medications besides those for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, just the blood pressure pills. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. One pill every morning. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for aches after work, if I’ve really pushed myself. But that’s it. I try not to take it too often, just when I really need it. I don't have any allergies that I know of, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Lisinopril daily and ibuprofen as needed. No known allergies. Now, regarding your family history – are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, heart disease, or any unusual skin conditions or body odor issues?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… My mom had diabetes, type 2, I think. And my dad had heart problems, he had a heart attack when he was pretty young. And my grandmother, on my mom’s side, she always used to sweat a lot, but I don’t think it was anything… unusual. Just a lot of sweating. No one ever mentioned anything about body odor specifically, if that makes sense. Everyone just smelled… normal. I think. It's hard to remember, honestly. They're both gone now.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s often difficult to recall details about family medical history. So, we have a family history of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking, never have. I used to drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a couple of years ago. Didn’t really enjoy it enough to keep it up. And definitely no recreational drugs. I’m a pretty simple person, really. Work hard, try to eat healthy, and get enough sleep when I can. That's about it.
DOCTOR: That's very good to hear. Now, Ms. Purtee, to try and get to the bottom of this change in body odor, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I'd also like to take a look at your skin, particularly in areas where sweat glands are concentrated – your armpits and groin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good. I just want to figure out what’s going on, you know? I'm a little worried it might be something serious. But I trust you, Dr. Reisig. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Purtee. I appreciate your trust. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, if you’ll please lift your arms for me… I don’t see any obvious rashes, lesions, or signs of infection. The skin appears normal in both areas. Do you notice any tenderness or discomfort in either of these areas?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Not tender, not itchy, not sore. Just… normal skin. It doesn't feel different, just… smells different. It’s weird. I've been scratching my head trying to think of anything I’ve changed – new soap, new deodorant – but everything is the same. I've been using the same stuff for years.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your history and the normal physical exam findings, there are a few possibilities we should consider. Sometimes, changes in body odor can be related to dietary factors, although that's less common with a sudden change. It could also be a subtle hormonal shift, even after a hysterectomy. And, rarely, it could be a sign of an underlying metabolic condition. To rule out some of those possibilities, I’d like to order a few lab tests. I’m thinking a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. These tests will give us a good overview of your overall health and help us identify any potential issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever it takes to figure it out. I just want to know what’s going on. It’s just… unsettling, you know? Smelling different. I've never had this happen before. So, yes, please. Order the tests. The sooner the better, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Purtee. It's perfectly reasonable to want answers, and I agree – let's get these tests done as quickly as possible. I’ll write the orders now, and the lab technician will be able to draw your blood before you leave. It should only take a few minutes. Once the results are back – typically within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, if you notice any other symptoms – fever, weight loss, excessive sweating, or any changes in your overall health – please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Dr. Reisig. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not brushing it off. It really means a lot. So, just go to the lab, and they’ll take some blood? Sounds easy enough. And I'll call if anything changes. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Purtee. It’s my pleasure. I’m glad I could help, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Yes, just head to the lab, and they’ll take care of the blood draw. The results will be sent to me, and my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. I wish you a good day, and please take care.
