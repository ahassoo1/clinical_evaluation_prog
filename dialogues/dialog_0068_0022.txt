DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. I’m Dr. Sham. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… something with my tummy. It’s getting big, you see? And I don’t feel like eating much anymore. Not like I used to. It just… doesn't feel right. I don’t remember exactly when it started, though. Things… fade, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, things do fade. Alright, a change in your abdomen, feeling full quickly, and a decreased appetite. Can you describe what you mean by "getting big"?
PATIENT: Hmm… like a balloon, maybe? Not hard like a balloon, but… rounder. It feels… puffy. And… uncomfortable if I lie flat. I mostly sit up now. It’s just… different. I used to be very small, you know? Always small. I don't know what's causing it. Is it something bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: We'll figure it out, Soila. “Puffy” and uncomfortable lying flat… alright. And how long would you say this has been going on, even roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a hard one. A few weeks, maybe? Or… longer? It feels like a long time now, but time… it all blurs together, you know? I’ve been mostly on my own, so I don't always notice things right away. I mostly just… live quietly. I'm not sure when it got this puffy. Sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: No, it’s alright. It’s often difficult to pinpoint these things. A few weeks, or longer… okay. Have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… …Well, I’ve been a bit tired lately. More tired than usual, I suppose. And… sometimes I feel a little bit… shaky. Not all the time, just sometimes. And…oh! I haven’t been to the bathroom as much either, if you don't mind me saying. It's... awkward to talk about. But it feels like I'm not emptying everything, you know?
DOCTOR: No, it's not awkward at all. It's important to tell me everything. Tiredness, shakiness, and changes in your bowel habits… alright. And have you noticed any pain, anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm… not really pain, Doctor. It’s more… discomfort. Like a dull ache sometimes, in my tummy, but it comes and goes. It’s not sharp, or anything. Just… annoying. And sometimes, when I eat… it feels… heavy. Like my tummy is full of stones. Does that make sense? It doesn't hurt badly, just feels… wrong. Very wrong.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Dull ache, fullness, feeling "heavy"… alright. Now, have you had any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Oh, you asked that already, didn’t you? Sorry, dear. My mind is… not what it used to be. I just don’t feel like eating much. Everything tastes… bland. Like cardboard. I used to love my soups, but even those don't taste good anymore. I just… pick at things. Mostly crackers now. It’s just easier.
DOCTOR: Yes, you mentioned that. Alright, Soila. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listen to your tummy and feel around a bit. It will help me get a better idea of what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that’s alright. If it helps. I don't mind. Just be gentle, please. It’s a bit sensitive, you know. But do what you need to do. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start by listening to your abdomen. Just breathe normally. Hmm… bowel sounds are a bit diminished. Not entirely absent, but quieter than I’d expect. And… there's some mild tenderness here, on the lower left side. Not severe, but present. Abdomen is a bit puffy, as you mentioned. No masses that I can feel right now, but definitely some fullness. Alright. It's good that there are no sharp pains. It's likely something is causing some mild blockage or inflammation. I'd like to order some blood tests and a scan of your abdomen, if that’s alright. It will help us rule out any more serious issues. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh my… That did feel a little bit strange, dear. Blockage? Inflammation? That sounds… serious. I don’t think I have any allergies… not that I know of. I haven't taken much medicine in years. Just some pills for my… arthritis, I think. But I don't take them anymore. Too many side effects, the doctor said. Will the scan hurt? I don’t like being poked and prodded. And… will it show what’s wrong? I just want to feel normal again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, the scan won't hurt, Soila. It's a CT scan, which uses X-rays, but it's very quick and painless. You’ll just lie on a table for a few minutes. As for the arthritis medication, can you remember the name of it?
PATIENT: Oh… the name… It started with a “M,” I think. Something long and complicated. My daughter used to get it for me, but… she’s gone now. It was a little white pill. I just… can’t remember. It’s been so long. I mostly just deal with the aches, you know. It's better than the side effects. I don’t want to bother you with things you don't need to know. I’m just an old woman. Perhaps it’s nothing. I just… feel tired all the time.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Soila. We'll figure it out. It’s important to rule things out. I'm going to order the blood tests and the CT scan. We’ll check your liver function, kidney function, and look for any signs of infection or blockage. It will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. I'm also going to write you a referral to a gastroenterologist. They specialize in digestive problems and will be able to give you a more thorough evaluation. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, a… a gas-tro-enter-what? Is that another doctor? So many doctors… I just want to feel better, dear. If it will help, then yes. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. And… will I need to come back again soon? I don't want to keep bothering you. Maybe it’s just old age. It feels like everything is just… slowing down.
DOCTOR: A gastroenterologist is a doctor who specializes in the digestive system—your stomach, intestines, and all of that. They'll be able to look more closely at what's causing your discomfort. Yes, you will need to come back for a follow-up appointment after the tests are done. We'll discuss the results and make a plan. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, Soila. It’s just a precaution. The tests will help us understand what's going on. I’ll have the nurse schedule that appointment for you before you leave. I'm also going to give you some medication to help with the discomfort. It’s a mild antacid, it may help with some of the bloating.
PATIENT: Oh… alright, dear. More appointments… It’s a lot to keep track of. Antacid… will that help with the heavy feeling? And… will I need someone to drive me to these appointments? I mostly get around on my own, but… sometimes I feel a little bit weak. I don’t want to be a bother to anyone. And… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate it. It’s just… hard getting old. Everything feels so… uncertain.
DOCTOR: Yes, the antacid should help with the heaviness and bloating. As for getting to the appointments, it's best if you have someone drive you, just in case. It's better to be safe than sorry. And you are not a bother at all, Soila. It's my job to help you. I will make sure to send the results of the tests to the gastroenterologist, and they’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. Here's a list of the tests and some instructions. The nurse will go over everything with you before you leave. I will also write a referral for a home health aide if you're feeling weak, they can help you with transportation or assist you at home. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you, dear. A home health aide… That sounds nice. I used to be so independent. …I don’t think I have any questions right now. My mind is a bit foggy. But… thank you. Thank you very much. You're a good doctor. And… I appreciate you listening to an old woman like me. It means a lot. Perhaps… perhaps things will get better. I think I'm ready to go now. If you don't mind. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Soila. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, things will get better. The nurse is just outside, she’ll help you schedule everything and answer any questions you have. Take care now.
