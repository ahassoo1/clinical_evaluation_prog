DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time for chit-chat. It’s this… stuff. Coming up. Bad heartburn, I guess. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, mostly at night. Honestly, it’s quite disruptive. Just want something to fix it, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re experiencing heartburn, primarily at night, and it’s been going on for a few weeks. Disruptive sleep is no fun at all. We’ll certainly try to get to the bottom of this and find some relief for you. When you say “coming up,” could you describe what that feels like exactly?
PATIENT: Well, it feels like… food, I suppose. Or acid. Both. Coming back up my throat. It’s not pleasant. And it leaves a bad taste. Like… old pennies, maybe? Honestly, I don’t need a detailed description of it. I know what it feels like when food decides to revisit me. It’s just… uncomfortable. Is that enough detail for you? I really don't see what describing it will do for fixing it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly clear, Mr. Altine. Thank you. It sounds like acid reflux – the sensation of stomach contents coming back up into your esophagus. The metallic taste you describe can sometimes accompany that. And I appreciate your directness; knowing what it feels like is very helpful. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when this happens?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, mostly at night. After I eat dinner. Doesn’t happen every night, but often enough to be a bother. I usually eat around six, and it starts… an hour or two later, when I’m trying to relax. I prop myself up with pillows, but it doesn’t always help. I'm not one for lingering over meals, either. Quick and simple is my motto. What difference does when it happens make, anyway? It’s coming up, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It does make a difference, Mr. Altine, and I understand your frustration. Knowing the timing helps us pinpoint potential causes and the best course of action. Eating around six and symptoms starting an hour or two later is typical for acid reflux. The fact that it happens after eating and doesn’t occur every night is also useful information. Do you notice if certain foods seem to trigger it more than others?
PATIENT: Foods? Honestly, I eat pretty normal food. Meat, potatoes, vegetables… I’m not one for spicy things, never have been. And I don’t go for a lot of sweets. It's not like I can pinpoint a specific thing. I had steak last week, no problem. Then a simple chicken dinner the night after and that was bad. Really, I think it’s just random. Maybe it's the stress of everything, to be honest. I manage things, you know? Emergencies don't fix themselves. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no specific food triggers that you've noticed, and you suspect stress might be playing a role. That’s good to know. Stress can definitely worsen acid reflux. To get a better overall picture, could you tell me a little about your other medical conditions, if any?
PATIENT: Other conditions? Well, I had my knee replaced about five years ago, but that’s fine now. Apart from that… I'm generally healthy. I don't go to the doctor much, honestly. I like to stay on top of things myself. I take a multi-vitamin, if that counts. And I have insurance, private, thank goodness. I don’t have time to be sick, so I try to prevent it. Is this a checklist or something? I'm a busy man.
DOCTOR: No, it's not a checklist, Mr. Altine, just trying to get a complete understanding of your health. Knowing about the knee replacement is helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I've never had a reaction to anything. I took some antibiotics a few years back for a sinus infection, no problems. I don't take anything regularly, except that vitamin. Honestly, I'm a pretty straightforward case. No complicated medical history, no fancy drugs. Just this… stuff coming up. Can we please talk about fixing it now? I've got a meeting in a couple of hours.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies and only a multi-vitamin. That’s good to know. Alright, let's talk about getting this resolved. Before we discuss treatment options, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs and feel your abdomen. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Sighs heavily Look, I really don't see the point, but fine. If it gets me out of here faster, yes. Just… try to be quick about it. I have things to do. Don't poke around too much, either. I'm not one for being prodded and poked. And please explain what you're doing while you're at it. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. This helps me rule out any other underlying causes for your discomfort. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. I’m checking for any tenderness or masses. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses. Everything feels normal. Based on the physical exam, everything seems alright. Given your symptoms and the fact that you haven’t noticed any specific food triggers, it’s likely acid reflux. However, since it's been going on for a few weeks, I’d like to start with a trial of medication and some lifestyle modifications. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications? Medication? Fine. As long as it works. I don’t want to be on pills forever. What kind of modifications are we talking about? And what’s the medication? Don't give me anything that will make me drowsy, I need to be alert. I run things, you know? I can’t be napping all day. Honestly, the quicker we get this sorted, the better. And please, no complicated instructions. Simple is best.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Altine. I understand your concerns about long-term medication and needing to stay alert. We’ll start with the simplest approach possible. For lifestyle modifications, I recommend elevating the head of your bed by about six inches. This helps prevent stomach acid from flowing back into your esophagus when you lie down. Also, try to avoid eating within three hours of bedtime. Smaller, more frequent meals can also be helpful. As for medication, I’m going to prescribe a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, called omeprazole. It’s a common medication that reduces the amount of acid your stomach produces. It’s generally well-tolerated, and drowsiness is not a common side effect. We'll start with a low dose. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Elevate the bed… alright, I can handle that. No eating before bed… I usually don’t, anyway. Omeprazole… never heard of it, but if you say it won’t make me sleepy… fine. How long do I have to take it? And what if it doesn’t work? I don’t have time for trial and error. Just tell me what’s going to fix this, and how long it will take. Simple, remember? No complicated answers. I have a reputation to uphold, you know? Emergencies don’t wait for a doctor’s appointment.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. We’ll aim for the quickest and most effective solution possible. I’m prescribing omeprazole for eight weeks. After that, we’ll reassess your symptoms. If you’re feeling significantly better, we can discuss gradually tapering off the medication. If your symptoms haven’t improved, or if they worsen, we may need to consider further investigation, such as an endoscopy to examine your esophagus. It’s important to note that medication doesn’t always provide an immediate fix. It often takes a few days, or even a week or two, to see noticeable improvement. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning symptoms, such as difficulty swallowing, unexplained weight loss, or black, tarry stools, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions about the medication or the plan?
PATIENT: Difficulty swallowing… weight loss… black stools? Now that sounds unpleasant. I’ll try to avoid all of that, thank you very much. Look, I think I’ve got it. Elevate the bed, no late-night eating, take the pills. Eight weeks. And if things get bad, call you. Simple. Honestly, I’ve had more complicated briefings on emergency situations than this. Can I go now? I have a meeting to get to. And please, send the prescription to my usual pharmacy. I don't have time to go running around. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Altine. I’ll send the prescription to your pharmacy right away. It was a pleasure meeting you. And I’m glad we were able to come up with a plan that works for you. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and a successful meeting. .
