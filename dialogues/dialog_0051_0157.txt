DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I already told the lady at the front desk. High blood pressure. My husband made me come. Says I’ve been “stressed” lately. Honestly, I don’t see it. It’s probably just the summer heat. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here you mentioned high blood pressure. And it’s alright if you don’t feel particularly stressed, Ms. Dudney; sometimes it doesn’t feel like stress, but it can still affect your body. We'll take a look and figure out what's going on. Your husband seems concerned, and it's good he encouraged you to come in. To start, can you tell me if you know what your blood pressure reading was when it was taken?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. They just…told me it was high. I don’t really pay attention to numbers. Numbers are for accountants and…people who like that sort of thing. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Dudney. You don’t need to remember the numbers. We’ll check it again here, and that will give us a baseline. It won’t take long – just a few minutes. Now, while we get that done, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: General health? What does that even mean? I work. I keep the house tidy. I don't…lie around all day. I guess I'm healthy enough. I don’t get sick often. Maybe a cold now and then. I have private insurance, if that matters. Is that what you want to know? What I pay for?
DOCTOR: No, your insurance is fine to have noted, thank you. When I ask about general health, I just mean things like any ongoing medical conditions you have, or if you've been hospitalized or had any surgeries in the past. Also, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. And no, I haven’t been in a hospital since I was a kid, and that was just for my tonsils. A long time ago. No ongoing…conditions. Look, I eat normal food. I don’t do anything weird. Is this seriously all you're going to ask me? It feels like you’re trying to take up my whole day.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the time, Ms. Dudney, and I apologize if I'm asking a lot of questions. I just want to get a complete picture of your health. Okay, let’s shift gears a bit. How about your family?
PATIENT: My family? What about them? They’re fine. My husband, two sisters, a mom…they all live out West. Don’t see them much. Why do you need to know about my family? Does high blood pressure run in families or something? Honestly, I doubt it. They all seem pretty healthy. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: It's helpful to know if there’s a family history of conditions like high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes, as it can sometimes increase your risk. But if you don't know, that’s alright. We can move on. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Seriously? You’re asking me that now? Do I look like the type? No, I do not smoke. I might have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, if my husband is having a steak. And absolutely not the other thing. What is wrong with you people? This is ridiculous. I’m a civil engineer, for goodness sake. I build things. I don’t…indulge.
DOCTOR: I apologize if these questions seem intrusive, Ms. Dudney. I assure you, I ask them of all my patients to get a complete health history. It helps me understand what might be contributing to your high blood pressure and ensure I provide the best possible care. Alright. Let's just do a quick physical exam, if you're agreeable. Just to check your heart, lungs, and blood pressure again. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…get it over with. But I’m telling you, it’s probably just the heat. And don’t poke and prod too much. I have a meeting later. And I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll be quick. If you could just have a seat here, I'll start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 158/92. That is elevated. Heart sounds are regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles. Pulse is 88 and strong. Everything seems within normal limits, aside from the elevated blood pressure and slightly elevated heart rate. We need to investigate this further. I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying causes. It will include a complete metabolic panel, lipid panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Seriously? You’re going to take more of my blood? What are you looking for, exactly? And how long is this going to take? Because honestly, I'm starting to get a headache. And I’m not sure I trust you anymore. I’m starting to think my husband just wanted to get me out of the house. You know what? Never mind. I’m leaving. I don't need any of this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Dudney, I understand your frustration and concern. I assure you, I only recommend tests that are necessary to determine the cause of your elevated blood pressure and ensure your health. The blood work will help rule out any underlying conditions. However, I respect your decision. I strongly advise you to reconsider. Untreated high blood pressure can lead to serious health problems. But if you are firm in your decision, I will document your refusal of testing. Here is some information about high blood pressure, including lifestyle changes you can make. If you change your mind, or if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, or vision changes, please seek immediate medical attention. Thank you for coming in. Have a good day.
