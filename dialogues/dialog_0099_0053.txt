DOCTOR: Right. Kandy Yadao, 66 years old. Good morning. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too. Well, it's… it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’m having trouble… going to the bathroom. It’s just… difficult to start, you know? And it takes a long time, even then. It's been going on for about… oh, maybe a week now, a little more?
DOCTOR: Difficult to start, you say. And a week or so, gradually worsening. Hmm. Alright. Let's try to be a bit more specific. When you do manage to go, is it a complete emptying, or do you feel like you're still holding some back?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. It feels like I don’t get everything out, yes. Like there’s still some left, even when I’ve been trying for a while. It's not a lot, but definitely not empty, if that makes sense. I have to go back again pretty soon after. It’s just… irritating, honestly. And a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Irritating and worrying, I understand. Alright. And is there any pain or discomfort during urination?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. It's not sharp or anything. More… a straining feeling, like I have to push a little. And sometimes, after I’m finished, there’s a bit of a… a weak feeling, lower down, you know? Not exactly pain, but definitely not comfortable. It doesn't last long, thankfully. Just a few moments.
DOCTOR: Straining, and a weak feeling afterwards. Alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… let me think. It seems… darker, maybe? Not bright yellow like it usually is. More of a… amber color, I suppose. And I don’t know if this is important, but it smells a bit stronger than usual, too. Not awful, just… noticeable. I drink a lot of water, so it's usually very pale.
DOCTOR: Darker urine, stronger odor… and you mention you usually drink a lot of water. Good. Now, let's talk about other things. Have you had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain outside of when you're trying to urinate?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. And no, not really abdominal pain, no. Like I said, it’s just the straining and the weak feeling after. It’s not a sharp pain, just… discomfort. I feel perfectly normal otherwise. I've been eating alright, sleeping alright, everything's been regular except for… well, this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh! Bowel movements… yes. They've been… regular, I suppose. Not much different than usual. Maybe a little… harder, if anything. I haven’t had any trouble going, just… not as soft as they normally are. Is that important? I do try to eat enough fiber, but… well, you know. Getting older. Sometimes things change.
DOCTOR: Harder stools… alright. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine or stool?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, no blood. Definitely not. I would have noticed that, wouldn’t I? No, everything looks… normal, color aside, you know? Just the darker urine and the harder stools. And the trouble starting to pee, of course. I really don’t like worrying about this. It’s probably nothing, but… it's better to be safe, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's go through some medical history then. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my gallbladder out many years ago, oh, must be 20 years now. And I have a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. I take a small pill every morning. Other than that… no, nothing major. I had a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist, but it healed just fine. I see my regular doctor for checkups every year. She always says I’m remarkably healthy for my age, aside from the blood pressure, of course.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, controlled hypertension… Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, just the one pill for my blood pressure. I take it every morning with my breakfast. Nothing else. I don't really like taking pills, so I try to avoid them if I can. Vitamins, maybe, sometimes, but nothing regular. Just when I remember. And I definitely haven't taken anything new recently. I wouldn't have forgotten that!
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any problems with anything like that. I eat everything, really. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I know. My doctor always asks, and I always tell her “no.” I'm quite lucky in that regard, I think. It would be awful to be allergic to something!
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… let me see. My mother had diabetes, but she lived a long life, well into her 80s. My father had heart trouble, but that was later in life too. And my brother… he had high cholesterol, I think. Nothing major, really. Lots of longevity in my family, thankfully. Not much in the way of… serious illness, you know? Just the usual things that come with getting older. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. I'll need you to lie down on the examination table. We'll start with listening to your abdomen and checking your vital signs, and then I'll do a quick neurological exam and a prostate exam. It's standard procedure for these symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A prostate exam? For a woman? I… I think you might have the wrong patient. I’m Kandy Yadao. A woman. I don't think I need a prostate exam. Unless… am I in the wrong room? I’m getting very confused now. Perhaps I should call my regular doctor?
DOCTOR: My apologies. A… a significant oversight on my part. You are absolutely correct. I… I am reviewing an older patient file alongside yours, and clearly the information blended. Please excuse my unprofessional mistake. We will proceed with a standard abdominal and neurological exam, and a pelvic exam. Again, my deepest apologies for the confusion. Let’s start with your abdomen. If you could lie down on the table, please.
PATIENT: Oh, well. Mistakes happen, I suppose. Yes, alright. A pelvic exam is… understandable. Just… please be gentle. And try to remember who you’re examining this time. It was rather upsetting, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Of course. Absolutely. Again, my sincere apologies. I will be as gentle as possible. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope first, just to check for any abnormalities. Breathe normally for me, please. I'm listening for any unusual sounds. Everything sounds… normal so far. No masses or tenderness detected on initial palpation. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, no discomfort. Just a little… strange, having someone poke around. But not painful, no. It feels… normal, I suppose. Like a regular checkup. I've had plenty of those over the years. Just a little… awkward, with the mistake earlier. Are you sure you have the right patient now? Just to be absolutely certain. I wouldn’t want any more surprises.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely certain. Kandy Yadao, female, date of birth [redacted for privacy], confirmed. I reviewed the initial file again while you were getting situated. It was a careless mistake on my part, and I apologize for the anxiety it caused. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes and muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hand as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? I’m quite strong for my age, you know. I still do a bit of gardening, and that keeps my hands strong. Is everything alright so far? You seem very… focused. A little too focused, perhaps? I don't want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Excellent grip strength. Everything appears normal neurologically. Reflexes are intact, and muscle strength is within normal limits. Now, as we discussed, I’m going to perform a pelvic exam. I’ll explain each step as I go. I need you to lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the table. I’ll use a speculum to gently examine your vagina and cervix. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it should be quick. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: A speculum… yes, I’ve had those before. Not my favorite thing, but… necessary, I suppose. No questions, no. Just… be gentle, please. And explain what you're doing as you go. I don't like surprises, as you've already learned. And… try not to think about the mistake earlier. It was very upsetting.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to gently insert the speculum now. It might feel a little cold and uncomfortable at first, but it should be quick. I'm just going to open it slowly. I’m examining the cervix now. It appears… slightly inflamed. No obvious lesions or masses. I’m going to take a swab to test for any infection. This might feel a little uncomfortable. There. That’s all. Now I’m going to remove the speculum. Everything looks… normal overall, aside from the slight inflammation. I'm going to palpate your abdomen again to check your uterus and ovaries.
PATIENT: Inflammation… is that bad? What kind of infection are you looking for? I haven't been feeling unwell, aside from the trouble urinating, of course. Is everything alright down there? You're being very gentle, I'll give you that. But… I'm still a little nervous. I don't like being poked and prodded, even by a doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your uterus feels normal in size and position. Your ovaries are… difficult to palpate due to your body mass index, but I don’t feel any obvious masses or tenderness. The inflammation of the cervix could be due to a number of things – a mild infection, irritation, or even just normal hormonal changes. The swab will help us determine the cause. I’m going to order a urine analysis and a pelvic swab to rule out any infection. We’ll also check your blood pressure again. Once we have the results, we can discuss a plan of treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. A urine analysis and a swab. That's what I expected, really. Yes, alright. Check my blood pressure too, if you think it’s necessary. I trust your judgement. And… thank you for being gentle, despite the initial… mishap. How long will it take to get the results? And… what if it is an infection? What kind of treatment would I need? I'm a little worried now, to be honest. I don't want anything serious.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range for your age. We can discuss adjusting your medication if it remains consistently high. The urine analysis and pelvic swab results should be available in 2-3 business days. If it is an infection, the treatment will depend on the type of infection. It could be as simple as a course of antibiotics, or it might require further investigation. We'll discuss all of your options once we have the results. I don’t want to jump to conclusions before we know what we’re dealing with. For now, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and urinating frequently. If you experience any fever, chills, or worsening pain, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Drink plenty of fluids, avoid caffeine… and wait for the results. Thank you, Doctor. You were… very thorough. And despite the… initial confusion, you were very kind. I appreciate that. I’ll wait for a call from the office in a few days. And… hopefully, it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I apologize again for the earlier mistake. We’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, Kandy. .
