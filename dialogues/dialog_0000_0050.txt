DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Pavlovic, good to meet you. Though, at 90, I expect a few things are starting to ache. Now, tell me… what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Pavlovic… yes, that’s right. It’s been a while since someone got that right. Oh, the cough. It just… won’t go away. Been with me for… goodness, a long time now. I don’t rightly remember when it started, just that it’s always there. Especially when the air gets… dry. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: A long time, you say?
PATIENT: A long time. Maybe a year? More? It’s hard to say. Things… blur. My wife, she used to keep track of these things. But… she’s gone now. So… it's just been me trying to remember. It doesn’t hurt, not really. Just… irritating. And makes it hard to sleep sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right. Irritating. And the dry air makes it worse, you said. Any other symptoms accompanying the cough?
PATIENT: Let me see… well, I get a little… breathless sometimes. Not all the time, just when I… when I try to do things. Like… gardening. I used to have a beautiful garden, you know. But… haven't been able to keep it up lately. And… sometimes I feel a little tired. But who doesn't feel tired at my age? I don’t know if that’s related. Is that what you mean by ‘symptoms’?
DOCTOR: Breathlessness and fatigue. Yes, those are symptoms. And important ones. Have you noticed any… weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… now that's a good question. I haven't been weighing myself. My wife always did that. My clothes feel a little looser, maybe? But that could just be… well, getting older. Everything sags a little, doesn't it? I really couldn’t say for sure. I mostly just eat what’s easy now. Soup, mostly. And toast.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any fever, chills, night sweats?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not that I know of. And no chills, no sweats. I sleep pretty soundly, actually. Or… I try to. It’s the cough that wakes me up. It’s a nice office you have here, Doctor… Batara, was it? Very clean.
DOCTOR: Any history of smoking?
PATIENT: Smoking? Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife, she used to tell me stories about her father… he smoked a pipe, terrible habit. I always thought it was a foolish thing to do. We used to grow tobacco, actually, back in Laos, but that was for… well, for other things. Not for smoking.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… goodness. That was my wife’s department too. She kept track of all that. I think… I might have reacted to something once, a long time ago? A rash, maybe? But what it was, I haven’t the faintest idea. I don’t take many medications, so it’s probably not important. Just some cream for my arthritis, and… that’s about it.
DOCTOR: And what arthritis cream are you currently using?
PATIENT: Oh dear... that’s a good question. It comes in a blue tube, I think? A small one. It's… something with a 'D' in the name. Diclo… Diclofenac? Is that right? Yes, I think that’s it. I get it from the drugstore, down the street. I'm not very good with names, you see. Everything just… slips my mind these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. Let's do a quick examination. I'm going to listen to your lungs, check your heart, and take your blood pressure. Then, we'll discuss a plan. Please sit back.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. My wife always said I should listen to the doctor. I hope it won’t take too long. My bones get creaky if I sit still for too long.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me, please. And exhale slowly. One more deep breath… and exhale.
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It feels… tight in my chest sometimes, you know. Especially when I breathe deep. Like something’s… blocking the air. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily "bad," Mr. Pavlovic. But the wheezing indicates some airway obstruction. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated as well, but we’ll monitor that. Given your age and symptoms, I suspect this is likely a combination of chronic bronchitis, possibly exacerbated by some mild heart strain. It's not uncommon at your age, I assure you.
PATIENT: Chronic… what-now? And… heart strain? I just thought it was old age, you know? Everything getting a little… worn out. Is it something serious, Doctor? Will I… will I need to go to the hospital? My wife, she hated hospitals.
DOCTOR: It's not an emergency, Mr. Pavlovic. No need to panic. Chronic bronchitis simply means inflammation of your airways, leading to that cough and wheezing. The slightly elevated blood pressure… well, we’ll need to manage that. I'm going to order a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of your lungs and rule out anything more serious. And a basic blood panel to check your overall health. It’s standard procedure. We’ll see what the results say. I will also prescribe an inhaler to help open your airways, and a low-dose medication for your blood pressure.
PATIENT: An X-ray… and blood work… alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. An inhaler? What does that do, exactly? And… how long will I have to take these medications? I don’t want to get… addicted to anything. I just want to be able to breathe comfortably again. That's all.
DOCTOR: The inhaler delivers medication directly to your lungs, opening your airways and making it easier to breathe. It’s not addictive, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s simply helping your lungs function properly. As for how long… that depends on the results of your tests. We’ll start with a short course and see how you respond. I’m going to write you a referral to a specialist, Dr. Lee, a pulmonologist. He’s the best in the area. You’ll need to schedule an appointment with him after your X-ray. Here are the prescriptions, and the referral form. The nurse will explain the details of the X-ray and the appointments. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: A specialist… Dr. Lee… That’s… a lot. Will I need someone to drive me to these appointments? My… my friends are all getting on in years, you see. And… how much will all this cost? I don't have… insurance, you know. It’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: The nurse can assist you with transportation options. As for the cost… I’m afraid I can’t give you an exact figure. It depends on the facility and the tests performed. You can discuss payment options with the billing department. For now, focus on getting the X-ray scheduled and following up with Dr. Lee. It's important to get this addressed. The nurse will be with you shortly to answer any further questions. Do you have any immediate concerns?
PATIENT: No… I guess not. Just… getting the X-ray. And seeing Dr. Lee. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I think… I think I’m ready to go now.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will escort you out. Have a good day, Mr. Pavlovic. .
