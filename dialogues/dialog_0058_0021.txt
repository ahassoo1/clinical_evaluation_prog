DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Parascandola, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor Todoro-vich, is it? It’s my foot, see. It's been swelling up something fierce. Started a couple days ago, and it just keeps getting worse. It’s on my right foot, mostly around the ankle. Hurts to walk on it, too.
DOCTOR: Right, your foot. Okay. A couple of days, you say. And it hurts to walk. Hmm. Have you…injured it?
PATIENT: Injured it? Not that I know of, Doctor. I haven’t fallen or anything. I was just…walking. Like usual. I walk to the store most days, you know? Helps keep me moving. But this started after one of those walks, I think. Maybe I stepped on something funny, but I don’t remember anything. I really don’t. It just started feeling tight and then started swelling up. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: "Walking…like usual." Right. So, no specific incident. Just…gradual swelling. Okay. And is there any redness?
PATIENT: Let me see… … Yeah, a little bit, now that you mention it. It’s not bright red, more…pinkish? And it feels warm, if that makes a difference. Not fever warm, but warmer than my other foot, definitely. It’s hard to see under all this…well, you know. I don't get around to shaving my legs as often as I should. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Right. Pinkish. Okay. And, just to be thorough, have you had any fever, chills, or felt unwell at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. I feel fine, other than the foot, of course. No fever, no chills. Just a bit tired, but that’s probably just getting old, you know? I sleep okay, eat okay… nothing different, really. Just this foot being a bother. It’s starting to ache a bit, too, now. Not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: So, dull ache, gradual swelling, pinkish color... alright. Have you tried anything for it at all?
PATIENT: Well, I wrapped it with an elastic bandage, like my mother used to do when I had a sprained ankle when I was a kid. And I've been keeping it elevated when I sit. It helps a little, but not much. I haven’t taken anything for the pain, though. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I just figured it would go away on its own. It hasn’t, though. That's why I'm here.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no improvement with home treatment. Let’s take a look at it, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds good, Doctor. It’s probably nothing serious, but it’s better to be safe than sorry, right? It's just been getting worse each day, and I don't want it to get so bad I can’t walk to the store. Go ahead, take a look.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It's warm to the touch, and there is some tenderness here… Swelling is present, as you mentioned. I don’t see any obvious deformity. Is there any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes! That’s a little sore, Doctor. Not terrible, but definitely uncomfortable. It's more of a dull ache when you press, like a deep bruise, but it stings a little, too. And it feels…tight? Like something is stretched. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness to palpation… and tightness. Alright. It could be a sprain, although the lack of a specific injury is… unusual. We should rule out other possibilities. Do you have any history of blood clots?
PATIENT: Blood clots? Oh, goodness, no! Never had a blood clot, Doctor. My mother always told me to drink plenty of water to keep things flowing, you know? I try to follow her advice. I've never been sick with anything like that. No, definitely no blood clots. I don't even know what that feels like. Is that… bad? Is that what you're thinking it is?
DOCTOR: It's just something we have to ask, Mr. Parascandola. Standard procedure. Given your age, and the fact that the swelling isn’t improving, we should get an X-ray to rule out a fracture. It's unlikely, but better safe than sorry. And just to be thorough, I'm going to order some blood work to check for inflammation. It's probably nothing, but we need to cover all our bases.
PATIENT: Oh. X-ray and blood work… That sounds… serious, Doctor. Is it that bad? I just thought it was a sprain or something. I don’t like needles, you know, and I haven’t had an X-ray since… well, I don’t even remember. Is it going to cost a lot of money? I don't have insurance, and things are… tight.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Parascandola, I understand your concerns, but we need to determine the cause of the swelling. It could be a simple sprain, as you said, but we can’t know for sure without these tests. As for the cost… I can't give you an exact number, but I'll have the billing department contact you. We can discuss options if it's a financial burden. Now, let’s get these orders placed so we can get you some answers. I'll send you with a referral to a radiology center nearby, and a lab requisition. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, okay… a radiology center and a lab. I guess I don't have much choice, do I? I just want to know what's wrong with my foot. And I hope it’s not too expensive. Where is this radiology center? Is it far? And what do I need to bring with me? Do I need an appointment? I'm not good with all this…paperwork and appointments. I usually just walk in places and get things done. It's all a bit much, if you don't mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: The address and phone number are on this paper. You'll need to call to schedule an appointment. They require your identification. And this is the lab requisition. You’ll need to fast for eight hours before your blood draw. Everything you need to know is on these forms. I have patients to see, Mr. Parascandola. If you have further questions, you can contact the front desk. They’re happy to assist with paperwork. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Fast for eight hours… identification… This is a lot to remember. Alright, alright. I guess I’ll try to figure it out. Thank you, Doctor. … I appreciate you looking at my foot, even if you don’t think it’s anything serious. I just want to be able to walk to the store again. .
