DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my family. Lots of… problems. My mother, she had… things. My brother too. I just want to make sure I don’t get them, you know? It’s on my mind a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. It’s very responsible of you to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history that concerns you. When you say “things,” could you tell me a bit more about what your mother and brother experienced?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to say exactly. My mother, she got very… weak. Couldn’t walk good. Always tired. And she… forgot things. A lot of things. My brother, he… his brain. He acted… strange. Different. Doctor said… something about the mind. I don’t remember the words. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a little more to work with. Weakness, fatigue, memory problems with your mother, and changes in mental state with your brother. It sounds like you’re concerned about neurological conditions, perhaps something hereditary. To get a clearer picture, let's start with you. Have you been experiencing any weakness, fatigue, or difficulty with your memory?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get tired sometimes, but… I’m 73! That’s normal, right? Memory… maybe a little slow, but who isn't? I forget where I put my keys, but… everyone does that. Nothing like my mother, though. She… she didn’t even know her own grandchildren sometimes.
DOCTOR: You're right, some forgetfulness is typical with age. It's good that you're aware of the difference between what's normal for you and what you observed with your mother. Let's talk a bit more about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Um… just the usual old man stuff. A little bit of trouble with my knees, but I can still walk. And the doctor told me my blood pressure is a little high. I take a pill for that. Other than that… no. Nothing major. I have Medicare, they check me up every year.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and some knee trouble. That’s helpful. Do you remember the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s… a white pill. Small one. I think it starts with an “A”? Maybe… amlodipine? Is that right? My wife used to handle all the pills. It’s been a while since she… well, since she left.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes, that’s a common medication for high blood pressure. And I'm sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Schwer. It’s completely understandable that you might not remember all the details about your medications right now. Now, regarding your family history – did your mother or brother receive a specific diagnosis, or do you know what the doctors thought might have been causing their problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. It was a long time ago. My mother, the doctor said… something about the brain shrinking? Old age, they said. My brother… they said “mental illness.” But… he wasn't crazy! He just… changed. He got angry easier, didn't sleep. It was sad. They put him in a… a place. I don’t like talking about it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. It sounds like a very difficult experience for you and your family, and it’s perfectly alright if it's hard to talk about. Given your family history of neurological symptoms and changes in mental state, I'd like to do a few simple tests to get a baseline assessment of your cognitive function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? What kind of tests? I don't like tests. Will they… will they show something is wrong? I told you, I feel fine. Mostly. Just a little tired sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Schwer. These aren't like the tests they do at the hospital. They're brief and simple questions and tasks that help me assess your memory, attention, and ability to think clearly. It's a quick way to see if everything is functioning as it should. Think of it as a check-up for your brain, just like we check your heart and lungs. It will not necessarily show anything is wrong, and it’s better to know now if we need to explore anything further. Would you be willing to try a few questions?
PATIENT: …Alright. But just a few. And not too hard, okay? My brain isn’t what it used to be. I get confused easy.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schwer. Just a few, and nothing too difficult at all. We’ll take our time. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: …Today? Uh… August… the second? 2025, right? I think so. It’s been hot, so it must be summer.
DOCTOR: That’s right, today is August 2nd, 2025. Good. Okay, next question. Can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: …Oh. That’s… um… Let me think. It’s a big city. Lots of people. I always forget the name. My wife used to drive, I never paid attention to where we were going. Is it… New York? No, that's wrong. It's… I'm sorry, Doctor. I just can't remember.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Schwer. It's perfectly okay. Knowing what city we are in isn't always easy to remember, especially if you don't drive regularly. Now, can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: The three words are: apple, table, penny. Please repeat them back to me.
PATIENT: …Apple… table… penny.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple math problems. Can you count backwards from 100 by 7s?
PATIENT: …Backwards by 7s? Oh… That’s… hard. I never was good at math. Um… 100… 93? No… Is that right? I'm sorry, Doctor. This is too much. My head is spinning.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schwer, that’s enough for now. Don’t worry about it at all. It sounds like we've gathered enough information for today. I can see this is a bit stressful for you. Based on what you've told me and the brief assessment, and given your family history, I think it would be prudent to order some blood tests and a brain scan - an MRI if possible. This will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions and get a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: …A scan? Like… a picture of my brain? I don’t like that. Is something wrong? You think I have something wrong? I just want to be sure I don’t end up like my mother… or my brother.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schwer. A scan is just a precaution. It doesn't mean there's anything definitely wrong. Think of it like getting an X-ray to check your bones. It's a way to get more information so we can make the best decision about your health. It's important to remember that having a family history doesn't guarantee you'll experience the same thing. But being proactive and getting checked is the best way to stay on top of things. The scan and blood tests will help us determine if any further investigation is needed. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: …Yes, please. Explain it to me… slowly. And tell me if it will hurt. And how long it takes. My wife used to handle all these things… I never liked doctors.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schwer. I understand it’s not easy dealing with these things, especially when you’re not used to it. Let's start with the blood tests. They’re very simple. A nurse will just draw a small amount of blood from your arm, like you might have had done at your annual check-up. It takes just a few minutes, and there might be a tiny pinch. The blood tests will check for things like vitamin deficiencies and inflammation, which can affect your brain function. Now, the brain scan – the MRI. It’s a bit more involved, but it’s painless. You’ll lie down on a table inside a large machine that uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of your brain. It’s like a very powerful camera. It’s a bit noisy, and you'll need to lie very still for about 30-45 minutes while the scan is being taken. We will provide you with headphones to block out the noise. Do you have any metal in your body, like a pacemaker, or any implants?
PATIENT: …Metal? Uh… I don’t think so. I had a tooth filling once, but that was a long time ago. I think they took it out. And… maybe a screw in my knee from when I fell? But the doctor said it was okay. Nothing fancy. Just a little screw.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. The tooth filling and a small screw in your knee shouldn’t be a problem. But it's important to let the technician know when you go for the scan, just in case. I will write an order for the blood tests and the MRI. The nurse will give you instructions on where to go for the blood tests, and the radiology department will contact you to schedule the MRI. In the meantime, I want you to focus on taking care of yourself – eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep, and stay active. And if you notice any new symptoms, or if your current symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to call us. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: …No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You explained it very nicely. It still makes me nervous… but less nervous than before. I hope… I hope everything is okay.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schwer. I understand your nervousness, and it's perfectly natural to feel that way. I’m here to support you every step of the way. We'll get the results of the tests as soon as possible and discuss them with you. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about two weeks to review the results. In the meantime, please take care of yourself and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Sieh. You've been very kind. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schwer. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. .
