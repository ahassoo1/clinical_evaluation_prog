DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing. I mean, I travel all over, you know? Very active. And now this. I just... my legs feel like jelly. Started a few days ago, right after I got over a terrible cold. It's just...weak. Both of them. It's slowing me down, and that's just not acceptable.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you're getting it checked out, even if it feels embarrassing – these things happen, especially with an active lifestyle and after being sick. “Jelly legs,” as you put it, is a good way to describe it. So, it started a few days ago, after a cold. Can you tell me more about the cold itself?
PATIENT: Oh, it was awful. Runny nose, terrible cough, the whole nine yards. Felt feverish for a day, I think. Just a standard cold, really. Nothing special. I usually just power through them, you know? Lots of vitamin C, lots of fluids. This one just... lingered. And then, after about three days of feeling better, my legs started acting up. It wasn't immediate, it was gradual. Honestly, I thought it would just go away on its own. It hasn't.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a pretty standard cold with a runny nose, cough, and fever for about a day, then it lingered. And the leg weakness started after you started feeling better from the cold, and it came on gradually. When you say weakness, can you describe it a bit more specifically?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I can’t walk, Doctor. Don’t misunderstand me. It’s just… difficult. Like trying to walk through thick mud, almost. And it’s worse when I try to stand up from a chair. I have to use my arms to push myself up. And stairs…forget about it. I had to practically crawl up the stairs in my hotel yesterday. It’s just… tiring. And it's both legs, equally. It's not just one side, which is…odd, isn't it?
DOCTOR: That’s a helpful description – “walking through thick mud” is a good way to put it, and the fact that it’s equally affecting both legs is important. It’s good you noticed that. And it’s worse with standing from a chair and stairs. Okay. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the leg weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No numbness, no tingling. No pain, thankfully. My back feels…a little achy, maybe? But I travel a lot, so that could just be from the flights. And I haven't had any trouble with my bladder or bowels, if that's what you're going to ask. I really haven't noticed anything else… honestly. Just the legs. It’s just… inconvenient. It’s ruining my schedule. I have a tour planned for next week.
DOCTOR: Okay, no numbness, tingling, or pain. Mild back ache, which you attribute to travel. Normal bladder and bowel function. And it’s impacting your travel schedule. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’m generally very healthy. I eat well, I exercise… when I can, of course. Medicare keeps an eye on things, you know? They do the regular check-ups. And honestly, this is the first time I’ve had any real trouble in years. My mother had some issues with arthritis, but that's about it in my family. I pride myself on being fit and independent. This whole thing is just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no chronic medical conditions, you generally feel healthy, and Medicare does regular check-ups. Family history is unremarkable aside from your mother’s arthritis. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been very lucky, actually. A few broken bones as a child—scraped knees, things like that—but nothing serious enough for surgery or a hospital stay. I've always been able to bounce back quickly. That's why this is so… bewildering. I usually fix everything myself, with a little rest and a lot of willpower.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. Nothing fancy. And occasionally, ibuprofen for a headache, but that's it. I really try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. I prefer natural remedies, honestly. I'm a firm believer in letting my body heal itself.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. No other medications. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of. I've eaten everything, been everywhere. No hives, no breathing problems, nothing. I'm quite adventurous with food, actually. Part of the fun of traveling, you know? Trying new things. No, allergies aren't an issue.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright, Ms. Firestone, that gives me a good start. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. I have a very busy schedule, you know. But do hurry, please.
DOCTOR: Of course. It won't take long. First, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please sit on the edge of the examination table with your legs dangling?
PATIENT: Just…try to be quick about it, Doctor. I really don't have time for a long examination. And please, don't tap my knees too hard. It's quite unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I'll be gentle, I promise. I’m just going to use this little hammer to check your reflexes. Relax your legs as much as possible. Okay. Both reflexes are a little diminished, but not absent. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Could you please push your legs against my hands?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? I’m not particularly weak, you know. I travel all over the world. This is probably just a temporary thing. Just a little… strain, maybe?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. I agree, it doesn't seem like a severe weakness, but it’s noticeable. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart and lungs sound clear. And finally, I'll just check your feet for any sensation changes. Sensation is intact in both feet. Overall, Ms. Firestone, your exam is relatively normal, but the diminished reflexes and mild leg weakness are concerning, given your recent cold.
PATIENT: So? What does it mean? Is it something serious? I have a tour planned for next week, you know. I can't afford to be laid up in bed. Just tell me straight, Doctor. What's going on?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Firestone. It’s good you’re asking directly. Given your history of a recent cold followed by gradual onset of leg weakness, diminished reflexes, and normal sensation, one possibility we need to consider is Guillain-Barré syndrome, or GBS. Now, before you panic, let me explain. GBS is a rare autoimmune disorder where your immune system attacks your nerves, often after a viral infection. It can cause weakness and tingling, and sometimes it can be serious. But it’s treatable, especially if we catch it early. However, it’s also possible this is just a prolonged post-viral fatigue or a nerve inflammation from the cold. That’s why we need to do some further testing to get a clearer picture. I'd like to order a blood test to look for certain antibodies and a nerve conduction study to assess the function of your nerves. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Guillain-Barré what? That sounds… terrible. Autoimmune? Antibodies? I don’t even know what that means! And a nerve… study? Will that hurt? This is ridiculous! I came in here with a little leg weakness, and now you’re talking about serious diseases and… and tests! I don’t like this one bit. I just… I need to think about it. What are the chances it’s not that… that syndrome? I really don't want to be poked and prodded and… and diagnosed with something awful.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Firestone. It is a scary-sounding diagnosis, and I apologize for causing you anxiety. It's important to remember that GBS is rare, and many conditions can cause similar symptoms. We're not diagnosing you with anything yet – we’re just gathering information to rule things out and get to the bottom of what's causing your weakness. The blood test is a simple draw, and the nerve conduction study involves small, painless electrical impulses – it might feel a little uncomfortable, like a mild tingling, but it doesn’t cause any lasting harm. I would estimate that the chances of it not being GBS are fairly high, but we need to be thorough to rule it out. It's better to know for sure so we can start treatment if necessary. Would you like me to explain the treatment options for GBS, just in case?
PATIENT: Fine. Do the blood test. I suppose I have no choice. But I’m not keen on this… nerve study. Can we do that after we get the blood test results? I need to know what we’re dealing with first. And no, I don’t want to hear about treatments right now. I don’t want to think about treatments. Just tell me when and where I can get the blood drawn. And please, make it quick. I have a schedule to keep. This is all very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Firestone. We’ll start with the blood test. The lab is just down the hall, and you don’t need an appointment. I’ll write you a requisition form. They’re open until 5 pm today, so you can go at your convenience. We typically get the results back in 2-3 business days. Once we have those results, we can discuss whether a nerve conduction study is necessary. And of course, we’ll go over everything step-by-step. Here's the requisition form. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. Just…get it over with. I have a tour to plan, you know. This is wasting valuable time.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And I hope you feel better soon, Ms. Firestone. .
