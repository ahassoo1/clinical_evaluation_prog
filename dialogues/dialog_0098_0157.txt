DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, like the lady on the phone said. Honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. I feel fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure. It's good you're here to get it checked out, even if you’re not feeling any symptoms. High blood pressure can often be silent, that is, cause no noticeable problems until something more serious happens. So, when did you first learn about this elevated blood pressure?
PATIENT: Elevated? Look, I went to a check-up a few months ago with my husband’s doctor – he's a veteran, gets free care – and the nurse said it was a little high. A little. I didn't think much of it. That’s it. It wasn’t my doctor telling me anything was wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this was somewhat unexpected, and perhaps wasn’t fully explained to you at the time. A single reading can sometimes be a bit off, which is why we want to confirm it here and see what’s been going on. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, not much to tell. I haven’t been sick a day in my life. I work outside, I’m on my feet all the time, so I'm pretty active. I eat…normal. My husband handles most of the doctor stuff anyway. He’s very good with all that. Is this going to take long? I have a site survey to get to this afternoon.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear you're generally healthy and active! That’s often helpful. I just ask a few routine questions. Just to be thorough. Okay, so no significant illnesses, surgeries, or hospital stays that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I had my tonsils out when I was little, but that was ages ago. Like, before I started school. And a broken arm once, climbing a tree, but… that's it. Really. I just want to know if I'm okay to go back to work. My boss is already annoyed I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a broken arm, that's good information to have. And I understand your concern about work. We'll definitely get to that. Now, thinking about your family… are there any health problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family? My grandma on my mother's side had… diabetes, I think. And her brother, he had a heart attack when he was pretty young, but he smoked like a chimney. I don't smoke. My dad's side, everyone's pretty healthy. Or they were, before… well, before they all passed. It’s been a while. Look, is this about lifestyle changes? Because I already eat pretty well.
DOCTOR: Okay, so diabetes in your maternal grandmother and a heart attack in her brother who was a smoker. And it sounds like your father’s side of the family had good health overall. That’s helpful. It's good you're already thinking about healthy habits. We’ll see what the exam shows before discussing any lifestyle changes. To get a complete picture, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a multivitamin. My husband says everyone needs one. And sometimes ibuprofen for a headache, if it's really bad. That's it. Honestly, I barely even need that. I don't like taking pills. It feels… unnecessary. Is this going to be a long process? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. That’s good to know. No allergies to either, correct?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. Look, can we just check my blood pressure and tell me if I'm good to go? I’m wasting valuable time here. My team needs me. It's a pretty important site survey.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Dudney, and I want to assure you that I’ll be as efficient as possible. Checking your blood pressure is definitely the next step. I'd also like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline and make sure everything else looks good. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… hurry. I’m really not a fan of doctors’ offices. Too many germs. And… honestly, I just don't have time for a lot of poking and prodding. A quick check is all I need. And tell me straight if I can go back to work or not.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as quick and efficient as possible. We'll start with your blood pressure, then just a quick listen to your heart and lungs. Okay, just relax your arm… and take a few deep breaths. 148 over 92. Hmm… that's elevated. Let me listen to your heart and lungs, and then we can discuss next steps. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Overall, everything sounds good, but the blood pressure reading is definitely something we need to address.
PATIENT: Address? What does that mean? Am I sick? Can I go back to work? I have a very important survey to complete. I really don't have time for a prolonged illness. Look, can we just get a pill or something? Something to lower it, and I can be on my way? My husband has all sorts of medications. He probably has something.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Dudney, let’s take a step back. You are not necessarily “sick”, but your blood pressure is higher than it should be. This is called hypertension. And while a pill might seem like the quickest solution, it's important to understand why your blood pressure is elevated before starting any medication. It could be something simple, or it could indicate an underlying issue we need to investigate. Taking a medication without knowing the cause could mask a more serious problem. And it’s always best to start with lifestyle changes whenever possible. Before we discuss any medications, I'd like to order some basic blood work and a urine test to get a better understanding of your overall health. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood work? Urine test? Honestly, this is getting ridiculous. I came in for a quick check, not a whole medical investigation. I feel perfectly fine! My husband is going to be so angry. He hates when I go to the doctor. Look, I don’t want blood work or urine tests. I just want to know if I can go back to work. And if I need a pill, just give me one. Please. I really need to get this survey completed. It's important. Is that so hard to understand?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney, and I want to reassure you that I’m trying to help you get the answers you need as quickly as possible. However, prescribing medication without proper testing would be irresponsible and potentially harmful. While you may feel fine, high blood pressure often has no symptoms. Ignoring it could lead to serious health problems down the road. To be safe, and to make sure I’m providing you with the best possible care, I strongly recommend the blood work and urine test. It’s a standard procedure for diagnosing hypertension. If you are still hesitant, I can offer a referral to another physician for a second opinion. However, I want to emphasize that these tests are crucial for determining the best course of action. Would you be open to discussing this with your husband?
PATIENT: Fine. Tell him. He can deal with you. He's always right anyway. Just… hurry up. This is a complete waste of my time. And don't tell him I said that. He’ll get mad. I just… I need to get back to work. This is so frustrating. .
