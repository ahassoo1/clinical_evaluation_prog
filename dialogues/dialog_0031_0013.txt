DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It’s good to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out, you see. It just… stays in there. It's been happening for a little while now, maybe a month or so. Not real bad at first, but getting worse.
DOCTOR: I understand. Difficulty with complete bladder emptying, and you've noticed it worsening over the past month. Could you describe what you mean by "stays in there"?
PATIENT: Well, after I go to the bathroom, it feels like… like there’s still some left. I have to… strain a little bit, sometimes a lot, to get the rest out. And sometimes… sometimes I just can’t get it all. It's not painful, not exactly. Just… uncomfortable. And a little worryin’, you know? I don't like feeling like I didn't empty myself completely.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a sensation of incomplete emptying, requiring straining, and sometimes being unable to completely void. No pain associated with urination itself, just discomfort and a sense of fullness. And it’s been concerning you. To get a better understanding, could you tell me approximately how often you're urinating during the day?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t really… keep track. I guess… maybe every two or three hours? Could be more, could be less. It depends on how much water I drink, I suppose. I try to drink plenty, especially with the weather being warm. I don’t want to get dehydrated, you know? But it seems like… even when I drink less, I still have to go around that same amount. It’s hard to say for sure. I haven't been writin' these things down.
DOCTOR: That's alright, we can work with an estimate. So, roughly every two to three hours during the day. And you haven’t noticed a significant change in frequency related to your fluid intake?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, if I drink a lot, I have to go more, of course. But even on days when I’m careful, tryin’ not to drink too much, it’s still about the same. I also find myself gettin’ up… once or twice at night. Used to not have to do that. That’s new, just in the last few weeks. Just a little bit, though. Not a whole lot. But enough to bother me. I like a good night's sleep, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency during the day, and you’ve developed nocturia – waking up once or twice at night to urinate – over the past few weeks. Has there been any change in the stream itself?
PATIENT: Stream? You mean… when it comes out? Well… it’s not as strong as it used to be, I suppose. It doesn’t… push like it once did. More of a… trickle, sometimes. I have to… wait a bit before it really gets goin’, you see? And sometimes it starts and stops. Not all the time, but enough that I notice it. It's not painful, just… weak. And slow. Like tryin' to fill a bucket with a tiny hole.
DOCTOR: Okay, a weaker stream, hesitancy – that’s the delay in starting – and intermittency – the starting and stopping. This is all helpful information, Mr. Hilber. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Well… let’s see. I had high blood pressure for a little while, years ago. But the doctor put me on some pills and it went away. Haven't had any trouble with it for a long time now. And… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. But that was a long time ago, doesn't bother me none. Other than that… not really. I try to stay healthy, you know? Eat good food, get some exercise when I can. I don't really go to the doctor much. I only go when somethin’ is really botherin’ me, like this. I have Medicare, so I try not to bother them if I can help it.
DOCTOR: I see here you were diagnosed with hypertension in 2010, but it's been well-controlled, and there’s no record of current medication. Appendectomy as a child, that's good to know. And no other significant medical history listed. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to any pills before. I've taken a few different things over the years for colds and aches, but never had any trouble with them. My wife… she had allergies, but I didn't. Poor thing. She was always snifflin' and sneezin'. But I never had any problems with medications myself. I can usually take anything the doctor gives me, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a baby aspirin every day. Doctor told me to, after my heart started actin’ up a little bit a few years back. Just one. And… sometimes I take some fish oil pills. For my joints, you know? They get achy when the weather changes. Other than that… no, not really. I don't take a lot of pills. I prefer to stay natural, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, daily baby aspirin for cardiac health, and fish oil supplements. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never have. My wife… she smoked for a while, but she quit years ago. Tried to get me to try it once or twice, but I never had the taste for it. Always thought it was a foolish habit. And it didn't agree with her lungs, that's for sure. She coughed somethin’ awful when she smoked. No, I don't smoke, never have, never will.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Well, I have a little bit now and then. Mostly on Sundays with dinner. A glass of wine, maybe. Or a beer. Not much. I don't drink every week, even. Just when I'm feelin' sociable, or when I'm with friends. I don't go out to bars or anything. Just a little somethin' to relax with. Not enough to bother me, I wouldn't think. I don't drink to get drunk, you see. Just to enjoy myself a little bit.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional light alcohol consumption. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your work and social life?
PATIENT: Well, I used to work at the shoe factory, makin’ shoes. Did that for… oh, a long time. Thirty years, maybe more. But the factory closed down a few years back. Now I mostly stay home, fix things around the house, help my neighbors when they need it. I’m retired now, you see. Don't have to work anymore. Social life… not much, to be honest. My wife… she was the social one. After she passed… it's been hard to get out and do things. I see my grandkids every now and then, that's nice. And I go to church on Sundays. But mostly I just keep to myself. It's a quiet life, but it's a good life. I don't need a lot to be happy.
DOCTOR: I understand. Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Hilber. That gives me a good overall picture of your health. Now, I think it would be best to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what’s causin’ this trouble with my water. It's worryin' me, you know? So, if an exam will help, I'm happy to do it. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then, I'll do a quick neurological exam just to assess your reflexes. And finally, I'll perform a prostate exam, if you're comfortable with that. It's a standard part of evaluating urinary issues in men. It can help us check the size and condition of your prostate gland, which can sometimes contribute to these symptoms. The prostate exam involves a gentle digital rectal exam. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. It takes only a few seconds. Do you have any objections to that part of the exam?
PATIENT: Well… a prostate exam… I’ve heard about those. Not exactly lookin’ forward to it, to be honest. It sounds… unpleasant. But I understand it's important, if you think it's necessary. I trust you, Doctor. If it will help figure out what's wrong, then… then go ahead. Just… be gentle, if you would. And tell me what you’re doin' as you go, so I know what to expect. I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Hilber. I will explain everything as I go, and I will be as gentle as possible. It is a quick exam, and I'll let you know before I start. Alright, let's start with listening to your abdomen. Please lie back on the exam table. Your abdomen sounds normal – no unusual sounds or blockages. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please keep your arms relaxed. Your reflexes are within normal limits. Now, if you are comfortable, we can proceed with the prostate exam. Please lie on your left side, with your knees bent. I will use lubricant and a gloved, finger to gently examine your rectum. Remember, it should not be painful, but you may feel some pressure. Let me know if you experience any discomfort at any point.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Just… let me know when you’re startin’. I’m ready, I suppose. Just… be gentle, like you said. And tell me what you're doin'. It helps to know what to expect. I'm a little nervous, but I trust you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. I’m just going to gently insert my finger into your rectum. This allows me to feel the size, shape, and consistency of your prostate gland. I'm also checking for any tenderness or abnormalities. Okay, I’ve completed the exam. Your prostate feels slightly enlarged, but it's smooth and symmetrical. There's no tenderness. That’s a good sign. Based on the physical exam, the enlargement could be contributing to your symptoms. However, to get a more definitive answer, I’d like to order a few tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A little uncomfortable, but… I’m glad it’s over. Tests? What kind of tests? I don't like goin' to a lot of different doctors and havin' a lot of things poked and prodded. What will they tell you? And how long will it take? I just want to figure out what’s wrong and get it fixed, you know? I don’t want a big ordeal.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Hilber. I want to assure you that these tests are standard procedures, and we’ll keep everything as straightforward as possible. The first test I recommend is a urinalysis. This involves testing a sample of your urine to check for infection, blood, or other abnormalities. It’s a simple test, and we can do it right here in the clinic today. The second test I recommend is a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, blood test. This test measures the level of PSA in your blood, which can be elevated if your prostate is enlarged or inflamed. This test will also be done today. Finally, I recommend a post-void residual, or PVR, measurement. This test measures the amount of urine remaining in your bladder after you urinate. This can help us determine if you are completely emptying your bladder. We can do this using a bladder scanner right here in the clinic as well. These tests will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on and help us determine the best course of treatment. Do these tests sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Alright… those don’t sound too bad. A little bit of blood, a little bit of pee… I can handle that. Better than not knowin’, I suppose. So, you can do them all here, today? That’s good. I don’t want to have to come back a bunch of times. And… how long will it take to get the results? And what happens after that? Will I need to see a specialist? I'm gettin' a little worried now, to be honest. I just want to know what’s wrong and get it fixed, like I said. I just want to be able to sleep through the night again.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Hilber. It’s perfectly normal to feel worried when you’re facing uncertainty. Yes, we can do all the tests here today. The urinalysis and PSA blood test will be sent to the lab, and the results should be available within 24 to 48 hours. The PVR measurement can be done immediately after you urinate. Once we have the results, I’ll review them with you and discuss the best course of action. In many cases, these symptoms can be managed with lifestyle changes or medication. However, depending on the results, you may need to see a urologist – a specialist in urinary issues – for further evaluation. I’ll give you a referral if it’s necessary. Let’s get these tests done first, and then we’ll take it from there. I’ll also have my nurse come in to explain the process and answer any questions you may have. Would you like me to go over the steps for each test now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Tell me what I need to do. I like to know what to expect. And thank you, Doctor. You’re explainin’ things well, and that helps a lot. I just want to get this figured out.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Hilber. Let’s start with the urinalysis. You’ll be given a sterile cup, and I’d like you to collect a mid-stream urine sample. That means you’ll start urinating into the toilet, then collect a small amount in the cup mid-stream, and finish urinating into the toilet. It’s important to avoid getting any contaminants in the sample, so please avoid touching the inside of the cup. My nurse will give you instructions on how to properly collect the sample. Next, we’ll draw a small amount of blood for the PSA test. You’ll sit in a comfortable chair, and a phlebotomist will draw blood from a vein in your arm. It’s a quick procedure, and it shouldn’t be painful, although you may feel a slight pinch. Finally, after you urinate, we’ll use a bladder scanner to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder. It’s a non-invasive procedure – we simply hold a device over your lower abdomen to get the reading. Do you have any questions about the process so far?
PATIENT: Mid-stream… got it. Don’t touch the cup. And just a little bit of blood… alright. The scanner sounds easy enough. I guess my only question is… will the blood make me feel weak? I don't like feelin' faint. And will the urine sample need to be refrigerated or anything? I want to make sure I do it right.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mr. Hilber. The amount of blood drawn for the PSA test is very small, so it’s unlikely to make you feel weak. However, it's always a good idea to drink some water before and after the blood draw to stay hydrated. If you do feel faint, please let my nurse know immediately, and we'll have you lie down. Regarding the urine sample, it doesn’t need to be refrigerated. Just collect the sample as soon as possible after waking up, and bring it to my nurse right away. We’ll send it to the lab promptly. We'll have my nurse come in now to collect the sample and draw your blood. She’ll guide you through the process and answer any further questions you may have. Are you ready for her to come in?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Just… try not to poke too hard.
DOCTOR: I’ll be sure to let her know. She’s very gentle and experienced. I’ll step out for a moment to give you some privacy. She’ll be right in. Please let me or the nurse know if you need anything at all.
