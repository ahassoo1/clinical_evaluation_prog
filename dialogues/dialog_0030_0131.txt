DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sladen. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Quicksey. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Quicksey! It's nice to meet you as well. Well, I've been having a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, that's why I made the appointment. It's been running a little high, according to the machine at the pharmacy.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. High blood pressure is definitely something we want to investigate. When did you first notice the readings being higher than usual?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... it was probably… around March, maybe? I check it at the pharmacy every couple of weeks, just to keep an eye on things, and that’s when I started noticing it creeping up a bit. Not drastically, but enough to make me a little worried.
DOCTOR: Alright, so around March. And has it been consistently higher since then, or does it fluctuate?
PATIENT: It's been mostly consistent, yeah. Maybe a good day here and there, but generally it's been higher than what I’m used to. I wouldn't say it swings wildly, but definitely not staying in the normal range like it used to. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. And do you happen to know what the readings have been, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see if I wrote it down… Okay, here we go. The last few times, it's been around 140 over 90, sometimes a little higher, like 145 over 95. That's why I figured I should come get it checked out. I’m not a doctor, but that doesn’t sound right, does it?
DOCTOR: No, you are right to be concerned. 140/90 and higher is considered elevated. Let's get a better reading here in the office, and then we can discuss some potential causes and next steps. Before we do that, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Sure thing. Not much to tell, honestly. I haven't had any big illnesses or surgeries. I had the usual childhood stuff - chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. No diabetes, no heart problems in the family that I know of. I’m on Medicare, just because of my age, but haven't needed to use it much. My mother has arthritis, but that's about it. I’ve always been pretty healthy, which is why this blood pressure thing is a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies at all! I can take pretty much anything without any problems. I haven’t really had to take much medication, to be honest, besides the occasional pain reliever for a headache. But never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And are you currently taking any medications regularly, even over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just the occasional Tylenol for a headache, like I said. No vitamins, no prescriptions, nothing. I try to eat healthy and get enough rest, so I don’t really feel like I need anything. That’s why I was surprised about the blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no! Not at all. I don't smoke, haven’t ever tried it. And I maybe have a glass of wine once or twice a year, with dinner. Definitely not a regular thing. And no, no recreational drugs, never. I’m a pretty simple person, really.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And what about your activity level?
PATIENT: Well, I wouldn’t say I’m a marathon runner, if that's what you’re asking! I try to get some exercise. I walk most days, usually around the neighborhood for about 30 minutes. And I do a little gardening, which keeps me moving. But it's not a super intense workout or anything. Just trying to stay active, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And what do you do for work, Ms. Sladen?
PATIENT: Oh, I work as a… well, it’s a little hard to explain. I do personal care and service work, all sorts of little jobs. Mostly helping people with errands, light cleaning, that kind of thing. It keeps me busy, and I enjoy it. It’s not physically demanding, though. Mostly just being on my feet a bit. I don’t have a set schedule, it varies.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good information. Now, before we take your blood pressure, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your pulse, and a quick look at your reflexes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine! Absolutely. Go right ahead. I want to get to the bottom of this, so anything you need to do, just let me know. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear, good air movement on both sides. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Reflexes are normal. Now let's get your blood pressure. Please relax your arm comfortably. Okay, your blood pressure is 142 over 92. It confirms what you were seeing at the pharmacy. And your temperature is 98.6 and your respiratory rate is 16, both within normal limits.
PATIENT: Okay, 142 over 92… So it is higher than it should be. That’s… a little worrying, isn’t it? What does that mean, exactly? Is it something serious? I’m not trying to be difficult, I just… I don’t really understand all of this medical stuff.
DOCTOR: You're not being difficult at all, it's perfectly normal to be concerned and want to understand. 142/92 is considered Stage 1 hypertension, or high blood pressure. It's not an emergency, but it does need to be addressed. High blood pressure puts extra strain on your heart and blood vessels, and over time, can increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, and other health issues. However, it's often manageable with lifestyle changes and, if needed, medication. We need to figure out why your blood pressure is elevated before deciding on the best course of action. Do you have any family history of high blood pressure, kidney disease, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… Not that I’m aware of, actually. My mother, she has arthritis, like I said, but no high blood pressure. And my father passed away a long time ago, but I don’t remember him having any heart problems. And I don’t really know much about my grandparents, to be honest. We weren’t very close. So, no, I don’t think there’s any family history. That’s why I’m so surprised.
DOCTOR: Okay. Since there’s no known family history, that suggests this could be related to lifestyle factors or other underlying causes we need to investigate. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and cholesterol. We should also do an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity. And I’d like to have you do a urine test as well. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I want to get to the bottom of this, so go right ahead and order whatever tests you need. I trust your judgement. When will I be able to get those done? And will I need to come back here, or can I do them somewhere else?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can do all of those tests here at the clinic today. The urine test is quick and easy, and the blood work will take about 15-20 minutes. The EKG will only take a few minutes as well. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. I anticipate the results will be back in about 3-5 business days. In the meantime, I recommend starting to track your blood pressure at home, if you can. It will give us a better understanding of how it fluctuates throughout the day. Do you have a blood pressure monitor at home?
PATIENT: No, I don't have one at home. That's why I’ve been relying on the machine at the pharmacy. So, you’re saying I should get one? Which kind should I get? There are so many different ones, I wouldn’t even know where to start.
DOCTOR: You’re right, there are a lot of options. A standard, automatic upper arm blood pressure monitor is best. You don't need anything fancy. Look for one that has a cuff size appropriate for your arm – most pharmacies have them, and the staff can help you choose the right size. The Omron and A&D brands are generally reliable. The important thing is to use it consistently, at the same time each day, and to record the readings. We can discuss the readings at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions about any of this so far?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand everything. Get a blood pressure monitor, track my readings, and come back in a few days to discuss the test results. And you're going to order those tests for me today? That sounds good. Thank you, Dr. Quicksey. You’ve been very helpful and put my mind at ease a little bit.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sladen. I’m glad I could help. Yes, I’ll go ahead and order those tests for you right now. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, or vision changes, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other concerns or questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly, Dr. Quicksey. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I'll go ahead and wait for the nurse, then. Thank you again.
