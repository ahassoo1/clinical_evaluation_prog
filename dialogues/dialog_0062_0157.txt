DOCTOR: Hi Tasmia, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time. My blood pressure’s been high, okay? That's what the machine at the pharmacy said. I just need a refill for whatever I was already on and I need to get going.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're short on time and want to get this sorted quickly. It’s good you're being proactive about your blood pressure. Just to be sure, and so I can write the prescription accurately, can you tell me what medication you were taking previously for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Honestly? I have no idea. My husband handles all that. He picks up the pills, tells me what to take and when. I just... take them. I don’t look at the names or anything. He said it was for the pressure. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. It's not ideal, but it happens. It's important for you to know what you're taking, even if your husband is managing things. We want to make sure the medication is still the right one for you and that there aren't any interactions with anything else. Before I write anything, could we quickly check your blood pressure here in the office just to get a baseline?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? I just had it checked at the pharmacy. Isn’t that enough? It’s probably the same. I was already stressed going to the pharmacy, so it was probably high then, too. Look, I’m not trying to be difficult, but I have a lot on my plate today.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and I'm not trying to add to your stress. Pharmacy readings can be a little off sometimes, and checking it here allows me to get a more consistent reading in a calmer environment. It also helps me to assess you overall. It will only take a few minutes. And honestly, it’s just part of good medical practice to confirm things myself. We're aiming for the most accurate picture of your health, okay?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. And don’t ask me a bunch of questions about my diet or exercise or anything. I eat normal food and I… get around. Is that okay? Just take the pressure.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Just relax your arm, please. I'll keep it brief. I do need to ask a few quick questions for documentation, just basic things. It’s mostly to rule out any immediate concerns. First, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. My husband always checks all that stuff when he gets the prescription filled. I told you, he handles all this. Look, is this machine going to squeeze my arm really tight? I don’t like that.
DOCTOR: It will tighten, but it shouldn't be painful, just a firm pressure for a moment. It will be quick. Okay, and have you had any other medical conditions diagnosed – anything at all?
PATIENT: Just the pressure, like we said. And… well, my doctor back home, before we moved, said something about my cholesterol being a little high once. But my husband got me some stuff for that, too, and I’ve been taking it. He said it was okay. Don’t ask me what it’s called. Really, I don’t remember.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you currently take any other medications or supplements besides what we’ve discussed – anything for headaches, vitamins, anything at all?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I have no idea. Little pills in little bottles. He puts them all together in this thing… a pill organizer, I think it’s called. Every week. I just swallow what's in there. I don’t even look at them, I just take them when he tells me to. It’s easier that way. Look, can we just get to the refill? I really need to go. This is taking forever.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tasmia. I understand your frustration, and I want to help you as quickly as possible. However, because I don't have a clear list of what you're currently taking, I can’t responsibly refill a prescription. It’s important to know exactly what medications you’re on to avoid potential interactions or side effects. To move forward safely, we have a couple of options. One, could your husband call the pharmacy and provide me with a list of your current medications?
PATIENT: Look, he’s at work. He can’t just… call. And honestly, I’m not calling him to ask about pills. That’s embarrassing. I just want my blood pressure medicine. This is ridiculous. Can’t you just give me the same thing I got before? It worked fine. Is that even legal to not give me what I need? I’m starting to feel really stressed now, and you know what that does to my blood pressure! .
DOCTOR: I understand you’re feeling stressed and frustrated, and I apologize for the inconvenience. You are right, stress can definitely affect your blood pressure. I want to help you, and I'm not trying to make things difficult. However, it is not safe or legal for me to simply refill a medication without knowing what it is and confirming it's appropriate for you. Given the situation, and because you are unsure of your current medications, the safest course of action is for me to recommend you see a specialist—a cardiologist—for a more thorough evaluation. They can review your history, conduct appropriate tests, and ensure you are on the right medication. Would you like me to provide you with a referral to a cardiologist in the area?
