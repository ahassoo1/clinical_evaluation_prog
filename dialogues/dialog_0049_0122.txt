DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. It is… difficult to explain, but I have been… forgetting things. Small things, mostly. Lately, it has been happening more. I am Venus Alvara, by the way. Perhaps you have it in your papers already? I do apologize for the trouble, I just… want to understand what is happening.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Alvara, I do have your information here. Venus Alvara, age 53. And you're concerned about increasing forgetfulness… right. "Small things," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Things like… where I put my keys. Or the name of a neighbor I have known for years. It is… embarrassing. And I worry. My blood pressure has been… not good, the doctor told me. Is that… connected, do you think? I do not understand these things.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure can sometimes contribute to cognitive issues, but it’s rarely a direct cause, especially for just forgetting keys or names. We need to explore other possibilities. Now, when did you first start noticing these lapses in memory?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Let me think. I believe… approximately six months ago? It began very gradually. I would misplace something, then find it later. Or… struggle for a word, you know? It was not frequent. But in the last month, it has been… more noticeable. Every week, maybe several times a week. It worries me, Doctor. I do not like feeling… this way.
DOCTOR: "Several times a week…" Alright. And are these memory issues interfering with your daily life?
PATIENT: Yes, they are, Doctor. I manage properties, many things to remember – appointments, tenant concerns, bills… It is… becoming difficult to keep everything straight. Just yesterday, I almost double-booked a contractor. A very expensive mistake, that would have been. And I worry about forgetting important details when speaking with my tenants. I need my mind to be sharp. It is my livelihood. It is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Properties, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Several apartment buildings, and a few single-family homes. I handle everything – the finances, the maintenance requests, dealing with the tenants, the association meetings… It is a great deal of responsibility. I have been doing this for… twenty years, now. But lately, it feels… overwhelming. As though my brain is not working as quickly as it used to. I apologize, I do not mean to ramble. I am simply… concerned. It is difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Right. Twenty years... and a significant workload. Before we jump to conclusions, let’s go through a standard review of systems. It's just a series of questions to get a broader picture. Have you experienced any headaches lately?
PATIENT: Headaches? Hmm… not frequent. I had a mild one last week, but I often get those when the weather changes. Nothing… unusual. I take an over-the-counter pain reliever, and it goes away. No other headaches recently, no. I do not suffer from them often. Is that… relevant, Doctor? I hope I am not taking up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: It’s all relevant, Ms. Alvara. We need to rule things out. Any dizziness or vision changes?
PATIENT: Dizziness… occasionally, when I stand up too quickly. I am rather tall, you see, 195 centimeters, and sometimes I feel a bit lightheaded. But it passes quickly. Vision… no changes that I have noticed. I had my eyes checked last year, and everything was fine. I do not have trouble reading or driving. No, no vision changes. Is this… what you are looking for, Doctor? I want to be helpful, but I am not certain what is important.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your sleep pattern?
PATIENT: Sleep… that is… a little difficult. I do not sleep as well as I used to. I wake up several times during the night. Sometimes I struggle to fall asleep. I do not think it is a serious problem, just… age, perhaps? I do not feel tired during the day, usually. I try to go to bed around ten o'clock, but sometimes I am still thinking about work. Is that… important, Doctor? I do not take anything to help me sleep.
DOCTOR: And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not regularly. As I said, I sometimes take something for a headache, but that is all. I do not take anything for my blood pressure. The doctor told me to watch my diet and exercise more. I try, but it is… difficult. I do not take any vitamins or supplements, either. No. Nothing regular. I apologize for being… so forgetful. It is making this very difficult. I hope you can help me find out what is happening.
DOCTOR: Right. No medications. Okay. Now, let's talk about your family history. Has anyone in your family experienced memory problems or dementia?
PATIENT: That is… a difficult question. My parents… they both passed away several years ago. My mother… she was always a little… scattered. She would misplace things, forget appointments. But I do not believe it was anything serious. She simply… was not very organized. My father… he was very sharp, all his life. No, I do not recall anyone in my family having… what you call… dementia. It is a very sad thing, isn’t it? I apologize, I am not very knowledgeable about these things. It is just… worrying. What do you think is happening, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Alvara, it's too early to say definitively. Given your age and workload, and the gradual onset of these symptoms, it could be related to stress and mild cognitive impairment. But we need to rule out other potential causes. We'll start with some basic blood work to check your thyroid, vitamin levels, and rule out any underlying infections. I’ll also want to get your blood pressure checked again today, to get a more accurate reading.
PATIENT: That… sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work and another blood pressure check. I am relieved you are taking this seriously. Is… is there anything else I should be doing? Anything I should be avoiding? I worry about my tenants, and my properties. I need to be… sharp. I do not want this to… affect my business. Perhaps I should slow down? I apologize for rambling. Just… anxious. What do you suggest?
DOCTOR: For now, Ms. Alvara, I wouldn't make any drastic changes to your routine. Trying to self-diagnose or excessively worry will likely just exacerbate the problem. Let's get the blood work done and revisit this once we have the results. I would suggest maintaining a consistent sleep schedule as best as you can, and ensuring you are adequately hydrated. I'll have the nurse take your blood pressure now and draw the necessary samples.
PATIENT: .
