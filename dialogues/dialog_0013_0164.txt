DOCTOR: Hi Mande, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It's nice to meet you too, Doctor. Well, it's a bit strange, honestly. I've been feeling really tired lately, and I've also been…yellowish, I guess you'd say. My skin and eyes, it's not right. And it seems to happen after I eat fava beans. It's a bit embarrassing to even talk about, but it's worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is a bit unusual, but don't be embarrassed at all – that's what I'm here for. Tiredness and yellowing of the skin and eyes – that yellowing is called jaundice, by the way – and it being linked to fava beans…that's a really important piece of information. Just to clarify, how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, jaundice, that's what it's called. Good to know. It's been happening on and off for… maybe a year now? It's hard to say exactly. The tiredness has been worse lately, maybe the last few months. And the yellowing… it comes and goes, like I said. Definitely worse after I eat fava beans, though. Like, within a day or so, I start to look unwell. I haven’t eaten them for a while now, trying to avoid it, but I did have some at a friend’s barbecue a couple of weeks ago and it was pretty bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, a year of on-and-off symptoms, worsening tiredness in the last few months, and a clear connection to fava bean consumption… that's very helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the tiredness and yellowing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been a bit short of breath sometimes, especially when I’m walking uphill. And my urine has been… darker than usual, I think. Not drastically, but noticeable. Oh, and I feel a bit weak overall, like I don't have much energy. Does that make sense? I haven’t really told anyone else about this, so I’m trying to remember everything.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mande, and you're doing great remembering everything. Shortness of breath, darker urine, and overall weakness… those are all important pieces of the puzzle. Do you have any pain in your abdomen, or have you noticed any changes in your stool color?
PATIENT: No, no pain in my stomach at all. And… no, my stool color hasn’t changed, as far as I can tell. It looks normal. I haven't really paid that much attention, to be honest. I should probably start paying more attention, shouldn't I? Sorry, this is all a bit… much.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mande, don't apologize. You're doing fine. It's perfectly normal to not routinely monitor stool color! Okay. And just to get a complete picture, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, not that I can remember. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. No regular medications, nothing like that. I don’t usually get sick, so I haven’t needed to see a doctor much in my life. This is… new.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just a multivitamin occasionally. That's good to know. Given your symptoms, especially the connection to fava beans, I’m concerned about a possible enzyme deficiency called G6PD deficiency. It can cause episodes of jaundice and tiredness after exposure to certain triggers, like fava beans. To confirm this, I’d like to order a blood test to check your G6PD levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: G6PD deficiency? I've never heard of that. But if that's what might be causing this, then yes, absolutely. A blood test sounds good. Anything to figure out what's going on. I just want to feel normal again. Is it a painful test? I don’t like needles very much.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be nervous about needles! It’s a very common fear. The blood test itself is fairly quick and shouldn’t be too painful – just a small prick in the arm. It might sting for a moment, but it's usually over very quickly. We'll send the sample to the lab, and the results usually take a couple of days to come back. While we're waiting for those results, it's best to avoid fava beans and anything that might trigger your symptoms. I'd also like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds manageable. A quick prick I can handle, I think. And yes, definitely, a physical exam is good. The more information, the better. Avoiding fava beans isn't a problem, I've already been trying to do that. So, what exactly will you be looking for during the exam? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Good question. I'll be listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen for any tenderness or enlargement, and looking at your skin and eyes for signs of jaundice. I'll also take your blood pressure and pulse. It's a pretty standard exam, just to rule out any other possible causes for your symptoms. If you could just lie down on the table, we'll get started.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… okay. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, okay? I'm a bit of a worrier.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mande. I will. Alright, let's start by listening to your heart and lungs. Take nice, deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling. Good. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any pain or tenderness. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, that’s okay. Doesn't hurt at all. Just feels… normal, I guess. A little pressure, but nothing concerning. I do feel a bit weak, but I’m not sure if that’s from everything that’s going on or just… me.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No tenderness detected. You're right, a general feeling of weakness is difficult to pinpoint. I’m now checking your skin tone. I notice some mild yellowing, especially in your sclera – the whites of your eyes. It’s not severe, but it's consistent with what you've described. Your sclera does have a yellowish tinge, as expected. Blood pressure is 128/80, and pulse is 72. Everything else appears normal on initial examination. Okay, Mande. That completes the physical exam. Everything seems stable, but the blood test will give us a much clearer picture. It’s likely G6PD deficiency, but we need to confirm it. While we’re waiting for the results, it’s important to continue avoiding fava beans and any other foods or medications that might trigger your symptoms. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, that all makes sense. Avoiding fava beans, I can do that. I guess… what happens if it is G6PD deficiency? Is it serious? Is there a treatment? I'm a bit scared, honestly. It's just… a lot to take in. And thank you for being so patient with me. I know I'm probably asking a lot of silly questions.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking silly questions at all, Mande. It’s perfectly normal to be scared and want to understand what’s going on. And you're very welcome – that’s what I’m here for. G6PD deficiency isn’t usually serious if you know you have it and avoid triggers. It’s a genetic condition, meaning it’s inherited. The main concern is avoiding substances that can cause a sudden breakdown of red blood cells, which is what causes the jaundice and tiredness. There’s no cure for G6PD deficiency, but it’s manageable. Treatment focuses on avoiding triggers and, if you do experience a reaction, supportive care like hydration and, in some cases, blood transfusions. Most people with G6PD deficiency live normal, healthy lives. We'll discuss all of this in more detail once we have the blood test results. I’ll also give you a list of foods and medications to avoid. For now, just focus on continuing to avoid fava beans and try not to worry too much. Do you have any family members who might also experience similar symptoms, or a family history of anemia or jaundice?
PATIENT: That… that's actually a bit reassuring. Manageable is good. I'm glad there's not a cure I need to find, just things to avoid. Thank you. Let me think… my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she was often tired and pale. I remember my mother saying she had “weak blood” or something like that, but it was a long time ago, and we didn’t see her very often. I don’t know if that’s related, but it's the only thing I can think of. She passed away a long time ago, so I can’t ask her. My mother and my sister seem perfectly healthy, though. They’ve never had any problems like this. I think that's all I can remember right now. I’m still a bit shaken up, but I feel a little better knowing what we're looking for. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know about your grandmother. A history of fatigue and pale skin in the family could be relevant. We'll keep that in mind. Right now, let’s focus on getting those blood test results back. I’ll have the lab send them directly to me, and I'll contact you as soon as they’re available – hopefully within a couple of days. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden worsening of your symptoms – severe fatigue, dark urine, yellowing of your skin or eyes – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’ll also send you a handout with information about G6PD deficiency and a list of foods and medications to avoid. Do you have any questions before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Emergency room if things get worse, and I'll keep an eye on things. Thank you so much for your time and patience, Doctor Morenomartinez. I really appreciate it. I feel much better informed and less scared now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mande. I'm glad I could help. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are back. Have a good day.
