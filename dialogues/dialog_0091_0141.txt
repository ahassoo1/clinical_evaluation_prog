DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Brendan. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's this itching, really. It's just... everywhere, and it's been going on for a little while now. Not dangerous, I don’t think, but very annoying.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Brendan. “Itching” is a rather broad symptom, so let’s try to narrow things down. When you say “a little while,” could you give me a more precise timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, I’d say, about three weeks ago, maybe a little longer. Around the 10th of July, give or take a few days. I remember because the garden tomatoes were just starting to ripen. Does that help? It wasn't bad at first, just a little spot here and there. Now… well, now it’s pretty constant.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. And you mentioned it started as a “little spot here and there.” Where did it begin?
PATIENT: It started on my forearms, I think. The insides mostly. And then it spread to my chest, and then… well, pretty much everywhere. My back, my legs… even my scalp feels a bit itchy now. It's not raised, not bumpy, just… itchy. And red, I suppose, if you look closely. It doesn’t look terrible, thankfully. My late wife, bless her, she always worried about these things.
DOCTOR: I understand. And is the itching constant throughout the day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's pretty much constant, yes. It's not agonizing, you understand, but it’s always there, nagging at me. It’s worse in the evenings, I’ve noticed. And after I shower. Warm water seems to make it… perk up, I guess you’d say. It doesn’t keep me up at night, but it’s definitely distracting. I find myself… well, scratching, I suppose. Not constantly, but often.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Brendan. Have you noticed anything that seems to relieve the itching, even temporarily?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Um… cool compresses help a little. Just a damp cloth, really. And… this sounds silly, but watching television. Distraction, I suppose. It doesn’t make it go away, but I don’t notice it as much when I’m focused on something else. And a lotion, I’ve been using a plain, unscented lotion, but it doesn't do much more than… moisturize. It's a small comfort, maybe.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried any over-the-counter remedies, such as antihistamines or hydrocortisone cream?
PATIENT: Yes, I did. I tried some Benadryl, you know, the allergy stuff. Didn't seem to do a whole lot. Made me a bit sleepy, that's all. And I got some of that hydrocortisone cream, the one percent stuff. It helped for maybe an hour, then it just… stopped working. I've used it a few times, but it didn’t really make a difference in the long run. I figured it was worth a shot, but it didn’t help much. I didn't want to keep using it if it wasn't going to do anything.
DOCTOR: I see. Thank you for letting me know. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies, to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife always said I had a cast iron stomach. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, traveled a bit... never a problem. I've had the usual vaccinations, I suppose, but nothing major. No asthma, no hay fever, nothing like that. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. I have Medicare, if that helps with anything.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Brendan. And are you currently taking any medications, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a low-dose aspirin, Doctor. The doctor prescribed it a few years back, for my heart. Nothing else. No vitamins, no herbal teas, nothing. Just the aspirin, every day. And that's it. I try to keep things simple, really. My wife always said too many pills were bad for you, and I tend to agree. I get it refilled regularly, though. I'll have to tell you the dosage in a minute if you need it, but it’s a very common one. 81 milligrams, I believe.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And have you had any significant medical conditions in the past, such as heart disease, diabetes, or skin problems?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor said I have a bit of a heart condition, that's why I'm on the aspirin. It's managed, though. No diabetes, thankfully. And no major skin problems, aside from the usual sunburns when I was younger. I've had a few rashes over the years, nothing serious. Just the occasional thing that cleared up on its own. My wife used to put calamine lotion on me when I got poison ivy. But nothing chronic, nothing like eczema or psoriasis. Just a bit of everything, really. I'm generally healthy for my age, I think. Or I was, until this itching started.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a boy, maybe eight or nine years old. And a hernia operation a few years back, about five years ago, I think. That’s it, really. Nothing major. The appendix was when I was a kid, so I barely remember it. The hernia operation was a bit more involved, but I recovered well. No complications from either one, thankfully. It was all routine stuff, really. Nothing to worry about now.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, could you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly. My mother, bless her soul, she had high blood pressure. And my father, he had some problems with his cholesterol. My sister, she has arthritis, the kind that affects her hands. And my late wife… she had breast cancer, sadly. She fought it bravely, but it was a long battle. On my side, nothing too dramatic, really. Just the usual things, I suppose. High blood pressure, cholesterol… the arthritis. Nothing like heart disease or cancer, really, until my wife. I suppose that's why I'm careful about my check-ups. You never know, do you?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Brendan. That’s helpful. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Of course. Well, I’m widowed, as I mentioned. My wife passed away about three years ago. We didn't have any children. I live alone in a small house in the city. I used to work as a dispatcher, mostly for delivery trucks. Retired now, though. I keep myself busy with gardening, reading, and watching old movies. I don't smoke, never have. I drink a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but not much more than that. I don’t really go out much anymore. Mostly just stay home and take care of things. It’s a quiet life, but it suits me. I miss my wife terribly, of course, but I try to keep busy. It helps to pass the time.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Brendan. That gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you need. I'm happy to cooperate. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. There you go. Is that alright? I used to be a bit self-conscious about my breathing, but the doctor always said it was fine. Just a bit of a wheeze sometimes.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, a normal rate and rhythm. I do detect a very mild wheeze, as you mentioned, but it’s not concerning at this time. Now, let’s take a look at your skin. I see some diffuse redness, particularly on your forearms and chest. There are no obvious signs of rash, blisters, or other skin lesions. The scalp appears normal. There's no swelling or thickening of the skin. It appears dry overall. Now, I’ll check your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes are not enlarged. Alright, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears normal aside from the diffuse redness and dryness of your skin and the mild wheeze. Now, based on your history and the exam, I’m considering a few possibilities. It could be a mild allergic reaction, contact dermatitis, or simply dry skin exacerbated by the summer heat. To help narrow it down, I’d like to order a few blood tests, including a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood tests seem like a good idea. I trust your judgment. Whatever you think is best. I don’t mind getting poked if it helps figure out what’s going on. And yes, it has been awfully warm lately. Perhaps it is just the heat. But I'd rather be sure. Medicare should cover it, shouldn't it? I hope so, anyway. Just let me know what I need to do to get them done.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare should cover the tests, Brendan. I’ll write you a requisition form with the necessary information. You can go to any lab that accepts Medicare. The form will have the lab’s address and contact information. I’m also going to recommend you use a fragrance-free moisturizer several times a day, especially after showering. And avoid harsh soaps and detergents. I’ll also prescribe a topical corticosteroid cream to help reduce the inflammation and itching. It’s a mild potency cream, and you should apply it to the affected areas twice a day for one week. Here are the requisition form for the blood tests and the prescription for the cream. Please schedule the blood tests as soon as possible. We can review the results in about a week. If the itching worsens or you develop any other symptoms, such as fever, blisters, or difficulty breathing, please contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s very thorough. A week sounds good. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure out a plan. No, I don't think I have any questions at the moment. You've covered everything very clearly. The cream sounds good, I’ll start using it right away. And I'll schedule those blood tests tomorrow. Hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Brendan. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. We'll be in touch once the lab results are available. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
