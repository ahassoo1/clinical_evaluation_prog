DOCTOR: Hi Clearance, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor. Well, it's this pain in my side again, lower down on my back. And... honestly, I seem to be getting water infections quite a bit lately. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it's a bit bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, side pain and frequent water infections. Let's get some more details about both of those. Starting with the side pain – can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Right. It’s… a dull ache, mostly. Not a sharp, sudden thing. It comes and goes, but it's been happening more often these last few months. Sometimes it’s just a little niggle, other times it’s enough to make me a bit uncomfortable when I'm moving around. It feels like it’s on both sides, but usually the left side is worse. I don't really know how to explain it better than that, Doctor. It's just... there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache, comes and goes, more frequent the last few months, both sides but left worse. That's helpful. Does anything specifically make it worse – like bending, twisting, lifting, or even just sitting for a long time?
PATIENT: Hmm… lifting things definitely doesn't help. And, yes, you’re right about sitting for too long. If I'm in one position for a while, it tends to get a bit stiffer. It's not excruciating, but it's noticeable. I try to move around a bit to keep it from getting too bad, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Okay, so aggravated by lifting and prolonged sitting. Now, let’s talk about these water infections. How often would you say you’re getting them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s hard to say exactly… maybe three or four times in the last six months? It feels like more than it used to be, that's for sure. I usually just feel a burning sensation when I go to the toilet, and then I get a bit of a lower tummy ache. I usually go to the chemist and get something over the counter, and it clears it up, but then it comes back again a few weeks later. It’s a bit of a cycle.
DOCTOR: Okay, three or four times in the last six months, burning with urination, lower tummy pain, self-treating with over-the-counter medication. Have you ever been officially diagnosed with a urinary tract infection by a doctor, or is this just what you assume it is based on the symptoms?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I haven’t officially been diagnosed, not recently anyway. Years ago, a doctor told me I had one, and I remember the symptoms being similar. Since then, I’ve just been assuming it's that, and dealing with it myself at the chemist. I suppose I should have gotten it checked properly, shouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: You absolutely should. Self-treating can sometimes mask things or lead to complications. Alright, let's get a bit of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… about ten years ago, I found out I have something with my kidneys. The doctor said I have lots of little cysts on them. Polycystic kidney disease, I think it was called. It hasn’t caused me too many problems until recently, really. Just this pain and the water infections. I see a specialist every couple of years, but they haven’t changed my medication or anything. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Polycystic kidney disease, and you see a specialist regularly. That's important information. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't had any surgeries. Nothing at all. I'm not really one for hospitals if I can avoid it, to be honest. I prefer to keep things simple, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Alright, how about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had high blood pressure, and my father had something with his heart when he was older. Nothing too serious, as far as I know. I had a brother and a sister, but they’ve both passed away now. They didn't seem to have any major health problems, as far as I remember. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of high blood pressure and heart issues. Now, could you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Let me see… I take a tablet for my blood pressure, it's called… amlodipine, I think. Just one a day. And then I take a vitamin D supplement, the specialist recommended that. That’s about it, really. Oh, and sometimes paracetamol if I'm feeling a bit achy, but that's just as needed. Here, I've got a list here, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Excellent, thank you. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any allergies that I’m aware of. Never had any problems with anything, thankfully. I’m a pretty simple man, really. Not much bothers me!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I've never smoked. Never been interested, to be honest. My wife, bless her soul, she used to smoke, but she gave it up years ago. I always tried to discourage it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a little glass of wine with my dinner sometimes. Nothing excessive, mind you. Maybe three or four times a week, and it’s only a small glass. It helps me relax, you see. I'm not a big drinker, though, not at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. And finally, can you tell me a little about your job and how active you are during a typical day?
PATIENT: Well, I work as a receptionist at the local doctor's surgery, funnily enough! It's not very strenuous, mostly just answering phones and greeting patients. I'm on my feet a bit, but it's not a physically demanding job. I try to walk around a bit in the evenings, and I enjoy gardening when the weather is nice. I wouldn’t say I’m very active, but I’m not completely sedentary, either. I try to keep myself moving.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good overall picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your back. It shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Go ahead. I trust your judgment. Do you need me to do anything special?
DOCTOR: No, just relax. Take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that doesn’t hurt. Ooh, a little bit there, on my left side, just under my ribs. Not sharp pain, more of a dull ache, like I was describing earlier. It’s not too bad, but I can definitely feel something.
DOCTOR: Okay, mild tenderness to palpation on the left flank. And what about your back?
PATIENT: Yes, a bit of tenderness on my lower back, on both sides really, but again, more pronounced on the left. It's hard to explain... it's a deep ache, not a sharp pain. It feels like my muscles are a little tight. It's probably just old age, Doctor!
DOCTOR: It might be, but we need to rule things out. I'm also noticing some mild costovertebral angle tenderness on the left side. Alright, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to order a urine analysis and a complete blood count. The urine analysis will help us check for infection, and the blood count will give us some information about your kidney function and overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Absolutely, please go ahead and order those tests. I want to get to the bottom of this, and I trust your judgment completely. Where do I need to go to get them done? And is there anything I need to do to prepare?
DOCTOR: Excellent. You can get those tests done at the lab just across the street, here at the clinic. They're open until 5 PM today. You don't need to do anything special to prepare – just a standard urine sample, and they’ll draw a little blood. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. Once I have those results, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, if you develop a fever, chills, or severe pain in your back or side, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Fever, chills, severe pain… go to the emergency room. And I’ll go to the lab across the street this afternoon. Thank you for your help so far. I feel much better knowing we’re getting things checked out. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: No, that’s all for now. I’ll have the lab results sent to me, and my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they come back. Here's the form for the lab. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was nice meeting you, Clearance. I hope you feel better soon. .
PATIENT: It was very nice meeting you too, Doctor Condray. Thank you for taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I appreciate your kindness. I’ll go to the lab this afternoon as you suggested. Have a good day, Doctor! .
