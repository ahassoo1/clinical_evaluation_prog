DOCTOR: Hi Alayne, good morning! I’m Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. It’s lovely to meet you too. Dr. Ranjan, is it? Well… let me see. It's a bit hard to explain. My daughter, bless her heart, she got me in here because… well, I’ve been having these little spells. Not often, mind you. But my brother, he used to get terrible headaches… and sometimes his arm would feel… weak, she says. Something about that being important? It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, “spells” – can you tell me a little more about those?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… what do you mean? Well, it's not like magic, of course! It's just… sometimes I feel a bit funny. Like a wave washes over me, and for a little bit, everything feels… off. And once, just last month, my hand felt… clumsy. I dropped a teacup. Not a valuable one, thankfully! But it did scare me a bit. It didn’t last long, though. Just a few minutes, maybe. And then it was gone. It’s hard to remember exactly when they happen, you see. They just… do.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So, these "spells" involve a feeling of being "off," and once you had a brief episode of clumsiness in your hand. And they seem to come on without much warning. About how long ago was the episode with your hand?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… last month, I said? Yes, I believe so. It was… after Maria came to visit. She brought those lovely cookies, the almond ones. No, wait… it might have been before Maria visited. Everything’s a bit mixed up, you see. It wasn’t long ago, though. A few weeks, maybe? It definitely felt recent. I remember being a little shaky afterwards. Not terribly, just… unsettled.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks ago. And you felt shaky afterwards. Do you recall anything else about those times when you felt “off”?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Sometimes, along with that funny feeling, my head hurts a little. Not a bad headache, not like my brother used to get, but… a dull ache. And maybe a bit of dizziness. It's hard to say for sure. It all kind of blends together. It doesn’t happen every time, though. Sometimes it’s just that wave washing over me, and I feel a bit out of sorts. My daughter, she worries so much. She says it could be important because of my brother, you know? He had… something with his head. I just can’t seem to recall the name of it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so sometimes with the “wave” you get a dull headache and a bit of dizziness. Your daughter is concerned because of your brother’s medical history. Do you know what your brother was treated for?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a tricky one. He went to specialists, of course. Big city doctors. They used long words. Something about… blood vessels? And pressure? He had those terrible headaches for years, and then… then his arm and leg started to feel weak. He had to use a cane for a while. My daughter says it was something to do with… blocked arteries? Is that right? I just remember she was very worried, and he looked so tired. It was a long time ago, though. Very long. I’m sorry, I wish I could be more help. My memory just isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, you're doing great. It sounds like your brother may have had a stroke or transient ischemic attack – sometimes called a TIA – which can be related to blocked arteries. Just to be thorough, let's do a quick check of your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'd like to ask a few more questions about your medical history, if that's okay?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds sensible, dear. Checking things is always a good idea. Yes, go right ahead. Blood pressure, you say? That's fine. And questions… yes, I’ll do my best to answer them. I've always been pretty healthy, you know. Mostly just a bit forgetful these days. But ask away! I’m happy to help in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Blood pressure is 142/88. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6. Not too bad, but the blood pressure is a little elevated. Now, have you been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: Oh, my! Is that good or bad? 142, you say? Well, the doctor at home… Dr. Peterson… he mentioned something about it once. He said to watch my salt intake, and to try and get a little more exercise. Exercise! At my age! But yes, I think he said something about high blood pressure. It wasn’t anything serious, he assured me. Just something to keep an eye on. I’ve been trying to be good, honestly. Mostly. I do love a good biscuit with my tea, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've been told about elevated blood pressure before and advised to watch your salt intake. It's good that you’re aware of it. A little biscuit with tea is perfectly fine in moderation! Now, do you have any other medical conditions – like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… No, nothing that I know of. My knees ache sometimes, but Dr. Peterson said that’s just old age! I had a bit of trouble with arthritis in my hands a few years back, but that’s settled down. And I used to get migraines, but those haven’t bothered me in… oh, decades, I suppose. Nothing serious, though. Just a bit of a headache now and then. My daughter always worries so much. She thinks I’m falling apart! But honestly, I feel pretty good, all things considered. Just a little forgetful, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no major medical conditions besides some knee pain and a history of migraines that have resolved. We’ve talked about the blood pressure. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Now that you mention it… yes! When I was quite young, I had my tonsils out. A long time ago, of course. And… oh, dear. I had a hysterectomy, I think. Yes, that's right. A long, long time ago. Before your father and I even moved to this town! I don’t remember much about it, honestly. It was all so long ago. I think everything went well, though. Dr. Miller did a wonderful job. He was a very kind man. I don’t think I’ve had any surgeries since then. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Tonsils out when you were young and a hysterectomy many years ago. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Just my water pill! Dr. Peterson gave it to me for my swelling. And sometimes, when my knees bother me, I take ibuprofen. The blue ones, I think. And… Oh, and I take a little vitamin D in the winter. My daughter says I don’t get enough sunshine. That’s about it, I think. Just those few things. Nothing fancy. I try to avoid taking too many pills, you know. They make me feel a bit sluggish.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take a water pill for swelling, ibuprofen occasionally for knee pain, and vitamin D in the winter. Do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Let me think... No, not that I know of! I've never had any trouble with allergies, thankfully. I eat everything put in front of me! My mother always said I had an iron stomach. No, I don't think I'm allergic to anything. At least, nothing comes to mind. My daughter is always asking me about allergies, but I always tell her I'm fine. She worries so much! But no, no allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That's a bit of a tangled web, you know. My brother, bless his heart, he had those terrible headaches and weakness, like I mentioned. Dr. Peterson said it was something about the blood vessels in the head, maybe a stroke? My mother, she had high blood pressure, I believe. And her mother… she had something with her heart, but I don’t remember the details. It was a long time ago. And my father… he was a strong, healthy man. Lived to be 90! So, a bit of a mix, really. Not much on my husband’s side, that I recall. It’s all a bit blurry, you see. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of headaches and weakness in your brother, high blood pressure in your mother, and something with the heart in your maternal grandmother. And your father was healthy. Now, just a couple of questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life! Your father wouldn’t have allowed it! He was very strict about those things. And I always thought they smelled dreadful! No, never smoked, and I don’t particularly care for being around people who do. It’s just not a good habit, you see. Your father always said that. No, no smoking, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, a little glass of wine with dinner now and then, dear. That’s about it. Your father and I, we used to enjoy a nice glass of Chianti with our pasta on Sunday evenings. But I don't drink every day. Mostly just on special occasions, or when we have visitors. It's a nice little treat, you know? But nothing excessive. Not at all. Just a little sip to enjoy with the meal. I'm not much of a drinker, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little wine with dinner occasionally. Now, last question about your lifestyle. Can you tell me about your typical activity level?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… Well, let's just say I’m not running marathons! I used to be very active, you know. Gardening, dancing, walking… But now… I mostly take it easy. I enjoy sitting in my sunroom, reading. And I like to watch my favorite shows on television. I do a little light housework, but nothing too strenuous. I try to get out for a little walk now and then, but my knees bother me sometimes. So, mostly I take it easy. Your daughter says I need to be more active, but it’s hard! It’s hard to keep up these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly relaxing at home, reading, watching television, and some light housework with occasional walks. That gives me a good picture. Thank you for answering all those questions, Alayne. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a quick neurological exam. It’ll just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds sensible, dear. Go right ahead. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, will you? My knees aren't always cooperating, you see. And please, don't hesitate to tell me if I’m saying anything silly. My mind wanders sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm listening to your heart now. It sounds a little fast, but regular. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Both knees have a good response. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. Is that good? It doesn’t feel as strong as it used to be, you know. My hands aren't what they once were. I used to be able to knit for hours, but now… it tires me out quickly.
DOCTOR: That’s okay. It’s a little diminished, but still within normal limits. Now, I’m going to check your balance. Can you stand up slowly for me when I count to three?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. One… two… three… Oh, goodness. It's a bit tricky, you know. My knees aren’t always cooperating.
DOCTOR: That's alright, don't worry. Just a little unsteady. It’s good you told me. Now, just one more thing. I’m going to shine a light in your eyes to check your pupils. Pupils are equal and reactive to light. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems within normal limits, although your blood pressure is a little elevated and your strength is slightly diminished. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you’re experiencing some mild weakness and dizziness, possibly related to your blood pressure. However, given your family history of headaches and weakness, and the episodic nature of your symptoms, I want to rule out anything more serious. I think it would be wise to get an EKG and some blood work to check your electrolytes and rule out any other underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… complicated. An EKG and blood work? Is that serious? My brother, was it something like that? I don't want to cause any fuss, you know. I just want to feel better. But if you think it's best… then alright. Yes, I suppose I can do that. But please, don't hesitate to tell me if anything is seriously wrong. I just want to know what's going on. Your daughter will be relieved to hear you're being thorough, I'm sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. It’s not necessarily serious, Alayne. It’s just a precaution. An EKG is a simple test that checks the electrical activity of your heart. The blood work will help us rule out any other potential causes of your symptoms. It’s just standard procedure given your history. I’ll have the nurse draw some blood and get an order in for the EKG. It can be done right here in the clinic. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend you continue to monitor your blood pressure at home, if possible. And try to stay hydrated. I’ll also write you a prescription for a low-dose blood pressure medication, just to get things under control. It’s a very mild medication, and we can adjust the dosage as needed. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. That sounds sensible. A little medication, you say? Not too strong, I hope? I don’t want to feel sluggish, you know. I still want to enjoy my tea and my reading. And I suppose monitoring my blood pressure isn’t too much to ask. Your daughter has one, I think. Yes, she’s always on about my health. She means well, of course. And I trust your judgment, dear. If you think it’s best, then I’ll do it. Just please, keep me informed. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. It’s a very low dose, and we’ll start slowly. We’ll monitor your blood pressure closely, and adjust the dosage as needed. And I promise to keep you informed every step of the way. No surprises, I assure you. The nurse will be in shortly to draw some blood and explain the EKG process. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… Now that you mention it… I was wondering… my brother… what exactly was wrong with him? Your daughter says it was something with his brain, but I just can’t recall. It was so long ago. If you don’t mind me asking, of course. I just want to understand what I’m dealing with, you know? Is it something I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and it’s important to understand your family history. From what I can gather from the records and based on your description, it sounds like your brother likely suffered a series of transient ischemic attacks, or TIAs, sometimes called "mini-strokes." These are caused by temporary blockages in the blood vessels that supply the brain. It can cause symptoms like weakness, dizziness, and headaches, which sounds consistent with what you've described. TIAs are a warning sign for a full stroke, which is why it’s important to take them seriously. That's why we're being thorough with your workup. It doesn’t necessarily mean you will have a stroke, but it’s important to rule out any underlying risk factors and get things under control. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Oh… TIAs… mini-strokes… That sounds… frightening. So, that’s what was wrong with him… I always felt so bad for him… He suffered so much… Is that what could happen to me? Is that why you’re doing all these tests? It’s just… it’s a lot to take in, you know? My mind isn’t what it used to be. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: It is a lot to take in, and it’s understandable to feel anxious. It doesn’t necessarily mean you will have a stroke, Alayne. But because of your family history, we want to be proactive and identify any risk factors that could increase your chances. Things like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and smoking can all increase your risk. The good news is that TIAs and strokes are often preventable with the right treatment and lifestyle changes. By controlling your blood pressure, maintaining a healthy diet, and staying active, you can significantly reduce your risk. We’re going to do these tests to get a better understanding of your overall health and identify any potential issues. And then we’ll develop a plan to help you stay healthy and prevent any future problems. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… reassuring. Preventing problems… that’s a good idea. I suppose I can try to be more careful… and eat healthier… and stay more active… It’s just… it’s hard at my age, you know? My knees aren’t what they used to be… and I love my tea and biscuits… But if it will help me stay healthy… then I’ll do my best. You’ll keep me informed, won’t you? Every step of the way? I just want to feel better… and not worry so much.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Alayne. I will keep you informed every step of the way. And we’ll work together to develop a plan that’s realistic and sustainable for you. We’re not going to ask you to make drastic changes overnight. We’ll start slowly and make adjustments as needed. And if you’re having trouble with anything, just let me know. The nurse should be here any minute now to draw your blood and explain the EKG process. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you?
PATIENT: Oh, no, I think that’s everything for now. You’ve been very patient with me, dear. And you’ve explained everything so clearly. I appreciate it. It’s just… it’s a lot to take in, you know? But I feel better knowing that you’re here to help. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alayne. It’s my job to help. And remember, you're not alone in this. We’ll get through it together. Let me know if anything comes to mind before she arrives.
PATIENT: Oh, alright dear. No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again. I suppose I should try to relax, shouldn't I? Easier said than done.
DOCTOR: Just a few more minutes, Alayne. You’re doing great. Try to take deep breaths. The nurse will explain everything clearly.
PATIENT: Oh… alright dear. Thank you. You’ve been very kind. I just hope everything turns out alright. I just want to feel better… and enjoy my tea and biscuits…
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alayne. And you will feel better. We're going to take good care of you. Focus on taking deep breaths, just like you’re doing. And remember, it's okay to feel anxious. It's perfectly normal. Here comes the nurse now. She’ll explain everything.
PATIENT: Oh… alright dear. Thank you. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Hi Alayne, my name is Maria. Dr. Ranjan mentioned you’d be getting some blood work and an EKG today. I’m going to start by explaining the blood work. We’ll just need to draw a few vials of blood to check your cholesterol, electrolytes, and overall health. It will only take a few minutes, and it might sting a little. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Oh… alright dear. Blood work… yes, I suppose that’s alright. It always stings a little, doesn't it? Just get it over with quickly, if you don’t mind. I hope you're good with needles. Just a few minutes… just a few minutes…
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I’m very good with needles! And I’ll be as quick as possible. Just relax your arm, and take a few deep breaths. This will only take a moment. All done! See?
PATIENT: Oh… alright dear. That wasn't so bad. Just a little sting… nothing more. Thank you. You were very quick. Just glad it's over. Now, what about that EKG?
DOCTOR: You were a perfect patient! And yes, next up is the EKG. It’s very simple. We’ll just attach some small stickers, called electrodes, to your chest, arms, and legs. They measure the electrical activity of your heart. It won’t hurt at all, and it only takes a few minutes. Would you like me to explain the process in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh… alright dear. Electrodes… stickers… measuring my heart… sounds… complicated. If you don’t mind, yes, please. Explain it to me in more detail. I just want to know what’s going to happen. The less surprises, the better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. No surprises at all! So, these small stickers are called electrodes, and they’re completely painless. We'll attach them to specific spots on your chest, arms, and legs. They detect the electrical signals your heart produces when it beats. The machine will then record those signals on a piece of paper. It’s a quick and painless way to see how your heart is functioning. It doesn’t involve any electricity being passed through your body, it just detects the electrical signals your heart is already producing. We’ll just need you to lie comfortably on your back while we attach the electrodes. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh… alright dear. Stickers… detecting signals… not passing electricity… that sounds… less frightening. So, I just lie here… while you attach the stickers? And it won’t hurt? And it doesn’t involve any needles? That’s good. Alright. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: That’s right, just lie back and relax. No needles at all! I’ll just attach these small stickers to your chest, arms, and legs. They’re just like bandages, they won’t hurt. It might feel a little cool when I apply them, but that’s all. And yes, it might feel a little cool. Okay, all done! Now just try to lie still and breathe normally. The machine will do the rest. It will only take a few minutes. Just relax… everything is going well.
PATIENT: Oh… alright dear. It’s a little cool, yes… but not painful. Just breathing normally… that’s all. It’s a little strange… feeling the machine… but I’m trying to relax. Alright. Just a few more minutes… just a few more minutes…
DOCTOR: Perfect, the tracing looks great! Everything is going well. Just a few more seconds… Okay, all done! That wasn't so bad, was it?
PATIENT: Oh… alright dear. No… not so bad. Just a little strange… but not painful. Thank you. You were very kind. Now what? Do you know what the results are?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome! I'm glad it wasn’t too uncomfortable. As for the results, I'm not authorized to interpret them. The doctor will review the EKG tracing and blood work and let you know the findings. It may take a few minutes for her to get back to you. Would you like me to stay with you until she returns?
PATIENT: Oh… alright dear. That sounds… sensible. That sounds… good. If you wouldn’t mind, yes. That would be… reassuring. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Of course, I'm happy to stay with you. Just relax and take a few deep breaths. Everything is going to be alright. Here comes the doctor now.
PATIENT: Oh… alright dear. Here she comes. Please let everything be alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, Alayne, I’ve had a chance to review your EKG and blood work. Overall, the results are very good. Your heart looks healthy, and your blood work is within normal limits. However, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, as we discussed earlier. And your cholesterol is a little high. We’ll need to address those issues to prevent any future problems. But nothing to be overly concerned about at this point. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh… alright dear. That’s… good news. My blood pressure is high, though? And my cholesterol? What does that mean? What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: That just means we need to make a few lifestyle changes and start you on a low-dose medication to help control your blood pressure. It's very common, especially as we get older. High blood pressure puts extra strain on your heart and blood vessels, increasing your risk of heart attack, stroke, and kidney problems. High cholesterol can lead to a buildup of plaque in your arteries, narrowing them and making it harder for blood to flow. But we can manage both of those things with medication and lifestyle changes. I’m going to prescribe you a low-dose blood pressure medication called Lisinopril. We’ll start with a low dose and adjust it as needed. I also recommend making some changes to your diet. Try to eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit your intake of salt, sugar, and saturated fats. And I encourage you to get regular exercise, even if it’s just a short walk each day. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Oh… alright dear. Medication… diet… exercise… A little overwhelming, yes. Lisinopril… is that strong? I do love my tea and biscuits, you know.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed. We'll take things one step at a time. Lisinopril is a very low-dose medication and usually has minimal side effects. Some people experience a mild cough or dizziness, but those are usually temporary. And I'm not asking you to give up your tea and biscuits completely! Just try to limit your intake a little. And focus on making small, sustainable changes to your diet. I also recommend working with a registered dietitian to develop a meal plan that's tailored to your needs. They can help you make healthy choices without sacrificing all your favorite foods. I'm going to give you a referral to a registered dietitian and a prescription for Lisinopril. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to check your blood pressure and see how you’re doing. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Oh… alright dear. A registered dietitian… and medication… yes, that sounds… manageable. One step at a time, you say? Thank you. That’s very kind of you.
DOCTOR: Exactly, one step at a time. And remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns, don’t hesitate to call the office. Alright, I think that’s everything for today. Do you have any other questions for me before I leave?
