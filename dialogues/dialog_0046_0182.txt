DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. My name is Dr. Glowka, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hmph. Yes, well. I suppose you know why I’m here. Pre-op clearance for…the face. Honestly, wasting my time with all this paperwork and talking…but the surgeon insisted. Let’s get it over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. I understand your time is valuable, and we’ll certainly try to be efficient. Just to confirm, you’re here for pre-operative clearance for a facial surgery, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Though “surgery” feels a bit dramatic, doesn’t it? It's just...a tightening. A little lift. You wouldn't understand. My wife…she always said I had a good face, but…well. Things change. Now, are you going to ask me a million questions or actually do something?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. I assure you, the questions are important to ensure your safety during and after the procedure. It helps us to identify any potential risks and prepare accordingly. I will certainly perform a physical exam as well. Let’s start with a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Goodness, no. I’ve always been healthy as a horse. Worked with terrazzo my entire life - hard work keeps a man fit. Heart problems... no. Though, my wife…she worried too much. Always a fuss about something. Never let her get to me, though. I haven’t been to a doctor in…well, decades, probably. I don't believe in coddling. Do I have to list every little ache and pain? It’s just getting old.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. It's good to hear you've been generally healthy. Even if you haven’t seen a doctor in some time, it's helpful to know what’s been going on. Let’s just quickly cover any past surgeries you may have had, even if they were a long time ago. And then, if you recall, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Surgeries…let me think. Had my appendix out when I was a boy. That’s it. Nothing since. As for allergies... no. I can take anything. My wife used to give me all sorts of tonics and remedies – garlic, onion, everything. Said it was good for the constitution. I never felt a thing. Honestly, the doctors these days…fussing over everything. What happened to toughing it out?
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know, Mr. Orwin. No reported surgeries besides appendectomy as a child, and no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Hmph. No. Why would I be? I told you, I don't believe in coddling. Maybe an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s it. Vitamins…my wife used to insist on those, too. Said I wasn’t getting enough sunshine. Probably right, if I’m honest. She always worried about my skin. But I haven't taken one in years. Waste of money, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, vitamins or supplements currently, and only occasional aspirin. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Honestly, that’s a depressing topic. My father died young, heart trouble, I think. Mother lived a long time, but she was always a frail woman. Lots of aches and pains. My brother…he wasn't very strong. Not like me. Mostly, it’s just…old age, if you know what I mean. A lot of weakness and failing health. Not much to report, really. Why does it matter, anyway? I'm still here, aren't I? Strong as an ox, for my age.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Orwin. While you feeling well is the most important thing, family history can sometimes help us understand potential risks. We’re looking for patterns of certain conditions that might be relevant. Alright. Let’s move on to your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! My wife would have had a fit. Always said it was dreadful for the complexion. I drink…a small glass of sherry with dinner, perhaps. Nothing excessive. Keeps the chill off, you know. I've always been a temperate man. Work keeps you too busy for vices, anyway. Terrazzo work is…demanding.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Orwin. Just a small glass of sherry with dinner. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you experiencing any current symptoms—anything at all that’s bothering you, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. I told you, I feel fine. Maybe a little…stiffness in the mornings. That's to be expected, at my age. It's not pain, mind you. Just…old age settling in. Honestly, you doctors are always looking for something to be wrong. I came here for clearance, not a diagnosis. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin. You are right; we just need to ensure you are a good candidate for the procedure. The stiffness you mention is worth noting, and it's good that you are able to differentiate it from pain. Alright. Let’s proceed with a quick physical exam, then. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your overall condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Honestly, all this fuss…My wife…she would have loved all the attention, though. But me? I just want to be done with it. Do what you have to do. Quickly, if you please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply for me, if you would. Heart sounds are a bit irregular, but within an acceptable range for your age. Lungs are clear. Now, I'll just take a quick look at your throat and check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little slow, which is common as we get older. Overall, you appear to be in reasonably good health for your age. I do want to document the slightly irregular heart rhythm, and I may recommend an EKG just to be on the safe side before your procedure. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: An EKG? Honestly…more tests. My wife would have insisted on that, too. Fine. Whatever you think is necessary. I suppose it can’t hurt. As long as it doesn’t take all day. I have things to do, you know. Just get it done, and let me get on with my life. What else do you need to poke and prod?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. We will get the EKG ordered right away, and it should only take about 15-20 minutes. It's a simple, painless test. While we're waiting, I'll quickly check your vital signs again—pulse, temperature, and oxygen saturation. It’s standard protocol. Everything looks good, Mr. Orwin. Just waiting for the results of the EKG. Okay, the EKG shows a slight irregularity in the rhythm, which we detected during the physical exam, but no significant abnormalities. It's likely a benign arrhythmia common in individuals your age. However, given your history of family heart trouble, I would recommend a consultation with a cardiologist just for a more thorough evaluation and peace of mind before the surgery. Would you be amenable to that?
PATIENT: A cardiologist?! Now you’re just trying to drum up business for your friends, aren’t you? I feel perfectly fine! And what did I tell you about my family’s heart trouble? My father had it, decades ago. I'm as strong as an ox, for my age. No. Absolutely not. I’m not wasting any more time and money on unnecessary tests. I came here for clearance, and I expect to get it. Look, I’m perfectly capable of making my own decisions. I’ve lived a long life, and I know my own body. Give me the clearance, and let me get on with it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration, and I respect your autonomy. However, as your physician, I have a responsibility to ensure your safety and well-being. While you feel well, the EKG findings do warrant further investigation, especially before undergoing a surgical procedure. I'm not trying to drum up business for anyone. I am simply following established medical guidelines and exercising due diligence. To be clear, I am not refusing to provide clearance. However, I am unable to provide unconditional clearance without addressing the EKG findings. I can document your refusal of the cardiology consultation, but I strongly advise you to reconsider. Alternatively, perhaps we can discuss a less invasive evaluation, such as a Holter monitor, which you can wear at home for a few days?
PATIENT: A Holter monitor… at home? Now that…that doesn't sound so bad. Less poking and prodding, at least. Fine. I’ll wear your Holter monitor. But that’s it. No more tests. No more doctors. Just the monitor, and then you give me the clearance, understand? And hurry up, if you please. I have a life to get back to.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Orwin. I’m glad we could reach a compromise. We will order a Holter monitor for you today. You will need to wear it for 48 hours, and then return it to the clinic for analysis. The results typically take a few days to interpret. Once we have those results, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine whether you are cleared for the procedure. I'll write you a prescription for the monitor and explain how to wear it properly. In the meantime, please continue with your usual activities, but avoid strenuous exercise. Do you have any questions about the Holter monitor or the follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: No. Just…get it over with. And make sure that monitor isn't too uncomfortable. I have no patience for flimsy contraptions. And one more thing…can you please write the clearance note, assuming the monitor shows nothing? Just so I don't have to come back for another round of fussing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your desire for a swift resolution. However, I cannot provide a pre-operative clearance note with a conditional statement. To do so would be unethical and potentially compromise your safety. My medical judgment needs to be based on the actual results of the Holter monitor, and I’m happy to discuss those results and make a determination at that time. I can, however, provide you with a note stating that you are currently undergoing a cardiac evaluation with a Holter monitor and are awaiting the results before proceeding with the facial surgery. This will explain to the surgeon why there is a slight delay in obtaining the clearance. I will provide you with detailed instructions for the monitor, and ensure you know how to contact us if you have any difficulties. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…the note explaining I’m wearing the monitor. That will have to do. Honestly, all this…fuss. You doctors… Just get the monitor, the note, and let me get on with my life. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. I’m happy to accommodate your request. Here is the prescription for the Holter monitor and the note for your surgeon explaining your current cardiac evaluation. Please call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you for your patience, and I wish you all the best. .
