DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have all day. Just… tired. Real tired. And… I eat dirt. Not like on purpose, but… I crave it, you know? It’s… stupid. Don’t judge me.
DOCTOR: Tired… and you've been consuming dirt. Okay. Not judging at all, Ms. Cantoran. We're just trying to figure out what’s going on. When did this tiredness start?
PATIENT: Honestly? A long time ago. Months, maybe even longer. It just… got worse. I used to be able to push through. Now? Everything feels like walking through mud. I don’t remember exactly when it started being this bad though, okay? Don’t need a history lesson. Just… fix it.
DOCTOR: Months... Okay. And this craving for dirt, how long has that been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh. It comes and goes. Maybe a couple months too? It’s not like I’m eating it every day, but… when it starts, I just… have to. It’s hard to explain. Like a feeling I need it, okay? It’s embarrassing. I haven’t told anyone.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. And when you say you have to… how much dirt are we talking about?
PATIENT: Not a lot. A handful, maybe? From the garden. Don't look at me like that! It's… reddish clay. Helps with… something. I don’t know what it helps with. Just… feels better, okay? A little bit. Don’t make a big deal out of it. It's not like I'm eating rocks!
DOCTOR: A handful of reddish clay… Okay. And besides the tiredness and the… dirt craving, anything else going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, well… my stomach's been bothering me. Sort of. Not like pain, exactly. Just… off. And I get headaches, but everyone gets headaches, right? Honestly, I don't know. Things just… feel wrong, okay? Like my body is… old. Which it is, I guess. But still.
DOCTOR: Okay, stomach issues and headaches. Anything specific with the stomach?
PATIENT: Like… everything feels slow. You know? Like food just… sits there. And sometimes I feel… bloated. And I burp. A lot. It’s… unpleasant. But who cares about burping, okay? It’s not a medical emergency.
DOCTOR: Slow digestion, bloating, burping… Alright. Do you have any trouble… passing gas or having bowel movements?
PATIENT: Ugh. Look, do I have to talk about this? Seriously? Fine. It’s… hard sometimes. Constipated, I think that’s the word. A lot of straining. It’s… private, okay? Don't write it down.
DOCTOR: Okay, constipation. We’re just gathering information, Ms. Cantoran. Now, any recent changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t really eat much anymore. Food just… doesn't taste good. And I think I’ve lost some weight, but… I don’t weigh myself, okay? It’s depressing. Everything is depressing. Don't make me talk about my weight.
DOCTOR: Alright. No appetite, possible weight loss. Now, let's go back a bit. Any medical conditions you've been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Ugh, a long time ago… the doctor said something about my blood… not enough iron, maybe? I don’t remember. I took some pills for a while, but… I stopped. Felt better, I guess. And… my husband had diabetes, but that’s not me, okay? Don’t need a lecture on family history.
DOCTOR: Low iron in the past… Okay. And any surgeries or hospital stays?
PATIENT: Ugh… when I was younger, I had my appendix out. A long time ago. And… when my husband died, I was in the hospital for a bit. But that was… grief, okay? Not a medical thing. I don't remember anything else. Honestly, I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Okay. Appendix removed, hospital stay after your husband's passing. I understand you want to go home. We're almost done with the questions, Ms. Cantoran. Any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: No. Haven’t taken anything regularly in… a long time. Just some painkillers for the headaches sometimes. Over the counter stuff. I don’t like pills, okay? They make me feel weird. And I don't want to be addicted. I barely remember what I took last time. It's just... aspirin or something. Don't bother.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications. One last thing – any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Ugh… no. Not that I know of. I mean, I get bitten by mosquitoes like everyone else, but that’s not an allergy, okay? Don’t waste your time. I’m done. Can I go now? This is exhausting.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. Alright, Ms. Cantoran, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what's going on. Then we’ll discuss some possibilities. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. But make it quick, okay? I have things to do. And don't poke me too much. Seriously. Just... get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just hop up on the table for me, please. We'll start with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A little elevated. Heart sounds are normal, but a little fast. Lungs are clear. Your abdomen is a little tender to the touch, particularly in the lower quadrants. No masses felt. And just quickly checking your skin... it looks a bit pale. Alright. It sounds like there's a few things going on.
PATIENT: Ugh. See? I told you something was wrong. Pale? Tender? I know something is wrong, okay? So, what is it? Just tell me. I haven’t got all day. And don't give me some long, complicated explanation. Just... what's the matter with me?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. Given your symptoms - the fatigue, the dirt craving – which is called pica, the stomach issues, constipation, paleness, and your slightly elevated blood pressure – it’s likely you have iron deficiency anemia. The pica can be a sign of that, as your body is trying to get iron from unusual sources. It’s important to get this confirmed with blood tests. We’ll need to check your iron levels, complete blood count, and a few other things. We'll also need to rule out any other possible causes for your symptoms. I’m going to order some blood work right away. In the meantime, I recommend trying to incorporate more iron-rich foods into your diet – things like red meat, leafy greens, and fortified cereals. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Ugh… iron? So, I’m just… weak? That's it? And blood tests? Great. Just what I needed. But… leafy greens? I hate leafy greens. And red meat gives me heartburn, okay? This is useless. What about the dirt? Does that mean I have to… stop eating dirt? Seriously? Is that going to make me feel even worse? Tell me. And… how long is this going to take? This is ridiculous. Just… tell me what happens next.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. It's not just being "weak". Iron is vital for carrying oxygen throughout your body, so a deficiency can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, headaches... and yes, the pica. It's a symptom, not the problem itself. Regarding the dirt... ideally, yes, we want to stop that. It's not a good source of iron, and it can introduce harmful bacteria or parasites. It could be making you feel worse, and it's masking the underlying issue. We'll get the blood tests done as quickly as possible. The lab should have results back in a few days. Once we have those results, we can discuss treatment options. Depending on the severity of the anemia, that could involve iron supplements, dietary changes, or further investigation to find out why you're iron deficient in the first place. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? More tests? This is exhausting. Fine. No, no other medical conditions. I told you. Just tired and… I crave dirt. Look, can I get a referral to someone who can just… fix this quickly? I don't have time for a long investigation. I have things to do, okay? And... can I get something for the headaches while I'm waiting for the results? Something stronger than over-the-counter stuff? Just… something to make me feel better. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. I understand your frustration. I can certainly write you a prescription for a stronger headache medication. However, it's important to use it as directed, and only until we have a better understanding of what’s causing your headaches. Regarding a referral… I don't think a specialist is necessary right now. We can manage this in the office. If the blood tests reveal something more complex, then we can consider a referral to a hematologist. But let's start with the basics. I’m going to order the blood work, write the prescription, and give you some information about iron-rich foods and the importance of stopping the dirt craving. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to discuss the results. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Ugh… fine. A week? That's… acceptable, I guess. But if I don't feel any better in a week, I'm coming back. And if that dirt craving gets worse, I'm blaming you, okay? Just… get it done. I have things to do, and I don’t want to waste any more time on this. And... no lectures, okay? Just fix me. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cantoran. Blood work order is placed. Prescription sent to your pharmacy. Here’s a handout with information on iron-rich foods and the importance of discontinuing pica. And here’s a follow-up appointment card for one week from today. If anything changes – if your symptoms worsen, or you develop new symptoms – please don’t hesitate to call the office. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Ugh, no. That’s it. Finally. Just… don't bother me unless it's about the results. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Cantoran. Have a good day.
