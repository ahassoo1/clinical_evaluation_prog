DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think. That’s what the lady on the phone said, anyway. Medicare wants it done, you know? Honestly, I don't really remember what they want tested. It's all a bit of a blur these days. Can we just… get it over with?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, Medicare. Always something with Medicare. Well, I have your chart here… it appears to be a standard annual physical with some additional blood work ordered. Though, frankly, the notes are… lacking in detail. It would have been helpful if the referring party had been more specific. Now, before we proceed with the blood work, I need to ask a few questions, just to be thorough. It’s protocol, you understand. Have you been feeling unwell recently?
PATIENT: Unwell? Hmm… not that I recall. I mean, I get a little tired, but who doesn’t at my age? Everything aches a bit, the usual. I haven’t been to the hospital or anything, if that’s what you mean. I mostly just… keep to myself. Is this going to take long? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: "Things to do," of course. Very well. Let’s try to be concise. You say you feel tired and experience aches. Can you describe these aches?
PATIENT: Well, it's… everywhere, really. Back, knees, sometimes my shoulders. Not sharp pains, just… dull. Like being old, I suppose. Honestly, it comes and goes. I don't pay it much mind. It's been like this for… years. Decades, probably. Is there a form I can fill out? I'm better at writing things down. My memory… you know.
DOCTOR: A form is not going to suffice, Mr. Croonquist. We require a proper history. Now, have you noticed any changes in these aches recently?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. That’s a good question. I… I suppose they might be a little worse lately. But it's been so hot, you know? Everything feels worse in the heat. Maybe it’s just that. No, I don’t think so… or maybe I do. It’s all a bit fuzzy, Doctor. Look, can we just do the blood work? I really don't want to sit here all day.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed with the blood work as you request. However, do not be surprised if I order further testing based on the results. It would be irresponsible of me not to. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, or any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. I haven’t taken a pill in… well, a long time. I used to get a rash from something as a kid, but I can't remember what it was. As for medical conditions… the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high once, a long time ago. But that was years ago. I don’t take anything for it. Really, I’m mostly just… old. Is that a condition? Can we get this over with now? I’m starting to feel lightheaded.
DOCTOR: Lightheaded, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. Just… a bit dizzy. Probably just the heat. And sitting here talking about aches and pains. I’m not one for doctors, you see. Always poking and prodding. I just want to know when and where to give the blood. Please.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Croonquist. Before the blood work, I must perform a brief physical examination. It is standard procedure, and frankly, concerning to hear you mention lightheadedness without a proper assessment. I need to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. It will be quick. Do you consent to a basic examination?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But quick, you promised. And gentle, please. My ribs are… sensitive. Just get it over with. I really don't like this. Is there a nurse who can do it? Someone… younger? Maybe they'll be quicker.
DOCTOR: I assure you, my expertise is quite sufficient. Now, please lie back on the examination table. Let's begin with your blood pressure. 158 over 92. Not ideal. And your pulse is… rather rapid. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Breath sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally. No murmurs noted. Now, I’m going to need to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Oh, dear. I always fail those tests. My brother used to laugh at me. He was a… a strong man. I’m mostly just bones these days. Just… be quick, please. This is really making me anxious. I think I need a glass of water. Can I get some water? Before the reflexes? Please?
DOCTOR: There is water over there. Please, help yourself. Then, we will proceed with a quick assessment of your reflexes. Now, extend your arm. Minimal response. And now the other side. Also minimal. Decreased reflexes bilaterally. Mr. Croonquist, given your elevated blood pressure, rapid pulse, diminished breath sounds, and decreased reflexes, I am concerned. We need to investigate this further. I am ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an EKG, and a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: Ugh. More tests? That’s just what I was afraid of. Look, is this going to cost me a fortune? My Medicare… it doesn’t cover everything, you know. I just wanted some simple lab work. That's all. I don’t understand why this has to be so complicated. And an X-ray? Is it going to hurt? I don’t like being poked and prodded. And all this talk about my heart… I just want to go home. Can’t we just… skip the X-ray?
DOCTOR: Mr. Croonquist, with all due respect, your blood pressure is significantly elevated, your pulse is rapid, and your breathing is shallow. I cannot simply "skip" essential diagnostic tests. To proceed responsibly, we must rule out any underlying medical conditions. As for the cost, I will submit all claims to Medicare, and your supplemental insurance may cover any remaining balance. I am scheduling you for an EKG and chest X-ray immediately at the imaging center across the street. A technician will be in touch. And yes, the X-ray involves minimal radiation exposure. It is a necessary precaution. Please, do not delay. The sooner we have these results, the sooner we can determine the best course of action. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to attend to. A nurse will come and draw your blood.
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, whatever you say. I don't like this one bit. Just… tell the nurse to be gentle. And can someone… can someone call me a taxi? I don't think I can drive. This is a terrible day. .
