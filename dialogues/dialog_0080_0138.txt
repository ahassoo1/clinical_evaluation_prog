DOCTOR: Hi Alayne, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It is lovely to meet you too. Dr. Rosanova, you said? My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. Well, my daughter… she’s the one who really made the appointment. Something about… weakness? And my family… there’s been headaches, bad ones, for a long time. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all, Alayne. It’s perfectly normal for things to be a little fuzzy sometimes, especially with family history. We’ll take our time and sort everything out. So, let's focus on you for now. You mentioned weakness – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Weakness… hmm. It comes and goes, mostly on one side, I think. My right side? Or was it the left… It’s not constant, thank goodness. More like… a heaviness. And it feels different each time. Sometimes it’s just hard to lift things, other times… well, other times it’s harder to even think straight when it happens. It doesn’t last long, usually. But it worries my daughter, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, the weakness comes and goes, mostly on one side – you’re not certain which, which is alright, we can explore that. And it’s associated with a feeling of heaviness, and sometimes difficulty with thinking. When you say “difficulty with thinking,” can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh dear, it’s hard to explain. Not like… a complete blank, you understand. More like… words getting stuck. Or… forgetting what I was about to say. It’s frustrating, mostly. Like something’s… slowing everything down. It happens when the weakness is bad, I think. Not always, though. Sometimes it’s just the heaviness. And sometimes… well, sometimes I just feel tired. A very tired. It’s all mixed up, you see. I apologize.
DOCTOR: No, please don’t apologize at all, Alayne. You’re explaining things perfectly well. It sounds mixed up because we’re trying to piece things together. So, let's recap – weakness fluctuating on one side, heaviness, difficulty finding words or thinking clearly when the weakness is present, and periods of significant fatigue. Now, has this been a sudden change, or has it been developing gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It hasn't been… overnight, no. It's been… creeping up on me, maybe for a few months? It's hard to say exactly. I tend to brush things off, you know? “Just a little tired,” or “Just having a bad day.” My daughter is the one who notices these things, she’s very observant. She said it’s been more frequent lately, that's why she insisted on coming to see you.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gradual onset over a few months, with increasing frequency recently, as noted by your daughter. That’s very good information. Now, let's talk about other things. Have you noticed any headaches, as you mentioned earlier?
PATIENT: Oh yes, the headaches. They’ve been around… forever, it seems. My mother had them, and her mother before her. Terrible, throbbing pain, mostly on the side of my head. Sometimes with… dizziness? And nausea. Not every time, but often. They used to be much worse, when I was younger. Now they come and go, but they still bother me. I usually just take something for them and try to rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of headaches, similar to your mother and grandmother, throbbing pain, sometimes with dizziness and nausea. You manage them with over-the-counter medication and rest. Have you experienced any changes in your vision lately – blurry vision, double vision, or any loss of vision?
PATIENT: Vision… hmm. Now that you mention it… I have been bumping into things a bit more. And sometimes… things seem a little… fuzzy? Not constantly, and it goes away quickly, but it’s been happening more often lately. I thought it was just my age, honestly. I’m not as steady on my feet as I used to be. But maybe… maybe it’s something more? I don't know. It's hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some recent changes in vision – bumping into things, and occasional blurry vision. It's good you're noticing these changes. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other health conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… My doctor, Dr. Bellini, he always checked my blood pressure. It was a little high sometimes, but he said it was nothing to worry about, just watch my salt intake. I think he put me on a little pill for it, years ago. And… I had my gallbladder out, many years ago. But other than that… not much, I don't think. I've always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I eat a good diet, mostly Italian food, you know? Lots of vegetables and olive oil.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood pressure, managed with medication, and a gallbladder removal many years ago. And you generally consider yourself to be in good health. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Just the one for my blood pressure, I believe. Sometimes I take something for headaches, like ibuprofen, but that’s just when I need it. And… a vitamin D supplement, my daughter makes me take it. She says I don't get enough sun. But that's it, I think. I'll have to ask my daughter to be sure, she keeps track of everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so blood pressure medication, ibuprofen as needed for headaches, and a vitamin D supplement. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, honestly. I love food too much to be picky! My daughter always asks me that, but I always tell her, “No, dear, I eat everything!” I suppose it's possible, but I can’t recall ever having an allergic reaction.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear, family history… That’s a long story. Like I said, my mother and grandmother both had terrible headaches. My father… he had some heart trouble when he was older. And my brother… he had… well, he had some problems with his legs, when he was a young man. He had to walk with a cane for a while. My daughter says it might be important, but I don't know what it all means. It was a long time ago. Mostly just headaches, heart problems, and my brother’s legs. Nothing too serious, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of headaches, heart problems, and leg problems in your brother. Now, before we move on, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all, dear. Go right ahead. I don't mind. I trust you completely. My daughter chose you, you know. She said you were very thorough. So, whatever you need, just let me know. I'm a bit creaky, you might hear some popping, but don’t worry about that! It's just old age.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Alayne. A little creakiness is perfectly normal. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and do a quick neurological exam – check your reflexes, balance, and strength. Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not necessarily concerning, but we'll keep an eye on it. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/85. Pulse is 78 and regular. Okay, Alayne, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A murmur, you say? Dr. Bellini never mentioned anything, but he was always a bit rushed. I’m not surprised. And my blood pressure… well, I knew I shouldn't have had that extra biscotti this morning! Here you go, dear. Is that alright? A little shaky, maybe, but I can squeeze.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. A little weaker on the right side, but nothing too alarming at this point. Now, can you squeeze my hand on this side?
PATIENT: Here you go. I think that feels… a little stronger, maybe? It’s hard to say. I’ve never had anyone check my grip strength before, you know. It’s all a bit strange. I'm getting a little tired, if I'm honest. All this squeezing is making my arm ache.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is a little stronger on the left. That's alright, we're just gathering information. And it’s perfectly fine to feel tired, we can take breaks as needed. Now, I’m going to check your balance. Could you please stand up for me, if you’re able?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Here I go. Slowly, slowly… There we go. A little wobbly, but I’m up. My legs aren’t what they used to be, you know. I have to be careful not to fall. It’s the age, I suppose. Don't mind the creaking! Is this alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Alayne. Just take your time. Okay, could you please close your eyes for a moment?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Eyes closed… Oh dear, this is making me a bit dizzy. Everything feels a little… unsteady. Please let me know if I’m swaying too much. I don't want to fall! It’s a bit frightening, honestly. I’m a bit nervous now.
DOCTOR: Yes, you're swaying a little, but that's perfectly alright. Let’s open your eyes now. Okay, please sit back down. That's enough for now. Okay, Alayne, thank you for your patience. Based on what you've told me, and what I've found during the exam – the slight murmur, elevated blood pressure, weaker grip strength on the right side, and some balance issues – I think it would be helpful to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh yes, dear, whatever you think is best. Tests… alright. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what’s going on, and hopefully, something can be done about it. It’s good to have a doctor I can trust. What kind of tests are we talking about? Are they painful? I’m a bit nervous, you see. My daughter will be relieved, though. She always wants me to get everything checked.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable, Alayne. We'll take things one step at a time. We'll start with a few basic blood tests – to check your general health, rule out any infections, and check your vitamin levels. We'll also do a CT scan of your brain – that's a painless imaging test that will help us get a better look at your brain and rule out any structural problems. And finally, I’d like to order an MRI of your brain, which provides even more detailed images. It’s a little longer than the CT scan, and you’ll be in a bit of a confined space, but it’s very safe. The blood tests are just a quick needle prick. The CT scan and MRI are painless, but you will need to lie very still for a while. Do you have any questions about any of those tests?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a CT scan and an MRI? That sounds… a bit frightening, honestly. Confined space? I don't do well with small spaces. I get a little… panicky. And lying still for a long time… my legs aren’t what they used to be, you know. They ache something awful. Is there… is there any way to avoid the MRI? Or maybe just the CT scan? I don't know… I'm a little overwhelmed. My daughter will be happy you're being thorough, but I'm not sure I can handle all of this. Perhaps we can start with just the blood tests?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Alayne. We can definitely start with just the blood tests. And we can absolutely discuss alternatives to the MRI if you’re feeling uncomfortable. The MRI provides the most detailed information, but we can get a lot of information from the CT scan alone, and we can always consider other options later. We can also talk to the radiology department about anti-anxiety medication if you decide to go through with the MRI, and they can make accommodations to help you feel more comfortable. Let's start with the blood tests, and then we can reassess and discuss the imaging options later. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh yes, dear, that sounds much better. Start with the blood tests… that I can handle. And then we can talk about the other tests later. Perhaps my daughter can come with me, when we discuss them? She’s very good at asking questions, and she always remembers everything. Thank you for being so understanding, Dr. Rosanova. You've put my mind at ease a little. It's good to have a doctor who listens. Now, what do I need to do about these blood tests? Do I need to fast? And where do I go?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Alayne. I'm glad I could help. Yes, you'll need to fast for at least 8 hours before the blood tests – that means no food or drinks, except for water. You can take your regular medications, unless I specifically tell you otherwise. You can go to the lab at St. Jude’s Hospital – it's just down the road, about a 5-minute drive. I’ll give you a lab requisition form with all the necessary instructions. They’ll draw a few vials of blood, and the results will be sent to me within a few days. Here you go. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll take things one step at a time, and we’ll figure everything out together.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. That's very kind of you. St. Jude’s, you say? I think I know where that is. And no food for 8 hours… that might be a little difficult, but I can manage. My daughter will remind me, I'm sure. Well, I think that’s everything, isn’t it? Thank you again, Dr. Rosanova. You've been a great help. I feel much better knowing we're getting to the bottom of things.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Alayne. It was lovely meeting you. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions. And remember, we’ll take things one step at a time. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon.
