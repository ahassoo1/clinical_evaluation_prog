DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… something with my coloring, I believe. My skin, it's become quite yellow. It’s rather unsettling, and I was told to come see someone about it. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I can’t recall all the details. Something about my liver, perhaps? It's all a bit muddled.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowing of the skin… that’s concerning, and good you came in to get it checked. You mentioned something about your liver – that’s a good place to start thinking. It could be related. Let’s try to sort through this. When did you first notice the yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh dear. When… that’s difficult. It feels like… a few weeks, perhaps? It started subtly, and I thought it was just the lighting in my home. Then my daughter pointed it out, and well, here I am. I truly wish I could be more precise. It all seems to blend together these days. Is it very serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks, starting subtly. That's alright, we can work with that. And it's good your daughter noticed – family is helpful in these situations. It could be serious, but it could also be something relatively minor. We need to figure out what’s causing it. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the yellowing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me think. I have been rather tired, I suppose. More so than usual. And my appetite… it hasn't been very good. Everything tastes a bit…off. Also, my stomach… it's been uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, just… bloated and uneasy. I hope that helps. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness, loss of appetite, things tasting “off,” and some stomach discomfort… that gives us a little more to work with. Do you have any pain in your upper right side, under your ribs?
PATIENT: Pain… Now that you mention it, yes, a little. Not constant, but a dull ache sometimes. Especially after I eat. It comes and goes, though. I hadn’t thought it was important enough to mention, honestly. It’s just a little discomfort. Is that… bad? I truly don’t mean to be a bother, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not a bother at all. It’s good you mentioned it. That dull ache in the upper right side is relevant. Okay, I'm going to listen to your abdomen and check your liver size. It won’t be comfortable, but it will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Can you lie back on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please, do what you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I do hope it isn't anything too serious. I’ve lived a long life, but I'd like to keep living it, if possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm feeling a little tenderness in your upper right quadrant, and your liver feels slightly enlarged. That supports my suspicion. I want to order some blood tests. These will help us determine what's causing the yellowing and the enlargement of your liver. Specifically, I want to check your liver enzymes, bilirubin levels, and a complete blood count. We may also need to consider an ultrasound of your abdomen, depending on the results of the blood work. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and an ultrasound. Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m not particularly fond of needles, but I understand it’s necessary. Will the blood tests tell me definitively what’s wrong? And… is an ultrasound painful? I truly appreciate you taking the time with me. I’m rather anxious about all of this. Perhaps it’s just my age showing.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to be anxious, Annelle, and you're right, it could be your age. The blood tests will give us a lot of information – they'll help narrow down the possible causes. And an ultrasound is completely painless. It uses sound waves to create an image of your liver and other organs. It's like a pregnancy scan, but we’re not looking for a baby! I’ll give you a lab requisition form and instructions for the ultrasound. The lab is just down the hall, and the imaging center is located across the street. Once I have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the next steps. It will probably be a few days until we get everything back. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds manageable, Doctor. A few days… I can certainly wait a few days. And no baby, you say! Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little less frightened now, knowing what to expect. Here, let me see that form. I’ll take it to the lab right away. Is there anything else I should do? Perhaps avoid certain foods? Or… rest more? I truly wish I remembered things better.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Annelle. It's my job to make sure you feel comfortable. For now, avoid alcohol completely. And try to eat a lighter diet – easily digestible foods. Nothing too fatty or greasy. Rest is always good, of course. And don’t worry about remembering everything perfectly. We’ll take it one step at a time. Given your age and the fact you're uninsured, I’m going to have my nurse, Fatima, give you information on some local resources that may help with the cost of the imaging. She's very helpful. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: That is very kind of you, Doctor, about the resources. I truly appreciate that. No, I don’t think I have any more questions at the moment. You’ve answered everything so patiently. I suppose… I’ll go to the lab now. Thank you again, Doctor Alzoubi. You have a very calming presence. I hope I don’t keep you too long.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Annelle. And you didn't keep me long at all. Please, take your time, and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or questions once you get the results. We’ll be here to help. Take care, and I'll see you in a few days.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. Goodbye.
