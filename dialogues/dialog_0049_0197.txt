DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarotta. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be blunt, I need a card to drive for one of those ride-share companies. You know, like Uber or Lyft. I believe I need a medical card for it. I want to get this sorted quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: A medical card… for a rideshare company?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. They require it, to make sure we’re all… fit to drive, I suppose. It’s new to me, honestly. I used to operate logging equipment – big machines! – for decades, and never needed anything like this. But this is different, driving people around. Is this something you handle here?
DOCTOR: It's… unusual, yes. Most people come to me with actual medical concerns. These companies are very new to me as well, and the requirements they’re setting. But, alright. We can do a basic assessment. It won't be a comprehensive physical, understand, just enough to determine if you meet the basic standards for driving. Do you have any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago, but no problems since. And my knees ache a bit when it rains – old age, I suppose! But nothing a doctor has ever needed to treat, if you know what I mean. I’m generally quite healthy for my age, I think. I still walk every day. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal twenty years ago… and some knee pain with weather changes. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure, a very low dose. It’s called… let me think… Amlodipine, I believe. Five milligrams, once a day. Other than that, nothing. Just vitamins.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine 5mg daily. Good. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. I can eat shellfish, take penicillin… everything. My husband – ex-husband, now – was allergic to bee stings, but that’s not me! Is that what you needed to know? It’s just… I always feel a little silly listing things I don’t have.
DOCTOR: It’s important to be thorough, Ms. Sciarotta. It’s not silly, it’s… standard procedure. Alright. Now, let’s talk about your general health. Do you experience any dizziness, fainting, or vision problems?
PATIENT: No, not at all. My eyesight is a little… diminished, of course. I wear glasses, as you can see. But no dizziness or fainting. Never have. I can see quite well with my glasses, good enough to drive, certainly. I had my eyes checked last year, and the doctor said they were stable. I don’t have any trouble with lights at night, either. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Stable vision, wears glasses. Alright. And have you had any recent changes in your hearing?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s… normal age-related hearing loss, I suppose. I have to ask people to repeat themselves sometimes, especially when it’s noisy. But nothing sudden, and nothing that would affect my driving. I can hear the horn, the radio… everything I need to hear. It just means I might ask a passenger to speak up sometimes. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: It's a matter of ensuring you can safely operate a vehicle, Ms. Sciarotta. Alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical assessment. Can you stand and walk a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here we go. Is this alright? Should I walk faster, or… do something specific? I just want to make sure I'm doing this correctly.
DOCTOR: Gait appears stable, slightly slow. No noticeable limping or difficulty with balance. Please, have a seat. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This will be quick.
PATIENT: Alright. I haven’t had one of these in… decades. I hope I don’t flinch! Just tell me what you need me to do. I’m ready, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are present and relatively symmetrical, though slightly diminished. Not particularly concerning for someone your age. Now, just a quick check of your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, consistent with medication use. Pulse is regular. Overall, your basic physical assessment appears… adequate.
PATIENT: Adequate? That’s… not a glowing review! But I suppose it's better than bad. So, does that mean I can get the card? I really need to get this done quickly. I have a car payment to think about, you know. Is there any paperwork I need to fill out?
DOCTOR: “Adequate” means you meet the minimum standards for basic driving functionality. It does not mean you are in optimal health. I will fill out the necessary form stating you are medically cleared, with the caveat that your blood pressure is controlled with medication. However, I strongly recommend regular monitoring of your blood pressure, and I suggest a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician within the next three months. And I would advise against driving for extended periods without taking breaks. Understand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I understand. Regular check-ups, shorter drives… I can do that. Thank you, Doctor. So, can I pick up the card today, or will it take a while? I really appreciate you getting this done for me. I’m not a complicated case, I assure you. Just a sensible woman trying to earn a little money.
DOCTOR: The form is completed. You can take this to the rideshare company. As I mentioned, it is simply a medical clearance – it does not endorse your driving ability, or guarantee your safety. It merely confirms you met the minimum health requirements at this moment in time. I strongly advise you to prioritize your health, Ms. Sciarotta. Driving while fatigued or unwell is dangerous. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Nestingen. Really, thank you. I appreciate your time, and your… advice. I’ll be sure to keep an eye on my blood pressure. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: That will be all.
