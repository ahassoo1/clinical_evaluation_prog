DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. I'm Dr. Annesley. Please, have a seat. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. Well, it's... difficult to explain, really. I've been having a bit of trouble with my speech, I suppose. It feels… slurred, sometimes. It's not constant, but it's enough to worry me. I don’t really remember when it started, exactly. It just… is.
DOCTOR: Okay, slurred speech. And you said it's not constant, it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. It doesn’t happen all the time. Some days I don’t even notice it. Other days… well, my husband says it's quite noticeable. He mentioned it first, to be honest. I didn’t believe him at first, but then I realized he was right. I just… don’t know why it would be happening.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently that might be connected?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not that I can recall, no. Everything’s been… pretty normal, I think. Work is the same, home life is the same… I haven’t been feeling unwell, or had any injuries. Honestly, I’m drawing a blank. Is that… helpful? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Adyn. It’s more common than you think to not immediately pinpoint a cause. We'll work through it. Now, when you say "slurred speech", can you describe how it feels to you?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It feels like my tongue is a bit heavy, maybe? And the words don't come out as clearly as they should. Like… I know what I want to say, but it doesn’t sound right when I say it. It’s not a complete mumble, but it's… off. And sometimes, it feels like I’m having trouble finding the right words, even before I start speaking. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Heavy tongue, difficulty finding words… Okay. Have you noticed any weakness in your face or arms at all?
PATIENT: Weakness… No, not that I’ve noticed. I’m a construction manager, you see, so I’m quite active during the day. Lifting things, walking around sites… I haven't had any trouble with that. My husband hasn’t mentioned anything either, and he’s usually the first to point out if something is wrong. He worries, you know.
DOCTOR: Good. That's reassuring. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, I have Medicare, so I see doctors regularly enough, but… I don’t really have any major conditions, no. Just the usual check-ups. I think I had high blood pressure a few years ago, but it was managed with medication, and I believe it’s under control now. I’d have to ask my husband, though, to be sure about the details. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of managed hypertension. We can verify that in your records. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a multivitamin, that’s it, I think. And sometimes, if I have a headache, I'll take paracetamol, but that’s not very often. Nothing else, no. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to worry about it, but my mother always said I was too robust to be allergic to anything. She was a strong woman. I haven't had any issues with allergies, food or otherwise.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Just a few simple tests to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Please, go ahead. I hope it won’t take too long, though. I have a site meeting later this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It shouldn't take long. First, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Now, I’m going to test your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? Is that too much? I don't want to hurt you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfect. Good strength. Now, let's check your coordination. Could you touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that alright? I’m a bit shaky today, I apologize. Is it something to worry about?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Adyn. A little shakiness isn’t necessarily cause for concern. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is everything alright, Doctor? I can feel my heart beating quite fast. Is that normal? I'm a little anxious, I suppose. I don't like being examined, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but you are a bit tachycardic, which can be expected with some anxiety. Lungs are clear. Now, can you say "thirty-three" for me?
PATIENT: Thirty-three. Thirty-three. Does that sound alright, Doctor? Is it slurred? I'm really starting to worry now, to be honest. I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: And now, can you follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Like this? Is it alright? It’s a little difficult, to be honest. My eyes feel tired. I haven't been sleeping very well lately.
DOCTOR: Alright, Adyn. Thank you for your patience. Based on the exam, and what you’ve told me, it could be a number of things. The slight slurring, the difficulty with coordination, and the fatigue… these could be related to stress or anxiety, as you mentioned. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a blood test, including a complete blood count and a thyroid panel, just to get a baseline. Also, I think an MRI of the brain would be prudent, just to make sure there isn't anything structural causing this. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI… that sounds… serious. But yes, if that’s what you think is best, Doctor. I want to know what’s going on. I just… I hope it’s nothing too bad. What are we looking for, exactly? And when would I get the results? I have a lot of work commitments, you see, and I need to know if I need to rearrange things.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Adyn. The MRI will help us rule out things like stroke, tumors, or multiple sclerosis. It doesn’t mean we’re expecting any of those, just that we want to be thorough. As for the blood tests, those will check for things like anemia or thyroid issues, which can sometimes cause similar symptoms. The blood tests should be back in a few days. The MRI will take a little longer—perhaps a week or so—because it needs to be reviewed by a radiologist. My office will contact you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, I recommend trying to manage your stress levels. Are you able to take some time off work, or delegate some responsibilities?
PATIENT: Time off… that would be difficult, Doctor. I'm the project manager, you see. Everything falls on me. Delegating… well, I'm not very good at that. I prefer to do things myself, to make sure they're done right. I suppose I could try to slow down a bit, maybe. But it's just… everything is so busy right now. And what if… what if it is something serious? What would happen then? Would I have to… stop working altogether? Would I need… treatment? I'm really scared, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Adyn, it’s perfectly normal to be scared. It’s good that you're expressing your concerns. Let’s not jump to conclusions until we have the results. We'll take things one step at a time. If it is something serious, there are treatments available, depending on the diagnosis. We’ll discuss all your options thoroughly, and I’ll be here to support you every step of the way. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. I’m going to write you a referral for the MRI and a lab order for the blood tests. My nurse will schedule you for the MRI as soon as possible. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—such as severe headache, weakness on one side of your body, or difficulty breathing—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate your reassurance. A referral for the MRI… and the lab order. And to go to the emergency room if anything gets worse. I hope it doesn’t come to that. I just want to know what’s happening, so I can get back to normal. Thank you again, Doctor. I think… I think that's all for now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Adyn. Please don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we're here to help. Take care, and try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this. .
