DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. I am Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, my face gets red. Not all the time, but… often enough to bother me. Like a flushing, you know? Gets warm, and red. It’s been happening for… oh, a long time now, I think. Maybe a year? Hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: A year, you say. “Often enough to bother you” is rather vague, Mr. Withycombe. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Okay. Let me think. Usually it happens after I eat something. Not everything, but… spicy food, mostly. And sometimes when I get… a little upset. Not angry, exactly, just… worried. Like if someone says something… not nice. Or if I have to think about… bills. Things like that. It doesn’t happen every time, but enough that I noticed. Maybe two or three times a week? Sometimes more. It goes away after a little while, but it's… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Right. So, flushing after eating, particularly spicy foods, and with periods of… anxiety, shall we say?
PATIENT: Yes, anxiety is a good word. Not always bad anxiety, just… thinking too much. And yes, the spicy food is definitely a trigger. I like Indian food, you see. But then my face… it gets so red! It's like a tomato. My wife… she used to joke about it. She liked spicy food too.
DOCTOR: I see. And has this flushing been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Sometimes my heart feels like it’s beating a little faster when it happens. Not like a pounding, just… quicker. And maybe a little sweating. On my forehead mostly. Not a lot, just… noticeable. Oh! And sometimes my hands feel warm too, when my face is red. But no dizziness or anything like that. Just the red face, fast heart, warm hands, little sweat. That’s all, I think.
DOCTOR: Mr. Withycombe, I'm noting a history of episodic flushing triggered by dietary factors and stress, accompanied by tachycardia and mild diaphoresis. Have you ever had a blood pressure check?
PATIENT: Blood pressure check…? I had one… a long time ago. When my wife was sick. The doctor checked everything then, lots of things. But… I don’t remember the numbers. They didn’t say anything was wrong, I think. But that was… years ago now. Maybe five? Six? It was a different doctor. A big hospital. I haven't really seen a doctor since then.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, given the episodic nature and associated symptoms, we need to rule out a few possibilities. I'm going to perform a brief physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table. I will need to listen to your heart and lungs and take your blood pressure, of course. And I'd like to briefly examine your skin.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… alright. Skin? You mean… look at my face? I guess that makes sense. Yes, go ahead. It’s probably just… nothing. But it’s good to check, I suppose. It’s a little cold in here, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is slightly elevated, as you noted. Normal rhythm, though. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is… slightly elevated, but not dramatically so. I do note some mild telangiectasia – small visible blood vessels – on your cheeks and nose. Consistent with flushing. Now, can you tell me if you have any history of rosacea or other skin conditions?
PATIENT: Rosacea…? No, I don’t think so. Never heard of it, actually. My skin is just… skin. I used to work outside a lot, when I was younger. Sunburns sometimes. But I always wore a hat. Never had any… rashes or anything. Just… this red face. It comes and goes, you see? That's what's so strange. Sometimes I look normal, and sometimes… well, like a tomato. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Withycombe, being concerned is not inherently “bad.” However, episodic flushing can indicate a number of underlying issues. Given your history, and your lack of a recent comprehensive medical workup, I recommend a few basic tests. We’ll need a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. This will help rule out any underlying medical conditions that might be contributing to your symptoms.
PATIENT: Tests… yes, alright. That sounds… sensible. A lot of blood, I suppose? I don’t like needles, you know. But if it helps… yes, okay. What happens after the tests? Will you… tell me what’s wrong? I just want to… feel normal again. Like my wife… she always knew what to do.
DOCTOR: A standard amount of blood, Mr. Withycombe. It’s a routine procedure. Once the results are back—typically within a few days—we will review them and discuss the appropriate course of action. If the results are normal, we can discuss possible lifestyle modifications or symptomatic treatment. If there are abnormalities, we will explore further investigation. I’ll write the orders for the lab tests now. The receptionist will schedule you for blood work at the clinic. Do you have any allergies to latex or other materials we should be aware of before the tests?
PATIENT: Latex…? No, I don’t think so. Never had any problems with… gloves or anything. My wife did the shopping, mostly. I just… wore them when she told me to. She was always very careful. I don't… I don't think I have any allergies, no. Just… a little nervous about the needles, that’s all. Will it hurt much?
DOCTOR: It will be a minor, temporary discomfort, Mr. Withycombe. The phlebotomist is very skilled. For now, I recommend avoiding known triggers, such as spicy foods, and managing stress through relaxation techniques. I will also provide you with a written summary of our discussion and the lab orders. Do you have any questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: Avoid spicy food… that's going to be difficult. But I can try. Relaxation… my wife used to say I worry too much. She’d rub my shoulders. No, I don't think I have any more questions right now. Just… thank you, Doctor. For listening. And for… trying to help. I appreciate it. Is there anything I need to do before I leave? Like… sign a form or something?
DOCTOR: The receptionist will have you sign the consent form for the lab tests. She’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Please avoid any strenuous activity before your blood work. And if you experience any sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, seek immediate medical attention. That will be all, Mr. Withycombe. Have a good day.
