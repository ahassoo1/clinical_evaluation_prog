DOCTOR: Alright, Annelle. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, well, Doctor… No, Bethanie, is it? Yes. It’s… it’s my skin, you see. And my eyes. They’ve gotten… quite yellow. A friend – a very kind woman – noticed it and told me I should come right away. Something about my liver, she said. I… I don't really recall the details. It’s all a bit fuzzy, truthfully. I do hope it’s nothing too serious. I’m not one for long illnesses.
DOCTOR: Yes, Bethanie is fine. And alright. Yellowing skin… that could be a number of things, honestly. Your friend is… well-meaning, I'm sure. But let’s not jump to conclusions about your liver just yet. It’s good you came in. Now, how long have you noticed this yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. It’s… difficult to say precisely. A week, perhaps? Maybe a little longer. Time does seem to slip away, you know. I’ve been feeling rather… tired lately, too. More so than usual. But I assumed that was just… getting older. I haven’t been eating as well, either. Not much of an appetite these days. Is that important? I… I truly wish I could be more specific. It’s terribly frustrating not to remember things clearly.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, tiredness and loss of appetite can be relevant. It’s good you're telling me all this, even if it's not precise. We'll figure it out. Now, have you noticed any pain, anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain… Hmm. Not really. Not a sharp pain, no. Though my stomach… it feels a little… uncomfortable sometimes. A dull ache, perhaps? It comes and goes. It's not something I've paid much attention to, to be honest. I tend to… ignore things until they become unbearable. Is that foolish of me? I apologize for being so vague. I’m simply trying to recall everything, and it’s… proving quite difficult. Is it alright if I sit here a moment? My head is feeling a little light.
DOCTOR: Yes, alright. Let’s have you lie down on the table. It's better if I actually examine you, rather than just talk about it. It’ll help me get a better picture of what’s going on. And it's quite alright, it's just… more information is always useful, even if it's not perfectly clear. We need to rule things out. Now, please, lie down. I’ll listen to your abdomen and check a few things.
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, of course. The table. I do hope I’m not inconveniencing you, Doctor. It’s just… these old bones aren’t as cooperative as they used to be. Please, do what you need to do. I’ll try my best to remain still. Is there anything specific I should be aware of? Or… should I simply close my eyes?
DOCTOR: No, just breathe normally. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with this. It won’t be uncomfortable. Just let me know if anything is painful. And no, you don’t need to close your eyes. Just relax. Now, let's see… Deep breaths. Anything here feel tender?
PATIENT: Oh! Well… yes, that’s a little… sensitive. Just there, on the right side. It’s not a sharp pain, mind you, just… uncomfortable. It feels… swollen, perhaps? Though I haven't noticed it before today. Is that… bad? I apologize for being such a bother, Doctor. I truly didn’t want to waste your time. Perhaps it’s just… indigestion? I do enjoy a good pastry now and then. Though my appetite hasn’t been what it used to be… it's all rather confusing.
DOCTOR: Indigestion is… unlikely, given the tenderness. And yes, it is tender. There's definitely some discomfort there. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Bowel movements… That’s… a rather personal question, Doctor. But… yes, actually. They’ve been… paler than usual, I suppose. And… not as frequent. I hadn’t thought much of it, to be honest. I assumed it was… the lack of appetite. I do apologize for being so vague. It's just… I'm not accustomed to discussing such matters with… well, anyone. Is that… concerning? Perhaps it’s just a temporary issue? I do hope so. It's all rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Pale stools and infrequent bowel movements… combined with the tenderness and yellowing… it's becoming clearer what we need to investigate. Now, have you noticed any itching?
PATIENT: Itching…? Now that you mention it… yes, actually. My skin has been rather… dry and itchy lately. I assumed it was just the cold weather, or perhaps a new soap. I’ve been using a lotion, but it doesn’t seem to help much. It’s most noticeable on my arms and back. It's… quite bothersome, really. Is that related to the other symptoms, Doctor? I do hope this isn’t something serious. I truly am starting to worry. It’s just… I don’t want to be a burden. Perhaps I should have just stayed home. But my friend… she insisted.
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, your friend was right to be concerned. And you’re not a burden. But we need to run some tests. Based on your symptoms – the yellowing, the tenderness, the pale stools, the itching – I’m concerned about a possible blockage in your bile ducts. We need to get a blood test to check your liver function, and likely an ultrasound of your abdomen. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A blockage… in my bile ducts? Oh dear. That sounds… terribly serious, Doctor. Ultrasound… blood tests… Is it… is it cancer? I apologize for asking, but… my husband… he passed away from cancer several years ago. It was a very difficult time. I… I don't know if I could… I understand you need to run tests, but… is it very bad? Please, be honest with me. I’m not sure I can handle another… another ordeal. And who would take care of me? I have no family left. Perhaps it's just a minor ailment… perhaps I should have stayed home. .
