DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Murph. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh... well, my wife, she makes me come. Said I gotta get checked out. Something 'bout... sports? I dunno. Old man tryin' out for somethin', I think. My memory ain't what it used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. “Sports,” yes. And your wife felt a check-up was warranted. That's… thoughtful of her. To clarify, Mr. Murph, are you currently participating in a sports activity?
PATIENT: Participatin’? Hmm… not really. Not… regularly. Used to play dominoes, is that a sport? Wait… is that why I’m here? Dominoes? My wife didn’t say nothin’ 'bout dominoes. She just said somethin' 'bout a team... and bein' able to… run? I don’t know, Doctor. It’s all a bit foggy.
DOCTOR: Okay. A “team” and the ability to “run.” That does sound… unusual. Perhaps we should focus on what you feel is different or concerning about your health right now, regardless of whether it’s related to dominoes or a team. Are you experiencing any pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fatigue?
PATIENT: Well… sometimes my knees ache. Old age, I guess. And I get outta breath pretty easy walkin' up the stairs. Just a little bit, though. Not bad. And… sometimes I feel a little… wobbly, like you said? Not fallin' down wobbly, just… not steady. Happens every now and then. It’s hard to explain, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Murph. “Knees ache, shortness of breath with stairs, and occasional unsteadiness.” How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… oh, goodness. A long time now. The knees, always botherin' me. The breathin’… maybe a couple of months. Since the summer got real hot, I think. And the wobbly thing… comes and goes. Sometimes weeks go by and I feel alright. Other times… like yesterday, I felt a little off balance gettin' outta the car. It's not every day, you know? Just… pops up now and then.
DOCTOR: Right. Intermittent. Okay. Now, has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes of unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Trigger? You mean… somethin’ that makes me feel wobbly? Not really. Not that I've noticed. Sometimes it's just after I stand up too fast. But not always. I ate a big lunch yesterday, maybe that had somethin' to do with it? My wife always says I eat too much. But she makes good cookin', you see! It's a tough problem, Doctor. A very tough problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to some other things then, just to get a better picture of your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Diagnosed… uh… let me see. The doctor, years ago, said somethin' 'bout my pressure bein' high. Took some pills for a while. I dunno if I still have it, to be honest. And… I had a bad knee when I was young, playin' baseball. That’s why it always bothers me now. But that wasn't a… diagnosis, was it? Just an old injury. I don't remember much else, Doctor. Old man brain, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm. Let me think... Oh! Yes. I take somethin’ for my water. The doctor said somethin’ 'bout my kidneys. Small white pill. And... I take a little somethin’ when my knees are really achin’. It's a cream, you rub it on. That’s it, I think. I can’t remember the names of them, Doctor. So many pills! My wife keeps track of it all.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Murph. It's alright, we can get a list from your wife. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or insects?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of! I eat pretty much anything. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I use certain soaps, but nothin' serious. Never had a problem with bees or anything like that. My wife says I’m a tough old bird. Can’t kill me! But seriously, Doctor, I don’t think I have any allergies. None that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we move on, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history... hmm. That's a tough one. My father, he was a strong man, lived a long life. He died in his sleep, I think. My mother, she had… problems with her legs when she got old. Couldn't walk very well. And my sister… she had somethin' with her heart, I think. But that was a long time ago. They’re all gone now, Doctor. It was a long time ago, and I don't remember much about their sicknesses. I was young then. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, do you currently use tobacco, alcohol, or any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no drugs! Never touched ‘em! Alcohol… I like a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just a little! Red wine, good for the heart, my wife says. And tobacco… I used to smoke cigars when I was young, a long time ago. But I quit years ago. Good lungs now, Doctor. Strong! Old man’s lungs! Well, relatively strong.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Murph. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I'm going to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. I’m an old man, used to doctors poking and prodding. Just don’t be too rough! My wife will be mad if you break me!
DOCTOR: Very good. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Heart rate is a little elevated, 88 and regular. Breath sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally, but no wheezes or crackles noted. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 148 over 82. Now, let's check your pulse in your extremities. Pulses are present and equal bilaterally, 2+ in all extremities. Finally, I'm going to briefly assess your gait and balance. If you're comfortable, would you mind standing up and walking a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Just a little wobbly sometimes, you know. See? A little shaky, but I'm still standing. My wife says I walk like an old penguin. But I haven’t fallen yet! That’s the important thing. Is that okay, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, Mr. Murph. I noticed some slight unsteadiness and a wider-than-normal gait, as you mentioned. Based on what you've told me and the brief exam, I suspect a few things could be contributing to your symptoms. Your elevated blood pressure, history of smoking, and occasional wine intake are all factors. The unsteadiness and shortness of breath could be related to a variety of things, including a decrease in overall fitness, or potentially something more serious. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some basic blood work, including a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. I also recommend an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. Additionally, I’d like to check your Vitamin D levels. It's a common deficiency that can cause weakness and unsteadiness. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood work... an EKG... Sounds serious, Doctor. But if you think it's best, then yes, okay. My wife always says I gotta listen to the doctors. She’s a smart woman, you know. Whatever you need to do to make sure this old man doesn't fall apart. Just try not to stick too many needles in me! And can I have a glass of water after? All this talkin' and walkin' makes a man thirsty!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Murph. We'll take it one step at a time. We'll start with the blood work. It's just a few tubes of blood, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. We'll get you a glass of water right after. I will also have my nurse schedule you for an EKG. It's a painless procedure where we place some stickers on your chest to monitor your heart rhythm. While we wait for the results, I'd recommend you continue to take things easy. Avoid strenuous activity, and make sure you're staying hydrated. Finally, I'd like to discuss some lifestyle modifications that could help improve your overall health, including diet, exercise, and potentially smoking cessation. We can talk about that in more detail once we have the results of your tests. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications… My wife already handles the lifestyle modifications, Doctor! She keeps me in line. No, I think I’m good for now. Just get those tests done and let me know what you find. I guess… maybe tell my wife what she should be feedin' me? She likes to cook, but maybe some things are better than others? And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to this old man ramble. You’re a good doctor. Now, about that water...
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Murph. It was my pleasure. I will certainly provide your wife with a detailed dietary recommendation based on your test results. We can discuss foods that are beneficial for your heart health, blood pressure, and overall well-being. I will also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week to discuss the results and formulate a treatment plan. For now, let me get my nurse to draw your blood and get you that glass of water. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms before your follow-up appointment. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been a great help. And tell that nurse to be gentle, alright?
