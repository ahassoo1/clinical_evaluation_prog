DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need to get this life insurance thing done. They sent me here for an exam. Hope it doesn't take too long, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. I understand you're here for a life insurance physical. We'll do our best to make it as quick and efficient as possible. Just so I have a complete picture, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… hmm. I work, you know? Manage a little hotel downtown. Keeps me on my feet. No big problems, I guess. Bit of a sore back sometimes from lifting, but nothing I can't handle. I’m divorced, been a few years now. I have Medicare. Does that answer your question? I don’t really go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. It sounds like you’re fairly active with your work. And yes, Medicare is good to know. Just to clarify, when you say a sore back "sometimes," could you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: It's mostly when I'm changing linens, or moving stuff around for guests. It'll ache for a day or so, then it's fine. It hasn't gotten worse or anything, just… there. I take some ibuprofen sometimes, when it really bothers me. It's not constant, you know? Mostly just when I overdo it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Intermittent back pain related to activity. And ibuprofen helps, that’s positive. Now, have you had any other aches and pains anywhere else?
PATIENT: Not really. My knees get a little creaky when it’s cold, but that’s just getting old, I figure. Happens to everyone, right? Nothing serious enough to see a doctor about, though. I just try not to stand too long in the cold. Is that what you're asking about?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I’m trying to get a sense of. So, knees are a little creaky with cold weather, but not a major concern. Now, let's move on to other things. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been diagnosed with anything. Doctors haven’t ever told me I have anything, if that makes sense. Just the usual check-ups when I was a kid, and now this for the insurance. I think I had the flu once, maybe twice, but that's it. Nothing that needed a special name.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No known chronic medical conditions. And you haven’t had any surgeries, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries. Never needed any. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. I try to be careful. I broke my arm when I was a little kid, but that's it. A long time ago. They just put it in a cast, it healed up fine. Not a big deal.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries other than a childhood broken arm that healed completely. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a tough one. My… my parents are both gone now. And I didn't really talk about health stuff with them much. My mom, she had… I think she had high blood pressure, maybe? But I don't know for sure, and I don't really know much about my dad’s side of the family. He wasn't around much. So… not really. I don't think so. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Putney. It's common for that information to be difficult to recall. Let's move on to your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Never even tried it. Always seemed kinda silly to me. My ex-wife smoked for a while, but I made her smoke outside. It smells terrible. Never wanted to pick up the habit myself.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a beer sometimes with dinner. Or a glass of wine. Nothing crazy. Maybe a couple of times a week. Definitely not every day. I don't drink and drive or anything like that. Just to relax. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. A couple of drinks a week for relaxation. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing I know of. I eat pretty much anything. I've never had a reaction to anything. Sometimes I get a little heartburn, but that's it, and that's not an allergy. I don't carry an EpiPen or anything like that. Just a regular stomach, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, before we move on to a quick physical exam, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the ibuprofen when my back hurts. And sometimes I take a multivitamin, but I forget half the time. Nothing regular. I really don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. Is that what you needed to know? It’s not like I’m on a bunch of stuff, or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for back pain and occasional multivitamin. That’s helpful. Alright, Mr. Putney, thank you for answering all those questions. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Sounds fine. Just… try to be quick, if you could? I got things to do, you know? But yeah, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Putney. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but we’ll keep that in mind. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in... and out... and another deep breath... Okay, your heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear. Ears and throat look good. I don't see any obvious signs of infection. Now, I'm just going to quickly feel your abdomen. No tenderness or masses. Everything feels normal there as well.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good. Everything normal, huh? Good. Can I go now? I really need to get back to the hotel.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything seems normal with the quick exam I've done. However, your blood pressure is a little elevated, and because you mentioned intermittent back pain, I’d like to order a few basic lab tests just to get a more complete picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Lab tests? Seriously? Look, I just need this done for the insurance. Is it necessary? It's going to take time, isn’t it? I really don't have time for a lot of tests. Can't you just… sign off on it?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Mr. Putney. And I want to respect that. However, the life insurance company requires a certain level of assessment, and these tests are part of that standard protocol. More importantly, even though you feel generally healthy, checking your blood pressure, cholesterol, and a basic metabolic panel can help identify potential risk factors for heart disease or other conditions, even if asymptomatic. The blood tests are relatively quick, and we can get the results back within a few days. It will give us both peace of mind and ensure accurate completion of the insurance requirements. It’s a simple blood draw, and it's usually covered by Medicare. Would you be willing to proceed with the tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. It’s Medicare, you said? And it won’t take long, right? Just tell me what I need to do. I got a hotel full of people expecting service. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Putney, I understand your frustration. I assure you, it won’t take long. The phlebotomist is just down the hall. They will draw a small amount of blood - it's usually less than a vial or two. I’m going to give you a lab order. It includes a Complete Blood Count , a Basic Metabolic Panel , and a Lipid Panel. These tests will check your overall blood health, kidney function, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. The phlebotomist will explain everything as well. Here you go. After you have the blood drawn, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me in about a week to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. A week. Fine. Just… where is this phlebotomist? I really need to get back. Hopefully, it doesn’t take too long. Tell them I’m in a hurry, will you?
DOCTOR: Certainly. The phlebotomist’s station is right through that door, just past the nurses’ station. I'll let them know you're here for a life insurance exam and that you’re on a tight schedule. They’re very efficient. Do you have any questions before you head over there?
PATIENT: No. Just… tell them to be quick. Thank you. .
