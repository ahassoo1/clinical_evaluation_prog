DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it's about my… well, it’s about what comes out when I go to the bathroom. There was blood. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to notice. And it’s not right, is it? A man my age shouldn’t be seeing that.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood in the stool is certainly something we need to investigate. Now, when you say “not a lot,” can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you want, a measuring cup? Look, I’m not a plumber. It wasn’t pouring out, alright? More like… streaks. Red streaks. And it happened…oh, I don't know… two times now. Yesterday and the day before. It’s unsettling, that's what it is. A perfectly good breakfast ruined by… that.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Streaks, two times now. And no changes to your usual bowel habits otherwise?
PATIENT: Habits? What kind of a question is that? I go when I need to go. Always have. It wasn't different, just… tainted. And I haven't been eating anything… exotic. Just regular food. Toast, eggs, sometimes a bit of fish. It’s not like I’ve been out foraging for berries, you know. A man doesn’t change his habits at my age. It’s too much bother.
DOCTOR: I understand. No recent changes to your diet, and usual bowel habits are consistent except for the blood. Have you experienced any pain or discomfort with your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. A bit of a grumble sometimes, like an old engine trying to start. But nothing to write home about. It’s just… unpleasant. And worrying, if you must know. A man shouldn’t be seeing blood, I tell ya. It’s not natural. And don't tell me it's just "age," I've lived a long life, but I haven't fallen apart completely yet.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant pain, just some discomfort. And you're right to be concerned, Mr. Rowbottom. Blood in the stool needs to be investigated. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite, weight loss, or fatigue recently?
PATIENT: Fatigue? Well, I get tired, of course. I’m eighty-eight years old! What do you expect? I don't bounce around like a young pup anymore. Appetite… I haven't been refusing food, if that's what you mean. And weight… I haven't been stepping on a scale, I don’t have time for foolishness. It’s probably the same as it always is. A bit on the thin side, perhaps. Never been a big eater. But definitely no sudden changes. Honestly, doctor, I just want to know what’s causing the blood. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It's good you haven't noticed any major changes in appetite or weight. However, blood in the stool can be a sign of several things, some more serious than others. It could be something relatively minor like hemorrhoids, but it can also indicate something more significant like diverticulosis or even colon cancer. We need to rule those things out. I'm going to do a quick physical exam, including checking your abdomen and a rectal exam. I understand this isn’t pleasant, but it’s important. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Good heavens. Must you? I mean, couldn't you just… give me some pills or something? I’m not a fan of poking and prodding, you know. Honestly. But… if you have to, I suppose. Just be quick about it. And try not to be too… rough. I haven't been feeling particularly sturdy lately. But I'd rather know, I suppose, than just worry about it. Just… warn me before you do anything, alright? A man likes a little warning.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will be as thorough and gentle as possible. I'll explain each step before I do it. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, then I’ll gently palpate it to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Just breathe normally, Mr. Rowbottom. Your abdomen sounds normal. Now, I will gently press on different areas to check for any discomfort. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: A little… a little bit there, on the left side. Not sharp pain, just… a dull ache. Like a bruise, almost. I’ve been feeling a bit… bloated lately, too, but I thought it was just something I ate. It’s probably nothing. An old man gets aches and pains, you know. Don't go making a fuss over it. Is that enough poking around? Honestly, I feel like a prize bull being examined at the fair.
DOCTOR: Alright, left-sided tenderness noted. It's good you've mentioned the bloating. Now, I will need to perform a digital rectal exam to check for any abnormalities. As I mentioned, it won't be pleasant, but it’s a necessary step. I’ll use lubricant to make it as comfortable as possible. Please let me know if you experience any pain. I'm going to ask you to bend over the exam table now, if you're able.
PATIENT: Hmph. Fine. Just… get it over with. And no unnecessary… enthusiasm, if you please. I'm not as sturdy as I used to be, you know. And warn me before…before anything happens. Honestly, the indignity of it all. A man's private parts shouldn't be subjected to such scrutiny. Bend over, he says. Like a schoolboy. Sighs dramatically. Just hurry it up.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rowbottom, just relax as much as you can. Alright. I do feel a small irregularity on the left side of your rectum, and there's some tenderness to palpation, which you likely already noticed. It's not large, but it's definitely something we need to investigate further. I'm going to order a fecal occult blood test to confirm the presence of blood in your stool, and I’d like to schedule a colonoscopy to get a better look at your colon and rectum. It's the best way to determine the cause of the bleeding and rule out anything serious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? Good heavens, what next? Stick a camera up there? Honestly, doctor, you’re trying to give me a heart attack. But… if you think it’s necessary. Yes, alright. A colonoscopy. Just… tell me what’s involved. How long does it take? Will it hurt? And… will I be awake? Honestly, this is all rather unsettling. A man shouldn't have to go through all this just to find out why his… well, you know. But if you insist… schedule it, I suppose. Just make it quick, and tell me everything. And warn me, alright? I can't stress that enough. Warn me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. A colonoscopy involves inserting a long, flexible tube with a camera on the end into your rectum to visualize the entire colon. It's usually performed with sedation, so you won't be awake or feel any pain during the procedure. You'll receive medication through an IV to help you relax and minimize discomfort. The procedure itself typically takes about 30 to 60 minutes. You’ll need to clear your colon completely beforehand, which involves following a special diet and taking a laxative solution. It’s not pleasant, I won’t lie, but it’s essential for a clear view. There is a small risk of complications, such as bleeding or perforation, but it’s very rare. I’ll explain everything in detail before the procedure, and you’ll have the opportunity to ask any questions you may have. I'll have the scheduler contact you to set up an appointment. In the meantime, I'm going to order that fecal occult blood test to confirm the bleeding. Does that address your concerns for now?
PATIENT: A laxative solution? Good grief. This is getting worse and worse. So, I have to… empty myself before they stick a camera up there? Honestly, the indignity of it all is almost too much to bear. A man deserves a little dignity in his old age. But… alright. A colonoscopy it is. A laxative solution and a camera. Just… promise me you'll be gentle. And warn me. Warn me about everything. And what about the results? How long will it take to get the results? A man doesn't want to be left hanging, you know. Just give me all the information. Everything. And be quick about it. This is all rather… unsettling. I think I need a cup of tea. A strong one. And maybe a biscuit. This has been a dreadful morning.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Rowbottom, you'll need to follow a specific bowel preparation regimen before the colonoscopy. It will ensure the colon is completely clear, allowing for a thorough examination. I understand it’s not pleasant, but it's a crucial step. I assure you, we will do everything to make you as comfortable as possible. As for the results, the pathologist will examine any tissue samples taken during the procedure, and it typically takes about a week to get the final report. I will personally contact you to discuss the findings as soon as they are available. I will also provide you with detailed written instructions on the bowel preparation and what to expect on the day of the procedure. Here are the written instructions. Please read them carefully. And yes, I promise to warn you about everything. I recommend you schedule the colonoscopy as soon as possible. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Hmph. A week? A week of worrying? That's a long time. Alright. Instructions, you say? Very well. I suppose I’ll have a look. But I still think this is all rather excessive. A man shouldn't have to go through all this just to find out why his… well, you know. “Drink a gallon of…” Oh, good grief. A gallon? That's preposterous. This is an awful lot of liquid, doctor. Are you sure this is necessary? And what if I can't… manage? A man isn't as spry as he used to be. Honestly, this is all rather… unsettling. And what about the discomfort? Will it hurt? And what if… well, never mind. Just… try to be gentle, alright? And warn me. You promised. This is a dreadful morning. A dreadful, dreadful morning. .
