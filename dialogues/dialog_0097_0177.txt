DOCTOR: Hi Jimmi, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's... something down there. A leak, kinda. Not good. Makes me feel... icky. I don't know what to call it, really. It just happened. Been a few days now, I think. Maybe longer? Time gets away from me.
DOCTOR: Okay, “something down there” and a leak… and it’s been going on for a few days, possibly longer. I understand it’s making you feel uncomfortable, that “icky” feeling. Let’s try to get a little more specific. When you say “down there,” are you referring to your vaginal area?
PATIENT: Vaginal? Oh, no, no, not there. Down there. You know... the man part. It's... well, a man part problem. Not my man part, of course. It’s… attached. Been with me a long time. Don't rightly know what it’s called. Never had to talk about it before.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, it’s related to your husband’s anatomy, not your own. And you’ve noticed a leak coming from that area. Is it a constant leak, or does it happen at certain times?
PATIENT: Husband? Oh, goodness no. Never married. It… came with me. Long story. Doesn't matter. And it's not all the time. Sometimes when I… move around a lot. Or after… well, after I've been sitting. Mostly when I sit. It’s just… damp. And it smells a bit funny. Not terrible funny, just… off. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s associated with movement and sitting, and you’ve noticed an odor. It's good you're noticing these things. It’s not usually normal to have leaking and an odor in that area. To help me understand better, has this happened before, even a little bit?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never. Not ever. I've... lived a long time, you know? Seventy-three years. And never had this problem before. It just… started. Out of nowhere. I don't do anything different now than I used to. Maybe a little less walking. It gets hot, you know? Hard to get around in the sun. But I haven't… changed anything. It's just... appearing. Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’ve lived a healthy life for seventy-three years. It’s definitely worth investigating something new like this. To get a better idea of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It'll involve me just taking a look at the area and checking for any visible issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a look? Well… I suppose so. If you have to. But be gentle, alright? It’s… sensitive. And I don’t want any poking and prodding. Just a quick look is fine. As long as it doesn't take long. I don't like doctors messing about down there.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and I’ll explain everything before I do it. We’ll just take a quick look, and I'll let you know what I see. I'll keep it brief, I promise. Okay, Jimmi, I’m going to gently examine the area. Please let me know immediately if you feel any discomfort. Okay, I’m finished with the quick look. I see what appears to be a… urethral prolapse. It looks like the lining of the urethra – the tube that carries urine from your bladder – has pushed outwards slightly. This can happen more commonly in men, but it can occur in women as well, especially with changes in anatomy over time. It explains the leaking and the odor.
PATIENT: Urethra? Prolapse? What in the world are you talking about? Is it serious? Do I need… surgery? I don’t want surgery! I'm too old for surgery. And what does "lining" even mean? You're using big words, Doctor. I don't understand any of this. Just tell me… is it going to kill me?
DOCTOR: Oh, Jimmi, no, it’s absolutely not going to kill you. I apologize for using those big words. Let me explain in simpler terms. Think of your urethra like a little tube that carries urine out of your body. Sometimes, that tube can weaken a bit, and the lining – the inner layer – can bulge outwards. That’s what’s happened here. It’s causing the leaking and the odor you've noticed. It’s not usually a life-threatening condition, but it can be uncomfortable and affect your quality of life. Surgery is one option, but it’s not always necessary. We have other things we can try first, like… pelvic floor exercises to strengthen the muscles around that area, or a pessary, which is a small device that can help support the urethra. Before we talk about any treatments, I'd like to do a quick urine test just to rule out any infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Urine test? Alright… I suppose so. If it gets this over with quicker. But I don’t want any poking and prodding, alright? And what’s a… pessary? Sounds… uncomfortable. I don’t want anything stuck inside me. I'm too old for things stuck inside. Just tell me… will it hurt? And how long will this all take? I have bingo tonight.
DOCTOR: No poking and prodding, I promise. The urine test is just a simple sample, you’ll just need to go to the restroom and collect a small amount in a cup. And a pessary is a small, soft, flexible device that's inserted into the vagina to help support the urethra. It's not usually painful, and many women find it quite comfortable once it’s in place. We can discuss it in more detail if you’re interested, and we certainly wouldn’t do anything you weren't comfortable with. It’s all about finding what works best for you. The urine test will only take a few minutes. Then, we can talk about your options and create a plan together. I’ll make sure we have plenty of time to answer all your questions before you go to bingo tonight. Would you like me to show you how to collect the urine sample?
PATIENT: Alright… show me the… cup. But make it quick. I don't want to be here all day. And I don’t want to catch a cold sitting on this paper. Just get it over with, alright? And don't expect me to understand any fancy words. Plain English, Doctor. Plain English.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jimmi. Plain English, I promise. Here’s a cup, and just collect a small amount of urine when you’re able. There are instructions on the lid, but don’t hesitate to ask if anything is unclear. I’ll be right here when you’re finished. And I’ll make sure everything is as comfortable and quick as possible. Take your time. .
