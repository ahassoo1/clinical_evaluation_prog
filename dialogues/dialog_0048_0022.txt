DOCTOR: Right. Soila McConnon, 90 years old. Yes. Well, Mrs. McConnon, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Sink, is it? Yes… my tummy. It feels… big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to. Everything just… sits. It's not pain, exactly. Just… full. And uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: "Big," you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Bigger than usual. I don’t know how long it’s been… a while, I think. Time… it goes so fast. I used to be… smaller, of course. Everything was smaller then. Not just me! The world… everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said it’s been going on for “a while.” Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… oh dear. That’s hard. Maybe… a month? Two months? It’s hard to say. I mostly just… notice it when I try to button my… well, my clothes. They feel tighter. I don’t remember when it started exactly, you see. Things… fade.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Oh. Well… not really. It's… regular, I suppose. Not different. Maybe a little… less? I don’t go as often. But not a big change. Is that what you mean? Is something wrong with my… bowels?
DOCTOR: Hmm. And have you noticed any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your appetite besides not wanting to eat as much?
PATIENT: No, no sickness. Not vomiting. Just… not hungry. I used to love to cook, you know? Big meals for everyone. Now… I just don’t feel like it. Even tea… sometimes. A little bread is nice. But not much. Everything feels… heavy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Oh… well, my clothes feel loose. But… I don’t know if I’ve lost weight. Maybe. It’s hard to tell. I haven't… stepped on a scale in a long time. I used to be very careful, but… things change, don’t they?
DOCTOR: Right. Let's do a quick physical exam, then. I need to listen to your abdomen and feel around a bit. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That’s… alright. Whatever you need. Just… be gentle, please? My tummy is… sensitive. I don't like being poked and prodded, but… if you need to, you need to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lie back for me, please. I'm going to listen to your tummy with this. Just breathe normally. Normal bowel sounds… a little diminished, but present. No bruits or murmurs detected. Soft… some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no guarding or rebound. No palpable masses. Slightly distended, but not significantly. Alright. And how long have you been taking any medications, if any?
PATIENT: Medications…? Oh dear. Let me think. Just a little… a little pill for my… my water. The doctor gave it to me a long time ago. For swelling. But I haven’t taken it in… a while. I forget. It's a small white pill. That's all I know. And… sometimes, a little something for my… my bones? But not every day. I have so many little bottles… I get them mixed up.
DOCTOR: And any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Oh, I don’t think so. I’ve never had… a bad reaction. Not that I remember. My mother always said I was strong. But… I don’t know. Maybe? I sometimes get a little… itchy, but that could be anything, couldn't it? The weather, or… something I ate. I don’t really pay attention. It’s been so long since anyone asked me about allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your age and symptoms, and the vague recollection of medications, I suspect this is likely related to constipation and possible fluid retention. I recommend increasing your fiber intake - more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. And drink plenty of water. We can also consider a mild stool softener if that doesn't improve things. I'm going to write you a prescription for docusate sodium. And I'd like you to follow up with me in a month to see if things have improved. If you experience any significant abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or fever, please come in sooner. Any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… fruits and vegetables. Yes, I remember those. My garden… I used to have a lovely garden. Docusate… sodium? Is that… a pill? Will it make me… better? I don’t want to take too many pills, Doctor. I forget them so easily. And… what if I feel worse? Should I call you then? A month… that seems a long time to wait. But… alright. If you think it's best.
DOCTOR: Yes, docusate sodium is a pill. It will help with the constipation. And if you experience any worsening symptoms, yes, call the office. Here’s a printout with instructions. Try to drink at least eight glasses of water a day, and increase your fiber gradually to avoid discomfort. Next patient, please. .
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. Eight glasses of water. I'll try. Thank you for… seeing me.
