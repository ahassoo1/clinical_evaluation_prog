DOCTOR: Good morning, Claudene. I'm Dr. TodoroVICH. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh, um… it’s my water. It… bothers me. A lot. It keeps happening, and it’s… unpleasant. I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it’s been a while. I just want it fixed, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Okay. "Bothers you" and "unpleasant" are a bit vague, Claudene. Can you be more specific about what's happening with your water?
PATIENT: Specific… oh dear. Well, I have to… go to the little girls’ room very often. And it… burns. It burns when I go. And sometimes… sometimes it feels like it doesn’t all come out, if you understand. I don't… I don't really know how to explain it better, Doctor. Is this… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene. Frequent urination and burning… and the feeling of incomplete emptying. That could be a number of things. We'll need to figure out what's going on. First, I’m going to ask you a few more questions. Then, I'll need to do a quick physical exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Physical exam… I suppose so. As long as it’s… quick. I have things to do this afternoon, you see. And… honestly, I don’t like doctors very much. No offense, of course. But the quicker, the better. Are you going to ask me about… everything?
DOCTOR: I'll try to be as efficient as possible, Claudene. But to get to the bottom of this, I do need some information. I’ll ask about your medical history, any medications you’re taking, and other things that could be relevant. It’s standard procedure. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a lot to remember. Let me think… I had… the flu, once. A very bad flu. And… my gallbladder, I think? They took it out, a long time ago. But other than that… no, not that I recall. I don’t go to doctors often, you see. It's expensive and… well, it doesn’t usually help. Does that sound like enough? I'm not very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a bout of the flu. Good to know. And you haven’t been diagnosed with anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing else that I can recall. I… honestly, I mostly just take a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up. It’s… over the counter. I don’t remember the name, but you can get it at the drugstore. It helps a little. I don't think that has anything to do with my… water problem, though, does it?
DOCTOR: It’s possible, Claudene, though less likely. What about family history?
PATIENT: Family history…? Oh, goodness. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my brother… he had problems with his heart, later in life. But other than that… not that I know of. We weren't very close, you see. My family isn’t very good at talking about… health things. Is this… important? Do I need to remember everything about my cousins? I didn't even like most of them.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know if there’s a family history of kidney problems, diabetes, or bladder issues, Claudene. But don't worry about listing every single cousin. Just general health concerns of your parents, siblings, and children, if you have any. We can move on if it’s too difficult to recall. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies that I know of. I eat… mostly everything. Though I don’t like olives. And sometimes spicy food gives me heartburn. But that’s not an allergy, is it? And… no, I didn’t have any children. Never got married, either. Just me, mostly. Is that enough? It’s a little… personal, you see. I don’t usually talk about this with people.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never have. Makes me cough just thinking about it. My mother smoked, you know. Dreadful habit. I always told her it would kill her, and… well, it eventually did. No, Doctor, I do not smoke. And I don’t drink much either. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. Is this… important? Is this about the drinking and smoking? Because I really don’t do much of either.
DOCTOR: It's just standard information, Claudene. Now, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen, check your reflexes, and I’ll need a urine sample. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A urine sample… oh, that’s… awkward. But alright, I suppose. As long as it’s quick, Doctor. And… are you going to ask me about… everything? Because I really don’t like… that part. And please be gentle, alright? I’m not as young as I used to be, you know. Where do I… go to do the sample?
DOCTOR: There’s a bathroom just over there. I’ll give you a sterile cup. Just collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a sample mid-way through. I’ll leave you to it. I'll be right outside when you are finished. And no, I won’t ask you about “everything”, Claudene. Just what’s relevant to your symptoms. Take your time.
PATIENT: Alright. A sterile cup… mid-stream… I think I remember. It’s… embarrassing, you know. But I suppose it has to be done. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll… be as quick as I can.
