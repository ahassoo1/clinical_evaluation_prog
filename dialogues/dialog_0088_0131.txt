DOCTOR: Good morning, Mykeisha. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Piet! Well, it's my blood pressure. It's been a bit high lately, and my sister told me I really should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good of your sister to encourage you to come in. High blood pressure is something we definitely want to keep an eye on. So, it's been high lately… can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I guess it started maybe… three months ago? I haven't been feeling bad bad, just a little more tired than usual, and sometimes I get a headache at the back of my neck. Nothing too awful, but it's enough to notice.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months ago, tiredness and headaches at the back of the neck. Do you happen to know what your blood pressure readings were, if you've had it checked anywhere – at a pharmacy, perhaps?
PATIENT: You know what? I did get it checked at the pharmacy down the street, maybe a month ago. The machine printed out a little ticket… hold on a sec. Ah, here it is! It says… 142 over 90, I think. Something like that. I’m terrible with numbers, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, 142 over 90. That is a bit elevated. And you said you’ve been feeling more tired than usual, and having headaches. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm... now that you mention it, yeah. My vision gets a little blurry sometimes, especially when I'm looking at the computer screen at work. And my ankles have been a bit swollen at the end of the day. But I thought that was just from being on my feet so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision and ankle swelling. That’s good information. Do you have any family history of high blood pressure, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh yeah, definitely. My mom had high blood pressure for years, and she ended up having a stroke a few years back. My grandfather on my dad's side, he had heart trouble. So, it runs in the family, for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s important to know. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I don't take any medication regularly either, unless you count a pain reliever for a headache now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a personal care aide, so I'm on my feet a lot, helping people with their daily routines. It's a busy job. I try to eat healthy – lots of fruits and vegetables – but sometimes it's hard when I'm rushing around. I don't really exercise regularly, I wish I did, but I'm usually too tired after work. I do enjoy a good glass of wine with dinner sometimes though!
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take a look at your eyes. Then I'll check your ankles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Dr. Piet. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Alright, your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. Nothing alarming at this point, but we'll keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. Pulse is a bit elevated at 82. I do see some mild swelling in the back of your eyes, which can be a sign of high blood pressure. And, as you mentioned, some slight swelling in your ankles. I’m going to note all of this.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds like a lot. Is it… bad? I mean, is it something I should be really worried about?
DOCTOR: It’s good that we're checking things out now. It is something we need to take seriously, but it’s also very manageable with the right approach. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it seems likely you have hypertension – high blood pressure. The swelling in your eyes and ankles, along with your family history and symptoms, all point in that direction. However, to be certain and to rule out any other potential causes, I'd like to order some blood tests and a urine test. These will check your kidney function and look for any other abnormalities. Also, I want you to wear a blood pressure cuff for 24 hours to get a better understanding of your blood pressure throughout the day and night. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough, which is good. I’d rather know everything, you know? Blood tests and the cuff… okay, I can do that. Will you explain how to use the cuff? I’m not very good with technology.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It’s a very simple device. You’ll wear this cuff on your upper arm, like this. It’s connected to a small monitor that you wear on your wrist or belt. It automatically takes your blood pressure readings every 30 minutes. You just need to make sure the cuff is snug but not too tight, and you continue your normal daily activities. The monitor records all the readings, and we’ll review them when you come back. I’ll have the nurse go over the instructions with you in detail before you leave. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a low dose of a medication called lisinopril. It's an ACE inhibitor, commonly used to treat high blood pressure. It has minimal side effects in most patients, but it's important to let me know if you experience anything unusual, like dizziness or a persistent cough. We’ll start with this low dose and see how you respond. Also, I want you to start reducing your salt intake and aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week, if possible.
PATIENT: Okay. Lisopril… salt and exercise. I can try. It’s just… it’s hard with my job. But I will try. So, the blood tests, the cuff, the medication… and less salt. Is there anything else? I feel like my brain is a little overwhelmed right now.
DOCTOR: It does sound like a lot at once, and it’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. We’ll take it one step at a time. I'll also give you a handout with more information about hypertension, including dietary recommendations and exercise tips. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review your blood test results and check your blood pressure. We can adjust your medication if needed. And please, don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. I’m also going to send a work note to your employer explaining that you’ve been diagnosed with hypertension and may need to take short breaks throughout the day. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… that would be really helpful, actually. My job can be pretty demanding. Thank you. So, two weeks… and call if I have questions. Okay. I think… I think I’ve got it. Thank you, Dr. Piet. I feel a little better just having a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mykeisha. I’m glad we were able to get a plan started. Remember, we're a team, and we’ll work through this together. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the instructions for the blood pressure cuff and to schedule your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.
