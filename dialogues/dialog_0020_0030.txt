DOCTOR: Good morning, Kerriann. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Beinborn. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you as well. Um, well, it’s a bit awkward to talk about, honestly. I’ve noticed a change in… how I smell, I guess. My body odor. It’s just… different than usual.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It can be concerning when you notice a change like that. “Different” is helpful – can you describe what’s different about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s not worse, exactly. It’s just… sweeter, maybe? And… I don't know… almost fruity? It’s definitely not how I usually smell after a day of work. I lay floors, you know? It's usually just… work smell. A little sweaty, a little dusty. Not peaches.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sweeter, fruity odor…and it's a recent change, compared to your usual smell after working. And you’ve noticed this despite the physical activity of your job. That's good information. Just to clarify, has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really. My divorce was finalized about six months ago, which was stressful, but that’s settled now. I haven't changed my soap or deodorant, and I haven’t started taking any new medications. I did try a new brand of lotion a couple of weeks ago, a mango one, but I stopped using it when I thought it might be the cause of the smell. It didn't seem to help when I stopped.
DOCTOR: Okay, no new medications, recent changes to hygiene products other than the lotion you've already discontinued...and you’ve been using the same soap and deodorant. The divorce was six months ago – while stress can sometimes contribute to body odor changes, it sounds like you’ve been stable since the finalization. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little about when you first noticed this change in smell?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think it was… maybe a month ago? It started gradually, so it’s hard to pinpoint an exact date. I remember noticing it when I was unloading some plywood after a job. My ex-husband always said I smelled “like hard work,” which wasn’t romantic, but he wasn’t wrong. And this… wasn’t that. It was… different, like I said. I thought maybe it was just me being more sensitive to something, but it’s still happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, about a month ago, gradually noticed a change after physical activity. We're trying to narrow things down. Have you noticed any other changes with your body recently?
PATIENT: Let me see… not really. My appetite’s been normal. I haven’t lost or gained any weight. My periods are regular, as regular as they ever are, anyway. I haven’t had any new rashes or bumps. I did have a little bit of night sweats for a few nights, but that was just when the weather got really hot, and I was using a heavier quilt. Honestly, I think that was just the quilt. I haven't been feeling sick, no fever or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in weight, appetite, menstruation, no rashes… occasional night sweats related to the weather. That's all helpful. Just to be thorough, have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… no, not really. Everything seems normal there, if you don’t mind me saying. Normal color, normal… everything. I know, it’s a bit personal, but you asked!
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It’s important information, and I appreciate you being so open. It helps me get a complete picture. Alright. So, we have a recent change in body odor, described as sweeter or fruity, no associated changes in weight, appetite, menstruation, urine, or stool, and no new medications. It doesn't seem to be related to stress or recent hygiene products. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. It'll mostly involve listening to your heart and lungs, and a general assessment. It might also be helpful to take your blood pressure and temperature. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. That makes sense. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I'm a bit worried, if I’m honest, but I trust your judgment. Listening and checking things sounds good.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Let’s start with your vital signs – I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Your blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit – all within the normal range. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles. Everything sounds good so far. I don’t detect any immediate concerns with your heart or lungs. Now, I’m going to just briefly check your thyroid gland. It’s located in the front of your neck. Just relax your neck muscles.
PATIENT: Okay, good. That’s reassuring. My mother always worried about my thyroid, so I’m glad to hear that’s okay too, if you can tell anything just by listening. I try to relax my neck muscles as she speaks.
DOCTOR: Your thyroid feels normal in size and consistency. No nodules or masses are detected. It doesn’t appear to be enlarged or inflamed. Based on the information you've provided and the physical exam, the change in body odor is a bit puzzling. While it could be benign, a subtle change in metabolism could be a factor. I want to order some routine blood work to rule out anything obvious. We'll check your blood sugar, complete blood count, thyroid function, and a comprehensive metabolic panel. It will help us get a clearer picture. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible. I appreciate you taking this seriously, even if it seems a bit silly. Blood work sounds good. I'm happy to do whatever it takes to figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all. It's important to investigate changes in your body. I’m glad you brought it to my attention. I'll have the lab draw the blood now. After the results come back, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. It usually takes about three to five business days for the results to come back. In the meantime, if you notice any new symptoms – such as unexplained weight loss, fatigue, increased thirst, or frequent urination – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Three to five business days… that’s good. And I will definitely contact you if anything else changes. Thank you so much for listening and taking the time to investigate this. I feel a lot better just knowing we’re looking into it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Kerriann. I’m glad I could help. Just remember, it’s always best to err on the side of caution. The lab is just down the hall; the technician is expecting you. We’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again, Dr. Beinborn. You too!
