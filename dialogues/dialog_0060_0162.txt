DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, I’m not really one for talking about…this stuff. It’s just…bloating, alright? Been happening for a while now. Feels like I’m gonna burst sometimes. Honestly, I just want to figure out what’s causing it and get rid of it. I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Alright, “bloating.” I understand you’d like to get to the bottom of this quickly. It is frustrating when something like that interferes with your life. Can you tell me a little more about when it started?
PATIENT: Honestly? Vaguely remember it starting… sometime last year, maybe? After… things. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be frank. Not really something I paid much attention to at first, you know? Just thought it was stress. It’s gotten worse recently, that's for sure. Don't really keep track of dates, Doc. Never have. Does that help?
DOCTOR: No, that's alright. “Recently” is enough to start with. And it’s common to dismiss things initially. When you say “things,” are you referring to a particularly stressful event or period in your life?
PATIENT: Look, I lost my wife. Okay? It was… last year. That's the “things” I was talking about. Don't really want to dwell on it. It’s just… life. And now this bloating. Feels like it all just keeps piling on, you know? It's probably just… something I ate. Or stress. I don't know. Look, is there a test you can just do to figure it out? I really don’t have the patience for a long process.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. Losing your wife is… a significant event, and it’s perfectly understandable that you’d want to focus on finding a solution quickly. We can run tests, but to make sure we order the right ones, I need to ask a few more questions. It’s not about dwelling, it's about ruling things out. So, this bloating… where exactly do you feel it?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. It’s… all over. Mostly my stomach, I guess. Like it’s full of air. Sometimes it feels like it’s pushing on my chest, makes it hard to breathe. And it's not just after eating, it happens randomly. I don't really change my diet much, eat what I always have. It’s just… uncomfortable, alright? And embarrassing. I don't need a lecture about fiber, Doc. I work a physical job, I eat enough. Pile driving isn’t exactly a sedentary lifestyle.
DOCTOR: No, no lectures about fiber, Mr. Kristofik. I appreciate you telling me it’s not related to diet. And pile driving is certainly a physical job – thank you for clarifying. The fact that it’s not consistently after eating, and that it affects your breathing… that's important. Do you experience any other symptoms along with the bloating?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… sometimes I feel tired. A lot. Thought it was just from work, you know? Long days, physical labor. And… occasionally, I guess, a little heartburn. Not bad, just… there. Nothing major. I don’t really pay much attention to stuff like that. Honestly, I just want this… fullness to go away. It's distracting when I’m on the job. Safety hazard, even.
DOCTOR: Alright, tiredness and occasional heartburn. Those are helpful pieces of the puzzle. And you're right to be concerned about it being a safety hazard. I want to rule out a few things. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Seriously? You’re asking about… that now? Look, I’m a grown man, Doc. I don’t need to detail my bathroom habits. It’s… normal. Generally. Sometimes a little… off. But what is normal, right? I don’t keep a log or anything. It's just… stuff happens. Can we just skip this part? It’s really not relevant. I’m telling you, it’s just bloating! Is there a pill or something? Just give me something to make it stop.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration, but unfortunately, changes in bowel habits can be relevant. It helps me determine the cause of the bloating, and the correct course of action. I'm not trying to pry unnecessarily. Are you experiencing diarrhea, constipation, or have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Look, this is ridiculous. Fine! Sometimes it's loose. Sometimes it’s… not. It varies. And no, I haven’t seen any… blood. I would remember that, alright? Honestly, I'm wasting my time here. I work with heavy machinery all day, I don’t have time for this. Just give me something for the bloating. Anything. And let me get back to work. I’m starting to feel… agitated. This is making things worse, Doc. Seriously. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I hear you are very frustrated, and I apologize if my questions are making things worse. I want to help, but I also need information to do so safely. Given your history and the description of your symptoms—the bloating, fatigue, heartburn, and variable bowel habits—and your recent loss, I want to run a few tests to rule out several possibilities. It could be something simple, but we need to investigate. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool test to check for inflammation and infection. I also want to get a C-reactive protein level checked, which is a marker for inflammation in the body. I’m also going to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your organs. It’s non-invasive, and we can usually get it scheduled quickly. Do you have any allergies to medications?
