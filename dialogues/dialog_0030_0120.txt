DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't really have time for a lot of chatting, okay? I just… I want to get pregnant. And I want it to be easy. My husband… well, he was a good man, but we always had trouble, and I don’t want a repeat of that. Is that what you need to know? Just… no problems, please.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Villarreal. It’s perfectly reasonable to want a straightforward path to pregnancy, especially given past difficulties. We'll certainly do our best to make that happen. To start, let’s gather some information to get a clearer picture of your situation. Could you tell me a little bit about your menstrual cycles?
PATIENT: Cycles? Honestly, I… I don’t really keep track of those things. They come and go. Regular-ish, I guess? Look, I'm 43. Things aren’t exactly… precise anymore, alright? Is that helpful? I just want to know if there’s something wrong with me that’s going to make this hard. That’s what I need to know.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Villarreal. Many people don’t routinely track their cycles, and it’s common for them to become less predictable with age. We can certainly work with that. To help me understand what's going on, could you give me a rough estimate of how often you typically experience a period?
PATIENT: Ugh, see, this is why I don't like doctors. All these questions! Okay, fine. Roughly… every month? Sometimes a little longer, sometimes a little shorter. It varies. I told you, it’s not regular. Honestly, I haven’t paid much attention since… well, you know. Is that good enough? I just want to know if I need… tests or something. And how much they're going to cost. My insurance is private, but still… it adds up.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Villarreal, that’s helpful. And I understand your concern about costs, we can certainly look into what your insurance covers. To get a better understanding, and to rule out any potential issues, I would like to order some routine bloodwork. This will help assess your hormone levels and overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Bloodwork… fine, whatever. As long as it doesn't take forever. And as long as it's covered. Honestly, I don't need a lecture about my age or anything. I just want a baby. Can we just… get it done? And tell me when I can expect results. I have things to do, you know. This is taking up my whole morning already.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Villarreal. We’ll keep things as efficient as possible. I assure you, I won’t lecture you about your age. My goal is to help you achieve your goal of having a baby, and we’ll focus on that. The bloodwork will take just a few minutes. We’ll send the sample to the lab, and the results typically come back within 3 to 5 business days. While we wait for the results, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… honestly? It’s… boring. I've always been pretty healthy. Had the usual childhood things, but nothing major. I had a… a difficult pregnancy with my son, but that was a long time ago. I don’t remember specifics. Look, I had him, he's fine, and I haven't really been to a doctor much since then. No chronic conditions, no surgeries… I think. Does that help? Honestly, I just want this to be quick and easy, like I said. Is there a form I can fill out instead of talking about this all day?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Villarreal, a form would be helpful. Here you go. It covers most of the information we need. Feel free to take your time and answer as thoroughly as you're comfortable. While you’re filling that out, I’ll just quickly document some basic information – your height and weight, for example. We have you at 164 cm and 130 lbs, is that correct?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Yes, that's right. Look, can we please just get this over with? I have a lunch appointment. And don't look at me like that. I’m perfectly capable of taking care of myself. Just… let me fill out the form. And then tell me what the next step is. Tests, I assume. Just tell me when and where. And how much it’s going to cost. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Villarreal. I understand your time is valuable. Once you've completed that, we can discuss the next steps. As we discussed, we'll start with some bloodwork. After we review those results, we can determine if any further testing is necessary. We’ll also check your insurance coverage to provide an estimated cost. Is there anything I can get for you while you complete the form?
