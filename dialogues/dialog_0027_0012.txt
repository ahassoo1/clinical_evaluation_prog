DOCTOR: Good morning, Velda. I'm Dr. Fazzina. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. I'm here about a cruise, actually. I'm planning a trip and they require some medical information before I can go. It's a bit of a formality, I suppose, but a necessary one. I’ve not been to a doctor in quite some time, to be truthful.
DOCTOR: Alright, a pre-cruise physical. Perfectly understandable. It's good you're getting it checked out. And no worries about not having been in for a while; we'll just get a good baseline. To start, could you tell me a little about any health concerns you do have?
PATIENT: Well, to be honest, I don't have any major concerns. I feel quite fit for my age, I think. I do get a bit of stiffness in my joints sometimes, especially in the mornings, but that’s probably just getting older, isn't it? And I wear glasses for reading, naturally. Other than that… hmm. Let me think. I had a bout of the flu a couple of years ago, a nasty one, but I recovered fully. My late husband, bless his soul, he had a weak heart, but that’s not something I inherited, the doctors assured me. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, thank you. Joint stiffness… and the flu a couple of years ago. Good to know about your husband’s history, too. Just to clarify, this joint stiffness... where specifically are you feeling it, and how would you describe the discomfort?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my knees and hips, Doctor. And my fingers, actually. Not all the time, but particularly in the mornings, like I said. It’s not a sharp pain, you understand. More of an ache, and a bit of… resistance, I suppose. Makes getting up and moving about a little slow, that’s all. It usually eases up after I’ve been active for a while, after I’ve had a good walk or been doing things around the house. It's not debilitating, not at all. Just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Alright, knees, hips, and fingers, more of an ache and stiffness that improves with activity. That's good information. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in those joints?
PATIENT: No, no swelling or redness, Doctor. Nothing like that at all. They don't look different, if you understand. It's just how they feel. And it comes and goes, you know? Some mornings it's worse than others. I haven’t taken anything for it, really. Just try to keep moving and stay active. A bit of oil of cloves sometimes, my mother always swore by it. But nothing regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no visible swelling, just the ache and stiffness. And you've tried oil of cloves. That's good to know. Have you experienced any fatigue, fever, or any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, no fatigue or fever, Doctor. And my weight hasn't changed a bit, thankfully. I enjoy my food, you see, and I’ve managed to keep it steady. I weigh myself every week, just to keep an eye on things. About the same for the last year, give or take a pound or two. I eat a fairly balanced diet, I believe. Lots of vegetables, some fish… I do enjoy a biscuit with my tea, of course, but everything in moderation, I always say.
DOCTOR: That's good. A stable weight and a generally balanced diet are both helpful things. Now, have you had any surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… The only surgery I ever had was my tonsils removed when I was a child, many, many years ago. Nothing since then, thankfully. And as for serious illnesses… I had pneumonia once, when I was in my twenties, but I recovered fully. Other than that, just the usual colds and flu, nothing major. I’ve always been fairly robust, I think. My late husband wasn't so lucky, but I seem to have inherited my mother’s constitution, thankfully. A strong constitution, she always said.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy as a child, pneumonia in your twenties… good. And you mentioned your husband's heart condition. Was there a family history of heart problems on his side?
PATIENT: Yes, there was. His father and several of his uncles all had heart trouble, Doctor. It ran in his family, I believe. He was very careful about his diet and exercise, but it was something he was always worried about, poor man. He went to the doctor regularly, of course, but it was unavoidable in the end. It wasn’t sudden, thankfully, but it was a long, slow decline. A very sad time. It's not something I worry about inheriting, the doctors reassured me there was no genetic link. But it's always in the back of your mind, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Right, a family history of heart conditions on your husband’s side. And you were told there’s no genetic link for you. Good to know. Now, just one more question about your medical history before we move on to your current medications and allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat all sorts of things, and I’ve taken plenty of medications over the years – pain relievers, antibiotics when I’ve been ill – and never had any trouble. I’ve not knowingly got any allergies at all. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. Perhaps that's why I’ve always been so robust! I don't even react to mosquito bites much, if you can believe it. A little itch, that’s all.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. No known allergies. Alright, let's talk about any medications you're currently taking. Do you take anything regularly, even over-the-counter medications or vitamins?
PATIENT: No, not regularly, Doctor. I try to avoid taking medication if I can help it. I might take a paracetamol if I’ve got a headache, or a throat lozenge if I’ve got a cold, but that’s about it. I don’t take any vitamins or supplements, nothing like that at all. I believe in eating a healthy diet and getting plenty of fresh air, that's what keeps me going. I used to take a calcium supplement a few years ago, but the doctor said it wasn’t necessary, so I stopped. That’s all, really. Nothing regular at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. And you stopped the calcium supplement. Alright. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, is there anything else at all you'd like to mention?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, just one thing, if you don’t mind. I get a bit breathless sometimes, if I’ve been doing a lot of walking, especially uphill. It’s not a major problem, and it usually eases off if I stop and rest for a few minutes. I put it down to my age, mostly. And I do enjoy a good walk, so I suppose I push myself a little bit. It's not something I've ever bothered the doctor about, it's just… a bit of breathlessness. Nothing serious, I’m sure. But I thought I should mention it, just in case.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathlessness with exertion, especially uphill. Good to know. We should definitely take a listen to your chest and check your oxygen levels. Now, if you'll just follow me over to the examination table, we’ll do a quick physical exam. It won't take long. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Lead the way. I’m ready when you are. I’ve not had a proper check-up in quite some time, so I’m happy to let you have a good look. I’m not usually one for fuss, but I understand it’s important to be thorough, especially before a trip. Thank you for being so attentive.
DOCTOR: Of course. It's my job. I just want to get a good baseline before your cruise. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but otherwise sounds regular. No murmurs or abnormal sounds detected. Your lungs are clear, but I do notice your breathing is a little faster than normal. Now, let's check your blood pressure and temperature. Blood pressure is slightly elevated at 140/90. Temperature is normal at 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit.
PATIENT: Right, thank you, Doctor. That doesn’t sound too bad, does it? I do get a bit flustered sometimes, perhaps that’s why my heart is racing a little. And it's been a warm day, hasn't it? I do feel a bit warm myself. I hope that’s not affecting the readings. Everything else sounds alright, doesn’t it? I’m grateful for you taking such good care.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your heart rate is slightly fast. It's possible the heat and some anxiety are contributing factors. However, we should keep an eye on it. Now, I'm just going to quickly check your reflexes and look in your ears, nose and throat. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Lymph nodes are normal, no swelling or tenderness.
PATIENT: Right, that all sounds reassuring, doesn't it? Thank you for being so thorough, Doctor. I appreciate you taking your time. I do feel a bit relieved, if I’m honest. Everything seems to be working as it should, more or less. Is there anything else you need to check? Perhaps my knees? They are a bit stiff, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, let's have a look at your knees. There’s a slight crepitus in both knees when you bend them, which is common with age. No significant swelling or tenderness to the touch. Range of motion is a little limited, but not significantly. Your gait appears normal, but you do seem to favour your left knee slightly. Overall, your knees appear to be suffering from mild osteoarthritis, which is a common condition, particularly as we get older. It's likely contributing to the stiffness you're experiencing.
PATIENT: Oh, I see. Osteoarthritis, is it? That explains a lot, doesn't it? My mother had something similar, I believe. She used to rub oil of cloves on them, like I said. Is there anything I can do about it? Some exercises, perhaps? I don’t want it to get any worse, especially not before my cruise. I’d like to be able to enjoy all the walking and sightseeing. I'm not one for taking a lot of medication, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Yes, osteoarthritis is very common. And you're right, oil of cloves can provide some temporary relief. We can certainly manage this without medication, at least initially. The best approach is a combination of gentle exercise, weight management if applicable – and you seem to be at a healthy weight, which is good – and maintaining a good level of activity. Simple exercises like walking, swimming, and cycling are excellent for strengthening the muscles around your knees and improving your range of motion. I can give you a handout with some specific exercises. It’s also important to avoid activities that put excessive stress on your knees. Given your breathlessness and slightly elevated blood pressure, I would recommend you consult with a cardiologist for a full evaluation before your cruise. It’s just to be on the safe side, and ensure your heart is in good condition for travel. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Doctor. A cardiologist, is it? I don't mind at all. Better to be safe than sorry, as they say. And exercises, yes, I can definitely manage that. Walking and swimming, I enjoy both of those. I'll be sure to ask for the handout. Is there anything else I should be aware of? Any dietary recommendations, perhaps? Or anything I should avoid? I’m grateful for all your advice, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. I feel much more confident about my cruise now.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. I'm glad I could help. Diet-wise, a healthy, balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and lean protein is important. Maintaining a healthy weight is also beneficial, which, as I said, you seem to be doing already. Avoiding processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive salt is always a good idea. Given your breathlessness, I would recommend avoiding strenuous activity until you've been evaluated by the cardiologist. Here’s a handout with some exercises and information about managing osteoarthritis. It also has some contact information for local cardiologists. I’ll also write a referral note for you. To summarise, we’ve discussed mild osteoarthritis in your knees, which we can manage with exercise and diet. However, due to your breathlessness and slightly elevated blood pressure, I strongly recommend a full evaluation by a cardiologist before your cruise. Do you have any questions for me at all before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and you’ve answered all my questions. The handout is very helpful, and I'll be sure to make an appointment with a cardiologist as soon as possible. I'm grateful for your time and your advice. You’ve put my mind at ease, and I’m feeling much more confident about my trip now. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll leave the referral note and handout with the receptionist on my way out. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Velda. And you have a wonderful cruise. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns or questions before your trip. Take care, and enjoy yourself.
PATIENT:
