DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Honestly, it’s a bit…difficult to explain precisely. I understand you can help with…planning for the future, in case something were to happen? I believe it has something to do with a form…an Advance Directive, or perhaps a POLST form? I was advised to inquire about these. My memory… isn’t what it once was, so I don't recall the specifics.
DOCTOR: Right, I see. Planning ahead, making sure your wishes are known… that's very responsible of you. And don't worry about the specifics, that’s what I'm here for. It sounds like you’re thinking about an Advance Directive and possibly a POLST form. An Advance Directive covers a range of future medical decisions, and a POLST— Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment—is a bit more specific, detailing what you would want right now if you were seriously ill and unable to speak for yourself. Before we dive into those forms, though, could you tell me a little bit more about why you're thinking about these now?
PATIENT: It's… complicated. There hasn't been a specific event, not exactly. It’s more a feeling… a sense that I should have this sorted. My divorce was… difficult. And it left me realizing… well, that no one truly knows what I would want if I couldn't tell them. My ex-husband… we weren’t close, and my family… they are all back in Mongolia. Communication is… challenging, to say the least. I just want to be prepared. And ensure my wishes are respected, should the need arise. I apologize for being vague. It's frustrating, this lack of clarity.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary at all, Ms. Buoniconti. It's perfectly understandable to feel this way. A difficult divorce, distance from family… those things can certainly bring about these thoughts. It’s very proactive of you to consider this now, and it’s quite common for people to want to ensure their wishes are known, especially when there isn’t someone readily available to make decisions. Let’s start with a little bit of your medical history, if you’re comfortable with that. Just to get a better overall picture. Have you been seeing any other doctors regularly?
PATIENT: Of course. That makes sense. I…I do see a specialist for my… etching. It’s a very delicate work, and sometimes my hands…they get quite strained. Dr. Anya Petrova, she’s excellent. She focuses on preventative care for artists, mostly repetitive stress injuries. Beyond that… nothing regularly. I was quite healthy, until the divorce, I suppose. It took a toll, emotionally and physically. I had a…a rather severe bout of the flu last winter, but that was a one-time occurrence. No hospital stay, thankfully. I do have private insurance, if that's relevant.
DOCTOR: Good, that's helpful. And yes, your insurance is relevant, so thank you for mentioning that. It sounds like Dr. Petrova is doing a good job keeping you going – that's excellent. Repetitive stress injuries can be tricky. Now, just to get a more complete picture, have you had any major surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. No… no major surgeries, I don’t believe so. When I was a child, I had my tonsils removed, but that was… decades ago. And… I had a wisdom tooth pulled, but that hardly qualifies as surgery, does it? Nothing significant. I’ve always been…fortunate, in that regard. I tend to avoid hospitals whenever possible. The smell…it’s quite unpleasant. I apologize for rambling. This isn’t a very organized recollection.
DOCTOR: No, not at all! You're doing perfectly fine. Tonsils removed as a child… that’s good to know. And your aversion to hospitals is perfectly understandable; many people feel the same way. Now, regarding your family history… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that's… difficult. My parents… they both passed away several years ago. My mother… she had heart problems. It was quite sudden. My father… he had diabetes, I believe. But communication was always… strained. It was hard to get details, even when they were alive. And my grandparents… I barely knew them. There wasn’t much discussion of medical history, truthfully. It wasn't… a priority. We were more focused on… survival, I suppose. I apologize. I’m not very helpful with this, am I?
DOCTOR: No, you're not being unhelpful at all. It sounds like you’ve had a challenging family situation, and it’s perfectly understandable that the medical history isn't clear. It’s not your responsibility to have all that information. Knowing your mother had heart problems and your father had diabetes is a good starting point. Now, just a few more questions, and then we can perhaps move towards discussing these Advance Directives and POLST forms. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Thank you. Allergies… no, not that I’m aware of. I eat… mostly bland foods, to be honest. I avoid anything too spicy. It doesn't agree with my stomach. And I haven't had any reactions to medications in the past. I rarely take anything, unless absolutely necessary. Perhaps a pain reliever for a headache, occasionally. I’m generally quite… resilient. Or, I was. Before the divorce. It's strange, how something emotional can affect the physical body.
DOCTOR: You’re right; it’s very common for emotional stress to manifest physically. And it's good to know you don’t have any known allergies. One final question before we move on to discussing your wishes. Are you currently taking any medications at all – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I truly don't take anything. I prefer to avoid it, if possible. I believe in… natural remedies, to a certain extent. A cup of chamomile tea for sleep, perhaps. But nothing regularly. I’ve always been… very cautious about putting anything into my body. I understand the need for them, of course. But I haven’t required anything, until recently. And even then… it was just a mild headache, occasionally. I apologize for rambling again. I seem to be doing a lot of that today.
DOCTOR: No, please, don’t apologize at all. It’s helpful for me to get a complete picture, and I appreciate you taking the time to share this with me. So, to recap: you have no known allergies, you aren’t currently taking any medications, you have a history of a tonsillectomy as a child, and your family history is somewhat limited due to communication challenges. Your mother had heart problems, and your father had diabetes. You’ve had no major surgeries and see a specialist for repetitive stress injuries related to your etching. Now, let's talk about what brought you in today – planning for the future and ensuring your wishes are respected. Are you familiar with the difference between an Advance Directive and a POLST form?
PATIENT: I believe I was told… vaguely. Something about the Advance Directive being… broader. More general. Covering a wider range of possibilities. And the POLST form being… more immediate? Specific instructions for when…well, when I’m unable to communicate. Honestly, the details are… rather blurry. I remember being advised to consider both, but the specifics escaped me. It’s all quite overwhelming, truthfully. Perhaps you could explain it in simpler terms? I’m trying to understand, but my memory… it's proving to be a significant obstacle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. You're right, the details can be overwhelming, and it's perfectly normal to feel that way. And your memory is no obstacle at all; that's what I'm here for. Think of an Advance Directive as a set of instructions for your healthcare team, outlining your values and wishes in general. It covers things like what kind of medical treatments you would or wouldn't want if you were seriously ill, or what happens if you were in a coma. It's a broad document. A POLST form, on the other hand, is much more specific. It's a medical order that outlines your wishes for life-sustaining treatments right now, if you are unable to speak for yourself. It's usually completed when someone has a serious illness or frailty, and it’s a direct instruction to the medical team. Think of it as a doctor's order. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: A doctor’s order… so, the POLST form is more… actionable? Immediate? The Advance Directive is more about… outlining my preferences, generally. What I would want, under most circumstances. And the POLST form is what I wouldn't want, if I were… incapacitated. I think… I think I’m starting to understand. It’s still a bit confusing, but I believe I’m grasping the basic concept. Is it common to have both? Or do people usually choose one or the other? And… would I need a lawyer to complete these forms?
DOCTOR: Exactly! You’ve got it. An Advance Directive outlines your general preferences, and a POLST form is a specific medical order. It is common to have both, actually. An Advance Directive can help guide the completion of a POLST form, but they serve different purposes. The POLST form is for immediate use in a crisis, and the Advance Directive provides broader guidance. And no, you don't necessarily need a lawyer to complete these forms. Many states have standard forms that you can fill out yourself, or we can go through them together here in the office. However, if you have complex wishes or concerns, consulting with a lawyer who specializes in estate planning can be helpful. Would you like me to show you a sample Advance Directive form and a POLST form, so you can get a better feel for what they involve?
PATIENT: That would be… incredibly helpful, actually. Seeing them… visually, I suppose, would make it much easier to understand. And knowing that I don’t necessarily need a lawyer is a relief. I was rather worried about the cost, and the added complexity. Yes, please. A sample of each form would be wonderful. And perhaps you could explain each section as we go through it? I apologize for being such a…trouble. It's just… it's all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Not a trouble at all, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s my job to help you through this, and I’m happy to take the time. These forms can be overwhelming, so it’s perfectly normal to feel that way. Here are some sample forms. This is the Advance Directive, and this is the POLST form. Let's start with the Advance Directive. As you can see, the first section is about appointing a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make medical decisions for you if you are unable to. Do you have someone in mind for that role?
PATIENT: A healthcare proxy… someone I trust. That’s…difficult. I don’t have many close relationships, truthfully. My family is… distant. And my ex-husband… well, that wouldn’t be a suitable choice. I haven't really considered this, to be honest. I suppose I could ask Dr. Petrova… she’s been very supportive. But… would it be appropriate to ask a doctor? It feels…presumptuous, to ask someone to take on such a responsibility.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly valid concern, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s not uncommon to struggle with choosing a healthcare proxy, and it's not unusual to feel hesitant about asking someone. It is perfectly appropriate to ask Dr. Petrova, actually. She’s your physician and knows your medical history, and a healthcare proxy doesn't need to be a family member. It’s more important that they understand your values and wishes, and that you trust them to advocate for you. However, it is important to ask her directly if she is willing and able to take on the responsibility – you can’t assume she will. If you’re not comfortable asking Dr. Petrova, or if she’s unable to take on the role, you can also consider a close friend, a trusted colleague, or even a professional healthcare advocate. It's really about finding someone you feel confident in. We can also discuss the option of a public guardian, but that's usually a last resort. For now, let’s just leave that section blank and come back to it later. It’s more important to focus on outlining your general wishes first. Do you have any strong preferences about the types of medical treatments you would or wouldn't want in the event of a serious illness?
PATIENT: That makes sense. Focusing on my wishes first…yes, that’s probably best. I… I don't want to be kept alive artificially, if there’s no hope of recovery. I’ve seen… unpleasant things. I’ve witnessed the suffering, and I wouldn’t want to prolong it unnecessarily. I value quality of life, not just… existence. I’m not afraid of death, per se. I just don’t want to be a burden. Or trapped. And I would want to be comfortable, if possible. Pain management is important. I wouldn't want to suffer needlessly. Is that… reasonable?
DOCTOR: That is very reasonable, Ms. Buoniconti. In fact, it’s a very thoughtful and common sentiment. You’ve clearly given this a lot of consideration, and it’s important to document those wishes. This section here is where we can outline those preferences. It asks about things like life-sustaining treatment – things like mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes, and CPR. You can indicate whether you would want those treatments in all circumstances, in some circumstances, or not at all. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you would want to limit those treatments if there’s no hope of recovery. We can write that in, specifying that you wouldn’t want life-sustaining treatment prolonged in the absence of a reasonable chance of regaining a meaningful quality of life. Does that sound accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… accurate. Limiting treatment… in the absence of hope. Perhaps we could also include something about pain management? Ensuring I’m comfortable, regardless of the circumstances? I don't want to be… conscious and suffering, if there’s no possibility of improvement. I apologize for being so… morbid. It’s not a pleasant conversation, is it? But it’s important, isn't it? To have these things documented. To avoid… unnecessary suffering.
DOCTOR: Not at all morbid, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s a very responsible and compassionate thing to do, and you’re not alone in wanting to ensure your comfort and dignity. In fact, it’s quite common. “Patient desires comfort management as a priority. Wishes to avoid prolonged suffering and will not request or desire aggressive interventions in the absence of a reasonable prospect of regaining meaningful quality of life.” How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… that sounds perfect, actually. “Comfort management as a priority…” Yes. That captures it precisely. Perhaps we could add something about my… artistic work? If I were incapacitated, I would want my studio preserved, if possible. It’s… important to me. It represents a lifetime of dedication. I apologize for bringing up something so…trivial. It seems selfish, given the circumstances. But it means a great deal to me. If it’s not too much trouble, of course. It’s not essential. But it would bring me some peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Not at all trivial, Ms. Buoniconti. It's perfectly reasonable to want to ensure your personal possessions are preserved, especially something so meaningful as your artistic work. It’s important to document those wishes as well. We can add a section at the end of the Advance Directive stating: “Patient expresses a desire for their studio and artistic work to be preserved, if feasible. Request that arrangements be made to ensure their preservation.” How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… that sounds wonderful. "Ensure their preservation…" Yes. That’s perfect. I believe… I believe that’s everything. For now, at least. I’m not sure if there’s anything else I need to consider. I apologize for taking up so much of your time. I know you have other patients. You’ve been very patient and understanding. I truly appreciate it. Perhaps we could discuss the POLST form now? If you’re not too busy, of course.
DOCTOR: Not a problem at all, Ms. Buoniconti. Taking the time to ensure your wishes are documented is a worthwhile investment, and you haven't taken up too much of my time. Now, let’s talk about the POLST form. This form is more specific, outlining your wishes for life-sustaining treatments right now. It’s a medical order, and it’s typically completed when someone has a serious illness or frailty. Based on what you’ve told me, you don’t currently have a serious illness, but it's helpful to have this form on file in case of an emergency. It's less about what you want in general, and more about what you want today. Are you comfortable discussing those preferences?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe so. “What I want today…” That makes sense. It’s a bit more…immediate, isn’t it? I suppose… if I were incapacitated and there was no hope of recovery, I would want to be kept comfortable. Pain management is important, as we discussed. And… I wouldn't want any aggressive interventions. No mechanical ventilation, no feeding tubes, no CPR. I understand it’s a difficult conversation. But I want to be clear. I don’t want to be kept alive artificially, if there’s no possibility of improvement. Is that… reasonable? Would that be enough information to complete the form?
DOCTOR: That is perfectly reasonable, Ms. Buoniconti. In fact, it’s a very thoughtful and common sentiment. You’ve clearly given this a lot of consideration, and it’s important to document those wishes. This section here is where we can indicate your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatments. Based on what you’ve told me, we’ll check “Do Not Initiate Mechanical Ventilation,” “Do Not Initiate Artificial Nutrition/Hydration,” and “Do Not Attempt CPR.” Does that sound accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…perfectly accurate. No mechanical ventilation, no artificial nutrition, no CPR. I believe… I believe that’s everything. For now, at least. I’m not sure if there’s anything else I need to consider. I apologize for taking up so much of your time. You’ve been very patient and understanding. Is there anything I need to do now? Sign the forms, perhaps? And thank you, again, for everything. I feel… much better, knowing that these things are documented.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Buoniconti. You haven't taken up too much of my time at all. I'm glad I could help. Yes, if you’re comfortable, please sign both forms. Once signed, we’ll make copies for your records, and I'll send a copy to your primary care physician. It’s also a good idea to share a copy with your designated healthcare proxy, if you have one. Do you have any questions about the forms, or anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s everything. The forms look… perfect. There. Thank you, again, for everything. I feel… much better, knowing that these things are documented. I believe… I believe I'll be going now. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Buoniconti. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I'm glad I could help. I’m happy you feel better knowing these things are documented. Take care now, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions in the future. Have a good day as well.
