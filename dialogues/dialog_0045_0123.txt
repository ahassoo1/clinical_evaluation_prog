DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cassimatis. Welcome. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, well, thank you, Doctor Billman. It’s this…itching. It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s just getting on my nerves, you know? It feels like all over, really. Not terrible, just…constant.
DOCTOR: Constant itching, alright. And you said "a little while"?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. Maybe…two, three months now? It started slowly, I didn’t even pay much attention at first. Just thought it was the dry air, you know? We had a pretty harsh winter. But it hasn’t gone away with the warmer weather. That’s when I figured I should probably get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, it started around…May-ish?
PATIENT: Roughly, yeah. May or June. Time just…flies by, doesn't it? I haven't really been keeping track. Is that important, knowing exactly when it started? I just know it's not going away. And it's especially bothersome at night, makes it hard to sleep sometimes.
DOCTOR: It can be. Sometimes the timing can give us clues. And the fact it's worse at night…that's helpful too. Now, is the itching all over, or are there specific spots that bother you more?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s pretty much everywhere, but my arms and back are the worst. Especially my upper back, it's hard to reach to scratch, you know? And sometimes my legs get really bad. Not…like a rash, it's not bumpy or anything. Just…itchy. Red sometimes, if I scratch too much, but mostly just…irritated. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does. No rash, just redness from scratching. And have you tried anything to relieve the itching?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Lots of lotion, mostly. Aveeno, and just regular moisturizing creams. Sometimes I’ll put a little bit of calamine lotion on it, but it doesn’t really help for very long. And I’ve tried not scratching, but…well, you know how that goes! It's just so hard not to.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Itching is…unpleasant. Let's take a look. Could you turn around for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I hope it’s not too bad. Like I said, it’s not a lot of visible redness unless I’ve been scratching a lot. It’s more of a…feeling, you know? A constant irritation.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Skin appears generally intact, some mild excoriation consistent with scratching. No visible rash or lesions. Texture seems…normal, honestly. Your arms look the same. Have you changed laundry detergents recently?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Let me think… Yes, actually, I did. About a month ago? My daughter, she recommended a new one, said it was better for sensitive skin. Something…Plant-based, I think? I can't remember the name. It smelled nice, though. Maybe that’s it? It is possible. I've been trying all sorts of things, I suppose. I just want it to stop itching.
DOCTOR: Plant-based… alright. It’s possible it’s a contact dermatitis reaction. Those can be… unpredictable. And the skin can take a while to calm down. I'm going to go ahead and recommend you switch back to your old detergent, immediately. And avoid fabric softeners altogether. We'll see if that helps. Now, beyond the itching, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Yes, okay, I can definitely do that. Back to the old detergent. Fabric softeners, too. No problem. Hmm…let me think about other symptoms. No fever, no tiredness, nothing like that. Oh! Actually, now that you mention it… sometimes my skin feels a little…dry, even after I put lotion on. Just a little, though. Not terribly flaky, just…not as hydrated as it should be, I guess. It's hard to explain. Does that sound weird?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound weird. Dry skin can accompany these things. We’ll consider it. Frankly, Ms. Cassimatis, it sounds like a mild irritant dermatitis. It’s likely the new detergent. But we should rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order a basic blood panel, just to make sure everything else is within normal limits. Mostly to be thorough. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, a blood panel…okay. Thorough is good. Allergies…hmm. Well, I’ve always been a little sensitive to cats, but it’s not a serious allergy, just a little bit of sneezing. And…I think I was allergic to penicillin when I was a child, but that was a long time ago. I haven’t had it in decades. Other than that…not really. I eat everything. I'm not a picky eater, that's for sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known drug allergies aside from a childhood reaction to penicillin – noted. And you’ve tried switching detergents, and that’s been the only recent change?
PATIENT: Yes, that was the only thing. Honestly, my daughter is always trying to get me to try new things. She means well, but sometimes… I just like what I like, you know? And I did use the new detergent consistently for about a month now. So it should be enough time to see if it’s the problem. I really hope it is. This itching is just so…annoying. It’s keeping me up at night, and it’s hard to concentrate on my reading. I’m a political scientist, you see, and I need to stay sharp.
DOCTOR: Political scientist, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’ve been studying political systems for… well, a long time now. Mostly comparative politics, looking at different governments around the world. It's fascinating work, when I can focus! It’s a bit different than worrying about itchy skin, though, isn't it? It keeps me busy, at least. And I always have an opinion on things.
DOCTOR: Right. Well. We'll get you back to your political systems. For now, let’s focus on the skin. I've ordered the blood panel. The lab results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, switch back to your old detergent immediately, and avoid fabric softeners. If the itching doesn’t improve significantly within a week, we’ll consider other options. I'll also write you a prescription for a mild topical corticosteroid cream. Use it sparingly, only on the most irritated areas. It won’t solve the problem, but it might provide some temporary relief. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds…reasonable. Switch back the detergent, cream for the itchy spots, wait for the blood test… I think I can manage that. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Thank you, Doctor Billman. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. And I hope you don’t mind my rambling on about politics. It’s just…it’s what I do.
DOCTOR: Quite alright. Political systems are…a subject. I'll have the nurse print out the lab order and give you the prescription. Get some rest, Ms. Cassimatis, and try not to scratch. We’ll see you in a week.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you again, Doctor. I will. Try not to scratch. Easier said than done, but I’ll try. Have a good day.
