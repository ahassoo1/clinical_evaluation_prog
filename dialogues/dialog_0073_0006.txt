DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s… a little embarrassing to talk about, but I’ve been coughing up some blood. Not a lot, but enough to worry me. It started a few days ago.
DOCTOR: Coughing up blood, you say. Hmm. And how much blood are we talking, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s not like a lot, like in the movies. More like… streaks, mixed in with the mucus when I cough. Sometimes it’s brighter red, sometimes it’s… older looking, I guess? Darker red. It’s hard to explain. It’s not every cough, only some of them.
DOCTOR: Streaks, you say. Bright red and darker…right. And when did you first notice this?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was about three days ago, maybe four? I was getting ready for work, and when I coughed to clear my throat, there it was. I thought maybe I’d bitten my tongue or something, but it happened again later that day. And then a couple of times yesterday. It hasn’t been constant, thankfully.
DOCTOR: And have you been experiencing any other symptoms alongside this…hemoptysis?
PATIENT: Hemop… what did you call it? Oh, the coughing up blood. Yes. I have been a little tired, more than usual. And a small cough, always. But that’s just… allergies, I think. It's summer, you know? And maybe a little…short of breath when I walk up the stairs. Not too bad, though. Just noticing it more.
DOCTOR: Allergies, alright. And any fever, chills, night sweats, or unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. I haven’t been feeling cold at all, even with the tiredness. And… no, I don’t think I’ve lost weight. My clothes feel the same. My husband… well, my late husband always said I ate too much, so that hasn’t changed. I apologize. That was… inappropriate. I get easily distracted.
DOCTOR: It's alright. These things happen. Now, let’s move on. Any history of lung problems in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. My father, he smoked for a very long time, but he didn’t get sick with anything…lung related, as far as I know. He died of a heart attack. My mother was healthy, mostly. Just…old age. I don't think anyone else had trouble breathing, no. It's been a long time, I'm sorry. My memory isn’t as good as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I always thought it was a terrible habit. My husband tried it once, a long time ago, but he didn’t like it. He said it made him feel sick. I always made sure he didn’t smoke in the house, of course. It’s very bad for you.
DOCTOR: Good. And any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve taken allergy medicine before, for hay fever, and I didn’t have any problems. And… painkillers, when I had a bad back. Nothing serious. I always tell the pharmacist everything, and they haven't said anything about allergies. Is this…serious, Doctor? The blood, I mean.
DOCTOR: It could be serious, Ms. Weichers. That’s why you’re here. Now, let's do a quick examination. I need to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen levels. Please sit up straight.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Yes, of course. I will do whatever you need me to do, Doctor. Just… please tell me if you find anything worrying. I get very nervous easily.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… good. And another… Now, I'm hearing some mild wheezing, but that could be from allergies. Your oxygen saturation is 96%, which is acceptable. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse 72. Nothing alarming there. Now, open your mouth, please. Hmm. Everything looks normal in your throat.
PATIENT: Okay. Is that… good? The numbers, I mean. I feel a little silly just sitting here. Is it possible it’s just a bad cold? A really bad allergy flare-up? I haven't been traveling or anything, just… staying home.
DOCTOR: It's possible, Ms. Weichers. But hemoptysis, even mild, requires further investigation. We need to rule out anything more serious. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. The X-ray will help us see if there’s anything going on in your lungs, and the blood work will check for infection or other abnormalities.
PATIENT: An X-ray? Oh dear. Is that… a lot of radiation? I try to avoid those if possible. And blood work… will it be a lot? I don't like needles very much. What are we looking for, exactly? Is it… something bad?
DOCTOR: Ms. Weichers, the radiation from a chest X-ray is minimal. It's a standard procedure, and the benefits outweigh the risks. As for the blood work, it's just a standard panel, a few vials of blood. And yes, we’re looking for anything that could be causing the bleeding: infection, inflammation, or… less common possibilities. I don't want to alarm you, but it's important to be thorough. Worrying yourself prematurely won’t help. We’ll get the results back within 24 hours, and then we'll discuss the next steps. I'm printing the requisition forms now. The radiology department is just down the hall.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Twenty-four hours… that seems like a long time to wait. Very well, Doctor. I will go to radiology. And… thank you for explaining everything. If you think of anything else I should know, or anything I should be watching for, please tell me. .
