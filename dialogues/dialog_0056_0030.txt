DOCTOR: Hi Kerriann, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve noticed a change in how I smell, like… my body odor. It’s just different than it used to be, and I wanted to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to be embarrassed at all. Changes like that can be concerning, and it’s good you’re getting it looked into. It’s definitely something we can explore. Can you tell me a little more about what’s different?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s hard to explain. It’s not worse, exactly. Just… different. It used to be, you know, a typical body smell after a day of work. Now it’s… almost sweeter, I guess? And sometimes, it has a kind of… chemical smell? Not like bleach, but… I don’t know, something artificial. It started maybe a month or so ago, I think. Around the end of June, probably. I work pretty hard, laying floors, so I sweat a lot, but this is new with the sweat, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sweeter or chemical-like odor, starting around the end of June… and it’s happening with the sweat. That’s helpful. And you said you lay floors – that’s physically demanding work. Do you notice it all the time, or just after work, when you're sweating?
PATIENT: Mostly after work, when I’m sweating. I don’t really notice it if I’m just sitting around, or haven’t been doing much. But as soon as I start moving and get warm, it becomes noticeable. It’s… well, my daughter noticed it first, actually. She said I smelled “different” after I came home from a job last week. That’s when I really started paying attention.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's more pronounced with exertion, and your daughter noticed it too. That's good she brought it to your attention. Have you changed anything recently – new soaps, detergents, deodorants, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been using the same deodorant for years – Dove, the unscented one. And the same laundry detergent, too – Tide, the free and clear kind. I switched to those a long time ago because I have sensitive skin. Nothing new on that front, I promise. I haven't started using any new lotions or anything either. Just the usual.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to rule those out. And have you noticed any other changes – like changes in your appetite, weight loss or gain, feeling more tired than usual, or any new skin rashes or anything else at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… I haven’t really lost or gained any weight. My appetite is pretty normal, I guess. Maybe I have been a little more tired lately, now that you mention it. But I figured that was just from the heat and the hard work. It’s been really hot, and laying floors all day is exhausting! No rashes or anything like that, though. Just the tiredness, and of course, the smell.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased fatigue along with the odor change. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with – like diabetes, kidney problems, thyroid issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: Well, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years back, but it’s pretty well controlled with medication. I take lisinopril, I think it’s called. And I had a hysterectomy about ten years ago, but other than that… not really. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. I’ve had the usual colds and flu, but nothing major. Oh! And I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just from the work, I think. Nothing they’ve given me any medication for, just some over-the-counter pain relievers when it flares up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of hypertension, controlled with lisinopril, a hysterectomy ten years ago, and some arthritis in your knees. No other major medical problems. And you mentioned you take lisinopril. Are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the lisinopril, and a multivitamin. That’s it. I take the multivitamin most days, but sometimes I forget. Nothing else, I promise. I don’t really like taking a lot of pills, so I try to keep it simple. I drink a lot of water, though! Especially when I’m working. I try to stay hydrated.
DOCTOR: Okay, just lisinopril and a multivitamin occasionally. Good you're staying hydrated. Now, a quick family history question. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, children – with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had diabetes, type 2, I think. And she had some problems with her kidneys later in life. My father was pretty healthy, as far as I know. He passed away a few years ago, but he didn't have any major medical issues. My sister has high blood pressure, like me, but she’s doing okay with medication. And my daughter is healthy as a horse. That’s all I can really think of right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes and kidney problems in your mother, and high blood pressure in your sister. That's helpful. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I don’t have any known allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, and I can eat pretty much anything. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess. No food allergies, no drug allergies, no environmental allergies… nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thanks for all that information, Kerriann. It’s good to have a complete picture. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just do a general assessment. Then we can talk about what might be going on and what steps to take. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I'm ready when you are. I just want to figure out what's causing this smell, you know? It's a little embarrassing, but more than that, I want to make sure it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll figure this out. It’s good you’re being proactive. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please take a seat on the exam table?
PATIENT: Okay, here I go. Let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 138/82. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so, considering you're a bit anxious about this. Heart rate is 78, regular. Let's listen to your lungs now. Take a deep breath in… and out… another deep breath… good. Lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to briefly examine your skin, looking for any unusual rashes or changes in pigmentation. Skin looks normal, no rashes or unusual discoloration. I don't see anything obviously concerning on the surface. Now, I’m going to check your thyroid. Your thyroid feels normal, no enlargement or tenderness. I’m not feeling any nodules. Finally, just a quick neurological check… can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: There. Is that okay? I'm pretty strong, from all the floor laying, you know. I'm always using my hands.
DOCTOR: Yes, very strong! Grip strength is excellent. Everything seems normal on the physical exam. Given your history and the symptoms you’re describing – the change in body odor, starting around the end of June, the increased fatigue, and your family history of diabetes and kidney problems – I’m thinking we should run some blood tests. These will help us check your kidney function, blood sugar levels, and rule out any other underlying causes. It could be something as simple as a minor hormonal imbalance, but we need to investigate further. We'll also do a urinalysis to check for any abnormalities in your urine. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best to figure this out. I'd rather know than worry about it, you know? Blood tests and a urine sample… okay. Where do I go to get those done? Do I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll get those ordered right away. You can go to the lab right across the street – they're open until 5pm today. You will need to fast for at least 8 hours beforehand, so no food or drinks besides water. We’ll need a first morning urine sample, so try to collect that as soon as you wake up. I’ll give you a cup and instructions on how to collect it properly. Once you have the results, they’ll automatically be sent to me here at the clinic. I’ll review them and give you a call to discuss them – usually within a couple of days. In the meantime, if the smell becomes significantly worse, or if you develop any other symptoms like fever, nausea, or vomiting, please call the clinic immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Fast for 8 hours, first morning urine sample, results sent to you automatically, call if anything gets worse. I've got it. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and figure this out. It's been worrying me quite a bit. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. I'm glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon. I’ll be in touch. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
