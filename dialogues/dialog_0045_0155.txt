DOCTOR: Alright, Lyman Jezik, 79 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… well, it’s this shaking. My hand, mostly. It’s been… happening. For a while now, I guess. Not sure how long, exactly. It’s just… annoying. I'd like to get it sorted, if you can, doctor. I haven’t got all day, you see.
DOCTOR: “Annoying,” right. Okay. Well, “happening for a while” isn’t terribly specific, Mr. Jezik. Can you tell me when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When… hmm. That’s… difficult. A few months, maybe? Six? Honestly, time just… slips away, you know? It started… gradually. I noticed it when I was trying to… well, hold a cup of coffee. Spilled a bit. Then it was harder to write. Little things, really. It’s not constant, thankfully. But it's there.
DOCTOR: “Little things” can be important, Mr. Jezik. So, it comes and goes. Is it worse with activity?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Definitely worse when I'm doing something. Like… trying to tighten a bolt at the plant. Or… eating soup. Anything that requires a steady hand, really. When I'm just… sitting, it's not so bad. Though it is there, even then, sometimes. Just… a little quiver.
DOCTOR: Okay. And does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Better…? Hmm. That's a good question. Honestly, I haven’t really tried to make it better. I just… try to be careful. Maybe… resting it helps? I don’t know. I usually just ignore it until it gets too bothersome. Not much point dwelling on things, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Ignoring things rarely makes them go away, Mr. Jezik. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Well, I'm an old man, doctor. What isn't a symptom? Seriously though… I don’t think so. No dizziness. No… well, I’m a bit stiff in the mornings, but that’s just age, I figure. And my memory isn’t what it used to be, but that’s hardly new.
DOCTOR: “Hardly new” isn’t a medical observation, Mr. Jezik. Alright. Any family history of… tremors, or neurological problems?
PATIENT: Tremors… neurological problems… My mother… she had a bit of a shake towards the end, I think. But she was very old. And my… my brother, Joseph… he wasn't quite right, mentally, but that was a long time ago. I don't remember the details, honestly. We weren’t close.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications…? Not really. Just… a little something for my blood pressure, years ago. But the doctor took me off it, said I didn't need it anymore. Nothing else. Just the usual aches and pains, you know? I mostly deal with those myself.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam, Mr. Jezik. Just to get a better idea of what's going on. Can you hold your arms out in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. There you go. Not as steady as they used to be, I’m afraid. Everything’s getting old, doctor. Everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m noting a resting tremor in both hands, more pronounced on the right. I also see a slight rigidity. Now, can you tap your finger to your nose, repeatedly, with your eyes closed?
PATIENT: Eyes closed, right. Like this? It's… harder than it looks. Everything feels… off.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. And now, can you walk a few steps for me, Mr. Jezik?
PATIENT: Alright. There. I don't like walking much these days, you see. Too easy to fall.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Jezik, have a seat. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it’s looking like you likely have essential tremor. It's a common condition, particularly as people get older. It’s not life-threatening, but it can be bothersome. I’d like to order some blood work just to rule out anything else, but I suspect that’s what we’re dealing with.
PATIENT: Essential tremor… Is there… anything I can do about it? I don't want to have to stop working, you see. I need to keep busy. And will it get worse? I'd rather not dwell on that, but… it's a worry.
DOCTOR: There are treatments, Mr. Jezik, but they don’t cure it. Medication can help reduce the tremor, but it comes with side effects, and not everyone responds to it. Physical therapy can sometimes help with coordination. And, yes, it can get worse over time, though the rate of progression varies greatly. We can start with the blood work and discuss your options further once we have those results. I’ll also write you a referral to a neurologist. They’re the specialists in these sorts of things. They can offer a more in-depth evaluation and discuss potential interventions, like deep brain stimulation, if it becomes necessary.
PATIENT: Deep brain… Oh dear. That sounds… serious. I think I’d rather just try the pills, if they’re not too bad. And the physical therapy, maybe. I can barely remember my own name these days, though. Alright. Blood work and pills, then. Is that all for today, doctor? I've got things to do, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s it for today. I’ll have the lab order sent to the front desk, and they’ll schedule you for the blood draw. The neurologist’s referral will also be sent electronically. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks to discuss the results and your options. And Mr. Jezik, please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Here’s a summary of everything we discussed. And please, try to be more specific next time. It makes things easier for everyone.
PATIENT: Alright. Specific… yes, I'll try. Though it's not always easy, you see. Time slips away. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help. Now, if you'll excuse me... I've got things to do.
