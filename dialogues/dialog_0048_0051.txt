DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nini. I’m Dr. Sink. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, my memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. My daughter, she said I should come in. Something about needing to know… what’s it called? The blood type? Yes, that’s it. Something about being prepared, she said. For… things. I don’t rightly recall why exactly, but she was quite insistent.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood type. Yes, well, it’s… prudent to be aware of these things, even if you don't recall the specific reason at the moment. It’s good your daughter is thinking ahead. We’ll get that done quickly. Before we do that, though, just to have a complete picture… have you been feeling unwell lately?
PATIENT: Unwell? Hmm… not that I’ve noticed. I get a bit tired, of course, at my age. And my knees ache sometimes, especially when it rains. But that’s just… old age, I suppose. Nothing a bit of liniment can’t fix. I haven’t been to the hospital for anything serious in… oh, goodness, decades, I’d wager. I used to be quite strong, you know. A rigger, I was. Lots of lifting and climbing. But that was a long time ago. Does that answer your question, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's… helpful. Knees aching with the rain, that’s… common. And a history of physical work. Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… well, it comes and goes, doesn’t it? Some days I can eat a whole plate of paella, and other days just a little soup is enough. I haven’t really weighed myself in ages. I suppose I might have lost a bit, but nothing dramatic. I still fit into my dresses, more or less. Though I do prefer loose-fitting ones these days… more comfortable, you see. My daughter keeps telling me I need to eat more greens, but… well, paella is much nicer. Do you like paella, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That’s… beside the point, Ms. Nini. We're discussing your health. Any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh dear. Now you’re asking about… things I don't usually talk about. Well… no, not really. Everything’s… regular, I suppose. As regular as it can be for someone my age. I haven’t noticed anything particularly different, if that makes sense. My daughter always worries about these things, but I assure you, I’m quite… functional. Is that a good enough answer, Doctor? I do hope I’m not being a bother.
DOCTOR: No, it's… fine. Let's move on. Any difficulty with breathing, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing? No, not really. I get a little winded when I climb the stairs, but that’s just… old age again. And sometimes, if I laugh too hard, I get a bit breathless. But nothing that requires… special attention. I used to sing, you know. Quite well, actually. Though my lungs aren't what they used to be. My daughter says I shouldn’t strain myself. She worries about everything, that girl. Is that what you wanted to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Nini, that is what I wanted to know. Have you experienced any chest pain, or palpitations – a fluttering in your chest?
PATIENT: Chest pain… hmm. Now that you mention it… sometimes, just a little ache, right here. It doesn’t last long, and it’s not terribly painful. More of a… discomfort, really. And I do get a bit… fluttery sometimes. Like a little bird flapping in my chest. But I always thought that was just nerves. Or maybe too much coffee. My daughter makes me drink herbal tea now. It doesn't taste nearly as good. Is that a problem, Doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It’s likely just… age-related changes, Ms. Nini. We'll do a quick listen to your heart and lungs to be certain. Then we’ll get that blood type checked, as your daughter requested. Please sit back and relax. I’m going to listen to your breathing now.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… sensible. Listening to my breathing, yes. I always thought my lungs were quite strong. All that climbing, you see. Go ahead, Doctor. I'll try to be quiet. And don’t mind if I close my eyes, it helps me relax. This is all very thorough, isn't it? I hope your daughter isn’t expecting too much from this blood type thing. I still don’t quite understand why she wants to know.
DOCTOR: Deep breaths, Ms. Nini. In and out. Breathing is… slightly diminished, but not overly concerning. Some mild crackles in the lower lobes, likely related to age or minor congestion. Heart rate is a bit irregular, as expected. Alright. We’ll proceed with the blood draw. It’s a standard procedure, nothing to worry about. The nurse will be in shortly.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Diminished breathing, you say? That doesn’t sound very good, does it? But you say it’s not too concerning. That’s… reassuring. A blood draw, yes. I don’t mind a little poke, as long as it’s quick. I’ve always been a bit squeamish about needles, though. My daughter will be pleased you’re being so thorough. She always worries so much. The nurse, you say? How long will that be? Is it a young nurse? I prefer an older one, if possible. They’re usually gentler, you see.
DOCTOR: The nurse will be with you momentarily, Ms. Nini. I can’t guarantee her age, but she is quite competent. Look, we've established some minor age-related changes, and we’re getting your blood type checked as requested. It's a preventative measure, not an emergency. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. I'll review the results once they are available. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I used to get a bit of a rash from some perfumes, but that was ages ago. And I’m allergic to… being bored, perhaps? No, I’m just teasing, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t recall any serious allergies. My daughter always asks me that question, and I always say the same thing. She worries about everything. But no, I don’t think I have any allergies to medications. Is that alright? Are you going to be back soon, Doctor? To tell me what the blood type is?
DOCTOR: No known allergies, noted. I will review the results, Ms. Nini. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once the results are available, we’ll discuss them. I have other patients awaiting assessment. Please remain seated, and the nurse will assist you. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Remain seated, yes. The nurse… I do hope she's gentle. And I hope she doesn't take too long. This blood type thing… it's all very mysterious. I suppose I'll just sit here and wait. But what if I forget what the doctor said? My memory, it's… .
