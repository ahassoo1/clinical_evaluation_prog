DOCTOR: Good morning, Jaxston. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. To start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doc. Yeah, nice to meet you too. It's… headaches, mostly. Bad ones. They come and go, and when they do come, it’s… well, it’s a whole thing. Sweating, heart races… feels pretty awful, honestly. I don’t really… remember exactly when they started, to be honest. It's been a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches that come and go, and are accompanied by sweating and a racing heart – that does sound unpleasant. It’s alright that you don’t remember the exact start date, we can try to narrow it down. To help me understand what’s going on, can you describe what the headaches feel like?
PATIENT: Um… good question. It's not like a normal headache, you know? It’s not just a dull ache. It feels… like pressure, all over my head, kinda. And it feels… tight. Really tight. Like someone’s squeezing my brain. Sometimes it's on one side, sometimes both. It's hard to explain. And then the sweating starts, and my heart just… thumps. It feels like it’s gonna jump outta my chest. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Jaxston. Pressure, tightness, sometimes one-sided, sometimes both, with sweating and a racing heart… that gives me a better picture. And when these headaches happen, how long do they typically last?
PATIENT: Oh, man. That’s… tough to say. It feels like hours, sometimes. Like, a good few hours, at least. Maybe even longer? I've kinda lost track, to be honest. I usually just try to lie down in a dark room and hope it passes. I don't really time them or anything. It’s just… really unpleasant, so I try to get through it. I guess they usually go away within a day, but I've had a couple that lingered a bit longer.
DOCTOR: Okay, lasting hours, sometimes up to a day, and you manage them by resting in a dark room. That’s helpful to know. Now, are there any things that seem to trigger these headaches?
PATIENT: Triggers… hmm. I haven’t really noticed anything specific, to be honest. I mean, sometimes they just… happen. I used to think maybe it was stress, with the divorce and all, but it still happens even when things are pretty calm. I don’t really drink much, don’t smoke… I eat alright, I guess. I haven't noticed any connection to food or anything like that. It's just… random, as far as I can tell. Sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright, Jaxston. It’s very common for headaches to not have a clear trigger. We’ll keep looking. Let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your vision when these headaches happen?
PATIENT: Vision… uh… sometimes things get a bit blurry, yeah. Like, when the headache is really bad. Not like, can’t-see-anything blurry, but… everything’s a bit fuzzy around the edges, kinda. And sometimes I see… spots, I think. Little floaty spots in front of my eyes. They don’t last long, just a few minutes, usually. But yeah, my vision gets a bit weird when they’re happening. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision and floaty spots with the headaches. That’s good information to have. Do you experience any nausea or vomiting when you have these headaches?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes. Not every time, but yeah, I've been sick a couple of times with them. Mostly just feeling really nauseous, though. Like I’m gonna throw up, but haven’t actually thrown up in a while. It's kinda a wave of feeling awful, you know? Just adds to the whole… misery of it all.
DOCTOR: Okay, nausea sometimes accompanies the headaches. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. I mean, I had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox and all that. But nothing serious. The divorce was… stressful, if that counts as a condition. Aside from that, I’ve always been pretty healthy, I think. I haven’t really been to the doctor much in the last few years. Just… never really needed to, you know? Is there anything specific you’re looking for? I’m really bad with remembering all that stuff.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright. Stressful life events certainly can impact your health. And it's good to hear you haven’t had any major medical issues. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital. Seriously. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. Just… this headache thing now. It's kinda new territory for me. I usually just tough things out, you know? But this… this is different. It's really knocking me around sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has a history of headaches or migraines?
PATIENT: Uh… that’s a good question. My mom used to get headaches sometimes, yeah. But she never really talked about them much. Just… said she had a bad head, and went to lie down. I don’t think they were as bad as these, though. And my dad… I don’t really know. He wasn’t around much when I was growing up. I don’t really know much about his medical history, to be honest. Sorry I can't be more helpful. Family stuff was… complicated.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright, Jaxston. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. Your mother having headaches is worth noting. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not that I know of. I haven't had any bad reactions to anything. I took some antibiotics a few years back for a bad throat, and that was fine. I’ve never had any trouble with food allergies, or anything like that. I can pretty much eat anything, I think. I'm pretty boring, really. No allergies, no major medical history… just this headache thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Jaxston. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a basic neurological exam to assess your reflexes and coordination. It’ll just take a few minutes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doc. I’m happy to do whatever I can to figure this out. Blood pressure, reflexes… go for it. I just want to get this sorted, if possible. It’s kinda been hanging over me.
DOCTOR: Great. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me… Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, which are both within normal limits. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical, and your coordination appears good. No obvious neurological deficits detected. I'm also going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Everything sounds normal so far. I am noting all of this in your chart. Given your history of headaches with nausea, blurry vision, and the feeling of pressure, along with the normal physical exam, I'm leaning towards considering migraine as a possible cause. However, because of the frequency and intensity of your symptoms, and because I haven't fully worked you up yet, I want to be thorough. I want to rule out other potential causes.
PATIENT: Migraine… okay. That sounds… serious? I always thought migraines were really bad headaches, but… is it something I can do something about? I'm kinda worried it's something worse, you know? Like, brain tumor or something. I know that sounds silly, but… it's been playing on my mind. What kind of things are you ruling out, exactly? And what happens next?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable concern, Jaxston, and it’s good you’re voicing it. It’s always best to consider all possibilities, and it's my job to rule out anything serious. The thought of a brain tumor is understandable, but thankfully, given your description and the normal neurological exam, it’s less likely. However, we need to be sure. What I want to rule out are other causes of headaches, like tension headaches, sinus infections, and, as you mentioned, more serious conditions like brain tumors, aneurysms, or meningitis. The next step is to get some imaging done. I'd like to order an MRI of your brain, just to get a clear picture and rule out anything structural. I’m also going to order some blood work to check for signs of infection or inflammation. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: MRI… yeah, okay. That sounds… intense. But if it rules things out, then yeah, I guess so. Blood work too, alright. It's just… a lot, you know? I haven't really been to the doctor in years, so this is all a bit overwhelming. Will the MRI… will it hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? And… what if it is something serious? What happens then? Sorry, I’m just… kinda panicking a bit now.
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable that you’re feeling panicked, Jaxston. It is a lot to take in, and it's okay to feel overwhelmed. The MRI is non-invasive, meaning it doesn't involve any needles or surgery. You'll lie on a table inside a large machine that uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It can be a little loud and you’ll need to lie very still for about 30-60 minutes, but it doesn’t hurt. We’ll provide earplugs to help with the noise. As for the results, the imaging center will send them to me, and I’ll review them as soon as possible, usually within a few days. I’ll then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results with you in detail. If the MRI reveals anything concerning, we’ll discuss the findings and explore the appropriate treatment options. That might involve a referral to a neurologist or other specialist, depending on what we find. We will tackle it step-by-step, okay?
PATIENT: Okay… step-by-step. Yeah, that sounds… better. Thirty to sixty minutes, earplugs… I can handle that. And you’ll explain everything if there’s something wrong? I don’t want to be left in the dark, you know? Just… tell me what’s going on. And… what about right now? Is there anything I can do to help with the headache right now? It's not as bad as it's been, but it's still there. Just… throbbing away.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jaxston. I will explain everything to you, step-by-step, and I will never leave you in the dark. I understand how frightening this can be, and I will make sure you have all the information you need to make informed decisions about your health. Right now, while we wait for the MRI results, there are a few things you can do to help manage your headache. First, try to rest in a dark, quiet room. Applying a cold compress to your forehead or temples can also help. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can provide some relief, but don't take them excessively, as they can sometimes worsen headaches with prolonged use. Hydrating well is also important. I’m going to write you a prescription for a stronger anti-nausea medication to help with that symptom. I’m also going to give you a referral to schedule the MRI. Do you have any preferences for imaging centers?
PATIENT: Anti-nausea meds… that sounds good. Yeah, definitely. I've been feeling pretty rough with that. And… no, no preference for imaging centers. Whatever’s closest is fine, I guess. I just… want to get this over with. The sooner we know, the better, right? And… thank you, Doc. For explaining everything, and… not making me feel like I’m going crazy. It’s just been hanging over me for so long, and… it’s nice to finally be doing something about it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaxston. I completely understand how it feels to have something hanging over you, and I’m glad we’re finally taking steps to address it. Okay, I’ve printed out the prescriptions for the anti-nausea medication and the referral for the MRI. The referral lists a few imaging centers nearby. You can choose whichever one is most convenient for you. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. Here's a summary of what we’ve discussed: We’re ruling out serious causes of your headaches with an MRI and blood work. You’ll get relief from the nausea with the prescription I’ve given you. And we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they’re available. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doc. Seriously. You’ve been really helpful. I’m still nervous, but… I feel a bit better knowing what’s happening. I’ll call to schedule the MRI tomorrow. And I’ll see you when the results are back. Thanks again. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jaxston. I’m glad I could help. Remember, I’m here if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Don't hesitate to call the office. Take care, and I’ll see you then.
