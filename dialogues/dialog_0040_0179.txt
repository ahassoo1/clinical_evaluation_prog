DOCTOR: Right. Sherrell, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Sherrell Gyamfi. It is… good to meet you, Doctor. Though, I confess, I do not… fully recall how I arrived here today. My memory, it is… not what it once was.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Not what it once was. Well, that's… convenient. Look, I have a waiting room full of actual patients, so let's try to be concise. What brought you in today?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, of course. Concise. I understand. It is… the words. They… do not come easily. Like they are hiding. I want to say something, but… it feels like a fog. It started… some time ago, I think. Perhaps a few months? It is difficult to pinpoint. My wife… she would always know. But… she is gone now. It is mostly just… finding the right words.
DOCTOR: Right. A few months. Vague. And your wife… passed. Okay. So, this difficulty with words… is it affecting everything?
PATIENT: Everything? Hmm. Let me think. No, not everything. I can still… do my work, mostly. Compensation, benefits… job analysis. Numbers are… solid. It is more the… explaining. Talking to people. I find myself… pausing. Searching. Sometimes, I just… stop mid-sentence. It is frustrating, for them, I think. And for me.
DOCTOR: So, mainly verbal communication?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe so. Writing… is easier. I can take my time. Think about the words. But when someone asks me a question… directly… it is different. It feels… quicker. And the words… they hide even more. It is… unsettling. I hope that makes sense. It is difficult to explain without… well, without the words.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think… I… I sometimes feel a little… tired. Not sick tired, just… worn out. And I have been a bit… clumsy, perhaps? Dropped a few things. But I always was a little clumsy. Is that… is that a symptom? I truly do not know. My mind… it wanders sometimes. I forget what I was saying, even when I am in the middle of saying it. It is all very… confusing.
DOCTOR: Clumsy, tired… wandering mind. Okay. Any headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches? Not really… not proper headaches. Sometimes, a little pressure behind the eyes. But I think that is just from… staring at the computer all day. Or perhaps not sleeping well. It is difficult to say. I do not… recall any severe headaches. No. I don't think so. But… my wife, she always knew when I was getting a headache before I did.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Let's move on. Any medical problems in the family?
PATIENT: Medical problems… in the family? My mother… she had… something with her heart. I believe. It was a long time ago. And my father… he was a strong man. Very strong. I don’t… recall any serious illnesses on his side. My wife’s family… hmm. They were… healthy, mostly. But she had an aunt… something with the nerves, I think. But that was… long ago. It is difficult to remember details, I’m afraid. I wish I was more help.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me see… just… for my blood pressure. A small white pill. I take it every morning. And… sometimes, a pain reliever for my back, if it is acting up. But that is only when needed. Nothing else. Just… the blood pressure pill, and the occasional pain reliever. My wife… she managed all my appointments. I don’t always… recall what they tell me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam, then. Stand up for me, please. I want to check your balance and reflexes.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. My balance… is sometimes a little… unsteady. Especially when I am tired. But I should be alright. Please, go ahead. I will try my best to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay. Walk a few steps forward. Now backwards. Good. A little unsteady, as you said. Reflexes are… normal, though slightly diminished. Blood pressure is controlled. Heart sounds normal. Now, I'm going to check your eyes. Follow my finger... look left, right, up, down. No obvious abnormalities there. It could be a number of things. Stress, fatigue... but given your age... we should rule out anything more serious.
PATIENT: Rule out… more serious? More serious… like what? My wife… she always said I worry too much. But I do not… understand. Is it… something I should be very concerned about? I confess, Doctor, this is… unsettling. I only came because the words… they are becoming so difficult.
DOCTOR: Look. It could be early signs of cognitive decline. Nothing definite, mind you. But it warrants further investigation. I'm going to order an MRI and some blood work. And I'm referring you to a neurologist. They specialize in these things. Don't panic. It doesn't automatically mean anything. But we need to be thorough.
PATIENT: MRI… and a neurologist? Cognitive… decline? Is that… like… losing my mind? My wife… she always said I had a good memory. It is just… the words, Doctor. That is all. I… I do not understand. What does this mean? Will I… will I still be able to… work? To… remember things?
DOCTOR: Look, I’m not going to speculate. That's what the neurologist is for. The MRI will give us a clearer picture of what's going on in your brain. The blood work will rule out any underlying medical conditions. It’s a standard procedure. Here’s the referral. Make an appointment with Dr. Anya Sharma as soon as possible. And try to relax. Worrying won’t help. Now, is there anything else you want to discuss, or can we finish this?
PATIENT: Dr. Sharma… yes. I will… I will make an appointment. But… what if… what if it is something serious? What if I… forget who I am? My wife… she would… she would be so worried. I… I just want to be able to… think clearly again. To… find my words. Is there… anything I can do? Before the tests?
DOCTOR: Look, I've already told you what you need to do. Stress management. Healthy diet. Get some sleep. Don't dwell on it. And frankly, I have other patients waiting. I've given you the referral. Schedule the appointment. That’s all I can do for you right now. .
