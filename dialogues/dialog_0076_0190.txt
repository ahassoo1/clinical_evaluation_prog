DOCTOR: Right, Lilyanna Snerling. 23 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… it’s a bit difficult to explain, actually. I’ve been… unsteady, I suppose. Like, losing my balance. It’s been happening for a little while now, but it’s… worsened recently. I don't quite recall when it started, truthfully. It feels like a fog, remembering things these days.
DOCTOR: Unsteady… losing your balance. “A little while now,” you say. And this “fog” with remembering… alright. Is it constant, this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: No, not constant. It comes and goes. Some days I feel perfectly fine, and other days… well, it’s like the floor is shifting beneath my feet. It’s mostly when I’m walking, I think. Or trying to stand for too long. I haven’t… fallen yet, thankfully. But I feel like I might. Does that make sense? I apologize if I'm being unclear. It's hard to put into words.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, it makes some sense. Intermittent, primarily with ambulation and prolonged standing. Do you notice anything else happening when you feel this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes, when it happens, things seem… a little blurry, I think. Not my vision exactly, but… like the room is swaying. And I’ve been feeling… quite tired, actually. More tired than usual. Though, with my work… being on the oil rigs, tiredness is fairly common. It’s hard to say what’s normal and what isn’t, you understand? Is it alright if I ask what you mean by “else”? I don’t want to miss anything.
DOCTOR: Blurriness… room swaying. Fatigue. Yes, well, fatigue is remarkably non-specific. By ‘else’, I mean any other accompanying symptoms. Nausea?
PATIENT: Nausea… Oh! Yes, sometimes. Not terribly severe, but a sort of queasy feeling in my stomach. It doesn't happen every time, but it’s there occasionally, along with the unsteadiness and the blurry feeling. I hadn’t really thought to mention it, as it’s not… overwhelming. I apologize again for being so… scattered. It's difficult to recall everything precisely. Would it help if I wrote it down? Perhaps that would be clearer?
DOCTOR: No, no, writing isn’t necessary. Intermittent nausea… alright. Any headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches… occasionally. Not frequent, and usually not very bad. More of a dull ache, behind my eyes, I suppose. They come and go. I didn’t connect it to the unsteadiness, to be honest. I just assumed it was… stress, perhaps? Work can be quite demanding. Is that relevant? I’m sorry to keep asking questions, but I want to be sure I’m providing all the information you need.
DOCTOR: Stress. Yes, well, many things can cause headaches. Let's move on. Past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… That’s a difficult question. Honestly, I don’t… I don’t recall much. I was married, but my husband… passed away a few years ago. And I’ve been quite healthy otherwise, I believe. Regular check-ups, the usual vaccinations. I haven’t been hospitalized for anything significant. I… I think. It’s all a bit hazy. I do know I’ve always had low blood pressure, if that’s relevant. The doctors on the rig always mentioned it. Would it help if I try to contact my previous doctor for records? I’m unsure if I even have their contact information, however.
DOCTOR: Low blood pressure. Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, I don’t believe so. Nothing major, at least. I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, but that’s it. A very routine procedure. I’m quite certain there haven't been any other surgeries. I would remember something like that, wouldn’t I? I apologize if I’m repeating myself or being unclear. This is… unsettling, trying to recall everything. Is it alright if I pause for a moment to collect my thoughts?
DOCTOR: Wisdom teeth. Fine. We'll move on quickly then. Family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… That’s… difficult. My mother is still alive, and fairly healthy, I believe. She lives in Ethiopia. I haven't seen her in a long while. I don't know much about my father's side of the family, truthfully. He passed away when I was very young. I don’t recall anyone in my immediate family having similar symptoms to what I'm experiencing. No one with balance problems, or… fogginess, or anything like that. I’m so sorry, I wish I could provide more detail. It’s frustrating not being able to remember things clearly. Perhaps speaking with my mother would be helpful, if it's possible to contact her?
DOCTOR: Alright. Social history?
PATIENT: Social history… Well, I work on the oil rigs, as I mentioned. It’s… demanding work, long hours, not much social interaction beyond my colleagues. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I’m… widowed, as you know. I live alone, in the company housing when I’m on assignment. I don’t have any… significant hobbies, if that’s relevant. Mostly I just try to rest when I have free time. It’s not a very exciting life, I suppose. Is there anything specific you're looking for? I'm attempting to be as thorough as possible, but it’s proving rather challenging.
DOCTOR: Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don’t believe so. I’ve never been diagnosed with any allergies. No reactions to foods, medications, or anything like that. I can occasionally feel a bit stuffy during pollen season, but that’s fairly common, isn’t it? I haven’t ever needed an antihistamine or anything like that. I apologize if I’m being repetitive, but I want to ensure I haven’t overlooked anything. It’s concerning not being able to recall details accurately. Is this information helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam then. Stand up for me, if you can.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I apologize, I might be a bit unsteady. As you can see. Is there anything specific you'd like me to do?
DOCTOR: Alright. Close your eyes. Now, extend your arms straight out to the sides. Can you touch your nose with your index finger?
PATIENT: Um… No. I missed. It feels… off. It’s difficult to coordinate. Is that… a bad sign? I apologize for my clumsiness.
DOCTOR: Romberg test positive. Now, walk a straight line for me, heel to toe, ten steps. I'll observe your gait.
PATIENT: Oh dear. I… I can't seem to maintain my balance. It's much harder than it looks. I apologize, Doctor. This is… embarrassing. Would it be alright if I sat down?
DOCTOR: Gait unsteady, Romberg positive. Now, let's check your vital signs. Blood pressure... 90/60. Pulse 72. Temperature normal. Respiratory rate normal. Low blood pressure, as expected. Given your symptoms and exam findings, it's difficult to say definitively what's going on. It could be a number of things. Possible vestibular issue, or something neurological. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I would also recommend a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I… I think so. Blood work and a neurologist. A vestibular issue… is that… something serious? And neurological… that sounds… concerning. I understand you need to rule things out, Doctor. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any precautions I should take? I apologize for my continued questions, but I’m quite anxious about this. It’s unsettling not knowing what’s causing this unsteadiness. Would it be alright if I contacted my mother? Perhaps she has some medical history I've forgotten.
DOCTOR: "Vestibular issue" simply means a problem with your inner ear balance system. It can be anything from a minor infection to something more serious. That's why we need the tests. In the meantime, avoid driving or operating heavy machinery. And… yes, contacting your mother might be helpful, though I doubt it will yield much. We'll get the blood work results back within a few days. I'll have my nurse schedule you for a neurology appointment. Do you have any questions about the blood work itself?
PATIENT: Avoid driving… and heavy machinery. Yes, of course. That’s sensible. No, I don’t think so, about the blood work itself. Just… the waiting. It’s difficult not knowing. Thank you, Doctor Ruocco. For taking the time to listen, and for explaining things. I appreciate it. Would it be alright if I asked for a copy of the requisition forms, just for my own records? And… do you have a contact number in case I think of anything else before my appointment?
DOCTOR: Here. Requisition forms, and the nurse’s number. It’s unlikely she’ll have answers you don’t already have, but… there you go. Alright. I have other patients waiting. Get the blood work done as soon as possible. And try not to worry. Though I understand that’s easier said than done. .
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Ruocco. I will get the blood work done immediately. .
