DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this cough. It just won't go away, you see. And my heart... it feels a little funny sometimes with it. It's been going on for a couple of weeks now, maybe a little longer.
DOCTOR: A cough and some heart palpitations… alright. A couple of weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, about that long. It started small, just a little tickle in my throat. Now it’s… well, it’s enough to keep me up at night sometimes. Mostly when I lie down, I think. And I get breathless easier, doing things I used to not even notice.
DOCTOR: Breathlessness… and it’s worse when lying down, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. Like something is… pressing on my chest, I guess. Not painful, exactly, but… heavy. And then I have to cough to get a good breath. It's a bit frightening, to be honest. My husband... he always knew what to do, but… well, he's gone now.
DOCTOR: I see. And this heaviness, is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. It's worse at night, like I said, and after I eat a good meal. Sometimes it’s just a little bit, and I don't even think about it. Other times… other times it feels like I’m carrying a brick on my chest. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does. And have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet, Ms. Sadhu?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Now that you mention it… my feet are a bit puffy. I thought it was just the heat, you know? It’s been so warm lately. But they're definitely bigger than usual, especially at the end of the day. I have to loosen my shoes a bit.
DOCTOR: Puffy feet… alright. And are you having any trouble sleeping besides the cough?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. I wake up feeling… restless. Like I can’t get comfortable. And sometimes I just… sit up because I feel like I’m choking, even if I’m not. It’s silly, maybe, but it happens. I used to sleep like a log.
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Ms. Sadhu. These things are important. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – heart problems, lung issues, anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My doctor, Doctor Ramirez, he told me a few years back I have… congestive heart failure, he called it. He put me on some pills, water pills, I think they were, and pills for my heart. I’ve been taking them ever since, mostly. And I see him regularly, or used to, before… before he retired. I have a new doctor now, but haven’t seen her much.
DOCTOR: Congestive heart failure… alright. And do you remember the names of any of those medications you’re taking?
PATIENT: Let me think… There was one… Furosemide, yes, that was one. And… Lisinopril, I believe. And something for my blood pressure, but I can’t recall the name right now. I have them all at home in a little box, if that helps? I take them every morning with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: We can look them up. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Doctor Ramirez always asked, and I never had a reaction to anything he gave me. I eat everything, too, pretty much. No food allergies, nothing like that. I like a good plátano maduro, you know? A ripe plantain.
DOCTOR: Very good. And, Ms. Sadhu, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. My mother always said smoking was a terrible habit, and I listened to her. My husband either, never touched a cigarette in his life. It's bad for you, you know? Always makes you cough, and smells awful.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, let's do a quick examination. Could you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is that alright? A little wobbly, maybe, but I can manage. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, take a deep breath for me… and again… There’s some crackling in your lungs, Ms. Sadhu. Not ideal. Heart rate is a little fast, and irregular. Yes, some definite swelling here. It’s pitting edema. We’ll need to do a chest X-ray and some bloodwork to get a better idea of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Crackling and swelling… Is it my heart again, Doctor? Should I be worried? I just want to feel normal again. I miss gardening, you know? I can't lift the bags of soil anymore.
DOCTOR: It’s too early to say definitively, Ms. Sadhu. These findings are consistent with worsening heart failure, but we need the tests to confirm. It could be a fluid buildup, which is common with heart failure. We'll get that checked. I’ll order the X-ray and bloodwork right away. The nurse will draw some blood, and we’ll send you down for the imaging. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a diuretic to help you get rid of some of the extra fluid. It's stronger than what you're currently on, temporarily. And… avoid strenuous activity, especially lifting. No gardening for now. Is that understandable?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s understandable. No gardening… that’s sad, but alright. A stronger pill… is it safe? Will it make me feel worse before it gets better? I just want to be careful. I don’t want any surprises. And thank you, Doctor, for explaining everything so clearly. It helps to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: It is a higher dose, yes, and it can have some side effects—dizziness, frequent urination. But we’ll monitor you closely. And it should help relieve some of the shortness of breath and swelling. The nurse will give you instructions on what to watch for. The results will be available this afternoon. I’ll review them and call you with a plan. If you experience any significant chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness—go to the emergency room. I’ll remember that. And I’ll try to rest and avoid lifting. Thank you again, Doctor Korrell. I appreciate your help. I feel a little better just knowing what’s going on. Now, where is this nurse to draw some blood?
DOCTOR: She’s right outside, Ms. Sadhu. She'll be in to see you shortly. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. .
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you very much, Doctor. .
