DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, finally. It took long enough to get an appointment. It’s my foot, dear. A nasty sore. Been bothering me for weeks now. Honestly, I’ve seen better wounds on fish.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, weeks! At least six, maybe eight. Time just…slips away when you’re older, you know? It’s not like I sit around counting the days, worrying over every little thing. Though, this is a worry. It’s getting bigger, and it smells…well, you can imagine. Not a pleasant scent, let me tell you. My grandson, he said I should come in, but boys always exaggerate.
DOCTOR: I see. And where exactly on your foot is this sore located?
PATIENT: Right on the bottom, near my heel. On my left foot. It’s…well, it’s right where my sock rubs, I suppose. Though I’ve been wearing good socks! Not those thin, cheap things. I always buy the thick, padded ones. You’d think that would help, wouldn’t you? Honestly, people don't have common sense these days.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any changes in the surrounding skin?
PATIENT: Changes? What do you mean, changes? It’s red, of course. And swollen. And it’s…weeping, I suppose. That’s what my daughter calls it when it’s…moist. It’s not a pretty sight. Honestly, I've always taken good care of my feet. I just don't understand how this happened. It’s probably one of those newfangled shoes everyone's wearing. Too tight, not enough support.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to take a closer look. Could you please sit back and remove your shoe and sock so I can examine your foot?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to look? After all this talking? Fine. Though I warn you, it’s not a pretty picture. And don't go making a face, dear. I’ve seen worse, I assure you. There. Happy now?
DOCTOR: Hmm. The ulcer is approximately 2 centimeters in diameter, with significant surrounding erythema and induration. There's some purulent drainage present. I also notice some maceration of the skin around the edges. And there’s diminished pulses in your left foot compared to your right. Do you have any diabetes or any other medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Well, the doctor mentioned something about my blood sugar being a little high a few years back. But I eat a sensible diet! Mostly. I don’t go loading up on sweets like some people. He put me on a pill, but I stopped taking it. Made me feel…funny. And I don't like taking pills, dear. Always thought they do more harm than good. Besides, I felt fine! Until this foot, of course. What does diabetes even do anyway? Honestly, doctors these days… always wanting to put you on something.
DOCTOR: High blood sugar over time can damage your nerves and blood vessels, particularly in your feet. This is what can lead to poor circulation and slow healing, making you susceptible to infections like this one. Did you follow up with your primary care physician after he mentioned your elevated blood sugar?
PATIENT: Follow up? Heavens no. I had better things to do! Garden to tend, family to visit. Doctors always making a mountain out of a molehill. My mother lived to be 95 and she never went to the doctor. Just a bit of common sense and a strong constitution, that's all you need. Honestly, all this fuss… You’re not going to tell me I need to start taking pills again, are you? Because I will not do it.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, with all due respect, this is not a simple matter. You have a significant ulcer on your foot, and based on your history—or lack thereof—there’s a strong possibility of underlying complications. Ignoring this could lead to a much more serious infection, potentially requiring hospitalization or even amputation. I am going to order some blood work to check your blood sugar levels and assess your overall health. I also want to get an X-ray of your foot to rule out any bone infection. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Amputation?! Now you're just trying to scare me! That’s ridiculous. My grandfather walked all the way across the Marshall Islands and he didn’t lose a foot! I don't need blood work, and I certainly don't need an X-ray. What is this world coming to? Honestly, I’ve never heard such nonsense. I'm perfectly fine. Just a little sore. I’m going home. I think I’ll get a second opinion. A real doctor.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cannington, I understand your reluctance. However, I have a professional obligation to ensure your well-being. You are free to seek a second opinion, of course. But I strongly advise you to reconsider these tests. Without a proper diagnosis and treatment plan, this condition will only worsen. I will have the nurse draw the necessary blood work before you leave. It’s a simple procedure, and it’s the responsible thing to do. Nurse, please prepare the lab requisition for a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. And please assist Ms. Cannington with the blood draw. I strongly recommend a podiatry consultation as well. I can provide you with a referral.
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But don’t go sticking needles in me all day. And I’m not promising I'll go see some…foot doctor. Honestly, the nerve of some people. Just get it over with. And be gentle. And don't expect me to be happy about it.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will explain the procedure. I will have the lab results faxed to my office as soon as they are available. I will review them and contact you to discuss the next steps. Nurse, please ensure Ms. Cannington understands the post-draw instructions. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Just…get it over with. I’m ready when you are. And don’t expect a thank you. This whole thing is highly unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. Have a good day, Ms. Cannington. .
