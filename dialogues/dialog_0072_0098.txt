DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Heindel. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 25 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, that’s right, 25. Um... well, honestly? Just kinda curious. I ain’t really sick sick. Just thought I should, you know, get checked out. Haven’t been to a doctor in a while.
DOCTOR: “Just kinda curious,” alright. While I appreciate proactive health management, it’s still important to have a focused reason for a visit. To help me understand what you'd like me to look at, could you tell me if there’s anything specific that’s been bothering you?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good point. Nothing really bothering me, not like pain or anything. I guess… sometimes I feel kinda tired, even when I sleep enough. And I work pretty hard, you know, on the boats. But I don't know if that's just the job. It's hard work. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue. And you attribute that to your work on the boats. We’ll certainly consider that. But let's try to be a little more specific. When did you start noticing this fatigue?
PATIENT: Let me think… maybe… six months ago? Around then, I think. It didn't come on all at once. Just… slowly started feeling more worn down, even after a good night’s rest. It's hard to say exactly when, but that feels about right. Six months, yeah.
DOCTOR: Six months of progressive fatigue. And has this fatigue been interfering with your daily activities at all?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. Like, I don't have as much energy to do stuff after work. Used to like to, you know, go out with friends or fix things around my place. Now I mostly just wanna sit. It's not that I can't do things, just... don't feel like it as much. It's kinda frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this fatigue?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. Not really… I mean, no fever or anything like that. Sometimes I get a little… I dunno… kinda achy? Like in my muscles, but it comes and goes. And maybe a little bit thirsty more often. But I work outside a lot, so that could be the sun, right?
DOCTOR: Muscle aches and increased thirst. We’ll keep those in mind. Now, let's move on to some broader questions. Do you have any significant medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never been told I had anything, really. I had the usual childhood stuff, you know, chickenpox, but that was a long time ago. And I got my shots, whatever they were. Nothing major, though. Just the regular stuff, I guess.
DOCTOR: No known medical conditions. Alright. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been in the hospital. Never had surgery. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. I try to be careful on the boats, but accidents happen, you know? Haven't needed anything serious yet.
DOCTOR: No prior surgeries or hospitalizations. Let’s talk about your family. Do you have any family history of significant medical conditions – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else that runs in your family?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mom... she has high blood pressure, I think. And my grandpa on my dad’s side, he had… something with his heart, I think. But I don't really know a lot about it. We don't talk about health stuff much. It's kinda a sensitive subject, honestly.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in your mother and a cardiac condition in your grandfather. We’ll note that. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, none of that. Never smoked. I'll have a beer with my friends sometimes, but not much. And definitely no drugs. I stay pretty clean, mostly. Gotta be sharp on the boats, you know? Can't be messing around with that stuff.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Just… nothing. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I try to tough it out, mostly. If I got a headache, I just drink some water and rest. That usually does the trick.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Heindel. Given your symptoms of progressive fatigue, occasional muscle aches, and increased thirst, and your family history, I’d like to do a brief physical exam and order some basic blood work. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Does that sound agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just wanna figure out what's going on, you know? A physical exam and blood work, that's fine. Sounds like a plan.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll just have a seat here, we'll start with your vitals—blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick abdominal exam. Is there anything specific you’d like me to pay attention to?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. You're the doctor, you know what to look for. Just check everything, I guess. I trust you. Whatever you think is important.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 76 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Respiration is 16 and unlabored. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s faint, but worth noting. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Overall, physical exam is relatively unremarkable, aside from the mild elevation in blood pressure and the faint heart murmur. I'm going to order a Complete Blood Count, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel, a Lipid Panel, and a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test. We'll also check your Hemoglobin A1c to screen for diabetes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Wow, that's a lot of tests. But yeah, if you think it's necessary, that's fine. All those things… are they serious? The heart murmur and everything? I just... don't wanna be too worried if it's nothing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Heindel, it's good you're asking. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. These tests are simply to get a baseline and rule out potential causes for your fatigue and the murmur. The murmur is faint, as I mentioned, and could be perfectly benign, but we need to investigate. The blood tests will give us information about your overall health, blood sugar levels, kidney and liver function, and thyroid levels. It's a standard procedure given your symptoms and family history. We’re being thorough, not alarming. I will send these orders to the lab now, and they should be able to draw your blood before you leave. The results will typically be available in 2-3 business days. We will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them then. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant changes in your fatigue, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, that makes more sense. Thorough, not alarming. I can remember that. Chest pain or shortness of breath, got it. Two to three business days… alright. And a follow-up appointment. Yeah, I understand. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. I feel a little better knowing what's going on.
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Heindel. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns before we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. You answered all my questions. Thank you again, Doctor Hembrey. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and explain things so clearly. I'll see you at the follow-up appointment then.
DOCTOR: Very well. You’re welcome, Mr. Heindel. We’ll be in touch to schedule your follow-up. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
