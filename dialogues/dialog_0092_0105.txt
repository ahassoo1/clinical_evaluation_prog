DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s good to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, I think... I’m here about getting surgery. Bariatric surgery, I mean. My wife helped me set up the appointment. Honestly, I don’t remember all the details, but it’s about losing weight, definitely.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bariatric surgery is a significant step, and it’s perfectly alright if you’re not entirely sure of all the details at this point. We’ll certainly go through everything thoroughly. Let me pull up your information here… Alright, Bradlee Kochubey, age 38. I see your wife scheduled this appointment for a consultation regarding weight loss options. To get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me a little bit more about how long you've been considering weight loss surgery, and what has led you to this decision?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. It feels like a long time, honestly. Years, probably. My wife's been worried about my health for a while now. I get tired easily, and just… things are getting harder. Moving around, playing with my kids… it’s not as easy as it used to be. I don't really remember when we started talking about surgery specifically, just that it kept coming up. I guess she did most of the research. I just… agreed it might be a good idea. Sorry, I’m not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You’re perfectly helpful, Mr. Kochubey. It’s very common to feel overwhelmed, and it’s good that you have your wife supporting you. It sounds like this is something you’ve been considering for a while, and it’s motivated by a desire to improve your quality of life. Okay, so quality of life is a major factor. Let's talk a bit more about your current health. Could you describe any specific symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… um. Like I said, I get tired really easily. Even just walking up the stairs leaves me breathless. And my knees, they bother me a lot, especially at night. It’s just… a general achiness, all over, really. And… I sweat a lot, even when I’m not doing anything. That's embarrassing sometimes. I don’t know… just feeling… uncomfortable, mostly. Is that helpful? I’m not sure what you’re looking for.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Mr. Kochubey. That gives me a good starting point. Breathlessness, knee pain, generalized achiness, and excessive sweating – those are all important things to note. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… uh. Honestly, I don’t really have much of one. I haven't been to the doctor in… a long time. I think I had the flu once, maybe? And I broke my arm when I was a kid. Nothing serious, though. I don’t take any regular medications. I… I don't really remember being sick much at all. Does that sound strange? My wife always handles all the doctor stuff, so I don't usually have to think about it.
DOCTOR: No, that doesn't sound strange at all, Mr. Kochubey. It’s fairly common for people to not have extensive medical histories, and it's good your wife is proactive about your health. Alright. And what about any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Like I said, just the broken arm when I was little, and that didn’t need surgery. Just a cast, I think. I've never had anything else. I… I'm not a fan of hospitals, to be honest. They make me nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, or obesity?
PATIENT: Um… that’s a tough one. My dad… he had some heart problems later in life, I think. And my mom, she was… overweight, I guess. And my brother, he has high blood pressure, I think. But… honestly, I don’t really know much about it. We don't really talk about health stuff much in my family. It's… a little awkward, maybe? Sorry, I'm not being very helpful again.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. It’s common for families to not openly discuss health issues. Knowing that there's a history of heart problems and high blood pressure in your family is helpful, though. Okay. Now, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I work in retail, so I’m on my feet a lot during the day, but it’s not… exercise, exactly. More like… standing. And I drive to work. I don't really have time for much else. I like to watch TV with my wife in the evenings. We eat pretty regularly, but… I guess we eat a lot of takeout. It's just easier. We don’t really cook much anymore. Is that what you mean by lifestyle? I don't really have hobbies, not really.
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me a good understanding. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never have. I drink sometimes, maybe a beer or a glass of wine with dinner on the weekends. But not very often. And definitely no drugs. Never have, never will. I don't really like feeling out of control, even a little bit. My wife doesn't drink much either. We mostly just enjoy relaxing at home. Is that okay? Is this information important? I sometimes feel like I'm not giving you the right answers.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. You’re providing exactly the information I need. Knowing that you drink occasionally is helpful. Okay. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. My wife always checks before I take anything, just in case. I haven't had any trouble with food, either. I… I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. It feels like I'm rambling. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling at all, Mr. Kochubey. This is all very helpful information. Okay, so to summarize, you’re a 38-year-old male presenting with concerns about weight loss and potential bariatric surgery. You’ve experienced fatigue, knee pain, and excessive sweating. You have a limited medical history, with no previous surgeries or known allergies. Your family history includes heart problems and high blood pressure. You live a relatively sedentary lifestyle and drink alcohol occasionally. Now, before we discuss bariatric surgery options, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s… that’s fine. Physical exam is okay. I guess I should have expected that. Just… please be gentle with my knees. They really bother me sometimes.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kochubey. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We’ll just take a look at your overall health and get some baseline measurements. First, let’s check your lymph nodes. No swelling here. Good. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again… and exhale. Sounds clear, but your heart rate is a little elevated, which could be related to your fatigue. Blood pressure is 145/90, and pulse is 88. That’s a little high, but not drastically so. We’ll want to monitor that. Now, let’s listen to your abdomen. Sounds normal. No unusual sounds. Alright, now let’s take a look at your knees. I notice some mild swelling and tenderness on both knees, particularly with movement. Range of motion is slightly limited. We may need to order some imaging to assess the extent of the cartilage damage. Okay, your height is 5’8” and your weight is 240 pounds. That gives us a BMI of 38.7, which classifies as obesity. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. Overall, your findings are consistent with the symptoms you’ve described. We’ll need to run some blood work to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and other key markers. Do you have any questions about the exam?
PATIENT: Uh… no, that doesn’t sound too bad. It’s… it’s good to know what’s going on, I guess. Blood work… okay. Will that take long? And… will it be expensive? I don’t have… insurance, so… I’m a little worried about the cost. I don’t want to get in over my head.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Kochubey. I understand that the cost of medical care can be a significant burden, especially without insurance. Let me check the pricing for the blood work panel we need. It's a fairly standard metabolic panel, plus some additional tests to assess your liver function and thyroid levels. It comes to approximately $350. We can also discuss payment options or potential assistance programs available at the clinic. The blood work will give us a better understanding of your overall health and help us determine if you’re a suitable candidate for bariatric surgery. It will also help rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your weight gain or fatigue. We’ll need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results, and we can then explore the different bariatric surgery options available, such as gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy. Before we proceed, I want to emphasize that bariatric surgery is a significant undertaking. It requires a commitment to lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise. We’ll also need to assess your psychological readiness for the procedure. Would you be open to a consultation with a psychologist to discuss this further?
PATIENT: $350… okay, I think I can manage that. Just barely. I’ll have to ask my wife. And… a psychologist? I don’t know about that. I feel fine… mostly. I just want to lose weight and feel better, that’s all. I don’t need someone to… dig around in my head. But… if it’s necessary… I guess I can talk to someone. My wife will probably want me to anyway. She worries a lot. Just… I hope it’s not too expensive. Everything feels so complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Kochubey. It’s perfectly normal to feel apprehensive about talking to a psychologist. However, a consultation can be very helpful in assessing your emotional readiness for surgery and identifying any potential challenges you might face. It’s not about “digging around in your head,” but rather ensuring you have the support you need to succeed. The cost of a one-time psychological evaluation is approximately $150. We can schedule it alongside the blood work if you’re comfortable. Before we move forward with either, I want to reiterate that bariatric surgery is not a quick fix. It requires a lifelong commitment to lifestyle changes, and it’s important to be fully prepared for that commitment. To summarize, we’ll schedule blood work and, if you’re comfortable, a psychological evaluation. Once we have the results, we can discuss the different surgical options and develop a personalized plan. In the meantime, I recommend starting to make small, healthy changes to your diet and exercise routine. Even a short walk each day can make a difference. Do you have any questions or concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work and… maybe the psychologist. My wife will definitely want me to do that. Just… I’m worried about failing. About not being able to stick to the diet, about letting everyone down. About… just making things worse. I don’t want to go through all this trouble and end up right back where I started. It feels like a lot. Is it… is it really worth it?
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Mr. Kochubey. It’s perfectly natural to feel anxious about taking such a significant step, and it’s good that you’re acknowledging those fears. Many patients experience similar anxieties before undergoing bariatric surgery. Let me assure you that you’re not alone in this, and we’ll provide you with all the support you need to succeed. The pre-operative program includes extensive education on nutrition, exercise, and emotional coping strategies. We also have a support group where you can connect with other patients who are going through the same journey. As for whether it's worth it, that’s a question only you can answer. However, if you’re committed to improving your health and quality of life, and you’re willing to make the necessary lifestyle changes, bariatric surgery can be a life-changing experience. It can help you lose weight, improve your energy levels, and reduce your risk of serious health problems. We’ll take things one step at a time. First, we’ll run the blood work and psychological evaluation. Then, we’ll discuss the results and develop a personalized plan that’s tailored to your needs and goals. We’ll be with you every step of the way. Let’s schedule those appointments now. Do you have any availability next week?
PATIENT: Okay. Next week is… probably best. I have to work most days, but… evenings are usually free. Monday or Tuesday would work. Whatever’s easier for you. Just… please don’t rush me. I need to… process all this. And… thank you. For not making me feel like I’m crazy for being so worried. It helps.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Kochubey. We’ll take things at your pace. There’s absolutely no rush. And you're not crazy at all for being worried; it's a perfectly normal reaction to a significant life decision. Alright, let's schedule you for blood work on Monday evening at 6:00 PM and the psychological evaluation on Tuesday evening at 6:30 PM. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s… perfect. Monday and Tuesday. I’ll… I’ll try to get a good night’s sleep. Thank you, Doctor Giganti. I appreciate your patience. I guess… I’ll see you next week.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. I look forward to seeing you next week. Have a good evening.
