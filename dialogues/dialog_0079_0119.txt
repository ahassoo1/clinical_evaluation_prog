DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you’re 57 years of age. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… a delicate matter, really. It’s about… a problem. A rather unpleasant problem, if I may say so. It concerns my… companion. He's been experiencing a… discharge. A rather unsightly one, truthfully.
DOCTOR: A discharge, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a discharge. It’s… well, it’s not normal, is it? And he’s quite embarrassed. I’m bringing him in because he won’t do it himself, you understand. Men. Honestly, they think they can just ignore things and they'll go away. It’s quite foolish, really. Is this… common?
DOCTOR: Hmm. A discharge in a male patient. It can be a number of things, Ms. Wartick. It's certainly not something to be ignored, as you rightly point out. To help me understand, could you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, let me see… It’s… yellowish, I believe. And rather… thick. Not watery, thankfully, but… substantial. And there’s an… odor. Not a pleasant odor, naturally. It’s been going on for… oh, a week, perhaps a little longer. He’s not been feeling quite himself, either. A bit… listless, you know? Not his usual energetic self at all.
DOCTOR: Yellowish and thick, with an odor…and listlessness. Right. Has he experienced any pain or burning sensation when urinating?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens, pain? I hadn’t asked him specifically about pain. He doesn’t complain much, you see. He just… grumbles. Let me think… I suppose he winced a little the other day, but he said it was just a draft. Men. Always stoic. No, I haven't directly heard him complain of pain. But, now that you mention it, he has been going to the lavatory a bit more frequently, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, with possible discomfort... and no direct complaint of pain, naturally. Has he noticed any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? Oh, no, nothing like that. He doesn’t do fevers. He’s a very healthy man, usually. Always out in the garden, digging and pruning. And abdominal pain? No, he hasn’t mentioned any pain down there. Though, he’s been a bit… preoccupied, if you know what I mean. Just… not himself. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to worry. This is very unlike him.
DOCTOR: Right. Preoccupied, no fever, no abdominal pain... Ms. Wartick, while I appreciate your detailed account, I really need to examine your… companion directly to get a proper assessment. It’s rather difficult to diagnose based on secondhand information, you understand. I’ll need to perform a physical examination. Is he here with you today?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Yes, well, of course. A physical examination. I suppose that’s… necessary. He is here, Doctor. He’s in the waiting room. He’s rather shy, you see, and… doesn't like doctors. That's why I’m doing the explaining. He's terribly embarrassed about all this, honestly. A perfectly respectable man, he is.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, ask him to come back with me. And Ms. Wartick, I assure you, everything will be kept as discreet as possible. A physical examination is essential for determining the cause of his symptoms. I'll need to take a thorough history from him as well, of course.
PATIENT: Alright. I shall go and fetch him. He won’t be pleased, I can assure you. He’ll probably grumble something about wasting his time. Honestly, men… They just don’t understand the importance of preventative care. I'll be right back, Doctor. And please, do be gentle with him. He’s a bit… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Sensitive... Of course.
PATIENT: .
