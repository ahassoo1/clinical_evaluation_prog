DOCTOR: Hi Candice, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Yoshino. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Yes, well, I suppose I’m here because… well, one has to, doesn’t one? New to the area, you see. Medicare required it, I believe. Honestly, all this paperwork… It’s quite a bother. I simply need a quick check-up to satisfy them. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Candice. I understand completely. New patient visits required by insurance are very common, and paperwork can be a pain. We’ll get through it. A general check-up is perfectly fine. It’s important to establish a baseline even if it's just for insurance purposes. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what’s been going on with your health lately?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not much. I’ve been… existing. Perfectly well, as far as I can recall. Though my husband, Harold, is always fretting about something or other. He worries unduly. I assure you, I’m quite robust for my age. I simply want this over with quickly, if you don’t mind. Are there forms I need to fill out still? It feels like I’ve been filling out forms for an eternity.
DOCTOR: I hear you about the forms – we can definitely minimize those. It's good to hear you’re feeling robust! Even if you're feeling well, a quick check-up is a good idea. Just to be thorough, could you tell me a little about any health issues you have had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The past? That was… a very long time ago. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I believe I had the measles as a child. And perhaps tonsillitis. Nothing serious, mind you. My mother always insisted on a good strong tonic after anything like that. Harold handles most of the medical details now. He's terribly organized, thank heavens. Is this really necessary? All this probing about ancient history…
DOCTOR: I understand. It is a lot to recall. Knowing about things like measles or tonsillitis helps give us a complete picture, even if they were long ago. It’s alright if you don’t remember specifics – Harold's help is wonderful. Has Harold mentioned any concerns he has about your health currently?
PATIENT: He worries about my… my balance, I think. And sometimes my appetite. He makes a dreadful fuss about me not eating enough, but honestly, I simply don’t have a large appetite. A small portion is perfectly sufficient. He’s a good man, Harold, but a bit of a hypochondriac, if you understand. Always checking his blood pressure and reading about every illness imaginable. He'll probably call tomorrow with a list of things I'm supposedly ailing from. Is it almost over? This chair is rather uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like Harold is very attentive, perhaps a little overzealous, but it's good he's looking out for you. It's also helpful to know he monitors his own health. Okay, so balance and appetite are the main things we're looking at. Have you noticed any issues with your balance?
PATIENT: Well… occasionally. A slight… wobble, perhaps. Nothing alarming. I simply put it down to age. One expects a little instability as the years go by, doesn’t one? I’ve never fallen, mind you. And I certainly don’t intend to start. It's mostly when I get up quickly from a seated position. It's nothing to fuss about, I assure you. And frankly, I’m rather tired of discussing my bodily functions with strangers. Can we speed this along? Is there a blood test involved? I dislike needles immensely.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your reluctance to dwell on these things, Candice. And I assure you, we'll move as quickly as possible. It's good to know you haven't fallen, but a slight wobble is worth investigating, even if it’s just to rule things out. We might need a small blood test, depending on what we find during a brief physical exam. But let’s do that first, and we can discuss the blood test then. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Honestly. I haven’t had one of those in decades. Must you poke and prod? It seems rather… intrusive. And I’m wearing my good dress. I suppose it can’t be avoided, can it? Very well. But please be gentle. And do hurry. I have a luncheon with the ladies from the garden club this afternoon, and I simply must be on time.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Candice. We'll be as gentle as possible, and I'll be mindful of your dress. This will just be a quick check of your heart, lungs, and a few other things. It shouldn't be intrusive at all. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, could I just listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Very well. But please do be quick about it. I’ve never been particularly fond of doctors, you see. Always cold stethoscopes and prodding fingers. Get on with it, then. But gently, please. And do explain what you're listening for, if you don't mind. I do dislike surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'm listening to your heart and lungs to check for any unusual sounds – things like extra beats, murmurs, or any wheezing or crackling that might indicate a problem. Everything sounds regular so far. I’m also listening to see if your breathing is clear and even. Breathing sounds clear on both sides. A little diminished, but that can be common with age. Now, let's just check your pulse and blood pressure. I’ll do that on both arms.
PATIENT: Diminished? That sounds… alarming. Is something wrong? Harold will be terribly upset if I’ve developed some sort of… chest ailment. He’s always predicting the worst. Just get it over with, dear. And be quick. My luncheon starts in… oh, goodness, I’ve completely lost track of time. Blood pressure, you say? On both arms? Honestly, the indignity of it all. This is hardly a pleasant experience.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Candice. “Diminished” just means it’s a little quieter than what we might see in a younger person – perfectly normal. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a problem, just something we note. It’s good to check both arms for comparison, as sometimes there’s a slight difference. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80 on your right arm and 128/78 on your left – very stable. Now, could I just quickly check your reflexes?
PATIENT: Reflexes? Honestly! What next? I feel like a science experiment. Must you tap my knees with that little hammer? I suppose… very well. But please be gentle. I’ve heard stories about doctors ruining people’s knees with those contraptions. And do hurry, dear. I really must be going. This has taken far too long already. I’m starting to feel quite faint. And I left my good purse at the garden club, you see…
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Candice. I will be very gentle. This is just a quick check to see how your nervous system is responding. It doesn't take long at all, and I promise to be as careful as possible. It will not ruin your knees, I assure you! Now, just relax your legs. I'm going to tap just below your kneecap. Okay, that was good. And now the other one. Both reflexes are present and equal, which is good. Now, just one last quick thing – could I just take a look in your ears and throat?
PATIENT: Ears and throat? Oh, for goodness sake! Honestly, what are you trying to do, dismantle me piece by piece? I came for a quick check-up, not a full-body examination. I distinctly remember being told this wouldn't take long! I suppose… very well. But please be careful with that little light. It’s terribly bright, and I have sensitive eyes. And do hurry. I really must get going. The ladies will be wondering where I am. And I left my good gloves at the garden club, too, you see… This is a complete disaster! Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: I apologize if this is taking longer than expected, Candice. I just want to be thorough and make sure everything is alright. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears to make sure there’s no blockage or infection. Both ears look clear. Now, just open your mouth wide and say "Ah." Your throat looks clear as well. Okay, that’s everything. Overall, your physical exam is quite normal for your age. Your heart and lungs sound good, your reflexes are normal, and your ears and throat are clear. We did note diminished breath sounds, which is common, but nothing concerning at this time. Now, let's talk about your balance and appetite, and then we can decide if any further testing is needed.
PATIENT: Balance and appetite… oh, goodness. Well, as I said, my husband worries. He says I wobble slightly when I get up. And I confess, my appetite isn’t what it used to be. I simply don’t have the same enthusiasm for food anymore. Everything tastes… bland. He made a dreadful fuss about me not finishing my soup last night. Said I was wasting away to nothing. Honestly, it's terribly embarrassing. He even started measuring my portions! A perfectly ridiculous waste of time, if you ask me. I simply want him to stop fussing. Is that too much to ask? And really, I must be going. This has taken far, far too long. What about my luncheon?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candice. It sounds like Harold is very well-meaning but perhaps a little overzealous with his monitoring. It's perfectly normal for appetite to decrease with age, and a slight wobble when getting up is common as well. Before we dismiss everything, let's explore a few possibilities. Has this change in appetite been sudden, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Gradual, I suppose. It's been… months, perhaps. A very long time. It didn’t happen overnight. I simply found myself eating less and less. The food… doesn't appeal to me as it once did. Everything tastes a bit… muted. And I do get tired easily, which may be related. Harold keeps saying I look pale. He’s convinced I’m anemic. Honestly, he reads the most dreadful things on the internet! He’s started making me all sorts of… concoctions. Beet juice, I believe. It’s absolutely dreadful. Is there any way to make him stop? I simply want to live in peace. And really, I must be going. The ladies will be furious if I’m late again.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candice. The gradual loss of appetite and fatigue, along with Harold’s concerns and internet research, certainly paint a picture. It sounds like we need to investigate this further. A gradual decrease in appetite and fatigue could be due to a number of things – it could be as simple as a vitamin deficiency, or something else entirely. To get a better understanding, I'd like to order a few blood tests. These will check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and complete blood count to rule out any underlying causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, goodness. Not needles, I hope? I detest needles. Is there absolutely no other way? Perhaps a… a potion? Or some sort of magical scan? Honestly, the indignity of it all. Harold would insist, of course. He's always convinced blood tests are the answer to everything. But I really dislike them. And the waiting! And the potential for… unpleasant results. Very well. If it must be done. But please, make it as quick and painless as possible. And could I have a little something sweet afterward? Perhaps a biscuit? I feel faint just thinking about it. This is a complete disaster. I’m going to be late for luncheon, and Harold will probably make me drink beet juice for the rest of my life.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Candice. I promise we’ll make it as quick and painless as possible. Our phlebotomist is very experienced and gentle. It will be a relatively small amount of blood, and it shouldn't take long at all. And yes, a biscuit afterward sounds like a perfect idea. We’ll also make sure to explain all the results to you thoroughly, and discuss any potential treatment options if needed. I'll write you a lab order now. It includes a Complete Blood Count , a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel , a Thyroid Stimulating Hormone test, and Vitamin D and B12 levels. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to get you in right away. Do you have any questions about the tests before we proceed?
PATIENT: Tests… oh, goodness. What is a Complete Blood Count? And what does this… CMP do? And what about this… TSH thing? It sounds terribly complicated. Honestly, I don't understand a word you're saying! I suppose… Harold will know. He reads all these things on the internet. But I really don't want to know all the details. It just makes me anxious. Just… tell me if something is wrong. And could I have a biscuit with jam? Beet juice is simply not an option. Is that understood? And really, I must be going. The ladies will have started without me. This is a complete catastrophe.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Candice. It is a lot of medical jargon, and I apologize for that. Let me explain in simpler terms. The Complete Blood Count just checks the different types of cells in your blood – red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets – to make sure everything is normal. The Comprehensive Metabolic Panel checks things like your kidney and liver function, as well as your blood sugar levels. And the TSH test checks your thyroid gland, which controls your metabolism. Basically, these tests give us a general overview of your health and can help us identify any potential problems. We’ll go over the results together when they come back, and I’ll explain everything in plain language. I'll write down the names of the tests for you, and also include a brief explanation of each one. And yes, a biscuit with jam is perfectly fine. Here’s the lab order. The nurse will walk you down and get you checked in. Is there anything else I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. This is… overwhelming. All these tests… and the explanations… and the potential for… unpleasant results. It’s simply too much. I suppose… thank you. For trying to explain, anyway. Harold will be relieved that I'm finally getting these tests done. He’s always insisting on being proactive. But I really wish he hadn't convinced me. No, I don’t think there’s anything else. Just… please tell the nurse to be gentle with the needle. And could I have the biscuit before I leave? Just in case… it's a long walk. This is a complete disaster.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Candice. We’ll make sure the nurse is gentle, and you can have a biscuit before you leave – a reward for being so brave. We'll call you with the results as soon as they're available. And please, don't hesitate to call us if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
