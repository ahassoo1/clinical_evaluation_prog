DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome to the clinic. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, um… well, my wife, she mostly handles these things, but… something about paperwork? For, you know, time off? I think it's for when I need to… be away from things for a bit. It’s a bit fuzzy, honestly. FMLA, maybe? Or… disability? She mentioned something like that. I just need the forms filled out, if you could help with that.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds as though you require medical documentation for either Family and Medical Leave Act paperwork or disability benefits. To properly complete these forms – and it’s quite important to be accurate – I will need to understand the underlying medical reason for this request. Simply filling out paperwork without a thorough assessment would be… irresponsible, and potentially detrimental to your claim. Could you tell me, in your own words, what is going on that necessitates time away from work?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Yes, of course, responsible. That’s good. It’s just… it’s hard to explain. Things have been… not quite right, lately. I feel… tired. Very tired. More than just old age, you know? And… sometimes my memory isn’t what it used to be. It comes and goes. It’s not… a sudden thing, it’s been building for a while, I suppose. My wife says I repeat myself a lot. And I… forget things. Important things. She's been very patient. It makes it hard to do my work, honestly. Directing things when you can’t remember what you directed… it’s not ideal. Does that make any sense? I’m sorry, I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Limtiaco. Fatigue and cognitive difficulties – memory lapses, repetition – are certainly concerning. It is important that we investigate the cause of these symptoms. While it could be a number of things, we need to rule out any serious underlying medical issues. To get a clearer picture, let's start with a more detailed history. How long have you been experiencing this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long… that’s a good question. It’s not like it was a single day, you see. It’s crept up on me, slowly. I suppose… maybe the last six months? Possibly longer. It’s hard to pinpoint. Six months feels about right, though. It's definitely worse recently. Before, I could push through it, you know? Still get things done. Now… it’s a real effort. I find myself needing to sit down more often. And then I forget why I sat down! It's… frustrating. Is that helpful? I'm not very good at these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. A gradual onset over six months suggests we should consider a range of possibilities. And the fact that it’s progressively worsening is also important. Now, regarding the memory lapses – can you describe what those are like?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, sometimes I’ll be in the middle of a sentence, and the word… it just disappears. Like it’s been swallowed. Or I’ll go into a room and forget what I went in there for. My wife says I tell the same stories over and over. Not intentionally, of course! I don't know I've told them. And… I struggle with names sometimes. Faces are okay, usually, but the names… they just won’t stick. It’s mostly little things, I suppose. But they add up. It's like… a fog. A little fog in my head. It’s not constant, but it’s there. And it worries my wife, which worries me.
DOCTOR: I see. Repetitive questioning and difficulty recalling names… these are certainly indications of cognitive decline. Now, let's move onto other aspects of your health. Do you have any other medical conditions – things you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my prostate looked at, years ago. That was… routine, I think. Nothing serious. And my blood pressure… it’s been a bit high, on occasion. My doctor keeps an eye on it. And I had a little trouble with my knees, a while back. Arthritis, I believe. Nothing major. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. I try to eat well, mostly. And I used to walk a lot, before… well, before the tiredness. Does that… cover it? I'm sure my wife has a list somewhere, but she's not here.
DOCTOR: Very well. We’ll confirm this information with your medical records. Now, are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I take something for my blood pressure. A little white pill. I forget the name, honestly. My wife handles all that. And sometimes, when my knees are acting up, I take ibuprofen. Over-the-counter stuff, nothing fancy. That’s about it, I think. Just the blood pressure pill and the ibuprofen when I need it. She keeps a list, you know. I’m terrible with names and numbers these days. It’s frustrating for everyone involved.
DOCTOR: I’m accessing your electronic health record now. Ah, yes. You are prescribed Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension and occasionally use Ibuprofen as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I recall. Maybe a little sniffle with certain flowers, but nothing serious. No food allergies, no medication allergies… not that I know of. My wife always double-checks, of course. She’s very cautious. But to my knowledge, no allergies. I feel like I would remember something like that, wouldn’t I? It’s the names I forget, not… allergies. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Limtiaco. Now, let’s discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, or other neurological problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… that’s a tough one. My mother… she had some trouble with her memory in her later years, but we didn’t really talk about it much. It was… a different time, you know? We didn’t ask so many questions. And my father… he was a strong man, always busy. He didn’t really have time for illnesses. I don’t recall anyone specifically with Alzheimer’s or dementia, but… there was some talk of “weakness” in some of the older relatives. Just whispers, really. Nothing concrete. It’s a big family, you see. Hard to keep track of everything. I’m sorry, I’m not very helpful, am I? It’s the details that slip away.
DOCTOR: I see. A lack of definitive information is… not ideal. Now, before we proceed, I need to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife… she wouldn’t allow it! And I wouldn’t dare. Always been healthy, mostly. Tried to keep active, until… well, until recently. I enjoyed gardening, a lot. And I used to walk every morning, along the beach. But the tiredness… it makes it hard to do anything, really. It's just… exhausting. It's a shame, really. I miss being able to do things.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. Nothing excessive. My wife and I, we'll share a bottle on special occasions. Or with friends. But nothing regular. Certainly not every day. I don't have a… a strong thirst for it, if you know what I mean. It’s more of a… social thing, really. Nothing that would interfere with my health, I assure you. She always makes sure I don’t have too much. She’s very careful.
DOCTOR: I see. Now, Mr. Limtiaco, given your symptoms, and the information you’ve provided, I believe we need to proceed with a basic neurological examination and some blood work to rule out underlying medical causes. Are you amenable to that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what's going on. Blood work, examination… whatever you need. I trust your judgement. I just want to be able to… think again, you know? And remember things. It’s… unsettling, not being able to remember things. So yes, please. Do whatever you think is necessary. I’m ready, whenever you are.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please follow me to the examination room. We will begin with a brief cognitive assessment, followed by a neurological examination and then draw some blood for routine testing. This will allow us to gain a better understanding of your condition.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Lead the way, Doctor. I'll follow you. Hopefully, we can figure out what's happening. It’s just… a little worrying, all of this. Thank you for taking the time.
DOCTOR: We will proceed as efficiently as possible, Mr. Limtiaco. Please try to answer my questions as accurately and concisely as you can. Please have a seat. We'll start with a few simple memory tests. First, can you repeat these three words for me: apple, table, penny?
PATIENT: Oh, um… apple, table, penny. Yes, I can repeat them. Apple, table, penny. It's… easy enough. But will I remember them later? That’s the question, isn’t it? I hope I can. It's like trying to hold water in your hands, you know? It slips away so easily.
DOCTOR: We will see. Now, I'm going to ask you some questions about your orientation to time and place. What is today's date, Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Today’s date… Um… is it the 2nd? August… the 2nd? Yes, I think it's August 2nd. 2025, isn't it? I’m pretty sure. My wife always reminds me. I used to know these things without thinking… It’s a little embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, can you tell me what city and state we are currently in?
PATIENT: Oh… um… Is this… the rural clinic? My wife said something about it being in the country. I believe it’s… well, I honestly can’t recall the city. I’m terrible with names and places, you see. It’s all a bit of a blur. I wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… the fog, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. Now, let us move onto the physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table. I will need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes. Your heart rate is slightly elevated, but regular. Lung sounds are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are diminished in all extremities. This could indicate a neurological issue, but further testing is required. Now, I am going to check your gait and balance. Please stand up and walk a few steps for me.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That's… a little wobbly. Okay. Like this? It's… difficult. I used to walk so easily. Now… I feel like I'm going to fall. It's just not the same.
DOCTOR: Yes, your gait is somewhat unsteady, and your balance is impaired. This is consistent with a potential neurological issue. Now, I will need to draw some blood for a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test. This will help rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Please have a seat, and we'll get this done quickly.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Blood work… yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. I'm not fond of needles, but I understand it’s necessary. Just… try to be quick, if you could. My wife always says I faint easily. I just hope it doesn’t take too long. It’s the waiting, you see. That’s the worst part.
DOCTOR: It will be as quick as possible, Mr. Limtiaco. Please relax your arm. Okay, all done. Just a little pressure on the site. Keep pressure on that for a few minutes to prevent bruising. We will send these samples to the lab immediately. The results should be available within a few days. In the meantime, I am going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results and further course of action. I am also going to order an MRI of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. The scheduling department will contact you to arrange those appointments. Does that sound acceptable, Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds… thorough. An MRI, too? Yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just want to figure out what’s happening, you see? It’s the uncertainty that’s so… unsettling. So yes, an MRI, follow-up appointments… I’ll let the scheduling department contact me. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this. I just hope it’s not… anything serious.
DOCTOR: We will proceed with all due diligence, Mr. Limtiaco. While it's too early to draw any definitive conclusions, it’s important to rule out all possibilities. I will provide you with a printed summary of today’s findings, including the list of ordered tests. Please keep this for your records. For now, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activities and ensure you get plenty of rest. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as headaches, vision changes, or weakness – please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions before you leave, Mr. Limtiaco?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I don’t think so. Headaches, vision changes… I’ll keep that in mind. Just… try to remember. That’s the hard part, isn't it? I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. And I’ll try to rest. Thank you for your time. I hope… I hope it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please follow up as directed. If anything changes, don't hesitate to contact the office. Stop.
