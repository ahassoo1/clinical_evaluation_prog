DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin' to ya, Doctor. Hmm… what does bring me in? Now, let me think a moment… It's me ears, I reckon. They ain't what they used to be, that's for sure. Things are gettin' a bit muffled, ya know? Not real bad, but… hard to hear folks sometimes. Especially the young ones, they mumble so!
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing, you say?
PATIENT: Aye, muffled. Like talkin' underwater, maybe? Not all the time, mind ya. More when there's a bit of noise around. Television's alright if I turn it up a bit… though the neighbors probably aren't too thrilled about that! I don't rightly recall when it started, though. Seems like it's been gradual.
DOCTOR: Gradual onset… I see. And has this affected one ear more than the other, Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Oh, now that's a good question… Hmm. I… I honestly couldn't say. They both feel… the same, I suppose. Maybe the left one's a little worse, but it's hard to tell. I don't pay much attention to 'em individually, ya know? Just that things aren't as clear as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any ringing in your ears, dizziness, or pain?
PATIENT: Ringing… now, sometimes, yeah. A little bit. Like a high-pitched whine, but it doesn't last long. Not bothersome, usually. Dizziness… no, not really. I get a bit unsteady on me feet sometimes, but I think that's just old age catchin' up with me! And no pain, thankfully. Just… quietness.
DOCTOR: Quietness, and intermittent tinnitus. Have you been exposed to any loud noises recently, or throughout your life – perhaps in a workplace, or hobbies?
PATIENT: Loud noises… well, now… I worked in a shoe factory for… oh, goodness, must be fifty years or more. Lots of machines whirrin' and clatterin'. Always had to wear earplugs, but… I reckon some of that noise still got through. Didn’t think much of it at the time, ya know? Just part of the job. And hobbies… not really. Just liked to sit and read, mostly.
DOCTOR: Fifty years in a shoe factory… that’s significant. Alright, Mr. Schneer, I'd like to take a look in your ears and do a quick hearing test. That will give me a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Sounds sensible. A look in me ears, ya say? Never had that done before, but go right ahead, Doctor. Whatever ya think is best. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you'll just have a seat here, I'll get started. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the examination.
PATIENT: Right then. I'll let ya know, Doctor. Don’t you worry. Never been one for complainin’. Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer, I'm just going to take a quick look in each ear now. … Hmm. There appears to be some cerumen – earwax – in both canals, obstructing the view somewhat. The tympanic membranes themselves appear normal in color, but difficult to assess fully due to the wax. Now, I’m going to perform a quick hearing test. I’ll put these headphones on you and you'll indicate when you hear a tone in each ear. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Sounds alright to me, Doctor. Earwax, ya say? Well, I have been scratchin' me ears a bit lately… Headphones are fine. Just tell me what to do. I’m not much good with fancy equipment, ya know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. When you hear a beep in either ear, please raise your hand. It doesn't matter how quiet it is, just raise your hand when you detect a sound. We'll start with the right ear. … Okay. And now the left ear. … Alright, that’s enough for now. The results indicate mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in both ears, more pronounced at higher frequencies. This is consistent with noise-induced hearing loss, and the cerumen is certainly contributing to the difficulty.
PATIENT: Sensorineural… noise-induced… well, that figures, I suppose. All those machines in the factory… So, what does that mean, Doctor? Is it bad? Will I go deaf?
DOCTOR: Now, Mr. Schneer, let's not jump to conclusions. “Deaf” is a rather strong term. It means you have some difficulty hearing certain sounds, especially quieter ones and higher-pitched frequencies. It’s not uncommon at your age, and especially given your work history. The good news is, we can address this. First, I recommend we remove the excess cerumen in both ears. That alone may improve your hearing significantly. Afterwards, we can discuss options such as hearing aids if you continue to have difficulty. We will start with the cerumen removal. I can perform that in the office today. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Cerumen removal… sounds… practical. I suppose. Alright then, Doctor, if ya think that's best. Get rid of the wax, and see how things are. Hearing aids… well, let's not talk about them yet. One step at a time, eh? Get rid of the wax first. Yes. That sounds sensible.
DOCTOR: Very good. Cerumen removal it is. It may be a little uncomfortable, a mild sensation of pressure. Just let me know if it becomes painful. I’ll use irrigation with warm water. It usually takes only a few minutes per ear. …Alright, that’s the right ear done. Now for the left. … There we go. Both ears cleared. Now, let’s repeat a quick hearing test to assess the improvement. …Alright, that's done. The hearing test shows a modest improvement with cerumen removal, but still indicates mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss.
PATIENT: Modest improvement… well, that’s… somethin’. Better than nothin’, I reckon. Still can’t hear too well, though, huh? So, what now, Doctor? Back to those… hearin’ aids ya mentioned?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Schneer, given the persistent hearing loss despite cerumen removal, I believe a hearing aid evaluation is the next logical step. A qualified audiologist can perform a comprehensive assessment to determine the best type and fit for your needs. They can also provide counseling on how to use and maintain the aids. I have a referral list here. I recommend you schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Ignoring the hearing loss will only exacerbate the problem and can lead to social isolation.
PATIENT: Oh. Right. A hearin' aid evaluation… with an audiologist. That's… a lot of names. Social isolation… well, I mostly keep to myself these days, but… Alright then, Doctor. I suppose I will give 'em a call. It’s just… a bit overwhelming, ya know? All this… fuss. But… thank ya, Doctor. For explainin' things. I’ll give ‘em a ring.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It is a lot to take in, and I understand your apprehension. Don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns along the way. I’ll also provide you with a summary of today’s visit and the referral list. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all, Doctor. Paperwork's good. Thank ya kindly. I appreciate ya takin' the time to sort me out. I reckon I'll be seein' ya again, one way or another. Have a good day now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. Take your time. And yes, I expect to see you again. Don't hesitate to call if you need anything. Have a good day as well.
