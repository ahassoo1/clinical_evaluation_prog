DOCTOR: Hi Lamark, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right, Dr. Hernandez. Good to meet you too. Well, I’m trying out for a… a sports team. They want a physical first, you know? Just to make sure I’m still in okay shape. It’s… important to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s great! A sports team, excellent. And how old are you, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Sixty-two. Yeah, I know, a bit old for some things, but I keep myself moving. Don’t want to get rusty, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, sixty-two. That’s fantastic that you're staying active! We'll definitely see what's going on. Just to get a good baseline, have you had a physical exam recently – within the last year, perhaps?
PATIENT: Uh… no, not really. It’s been… a while. Honestly, I haven’t been to a doctor in… I don’t even remember. Everything's usually been okay, so I just… haven't needed to. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, it's not bad, Lamark, just good to know. We'll do a thorough check-up today. Alright, let's start with some basic questions. Do you have any current medical problems – anything that’s been bothering you, even if it seems small?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My knees sometimes ache, especially when it's cold. And I get a little winded going up stairs, but… that’s just age, right? Nothing serious. I don’t think so, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee aches and getting winded with stairs. We’ll definitely take a look at those. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been pretty healthy, or at least I thought so. Never been told I have anything. I eat okay, I guess. Lots of… meat. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's good to hear you've been generally healthy! We can talk about diet later if you'd like. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been in the hospital for anything?
PATIENT: No, not ever. Nope. Broken a bone or two when I was a kid, but nothing that needed a hospital. Just a cast, you know? A long time ago.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. Now, thinking about your family - are there any medical problems that run in your family?
PATIENT: Uh… that’s a tough one. My family… well, we don’t really talk about that stuff much. My parents are gone now, and I didn't really ask them a lot about their health. I think my father had… something with his heart, maybe? But I’m not sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright, it’s common for family medical history to be a bit unclear. We’ll proceed as best we can. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I’m in the sun, but I just put some cream on it. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. I believe in letting the body heal itself, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Now, before we move on to the physical exam, let's quickly talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never touched any of that. Bad for you, right? I try to stay as healthy as I can. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very good to hear. Okay, now let's get started with the physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your overall condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Get it over with, really. I got things to do. Let’s just get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lamark. I understand. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 145/90. That’s a little elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart. Heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. Not necessarily concerning, but we'll need to monitor it. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Okay, I’m going to check your pulse and reflexes now. Pulse is 78 and reflexes are normal. Now, can you stand up and I’ll check your gait and balance?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Just tell me what to do. What do you see? Am I doing it wrong? I haven't had anyone look at my walk in… a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lamark. Your gait is slightly unsteady, and there's a bit of a shuffling movement. Nothing major, but it's something we should note. And, can you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. This table's a bit cold. What are you looking for now? Hope you're not going to poke me too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just going to listen to your abdomen now. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now I will check your knees. There’s some crepitus in both knees, and mild swelling. It seems like you have some osteoarthritis developing. Does this cause you a lot of pain?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s the knees I was talking about. Doesn’t hurt all the time, just when it’s cold or when I… overdo it, you know? Like after a good workout. It's just… achey. I just thought it was getting old. Is that bad? Do I need… shots?
DOCTOR: Okay, Lamark. It’s not necessarily “bad,” it's a common condition with age and activity. We can definitely discuss options to manage the pain. Shots – corticosteroids or hyaluronic acid injections – are one possibility, but we can also explore physical therapy, weight management, and over-the-counter pain relievers. Before we decide, I'd like to order some X-rays of your knees to get a better look at the joint space and confirm the extent of the osteoarthritis. Also, I’d like to check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels with a blood test. Do you have any objections to these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… fine. Whatever you think is best. I just… want to get back to my training. Is that too much to ask? Just tell me when and where to go. I got things to do, you know? This is taking a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lamark. I understand. We’ll get you sorted as quickly as possible. I will have the nurse draw some blood for the cholesterol and blood sugar tests before you leave today. And I'll write you a referral for X-rays of your knees at the imaging center down the street – they take walk-ins. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best plan to get you back to training. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Just… let me know when I can expect the results. And where to go for the X-rays. This whole thing is… a bit much, really. I just want to know if I can keep playing.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lamark. I understand your frustration. The nurse will give you the information for the imaging center and a timeframe for when to expect the results – usually within 2-3 business days. I'll also call you personally once I have them to discuss the next steps. In the meantime, try to avoid any strenuous activity that causes significant pain in your knees. We want to avoid further aggravation. Is there anything else I can answer for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s it. Just… get this over with, so I can get back to training. Thanks, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lamark. I'll have the nurse come in to assist you with the blood draw. Thank you for coming in today. I hope you have a good rest of your day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
