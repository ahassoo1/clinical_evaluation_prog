DOCTOR: Hi Sherrell, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ah, good day to you, Doctor. It is… well, it is the words. They do not come so easy now. I find myself… searching. It is frustrating, you understand? I used to be very good with… with everything, really. Compensation, benefits… important things. But the words… they escape me. I am Sherrell Gyamfi, by the way. Perhaps you have it written down?
DOCTOR: Yes, Sherrell, I do have your name and a few basic details here. It sounds like you’re experiencing some difficulty with finding the right words, or recalling them when you need to. That is frustrating, and I understand why you’re here. Just to clarify a bit – when did you first start noticing this difficulty with words?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, good. Good that you have it. When… when did it start? That is… a difficult question. It was not sudden, you see. More… gradual. Perhaps… six months ago? Maybe longer. It is hard to pinpoint. I remember… struggling a bit with reports at work. Then… little things. Forgetting names. Then… it became more noticeable, even to myself. It’s… unsettling. I am widowed, you know. My wife… she always knew the right words.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months or so, a gradual onset. And it started with work reports, then progressed to forgetting names… I appreciate you sharing that, Sherrell. It’s good to get a sense of how this has been developing. To help me understand a little better, can you describe what it feels like when you’re searching for a word?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. What it feels like… It is like… a fog, Doctor. A fog in my head. I know the word is there. I can almost… see it. But I cannot grasp it. It dances just out of reach. Sometimes, it comes after a long struggle. Other times… it simply disappears. It is… very tiring. I find myself avoiding conversations sometimes. Especially at work. It is… not good for business, you understand. I used to be very articulate. Very precise. Now… now I stumble. It is a bit embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A fog in your head, the word feels just out of reach… That's a very helpful way to describe it, Sherrell. And it sounds like it’s causing some frustration and impacting your work and social life. Okay. Let's do a quick run-through of some other things. Have you noticed any difficulty with other aspects of your memory, besides just finding words?
PATIENT: Other memory…? Hmm. That is… a good question. I believe… my short-term memory is not what it once was. I forget where I put things. Keys, glasses… small things, mostly. And sometimes… I repeat myself. My son… he points it out. He says I tell the same stories over and over. But… honestly, Doctor, it is hard to say what is normal at my age, you understand? I am… getting older. Sixty years… it takes its toll. I do remember dates, important events… mostly. But everyday things… they are… less certain.
DOCTOR: Okay, some difficulty with short-term memory – misplacing things, repeating stories. And you're right, some memory changes are normal with age. But it's good that you're noticing these things and bringing them to my attention. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes in health…? Hmm. Well, my eyesight has been… not so good lately. I need stronger glasses, I think. And my knees… they ache. Old sports injury, you see. Nothing serious. I also… I tire more easily. A bit of shortness of breath sometimes, when I walk uphill. But… I put that down to the weight, you understand? I am a large man. Not as active as I once was. I take… a few medications, for blood pressure. That is all, I think. Oh, and I have Medicare. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, eyesight changes, achy knees, fatigue, shortness of breath, and you take medication for blood pressure. And yes, Medicare is helpful to know, thank you. Let's talk about those medications for a moment. Do you remember what you're taking?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. The medications… I believe… it is a white pill. Small. I take one in the morning. And… another one. A blue pill. Smaller. I take that at night. I… I do not remember the names, you understand? My son… he manages all that for me. He brings the pills each week. I just… take them. Is that foolish? I should probably know… But I have so much on my mind these days. Work… the house… it is all a bit much, you understand?
DOCTOR: No, it's not foolish at all, Sherrell. Many people find it difficult to keep track of medications, especially if they have multiple ones. It's good that your son helps with that. I’m going to take a quick look at your chart now to see the exact names and dosages of your medications. Then, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Check the chart. Physical exam… yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just… want to understand what is happening. This… forgetting words… it is very unsettling. It makes me feel… old. And I do not want to be a burden to my son. He has his own life, you understand? So, whatever you can do… I appreciate it. Perhaps the chart will tell you something I have forgotten.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherrell, I'm seeing here that you take Lisinopril for blood pressure, and Atorvastatin for cholesterol. It also looks like you had your last physical about a year ago, and everything was generally within normal limits at that time. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to just listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a quick cognitive screening test – just a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Lisinopril… Atorvastatin… You have a good memory, Doctor! I cannot remember those names at all. Heart and lungs… reflexes… cognitive screening… Yes, yes, of course. Whatever you need. I will cooperate fully. I just… hope it is not too much trouble. I am a large man, you understand? Perhaps it will take a little longer. But I will be still. I promise. Just… please be gentle. My knees… they ache, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Sherrell. No trouble at all. And I will absolutely be gentle. I’m aware you’re a larger gentleman, and I’ll take that into consideration. Let's start with listening to your heart and lungs. If you could just take a deep breath for me… Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling that I can hear. Now, let's check your reflexes. I'm just going to tap a few places on your arms and legs with this little hammer…
PATIENT: Ah, yes. The hammer… I remember that from when I was a boy. Everything feels… different now, you understand? Slower. The tap… yes, go ahead. I will try to relax. It is… strange, feeling your hands on me like this. Not unpleasant, you understand. Just… strange. I used to be very strong. Very active. Now… well, now I mostly sit at my desk. Thinking about compensation and benefits. Important things, you understand. But… not very exciting. Go ahead with the tap, Doctor. I will try to be still.
DOCTOR: Okay, reflexes are a little bit slower than average, but that’s not necessarily concerning. Now, let’s do a quick cognitive screening test. I’m going to ask you a few simple questions, just to assess your memory and thinking skills. Nothing to worry about, just a few checks. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Ah, today’s date… Hmm. That is… a good question. Let me think… Is it still July? No… my son said something about August… August 2nd? Yes, I believe it is August 2nd. 2025. Is that correct, Doctor? I am not always certain of these things, you understand. The days… they all blend together. But I believe it is August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? I hope I am not… making a mistake.
DOCTOR: That is correct, Sherrell. August 2nd, 2025. Good. Now, can you tell me the names of three things I just named?
PATIENT: Ah, three things… You named three things? I do not… I do not remember you naming three things, Doctor. I am sorry. My mind… it is a bit foggy, you understand? Perhaps you could… repeat them? Slowly? I will try my best to remember. But… I make no promises. It is… difficult. Very difficult. Please, Doctor, repeat the three things. I am trying my best.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Sherrell. I named apple, table, and pencil. Apple, table, pencil. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Hmm. Pencil… Is that correct? Apple… Table… Pencil. Yes, I believe so. Apple… Table… Pencil. But… it took me a moment, you understand? A long moment. I feel… embarrassed. I used to be very quick. Very sharp. Now… Now I struggle with simple things. Apple… Table… Pencil. Are those correct, Doctor? Please tell me if I am wrong.
DOCTOR: Yes, those are correct, Sherrell. You remembered them. It’s alright that it took you a moment. We’re just gathering information. Okay, one last question for now. I’m going to ask you to repeat three numbers back to me. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Ah, numbers… Hmm. Numbers are… always difficult. Yes, I suppose I am ready. But… please speak slowly, Doctor. And do not use… complicated numbers. Simple numbers. One, two, three… Is that alright? Yes, simple numbers. Go ahead. I will try my best. But… I make no promises. My mind… it is a bit like a sieve, you understand? Things… they slip through. Go ahead, Doctor. I am trying.
DOCTOR: Alright, Sherrell. The numbers are 7, 2, 9. 7, 2, 9. Can you repeat those back to me?
PATIENT: Seven… Hmm. Two… Nine? Is that correct? Seven, Two, Nine? Yes, I believe so. But… it was a struggle, you understand? A long struggle. My mind… it is very slow today. Seven, Two, Nine. Are those correct, Doctor? Please tell me if I am wrong. I… I feel very foolish. I used to be so sharp. So quick. Now… now I struggle with simple numbers. Seven, Two, Nine. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Sherrell, those are correct. Seven, two, nine. You remembered them perfectly. Okay. Thank you for your patience. That was very helpful. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam and screening, it sounds like you’re experiencing some cognitive difficulties, particularly with memory and recall. This could be due to a number of things, and we need to investigate further. I want to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical causes, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. And I also recommend a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation with a neurologist. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Ah… Blood tests… Neurologist… Yes, I suppose so. If it will… help. I just… I want to understand what is happening. I do not want to… become a burden to my son. He has his own life, you understand? But… if blood tests and a neurologist will… help me understand… then yes. I am comfortable with that. But… will it be expensive? My Medicare… it does not cover everything, you understand? And… I do not want to worry my son. He… he worries enough as it is. But… if it is necessary… then yes. Blood tests and a neurologist. Is that what you recommend, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s what I recommend, Sherrell. It’s important to rule out any treatable causes for your memory difficulties. And yes, I understand your concerns about cost and worrying your son. Medicare should cover most of the cost of the blood tests and the neurological evaluation, but we’ll verify that with your insurance before we schedule anything. I’ll have my nurse draw some blood today. She’ll explain the process to you. And then I’ll get a referral sent to a neurologist – a Dr. Anya Sharma – who specializes in memory disorders. I’ll have her office call you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I want you to know that you’re not alone in this. There are many resources available to help you and your family. I’ll give you some information about those when you leave. And if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call us. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Ah… No, I do not think so. Not at the moment. You have… explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Blood tests… Neurologist… Information… Yes. Thank you. It is… reassuring to know that you are taking this seriously. I just… I want to be able to… remember things. To be able to… think clearly. To not be a burden. That is all. Thank you, Doctor Polczynski. You have been… very kind. I suppose… I will let my son know about the blood tests and the neurologist. He will… want to be involved. Thank you. Is there… anything else I should do? Any preparations I should make?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherrell. It’s my pleasure to help. For the blood tests, you don’t need to do anything special – just don’t eat or drink anything for 8 hours beforehand. And for the neurologist appointment, it’s helpful to bring a list of your medications, and any questions you have. Also, if you have a family member or friend who can accompany you, that can be helpful. I'm going to write down those instructions for you and give you the contact information for Dr. Sharma's office. I’ll also print out some information about memory resources. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Ah… No, I believe that is all. Thank you, Doctor. You have been… very helpful. Very kind. I appreciate your patience. My mind… it is not always easy to explain things. But you… you understood. Thank you. Perhaps… perhaps I will see you again after the blood tests and the neurologist appointment. Thank you again, Doctor Polczynski. You have put my mind at ease… a little.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherrell. I’m glad I could help. And yes, please do schedule a follow-up appointment after you’ve seen the neurologist. We’ll discuss the results and come up with a plan. It was a pleasure meeting you, Sherrell. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions.
