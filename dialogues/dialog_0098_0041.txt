DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astiore. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s… hard to explain exactly. It’s just… I’m getting weaker. Slowly, you understand? Not all at once, but… less strength. It makes things difficult.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. "Weakness" can mean a lot of things. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, it started in my legs, I think. A little stumbling, needing to hold onto things. Now… it’s in my arms too. Picking up things… harder than it used to be. It’s… frustrating, I guess. I used to be strong, you know? Athletic trainer for many years.
DOCTOR: I see. So it began in your legs and has gradually progressed to your arms. And you were an athletic trainer – that’s quite a physically demanding profession. Approximately how long ago did you start noticing the weakness in your legs?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. It’s been… maybe six months now? Maybe a little longer. It's hard to say exactly. Things creep up on you, you know? Didn’t think much of it at first. Just figured I was getting old! But it kept… getting worse.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. It's easy to dismiss things at first. And six months is helpful. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… other things? Let me see… sometimes my vision gets blurry. Not all the time, but… especially when I’m tired. And… sometimes I feel… numb. In my hands and feet. Like… pins and needles. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, those are definitely important things to mention, Mr. Astiore. The blurry vision and numbness… can you tell me more about the numbness?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not… constant. Comes and goes. Mostly in my toes and fingers. And… it’s hard to explain. Like… not feeling things properly. Like wearing thick gloves, maybe? And… sometimes my balance is off. I stumble more often, even on flat ground. It worries my wife.
DOCTOR: Okay. Intermittent numbness in your toes and fingers, a sensation like wearing thick gloves, and increasing difficulty with your balance. Has this balance issue led to any falls, Mr. Astiore?
PATIENT: Not a bad fall, no. Just… little stumbles. Catch myself on things. A couple times I’ve nearly gone down, but my wife is quick. She always catches me! It's… embarrassing, to be honest. I don't like relying on her like that.
DOCTOR: It's good that you have someone there to help, and it's perfectly understandable to feel that way. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just… I want to know what's happening. And if there’s something that can be done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astiore. If you could sit here for me. I'm going to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. We’ll start with your reflexes. Okay, and now your ankles. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Now, I'm going to check your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay. Squeeze your hands… yes. I can do that. Is that enough? It feels a little… weak.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. It does seem a little less strong than I’d expect. Now, can you push against my hands like you’re trying to push me away?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? It’s… hard. Not like it used to be. My arms… they feel heavy.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see. It does appear you have some weakness in both arms. Now, let's check your legs. Can you lift your right leg up while keeping it straight?
PATIENT: Okay. This is… difficult, Doctor. It feels like it’s stuck.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now the left leg. Okay, thank you, Mr. Astiore. That was helpful. Finally, let’s check your coordination. Could you touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Okay. Like this? It’s… shaky. I don't have the same control I used to.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Astiore. That’s all the physical exam for now. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, I'm concerned about possible nerve compression or a more generalized neurological issue. Your weakness, numbness, balance problems, and diminished reflexes are all things we need to investigate further. I would like to order some blood tests to start, and I think an MRI of your spine and brain would be helpful to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood tests and an MRI… alright. I just… what are you thinking it might be? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say definitively without the results of the tests, Mr. Astiore. There are several possibilities, ranging from vitamin deficiencies to nerve issues, or even something affecting your brain or spinal cord. It’s important not to jump to conclusions. We need the test results to guide us. We will rule things out systematically. However, given your symptoms, we need to take this seriously. The MRI will help us look for any structural abnormalities, and the blood tests will check for underlying causes. I’ll also get a referral to a neurologist for a consultation. They specialize in these types of conditions. Would you like me to explain the MRI process in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please. I’ve never had an MRI before. What does it involve? Is it… painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I'm… anxious, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Astiore, it’s perfectly normal to feel that way. The MRI uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain and spinal cord. You'll lie on a table that slides into a large, tunnel-like machine. It's generally not painful, but some people feel confined or claustrophobic. You'll be given earplugs to help with the noise, as it can be quite loud. You’ll need to remove any metal objects—jewelry, watches, hearing aids—before the scan, as metal can interfere with the images. The scan itself usually takes about 30-60 minutes. As for results, it depends on how busy the radiology department is, but typically, we can expect them within 3-5 business days. I’ll be sure to contact you as soon as they come in to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe weakness, difficulty breathing, or loss of bowel or bladder control – please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. No metal, earplugs, about an hour… and go to the emergency room if things get worse. I think I can remember that. And you'll call me when the results are in. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It… helps to know what to expect.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astiore. That’s what I’m here for. I'm going to go ahead and write the orders for the blood tests and the MRI now, and I’ll also get the referral to the neurologist sent over. The front desk will schedule those for you before you leave. They’ll also give you instructions on how to prepare for the MRI. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've covered everything very thoroughly, Doctor. I just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. Thank you again. I appreciate your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astiore. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and we’ll create a plan to address whatever the cause may be. I will be in touch as soon as I have the results. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, Mr. Astiore. And try not to worry too much.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
