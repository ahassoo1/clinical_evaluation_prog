DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Morning. Doctor… Neppl, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s… a problem. Down there. It’s… leaking. Not much, but it’s… wet. And kinda smelly. It’s been a few days now, I think. I don't really keep track of things like that. It’s just…uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Genard. I understand that discussing these types of issues can be difficult, and I appreciate your openness. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the leakage a bit more?
PATIENT: Leakage… Well, it's not like a whole lot, you know? More like… drops. After I… use the bathroom. And sometimes just… there. It's clear-ish, but kinda yellow sometimes. And like I said, it smells. Not good. It’s not like… a sickness smell, just… a bad smell. Is that enough? I don't know what you want me to say. It's just… leaking. It’s not normal, is it?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Genard, it’s not typical to experience leakage like that, and it’s good you came in to have it checked. Thank you for providing those details – that’s very helpful. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? Oh dear… That’s… hard to say. A few days, I told you. Maybe a week? I don't really pay attention. I been busy with my art, you see. I was working on a new sculpture, a big one with shells and driftwood, and… well, things just get lost in my head. It wasn't right after I finished the sculpture, though. Before that, maybe? I don’t know! Everything’s a blur these days. It’s just been happening. Is it important when it started?
DOCTOR: It can be helpful to pinpoint the timing, Ms. Genard, but I understand it’s difficult to recall precisely. We’ll proceed as best we can. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the leakage?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Well, no fever, I don’t think. I haven’t been feeling sick, just… annoyed. And kinda itchy sometimes. Down there. Not all the time, just… when it’s wet. And… it hurts a little when I… you know. When I go to the bathroom. Not bad pain, just… a little sting. Like something’s rubbed raw. Does that make sense? I don’t know what “symptoms” are, really. Just things that feel wrong.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Genard, thank you. The itching and stinging are important details. Now, have you experienced any changes in your urination – for example, is it more frequent, more urgent, or difficult to start or finish?
PATIENT: Urination… oh, let me think. Well, I go about the same amount as always, I guess. Maybe a little more often… now that you mention it. But I drink a lot of water, you see, gotta stay hydrated. And no, it doesn’t hurt to start, not usually. Sometimes it feels like it doesn’t all come out, like a little bit’s left behind. But that happens sometimes anyway, doesn't it? It's not new. I don't know… I'm an old lady, things don’t work the same anymore.
DOCTOR: That’s fair, Ms. Genard. It's good you’re aware of what’s typical for you. Now, regarding your medical history – do you have any existing medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… oh dear. Let me think… I had a bad knee for a while, but that’s fixed now. And my back aches, but everyone’s back aches when they get old. Diabetes… I don't think so. The doctor told me something once, a long time ago, but I don’t remember what. High blood pressure… maybe? I take a little white pill sometimes, but I forget what it’s for. I don't really go to the doctor much. They always poke and prod, and I don't like that. I just figure, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful, Ms. Genard. I understand your reluctance to visit the doctor frequently. We'll try to keep things as comfortable as possible. Do you take any other medications besides the little white pill?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... Well, I take something for my arthritis, a little pink one. And sometimes I take something for my sleep, but only when I can't sleep, which is most nights. And… oh! I take vitamins! A big one every morning. And… I think that’s it. I have a whole bottle of pills at home, but I just take what feels right. My niece told me to take them, she's a very sensible girl. Do you need to know what kind of arthritis pill it is? I don’t remember the name. Everything just sounds the same after a while.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Genard. It sounds like you're managing quite a few things. Knowing about the arthritis medication and the sleep aid is helpful. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh, goodness. Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, a long, long time ago. And I broke my arm once, when I was climbing a mango tree. But that was ages ago. Serious illnesses… I had the flu a few times, like everyone does. And I had a bad stomach bug last year, but that didn't last long. Nothing serious, really. I've always been a pretty healthy person, all things considered. I eat a lot of fruit, you see, and I walk every day. Although my back’s been bothering me lately, so I haven’t been walking as much. Does that count as serious? Everything feels serious when you get old.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Genard, that doesn’t count as serious. Thank you for sharing that information. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a tough one. My mother… she had a bad heart, I think. She died when I was young, so I don’t remember much. And my father… he was a strong man, never got sick a day in his life. But my brother… he got sick, a long time ago. Something with his stomach, I think. But he lived a long life, anyway. And my sister… she had cancer, but she fought it bravely. It’s just… everyone gets sick eventually, doesn’t it? I don’t know if any of that’s helpful. We didn’t talk about these things much back then. We just… dealt with it. I’m not very good with remembering things like that. Everything’s a blur. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, Ms. Genard, thank you. It’s understandable that it’s difficult to recall details. Now, I’d like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, no, no. I don’t smoke. Never have. Makes you cough too much. And I don't drink alcohol much. Maybe a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not very often. And drugs? Oh, no, never. I'm a respectable lady. I don’t need any of that. I get enough excitement with my art, thank you very much. I spend my days sculpting and painting, and that's enough for me. I don't need anything else to make me feel good. Is that what you wanted to know? I just live a quiet life. A simple life. And I like it that way. Is this important?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Genard. Thank you for sharing that. Now, one final question regarding your medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I think I got a rash once, when I ate some shrimp, a long time ago. But maybe it was just the sun. And I get itchy sometimes when I touch certain flowers, but that's just a little itch. Nothing serious. And I don’t think I’m allergic to any medications. I take so many pills, if I was allergic to something, I’d know it by now, wouldn’t I? I don’t think I have any real allergies. Just little itches and rashes. Nothing to worry about. Is that all? I'm getting tired of answering questions. Can we get to the bottom of this leaking thing now? It's very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Genard, we can certainly move forward. Thank you for answering all of my questions so thoroughly. Now, with your permission, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. This will involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and gently examining your abdomen. And then, if you’re comfortable, I'd like to examine the source of the leakage. This will require you to disrobe from the waist down, and I will provide a gown for privacy. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A physical exam… Well, I don't really like being poked and prodded, you know? But I suppose it's necessary if you want to fix this leaking thing. Checking my heart and lungs, that's fine. And my abdomen… I guess so. But disrobing? Oh, that’s… awkward. I haven't been examined like that in a long time. But… if you have to, I suppose. But be gentle, please. And give me a nice, thick gown. And please, don't take too long. I'm a modest lady, you know. Is this going to hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Ms. Genard. I assure you, I will be as gentle and respectful as possible throughout the exam. We'll take things slowly and at your pace. I will provide a thick gown, and I will ensure your privacy at all times. The exam itself shouldn’t be painful, but you may feel some mild pressure. First, let's check your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 140/85, which is a bit elevated, but not alarmingly so. Your pulse is 78, which is normal. Your respiratory rate is 16, and your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. I’ll make a note of that. Your lungs are clear, with no wheezing or crackles. Now, if you're comfortable, I’d like to gently examine your abdomen. Do you feel any tenderness or pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh, that gown is a little thin, you know. And poking around… it tickles. Your heart… a murmur? What does that mean? Is that bad? And my lungs… clear is good, right? And… pressing here… ooh, a little bit. Not bad pain, just… uncomfortable. It feels a little tender, down low. Like something’s… swollen. But it's probably just my age, you know? Everything’s a little saggy these days. Is that what you’re feeling? Just… old lady sag. Be careful, please. I don't want to be bruised. And don't take too long. This is very embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Genard. The murmur is something we’ll want to monitor, but it doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem. A clear lung exam is certainly good. And yes, I do feel some tenderness in your lower abdomen, as you noted. It’s difficult to assess fully with clothing on, so if you’re comfortable, I would like to proceed with the pelvic exam to better understand the source of the leakage. As I mentioned before, you will be fully draped and I will be as gentle as possible. Please let me know immediately if you experience any discomfort. Would you like me to explain the pelvic exam procedure in more detail before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A pelvic exam… I really don’t like the sound of that. I haven't had one of those in… well, a very long time. What exactly does it involve? You said something about draping, but… what exactly will you be looking at? And will it hurt? I don't like surprises, you know. I need to know what's going to happen. Just tell me everything, step by step. And be quick about it, please. I'm very sensitive down there. And please, don’t make me feel embarrassed. This is already very uncomfortable. I'm an old lady, not a spring chicken.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your apprehension, Ms. Genard. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about a pelvic exam, especially if it’s been a long time. I will explain everything in detail, step by step, and I will stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. First, you will lie on your back on the exam table, with your knees bent and your feet flat on the table. I will provide a sheet and drape it over your lower body to maintain your privacy. I will gently insert a speculum – a small, slightly curved instrument – into your vagina. This will allow me to visualize your cervix – the lower part of your uterus. It may feel a little cool or pressureful, but shouldn’t be painful. If you feel any discomfort, please let me know immediately. I will then gently examine your cervix to look for any abnormalities. I may also collect a small sample of cells from your cervix to test for any infections or precancerous changes – this is called a Pap smear. After that, I will perform a gentle external exam of your vagina and perineum – the area between your vagina and rectum – to check for any signs of irritation or swelling. The entire exam should take only a few minutes. I will explain everything as I go, and I will be as gentle and respectful as possible. Do you have any questions about the procedure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A speculum… that sounds dreadful. And a Pap smear… is that going to hurt? You said it shouldn’t, but… I've heard stories. And looking at my cervix… what are you looking for exactly? Is something wrong? I don’t like the sound of abnormalities. And poking around down there… that just sounds awful. I’m very sensitive, you know. And I’m a bit… fragile these days. Is this really necessary? Can’t you just give me some cream or something? I don’t want to be poked and prodded if it’s not absolutely necessary. And if you have to do it, please, be very gentle. And don’t take too long. I’m getting very anxious. This is all very embarrassing. And I don't want to know if you find anything wrong. Just… tell me if it’s something serious, and give me some pills. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxieties, Ms. Genard, and I want to assure you that I will do everything I can to make this as comfortable and quick as possible. The speculum allows me to visualize your cervix to check for any signs of inflammation, infection, or abnormal growths. The Pap smear is a routine screening test that helps detect precancerous changes in your cervix, which can be treated before they develop into cancer. It’s a very important part of preventative care, especially as we get older. While a cream might temporarily alleviate some symptoms, it won’t address the underlying cause of the leakage. To properly diagnose the issue and provide appropriate treatment, a pelvic exam and Pap smear are necessary. I will be as gentle as possible throughout the exam, and I will stop immediately if you experience any discomfort. I will also explain everything as I go, so you know exactly what’s happening. Before we proceed, would you like me to have a nurse present during the exam for additional support?
PATIENT: A nurse? Well… that might be nice. Yes, please. Having someone else there might make me feel a little less… exposed. A little less awkward, you know? And maybe she can hold my hand or something. But please, tell the nurse to be gentle too. I don’t want to be poked and prodded by two people at once. And tell her not to say anything embarrassing. I’m a modest lady, you know. And if you find anything wrong… just tell me what it is, and what we can do about it. Don’t beat around the bush. I’m an old lady, I’ve seen it all. Just give me the facts, and give me some pills. Is that possible? And please, hurry. I’m getting very anxious. This is all very stressful.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Genard. I will speak with the nurse and ensure she is gentle and respectful throughout the exam. She will be there for support and to assist as needed. I will also be sure to explain everything clearly and concisely, and I will provide you with the facts without hesitation. I will proceed slowly and at your pace. Please let me know immediately if you experience any discomfort, and do not hesitate to ask questions at any time. “Nurse Elena, could you please come in?
PATIENT: .
