DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s about my bruising. It’s… excessive, frankly. I’m on that blood thinner, you see, and normally a little bump is a little bump. But lately… it’s like I’m made of glass. It’s quite inconvenient, really.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Excessive bruising, you say, and you attribute it to being on a blood thinner. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not new new. But it’s…worsening. Perhaps the last month or so? I can’t pinpoint the exact date, Doctor. I’m a busy man, not a calendar keeper. It just seems to take longer for things to heal, and even small things leave a mark. It's…disturbing.
DOCTOR: I see here you've been on Warfarin for atrial fibrillation for the past three years. And you say this worsening bruising has been over the last month. Have you noticed any specific events that triggered it – a fall, an injury you don’t recall, or even just a change in activity level?
PATIENT: A change in activity? No, nothing like that. My routine hasn’t altered. I haven’t fallen, no. I assure you, Doctor, I’m quite careful. I suspect it's simply the medication. Perhaps the dosage is too high? One hears stories, you know. People reacting to these things… unpredictably. Though, I haven’t changed anything myself. I take it exactly as prescribed.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the bruising?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… No, not really. I feel…well, I feel my age, naturally. A little tired sometimes, but that’s just getting older, isn’t it? No dizziness, no bleeding gums, nothing like that. Just…the bruising. It's mostly on my arms and legs, I've noticed. Though I did bump my hip on the coffee table the other day, and that one is particularly nasty. But even without that… it’s concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any blood in your stool or urine?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. Are you suggesting…? No, Doctor, I haven’t seen anything like that. That would be… alarming. I assure you, I’d know. I’m a pathologist, remember? I’m not oblivious to such things. I simply thought, perhaps, we could adjust the medication. It's a nuisance, really. I have a golf tournament next month. I can hardly show up looking like I’ve been in a boxing match.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, a pathologist you are, so you're quite observant. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. I want to take a look at the bruising and check for any other signs. Can you roll up your sleeves, please?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Though I suspect you'll find it's exactly as I described. A bit…unprecedented, frankly. There. As you can see. It's not as though I'm deliberately injuring myself. It's… perplexing.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see several ecchymoses here, varying in size and age. No signs of active bleeding. Palpation is unremarkable – no tenderness or swelling beyond what one would expect with bruising. I'll check your legs as well. Similar findings on your lower extremities. No signs of edema. Capillary refill is normal. Let me listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72. Alright. We'll need to do some blood work to get a better picture of what's going on. Specifically, I want a complete blood count, a PT/INR to check your Warfarin levels, and a basic metabolic panel. We should also check your liver function tests.
PATIENT: Liver function tests? Now, hold on a moment. What are you implying? I eat a perfectly balanced diet. Are you suggesting this is…my fault? I find that rather condescending, Doctor. I assure you, my lifestyle is…impeccable. What possible relevance does my liver have to do with a little bruising? This seems…excessive.
DOCTOR: Mr. Farson, I am not implying anything of the sort. Liver function tests are standard procedure when investigating unexplained bruising, especially in someone on Warfarin. The liver produces clotting factors, and if it’s not functioning properly, it can affect your blood’s ability to clot. It’s a simple precaution, not an accusation of a poor lifestyle. We need to rule out all possibilities. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None whatsoever. Latex, no. I'm a physician, Doctor, I'm aware of such things. Honestly, this is becoming rather…patronizing. I simply want to know if we can adjust the dosage of the Warfarin. Is that too much to ask? All this…extensive testing…for a few bruises. It’s a waste of time and resources, frankly. Though, if you insist, I suppose I can cooperate. But I expect a clear explanation of the results, and a swift resolution. Golf, you understand. It’s…important.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Farson. I will order the blood work. The lab technician will draw blood from your arm. I’ll also give you a list of instructions to follow in the meantime – avoid any strenuous activity, and watch for any signs of internal bleeding, such as black, tarry stools, blood in your urine, or excessive bleeding from cuts. Once the results are back – typically within 24-48 hours – we’ll discuss them and formulate a plan. I understand your concern about the golf tournament. However, we need to ensure your safety first. I'm also going to put in a referral to a hematologist, just to get a second opinion. It never hurts to have another set of eyes on things. They may suggest further testing if necessary.
PATIENT: A hematologist? Now you’re just being…dilatory. A second opinion? This is preposterous! I am a pathologist, Doctor! I know my own body. This is simply bureaucratic overreach. Honestly, this entire experience has been…disappointing. I suppose I have no choice but to comply. But I expect prompt attention, and a swift resolution. And no lectures about my lifestyle, please.
