DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itching, really. It’s… all over, pretty much. Been going on for a couple of weeks now, and it's driving me a bit mad, to be honest. Not painful, exactly, just… constantly itchy.
DOCTOR: I see. Constant itching for a couple of weeks, you say. That certainly sounds bothersome. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It doesn’t seem to be getting worse, thankfully, but it hasn’t gone away either. It's all over – arms, legs, back, even my chest. I thought maybe it was the laundry detergent, so I switched brands, but that didn’t help. It's not raised or anything, just… red and irritated looking, I guess. My wife, God rest her soul, always had a good eye for these things, but… well, it’s just itching. And it’s worse at night, strangely enough. Makes it hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you tried switching detergents, that’s a sensible first step. And you’re right to mention it’s worse at night – that’s a helpful detail. Just to clarify, when you say “red and irritated”, is it a uniform redness, or are there specific patches or areas that are more affected than others?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. It’s… not completely uniform. There’s a bit more redness around my elbows and behind my knees, I think. And my ankles are a little itchier than, say, my shoulders. Not hugely different, but noticeable. It's hard to describe, Doctor. Just… general redness, with those spots being a little more intense. Sorry if that’s not very specific!
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Ferneding. Details are often difficult to articulate. So, more intense redness around your elbows, knees, and ankles. Have you noticed any blistering, scaling, or any changes in the texture of your skin in those areas, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, no blistering or scaling, thankfully. The skin just feels a little rougher where it’s itchy, I suppose. Not flaky or anything, just… not as smooth as usual. And it's not swollen, either. It's just… dry and itchy and red. It’s really quite a nuisance. I haven't changed anything else, really. Same soaps, same lotions, same everything. It’s been a fairly normal summer otherwise.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the itching?
PATIENT: Let me think… No fever, no fatigue. No changes in my appetite. I haven’t noticed any swelling anywhere, other than maybe a little bit around my ankles sometimes, but I figured that was just from being on my feet too long. Oh! I did have a bit of a stuffy nose a couple of weeks ago, but that cleared up pretty quickly. Nothing major. Honestly, Doctor, just the itch. It’s really the main thing.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, fatigue, appetite changes, swelling, and a brief stuffy nose. That's helpful. Now, let's move on to some general health questions. Do you have any known allergies, to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, take any medicine… well, usually. My wife always kept track of all that, but… I don’t recall ever having an allergic reaction. I’ve had the usual vaccinations, of course, and I'm pretty careful about avoiding things I know are bad for me. But no, no allergies.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a low-dose aspirin, Doctor. My cardiologist put me on it a few years back, just as a preventative thing. And I take a multivitamin every morning, the usual stuff. Nothing else. I really try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can help it. I prefer a good diet and a bit of exercise, if possible. Though with this itch, it’s been hard to get much sleep, let alone exercise!
DOCTOR: Alright, low-dose aspirin and a multivitamin. That's good to know. Now, have you had any significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let’s see… I had a heart scare about five years ago, that’s why I’m on the aspirin. They put a stent in, but it’s been fine ever since. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was younger, but that was decades ago. And… honestly, Doctor, that’s about it. I’ve been pretty lucky, health-wise, all things considered. My wife always said I had a strong constitution. Though I'm starting to wonder about that, with this itch...
DOCTOR: Okay. A history of a stent placement five years ago and a previous bout of pneumonia. And you say you've otherwise been in good health. Now, have you had any surgeries besides the stent placement?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. Just the stent, that was about it. I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that hardly counts as surgery, does it? Just a cast. No, no other surgeries, Doctor. I've always been careful. I don't like hospitals, if I can avoid them.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other surgeries. Now, can you tell me a bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had high blood pressure, and my father had diabetes. My older brother has arthritis, but that's about it, really. Nothing major, as far as I know. My wife’s family… her mother had some issues with her joints, but I don’t recall anything else significant. We didn't talk about medical history much, to be honest. We were more focused on enjoying life. It’s a bit difficult to remember now, without her… but I don’t recall any major hereditary illnesses on either side, no.
DOCTOR: I understand. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Certainly. I’m widowed, as I mentioned. My wife passed away about three years ago. We lived in this town for most of our lives. I used to work at the dispatch center, coordinating deliveries. Retired now, thankfully. I don’t drink or smoke, never have. I used to enjoy gardening, but… it's been hard to get out there much lately, with this itch, and... well, without her. I have a few friends, but mostly I keep to myself these days. Just quiet evenings, reading or watching a bit of television. Nothing too exciting.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Ferneding, that gives me a good overview. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll just take a look at your skin and listen to your heart and lungs. Would you please sit up and loosen your shirt for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Happy to do whatever you need. Please let me know if you need me to adjust anything. It's a bit chilly in here, isn't it? But I suppose that's better than being too warm.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Ferneding. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Take a nice, deep breath for me... and again... Good. I'm also just feeling your lymph nodes. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I can't feel any significant swelling in your lymph nodes. Your skin is a bit dry overall, and I do see the areas of redness you mentioned, particularly around your elbows, knees, and ankles. The redness isn't raised or blistering, as you described. It appears to be more of a diffuse irritation. It's not a dramatic rash, but it’s definitely present. Now, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve seen, several things could be going on. It could be something as simple as dry skin exacerbated by the change in weather, or it could be a mild form of eczema. Less likely, but we need to consider it, could be a reaction to something you’ve been exposed to. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a complete blood count, or CBC, and a basic metabolic panel, or BMP, just to rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A CBC and a BMP, you said? Absolutely. I trust your judgement. I just want to get this itch sorted out, if possible. It's… unsettling, to be honest. So, yes, please go ahead with the tests. How long will it take to get the results? And will I need to come back to the clinic, or will you call me with them?
DOCTOR: Good. The tests are relatively straightforward, and the lab is just down the hall. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back – usually within 24-48 hours – the lab will automatically send them to me here at the clinic. I will then review them and give you a call to discuss the findings and our next steps. In the meantime, I recommend using a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer several times a day, particularly after bathing. Avoid hot water, as that can dry out your skin even further. And try to wear loose-fitting, breathable clothing. These are just simple steps to help manage the symptoms while we await the results. Do you have any questions about that, or anything else we've discussed?
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. Fragrance-free moisturizer, loose clothing… I can certainly manage that. I think I even have some old lotion around somewhere. And yes, I suppose I have a few questions. While we’re waiting for the results, is there anything I should avoid? Any specific soaps or detergents that I should definitely steer clear of? And… is this something contagious? I have a few friends I see occasionally, and I wouldn’t want to pass anything on to them. I’m probably being silly, but… just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Mr. Ferneding, and it's good you're thinking ahead. To answer your first question, yes, it's best to avoid soaps and detergents with harsh chemicals, fragrances, and dyes. Look for products specifically labeled "for sensitive skin" or "hypoallergenic." And regarding contagiousness, based on what I'm seeing and hearing, it's extremely unlikely this is contagious. The appearance and your history don’t point to an infectious cause. However, to be completely cautious, it's always a good idea to avoid sharing personal items like towels or clothing with others while we're investigating. Better safe than sorry, as you said. I'll also send a note to the lab requesting they prioritize your results, just to expedite the process. Is there anything else I can address for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. Knowing it’s probably not contagious is a relief, and the advice about the moisturizer and avoiding harsh chemicals is helpful. I’ll head down to the lab now and get the tests done. Just let me know when you have the results, and I’ll be sure to give you a call. Thank you again, Doctor Abady.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. Please don't hesitate to call if you experience any worsening of your symptoms while you're waiting for the results, or if you have any other concerns. I will be in touch as soon as I have the results. Have a good day. .
