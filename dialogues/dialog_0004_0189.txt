DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Deschane, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s about… well, let’s just say things aren’t coming out right. There was blood. In the stool. Not a good sign, is it? I’ve seen things in my years, flying all over, and this… this is unsettling.
DOCTOR: “Flying all over?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Airline pilot, retired now, of course. Best job a man could have, really. Though, you wouldn't catch young people understanding that these days. Always glued to their screens. But that’s neither here nor there. The point is, I know a thing or two about… systems. And this? This doesn't feel like a well-functioning system, if you catch my drift. Blood in the stool is hardly normal, is it?
DOCTOR: I understand you've had a professional career, Mr. Rowbottom. While your observations are… noted, let's stick to the medical details. Can you describe the blood?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want the details. Fine. It wasn't… a lot, mind you. Not like a gushing wound or anything. More like… streaks. Red streaks. And it wasn’t just on the surface, either. It was in it, mixed in. And it happened… well, yesterday morning. Didn't feel right all day after, a bit weak, you know? Though, that could just be my age. Everything feels a bit weak these days. But the blood… that's what’s worrying.
DOCTOR: And has this happened before, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now, my memory isn’t what it used to be, flying at those altitudes does things to a man... but I don't think so. Not that I recall. Maybe once, a long time ago, but it was a small amount and I figured it was something I ate. Bad shellfish, perhaps. This time, though, it was… different. More noticeable. I’m quite sure of it. It’s not something you easily forget, seeing that in the bowl, you know?
DOCTOR: I see you’ve had a few visits for constipation documented here, Mr. Rowbottom. And a hemorrhoid was noted a few years ago. Is that still bothering you?
PATIENT: Hemorrhoid? Oh, that. Well, yes, a bit. Annoying little thing, really. But I wouldn't think that's causing this. Constipation, too, yes, getting old does things to your plumbing. But I manage it, drink plenty of fluids, prune juice now and then. This isn’t just a bit of straining, Doctor. This is… blood. Proper blood. And that suggests something more serious, don’t you think? I’m not some hypochondriac, you know. I’ve faced worse than a bit of discomfort in my life. Now, are we going to figure out why there’s blood, or just talk about my bowels all day?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Rowbottom. I’d like to perform a physical examination. That includes listening to your abdomen, and a rectal exam. It’s standard procedure when we’re investigating bleeding. It will help me determine the source of the issue. Are you amenable to that?
PATIENT: A rectal exam, is it? Really? Well, I suppose if you have to. Though I must say, at my age, one has endured… examinations. It’s not exactly a pleasant thought. But if that's what it takes to get to the bottom of this… blood business, then fine. Just be quick about it, if you would. I haven’t got all day. And try not to poke around too much, eh? Some things are best left undisturbed.
DOCTOR: Please lie on your side, Mr. Rowbottom. I'll need you to relax as much as possible. Okay. I did not feel any obvious masses during the exam, but there was some tenderness. Your stool was heme-positive, confirming the presence of blood. Given your age, the bleeding, and your history of constipation, we need to investigate further. I am ordering a complete blood count to check for anemia, and a fecal immunochemical test, or FIT, to detect hidden blood in your stool. We will also need to consider a colonoscopy.
PATIENT: Colonoscopy, you say? Now that sounds… invasive. Is that absolutely necessary? I’ve read things about those things. Not a pleasant procedure, I understand. Couldn't we just… monitor it for a while? See if it clears up on its own? I'm not a fan of unnecessary poking and prodding, you know. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor, and I’d prefer to spend it living it, not being examined. What exactly are we looking for with this… colonoscopy? Is it something truly serious, or just a bit of irritation? And what are these… tests you're ordering? Are they painful? I’d like a clear explanation, if you don’t mind. Don't just throw medical terms at me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, blood in the stool is never normal. While it may be a minor issue, it could also indicate something serious, such as polyps, which can sometimes become cancerous. A colonoscopy is the gold standard for detecting these. It involves inserting a flexible tube with a camera into your rectum to visualize the entire colon. It allows us to identify and remove any abnormalities. The complete blood count checks your red blood cell levels. Anemia can indicate chronic bleeding. The FIT test is a non-invasive stool test that detects hidden blood. If that comes back positive, the colonoscopy is even more important. Regarding pain, the colonoscopy itself is usually painless, as you'll be sedated. However, there is some preparation involved, which includes drinking a special solution to clear out your colon. That can be… unpleasant. But it's necessary for a clear visualization. I understand your concerns, but it's better to be proactive and rule out anything serious. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Cancer, you say? Well, that’s cheerful. Always something, isn't it? Polyps… and all sorts of things lurking down there. Sedated, you say? So, I’ll be out of it. Who's going to look after me then? My daughter lives too far away. And this… preparation. A special solution. I can just imagine. Alright, alright. But I want everything explained to me clearly before you do anything. Who performs this colonoscopy? What are the risks? And what happens if they find something? I need to know all of this before I agree to anything. I’ve seen enough in my life to know that doctors don't always tell you the whole truth. So, lay it all out for me, Doctor. Don't leave anything out. And make it simple. I don’t need a medical lecture. Just the facts.
DOCTOR: The colonoscopy will be performed by Dr. Ramirez, a board-certified gastroenterologist. He is very experienced. The risks are relatively low – there is a small risk of perforation, or bleeding, but it's uncommon. More commonly, there can be some bloating or cramping afterwards. If he finds something – a polyp, for example – he will likely remove it during the procedure. That tissue will be sent to a lab for analysis to determine if it’s cancerous. If it is, we’ll discuss further treatment options, such as surgery or chemotherapy. The preparation involves drinking a bowel cleansing solution the day before the procedure to completely empty your colon. It can cause frequent trips to the bathroom, and some cramping. It’s not pleasant, but it’s essential for a clear visualization. You'll need someone to drive you to and from the procedure, and you’ll need to arrange for someone to stay with you for a few hours afterwards, as the sedation will make you drowsy. I have the information sheets here with everything detailed. I will go over the potential risks, benefits, and alternative options with you. I can also schedule a consultation with Dr. Ramirez if you'd like to discuss it further. Do you want to schedule that now?
PATIENT: Fine. A consultation with this… Ramirez. I suppose I have no choice. I don't like being poked and prodded, but I don't like the thought of… things lurking either. So, yes. Schedule a consultation. But make sure he's a good doctor. I’ve met plenty of so-called “experts” in my time, and not all of them knew what they were doing. And I want to know everything before he does anything. No surprises. And make sure he understands I'm not a young man anymore. Everything takes a bit longer, and things aren’t as… resilient as they used to be. And get me those sheets. I want to read them. Carefully. I like to be informed. Don't just expect me to blindly trust you doctors. We've all heard the stories. Always something…
DOCTOR: Here are the pre-procedure instructions and consent forms. I've scheduled you for a consultation with Dr. Ramirez next Tuesday at 2:00 PM. His office is located in the same building, suite 302. They will contact you to confirm. I've also included information about colon cancer and treatment options. Please review these documents carefully. And I assure you, Dr. Ramirez is a very experienced and highly-regarded physician. He will take the time to answer all of your questions. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Alright, Tuesday at two. Suite 302. I suppose that's something. No, I don't think so. Just… make sure they understand I'm a bit of a… stickler for details. And I don't like being kept waiting. My time is valuable, even at my age. And if they try to upsell me on anything, I want to know about it beforehand. I've lived long enough to know how these things work. Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll go and have a cup of tea. This whole ordeal has been rather… unsettling. Thank you, Doctor. Though, truthfully, I'm not sure I'm any more reassured than I was before. .
