DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Drahota. My name is Dr. Andraca. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Andraca, you say? Hmm. Well, frankly, I haven’t the foggiest idea why my wife insisted I come. Something about my… complexion, she said. Been looking a bit… off, apparently. And tiring easily. Though, at my age, what isn’t tiring? I’ve been a reinforcing iron worker for… well, a very long time. I’d rather not make a fuss if it’s nothing serious. Let’s get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Drahota. It’s good you’re here, and we'll certainly try to be efficient. Your wife is wise to encourage you to get things checked out. "Looking a bit off" and fatigue can have many causes, and it's always best to investigate. So, when you say "looking a bit off," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Describe… well, it’s difficult. It’s just… darker, I suppose. My skin. Not a tan, mind you. I haven’t been exposed to any significant sun lately. More… a sort of… dullness. And, as I said, I'm perpetually tired. It's not like a sudden thing, Doctor. It's been creeping up on me for… oh, I don't know how long. Months, perhaps? Time blurs, you see. It’s probably nothing. Old age, I tell you. It ruins everything.
DOCTOR: I understand. A dullness of the skin and increasing fatigue over months… that’s helpful. And you’re right to mention it’s not a sudden change. To get a better picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fatigue and skin changes?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What sort of symptoms? I ache, naturally. Every bone in my body aches. But that’s standard for someone who’s spent decades wrestling with rebar. And… I suppose my appetite has been… diminished. Not that I have much of an appetite to begin with these days. Food just doesn’t taste the same anymore. It’s all rather bland, you see. And… …no, that’s it. No fevers, no chills, no… dramatic collapses. Just… general unpleasantness. Honestly, Doctor, I suspect it’s a waste of your time. People my age are supposed to fall apart, aren't they?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you being so thorough, Mr. Drahota. It's good you've noticed those details, even if they seem commonplace for your age. Diminished appetite and food tasting bland are important things to mention. Now, let’s talk a little about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Medical history? Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been a long life. I had… something with my gallbladder, decades ago. Removed, I believe. And… a touch of arthritis, I suppose. Nothing serious enough to warrant any fuss. I mostly ignored it. And… …there was a bad bout of the flu in ’87, but everyone had it. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve always been… robust. I rarely bother with doctors. They always tell you to rest and drink fluids. As if I hadn’t already figured that out. My wife, bless her heart, is the one who’s always getting poked and prodded. She's far more… delicate than I am. Do we have to go through all of this? It's rather tedious.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Drahota. We'll try to be brief. Knowing about the gallbladder removal and arthritis is helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries besides your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. No, I don’t believe so. Perhaps a few stitches here and there from various mishaps on the job site – a cut, a scrape. Nothing requiring a proper operation. A reinforcing iron worker accumulates a few battle scars, you see. It’s part of the trade. Truly, Doctor, I’ve been remarkably fortunate in avoiding serious medical interventions. I’ve always prided myself on being a… sturdy specimen. Though, lately, that sturdiness seems to be… waning. Still, no, just the gallbladder. And a lot of bandages. Is this really necessary? My wife will be expecting me back for tea shortly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no other surgeries besides the gallbladder removal. That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do you have any family history of medical conditions – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or anything else that runs in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a difficult one. My parents… they lived long lives, both of them. But I don’t recall any… specific ailments. My father worked in the rice paddies, a very hard life. He just… wore out, eventually. My mother… she was a homemaker. A quiet life. I have siblings, yes. A brother and a sister, but we haven’t spoken in decades. They live… far away. I honestly don’t know anything about their health. We’re not a particularly close family. And… to be frank, Doctor, I've never been one to pry into other people’s business. It's not polite. So, no, I can’t offer you much in the way of family medical history. A remarkably unremarkable lineage, I assure you. Is this really helping?
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Drahota. It’s alright if you don’t have a lot of information about your family’s medical history. We can proceed without it. Now, just a few more questions about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife would have my hide. Alcohol… I enjoy a glass of sherry with dinner, perhaps. A small glass. Nothing excessive. As for recreational drugs… are you suggesting I partake in such… vulgarities? I am a man of a certain age, Doctor, not a… a delinquent. I have always led a respectable life. Hard work, a loving wife, a quiet home. That is my lifestyle. A small sherry, occasionally. And a lot of tea. Is that satisfactory? I would like to be finished soon, if you don’t mind. My wife is quite particular about tea time.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly satisfactory, Mr. Drahota. A small glass of sherry occasionally, and you don’t smoke or use drugs. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, I don't believe so. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. A bit of a sniffle with certain pollens, perhaps, but nothing serious. I took some sort of penicillin as a child, I think, for a bad sore throat, but I don't recall any ill effects. And… no, nothing else. I’ve always been rather… resilient. A strong constitution, you see. Now, Doctor, with all due respect, is there anything else? I truly must get home. My wife will be worried, and the tea will be cold. I’m beginning to feel quite tired just talking about all of this. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. Thank you for answering all of my questions. It sounds like you’ve lived a very full and healthy life, and that’s wonderful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam just to get a better sense of what's going on. It will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your abdomen, and feeling your lymph nodes. Does that sound alright?
