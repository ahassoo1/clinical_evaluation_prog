DOCTOR: Good morning, Tarin. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. The pleasure is all mine. Thank you for having me. I’ve been experiencing some numbness in my leg, and it’s been… persistent enough that I thought it best to get it checked out. It started, I believe, about a week ago, though pinpointing the exact date is difficult. It’s primarily in my left leg, from the thigh down to my foot.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good of you to come in and get it checked out, Tarin. Numbness can be concerning, and it’s always best to investigate. Let's try to get a clearer picture of this. You said it started about a week ago in your left leg, thigh down to the foot. Can you describe the numbness for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not a complete loss of feeling, Doctor. More like… a diminished sensation. Like when your foot falls asleep, but not as intense, and it doesn’t go away quickly. It’s… a sort of tingling and dullness, if that makes sense. Sometimes it feels a bit cold, even when the room is warm. It’s most noticeable when I’m standing for long periods, I believe. Though, it’s been present even while seated at times.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Diminished sensation, tingling, dullness, and a cold sensation… and it seems to be exacerbated by standing. Thank you for clarifying. Now, has this numbness been constant since it started, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes, Doctor. It's not always present. There are periods throughout the day where I don’t notice it at all, and then it will return. I’d say it’s most prominent in the evenings, after I’ve been on my feet for a long time working. It seems to lessen when I sit and elevate my leg, if that provides any correlation. I’ve noticed it hasn't been consistent enough to truly map it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s good information, Tarin – the fact that it comes and goes and is relieved with elevation is certainly helpful. It sounds like it’s related to activity, which gives us a starting point. Now, to get a better understanding of the bigger picture, could you tell me a little bit about what you do for work?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as a special effects artist and animator, Doctor. It involves a fair amount of computer work, but also… quite a bit of being on my feet. I do motion capture work, set building, and sometimes prop handling. It requires a lot of physical movement, and I often spend long hours standing, walking, and reaching. It's a fairly demanding job, physically. I do a lot of work with practical effects, and that's where the standing comes into play.
DOCTOR: I see. That is a physically demanding job. A lot of varied movement and prolonged standing. That certainly could be contributing to this. Now, have you experienced any pain along with the numbness?
PATIENT: There hasn’t been any sharp pain, Doctor. But… there’s a bit of aching. A dull ache in my thigh and calf, mostly. It’s not constant, and it’s not severe, but it’s present at times, particularly after a long day. It’s almost a fatigue-like ache, if that makes sense. It’s not the sort of pain that stops me from moving, but I'm certainly aware of it. It sometimes radiates down into my foot, but it's not crippling.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache, fatigue-like, radiating to the foot, and not severe. That’s good to know. Now, let’s move on to some other areas. Have you noticed any weakness in your left leg?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. It’s… difficult to say definitively. I haven’t tripped or stumbled, and I don’t feel weaker, but I do find myself… subtly adjusting my gait sometimes. Almost unconsciously favoring my right leg. It’s not a dramatic difference, but I’ve noticed it on occasion. Perhaps a slight hesitancy when taking stairs, though that could be simply being more mindful of my leg. I’ve not consciously tested the strength, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, subtle gait adjustments and slight hesitancy with stairs… that’s worth noting. We'll need to assess that more directly. Now, have you experienced any changes in your bowel or bladder function?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't experienced any changes in either of those areas. Everything has been… normal, for lack of a better term. No issues with control, frequency, or anything of that nature. I apologize if that’s a crude question, but I want to be thorough.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Tarin – it's an important question, and I appreciate you being thorough. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. No chronic illnesses, no surgeries, and I haven’t been hospitalized for anything significant. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing lasting. My family history is… relatively unremarkable as well. No history of nerve disorders or anything similar that I’m aware of. I do have regular check-ups with my primary care physician, and the last one was about six months ago, with no concerning findings.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No significant medical history and a recent check-up with no concerning findings is reassuring. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't have any known allergies. I’ve never experienced a reaction to any medication, and I can eat any type of food without issue. I've been around animals my entire life, and I don't have any sensitivities there either. I've always been fortunate that way.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't take any medications currently. I do occasionally take a multivitamin, just a standard daily dose, but that’s the extent of it. No prescription medications, no herbal supplements, nothing of that nature. I generally try to maintain a healthy diet, so I don’t feel the need for anything beyond the occasional multivitamin.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. No medications or supplements. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tarin, if you don't mind, please walk normally for a few steps. I’m just observing your posture and the way you move. Okay, thank you. Now, let's check your reflexes. Please sit on the exam table and relax your legs. I'm going to gently tap on your knees and ankles with this small hammer. Okay, those are normal. Now, I’m going to test your sensation. I'm going to lightly touch different areas of your legs and feet with this cotton ball. Please tell me when you can feel the touch. Okay, and now I’m going to test your strength. I’m going to ask you to resist my force as I push against your legs. Please push back against me as hard as you can. Finally, I'll palpate your lower extremities to check for any areas of tenderness. Okay, thank you. That’s all for the physical exam. I’ve noted some slightly diminished sensation on the lateral aspect of your left foot, mild tenderness over the lateral malleolus, and a subtle asymmetry in your gait.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That all sounds quite thorough. It’s interesting to hear about the diminished sensation and the tenderness… I hadn’t consciously noticed those things, but it does correlate with what I’ve been experiencing. The asymmetry in my gait… I suppose I hadn’t been aware of that either, but it wouldn’t surprise me given the discomfort. What are your thoughts based on those findings?
DOCTOR: Based on your history and the findings of the physical exam, Tarin, my initial impression is that you may be experiencing symptoms related to a peripheral nerve issue, potentially involving the superficial peroneal nerve. This nerve supplies sensation to the lateral aspect of the lower leg and foot, and irritation or compression of this nerve could explain the numbness, tingling, and diminished sensation you've described. The tenderness over the lateral malleolus suggests possible inflammation or compression in that area. The subtle asymmetry in your gait could be a compensatory mechanism to avoid discomfort. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order an electromyography and nerve conduction study . This will help assess the function of the nerves in your lower extremities and identify any areas of damage or compression. I would also recommend an X-ray of your left ankle to rule out any bony abnormalities. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I trust your judgment completely. An EMG and NCS, along with an X-ray, seem like logical steps to take. I’m happy to proceed with those tests. I apologize for my lack of medical knowledge; I’m not familiar with those procedures. Could you perhaps explain them briefly? Just so I know what to expect. And, if you wouldn’t mind, could you also let me know the approximate cost of those tests, if possible? I want to ensure my insurance will cover them.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Tarin, no need to apologize at all – it’s perfectly normal to be unfamiliar with medical procedures. The EMG and NCS are non-invasive tests that assess the electrical activity of your muscles and nerves. The NCS involves placing small electrodes on your skin and delivering mild electrical impulses to stimulate the nerves. This measures how quickly the electrical signals travel along the nerves. The EMG involves inserting a small needle into your muscles to record their electrical activity. It helps assess the function of the muscles and identify any areas of damage or weakness. It’s generally not painful, but you may experience some mild discomfort during the needle insertion. The whole procedure typically takes about 30-60 minutes. As for the cost, it can vary depending on the facility and your insurance plan. Generally, an EMG and NCS can cost between $300 and $800. An X-ray typically costs between $50 and $200. I would recommend contacting your insurance provider to confirm your coverage and any out-of-pocket expenses. My office can also assist you in finding a facility that accepts your insurance and provides accurate cost estimates. Would you like me to provide you with a referral order for these tests, and a list of facilities in the area that offer them?
PATIENT: That explanation is very helpful, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to detail the procedures. It sounds manageable, and knowing what to expect alleviates some of my concerns. Yes, please. A referral order and a list of facilities would be fantastic. If your office could also assist with confirming insurance coverage, that would be incredibly helpful. I want to be proactive and ensure everything is covered properly. I truly appreciate your thoroughness and willingness to explain everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'll go ahead and print out a referral order for both the EMG/NCS and the X-ray. I’ll also prepare a list of facilities in the area that offer these services, along with their contact information. My nurse, Sarah, will reach out to your insurance provider to confirm your coverage and any potential out-of-pocket expenses. She’ll likely need your insurance card information, which she'll obtain securely. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that exacerbate your symptoms. If you experience any worsening of your numbness, tingling, or pain, or if you develop any weakness in your leg, please contact the office immediately. Once we have the results of the tests, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. Avoiding activities that worsen my symptoms is a sensible precaution, and I will certainly contact the office if anything changes. I appreciate Sarah reaching out to my insurance provider – that will be a tremendous help. Yes, a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and develop a treatment plan sounds excellent. I’m grateful for your care and attention to this matter. I feel much more reassured knowing we’re taking proactive steps to address this. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I believe that is all for today?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Tarin. I’m glad I could reassure you, and I’m happy to work with you to get to the bottom of this. Yes, I believe that is all for today. Sarah will be with you shortly to schedule the tests and provide you with the necessary paperwork. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again at your follow-up appointment.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day as well.
