DOCTOR: Hi Armando, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I got a… a thing I wanna get done. A little fixin’, you understand. Not a big deal, really. Just need a paper sayin’ I’m alright to go through with it. Don’t have all day, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're in a hurry. But to make sure I can help you properly – and legally – I do need to understand what "the thing" is, even if you don't think it's a big deal. Could you tell me a little more about what you’re hoping I can document for you?
PATIENT: Look, it’s… cosmetic. You know, makin’ myself look a little better. I ain’t lookin’ for a heart transplant, Doctor. Just somethin’ to… improve things. A little nip and tuck. Is that alright? Do I have to explain every little detail to you? It’s…private.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for privacy, Armando. And I’m not trying to pry. However, even for cosmetic procedures, I need to know what’s being done so I can ensure it's safe for you, given your health. It's part of my responsibility as your doctor. Knowing the specific procedure helps me check for any potential risks or complications based on your medical history. Do you mind telling me what kind of “nip and tuck” you’re considering?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don’t rightly remember all the fancy names the man used. Somethin’ about… liftin’ things. My face, mostly. Get rid of some of this…sag. He showed me pictures, promised good results. A quick in-and-out. That’s all I need you to do, is say I’m healthy enough. I ain’t got time for a whole examination. I got… appointments.
DOCTOR: Okay, "lifting things" on your face… that sounds like a facelift or potentially some other facial plastic surgery. I appreciate you telling me that much. Just to be clear, Armando, and to cover all bases, let me quickly ask a few standard questions. It really won’t take long, I promise. This is important for your safety. First, do you have any medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I’m a strong man. Always been healthy as a horse. Worked on them towers, you know. Tough job. Ain’t never been sick a day in my life… well, maybe a little cold here and there. But nothin’ serious. No doctorin’ needed. I told you, I don't have time for this. Is this paper ready yet?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. Just to be thorough – and again, this is important for legal reasons as well – have you ever had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. There was… somethin’ with my knee, years ago. When I was workin' on those towers. Fell off a ladder. But it wasn’t nothin’ major. Just a quick fix. And… I think I had my tonsils out when I was a boy. A long time ago, though. Can't rightly recall all the details. It was… a while back. Does that count? Really, Doctor, I'm tellin' you, I'm a healthy man.
DOCTOR: Okay, a knee surgery and tonsillectomy. Thank you for letting me know. And you said you worked on the towers?
PATIENT: Radio, cellular, and tower equipment, Doctor. The best in the business! Climbed those things like a monkey. Dangerous work, but somebody had to do it. Been doin' it for… a long time now. But I ain't climbin’ no more towers. Too old for that. That’s why I'm here, gettin' this little fixin' done. So, can we please hurry this up? I got a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Right, the towers. That’s… demanding physical work. Armando, I need to ask, and please be honest with me, have you had any breathing problems, heart palpitations, or chest pain, especially since you stopped working on the towers?
PATIENT: Breathing problems? Doctor, are you tryin’ to insult me? I climbed towers! You need good lungs to do that. No, I don't have no breathing problems. Maybe a little short of breath sometimes, walkin’ up stairs, but that’s just… age, you understand. And palpitations? No, never had no palpitations. Heart’s as strong as a bull. Look, I'm a simple man. I just want this paper. Are you gonna give it to me or not? I'm beginnin' to lose patience.
DOCTOR: Okay. Armando, I understand your frustration, but I need to be very careful here. Given your history of physically demanding work on the towers, and your acknowledgement of some shortness of breath with exertion, I need to do a brief physical exam before I can clear you for elective surgery, even a cosmetic one. It’s non-negotiable. It will just be a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and a check of your blood pressure. It’ll take five minutes, tops. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Five minutes? Fine. Five minutes. But that’s it. No pokin' and proddin'. Just listen and write on your paper. And hurry it up. I got places to be. Really, Doctor, this is ridiculous. A man can't even get a little fixin' without bein’ put through the wringer. But five minutes. That's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, five minutes. Alright, Armando, let’s just listen to your heart and lungs. Please try to breathe deeply for me. Your heart rate is a little fast, and I'm hearing a slight murmur. It's not necessarily alarming, but it’s something I need to investigate further. Your lungs sound clear, but I do notice you're breathing a little shallowly. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated as well, 150/90. I’m going to be honest with you, Armando. Given these findings – the rapid heart rate, murmur, shallow breathing, and elevated blood pressure – I cannot clear you for surgery today. It's not safe. I need you to see a cardiologist for a full evaluation. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: A… cardiologist? Are you serious? All this… for a little fixin'? I came here for a paper, Doctor, not a whole medical investigation! I don't need a cardiologist! I feel fine! This is… preposterous! I've been climbin' towers my whole life! Look, I'm not payin' for any fancy tests. I just want this paper. You're wastin' my time. I think I’ll find another doctor. One who understands what a simple request is. This is… ridiculous. .
