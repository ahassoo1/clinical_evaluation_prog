DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itching, really. All over, seems like. It’s been going on for…oh, goodness, maybe a month now? Not terrible at first, just a little annoyance, but it’s getting worse, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Itching all over, and it's been progressively worsening over the past month. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not…like a rash, exactly. My skin just feels itchy. Really dry feeling too, even after I lotion up. And it’s…hard to describe. It’s not like bug bites, or poison ivy, just…a constant need to scratch. It’s worse at night, I think. Keeps me up sometimes. And it doesn’t seem to be one spot, it’s everywhere. Arms, legs, back…even my stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a generalized itch, not localized to one area, and it’s been happening for about a month, worsening over time, especially at night. You’ve tried lotion, but it hasn’t provided much relief. And you'd describe it as a constant need to scratch, rather than a specific bump or rash?
PATIENT: That’s…exactly right, Doctor. You’re hitting all the points. Lotion helps a tiny bit, maybe for five minutes, then it's back. And yeah, it’s not like a normal rash. No bumps, no blisters, no redness really, just…itchy skin. It’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest. Especially trying to sleep.
DOCTOR: I understand how frustrating that can be, especially when it's affecting your sleep. Let's try to get to the bottom of this. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I don’t think anything makes it better, sadly. As for worse…hot showers definitely make it worse. And stress, I think. When I’m really worrying about something, it seems to get extra bad. I was helping my granddaughter move last week, lots of lifting and worrying, and it was awful that night. Also, I changed laundry detergents a couple months ago, right around the time it started. Could that be it? I hadn't thought of that until just now.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hot showers and stress seem to exacerbate it. And you recently changed laundry detergents – that’s a very good point, and a definite possibility. Let’s talk a bit more about your overall health. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I used to have hay fever as a kid, but that cleared up years ago. Otherwise, nothing. And I don’t take any regular medications, just an occasional pain reliever for my arthritis, but that's it. I mostly try to stay active, walk the dog every day, that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies and only occasional pain relievers for arthritis. That’s helpful. Now, do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Just the arthritis, really. It's in my knees mostly, gets a bit stiff and achy in the cold. The doctor told me it's just old age catching up with me! Nothing major, I can manage it. Oh…and I had pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. Other than that…no. I think I’m pretty healthy for my age, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and a past history of pneumonia. Good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any skin conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a tough one. My family…well, we weren’t big on talking about medical stuff. My mother had…something with her skin, I think. Eczema, maybe? It was when I was a kid, so I don't remember the details. My father, he was healthy as a horse. No, I don’t think so. Nothing obvious, anyway. My sister is still alive, I should probably ask her…but we don’t talk much.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible history of eczema in your mother, but otherwise nothing significant that you're aware of. Let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in my life. And I haven’t had a drink in…oh, goodness, over twenty years now. My wife…she didn’t like it, so I gave it up. And honestly, I don’t miss it. I used to, but not anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking and no alcohol use. That’s good. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, are there any changes in your life recently that might be causing you stress?
PATIENT: Well…my wife passed away last year. It’s been…hard. I’m trying to adjust, but it’s not easy. I'm living alone for the first time in a long time, and…everything feels different. I've been trying to keep busy, spending time with my granddaughter, walking the dog, but…it’s still lonely. I hadn’t really thought about it as stress, exactly, but…maybe it is.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Mr. Ferneding. That’s a significant life change, and it's completely understandable that you’d be feeling stressed and adjusting to a new normal. It absolutely could be contributing to your symptoms. Okay, let's do a quick examination. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your skin more closely. It will just be a quick check to see if there’s anything obvious going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I appreciate you listening. It’s good to talk about it, even if it’s just to a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart and lungs sound good, and your skin looks generally healthy, although it is a bit dry. I'm not seeing any obvious signs of a rash or other skin condition. Based on what you've told me – the generalized itch, worsening at night, no visible rash, and recent life stressors, and the change in laundry detergent – there are a few possibilities we should consider. The most likely is a condition called pruritus, which is simply a fancy word for itchy skin. It can be caused by a number of things, including dry skin, allergies, stress, and even underlying medical conditions. The change in laundry detergent could be an irritant. We also need to consider that stress and grief can manifest physically. To rule out other potential causes, I'd like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. These tests will help us check for any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Tests are good. Better to be sure. I hadn’t really thought about grief causing something like this, but it makes sense, I suppose. Everything is different. And the laundry detergent…well, I can easily switch back to the old one and see if that helps. So, blood tests and then maybe try the old detergent? Is there anything I should do in the meantime? Any creams or lotions you’d recommend?
DOCTOR: Yes, blood tests and switching back to your old laundry detergent. In the meantime, I recommend using a hypoallergenic, fragrance-free moisturizer several times a day, especially after showering. Something like Cetaphil or Eucerin. Avoid hot showers and try to keep your skin cool and dry. Also, and this might sound simple, but try wearing loose-fitting, cotton clothing to avoid irritating your skin further. We should also consider the psychological aspect. If your symptoms don’t improve with these measures, or if you’re struggling with grief and stress, I can recommend a counselor or therapist. Sometimes, talking things through can make a big difference. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Hypoallergenic lotion, cool showers, cotton clothes… I can definitely manage that. And I’ll think about the counselor. Maybe after we see what the tests say. So, how do we go about getting these blood tests done? Do I need an appointment somewhere, or can I do it here?
DOCTOR: We can do the blood tests right here in the clinic. I’ll write you a requisition form, and the phlebotomist will come in and draw the samples. It shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Here's the form. Just take it to the lab around the corner, and they'll take care of everything. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that sounds straightforward enough. Straightforward is good. Okay, I'll head over to the lab then. Thank you, Doctor Dashevsky. You've been very helpful. I feel a bit better just knowing what we're looking at, and that it's not something terribly serious, hopefully.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I'm glad I could help. And you're right, it's unlikely to be something terribly serious, but it's always best to rule things out. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
