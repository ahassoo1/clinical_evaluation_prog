DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s…fine, I suppose. I don't usually come to doctors unless absolutely necessary, and frankly, this is a bit ridiculous. I had a simple cold, just a little sniffle, and now my legs feel like jelly. It started a couple of days ago, and it’s just gotten worse. I can walk, but it’s…effortful, you know? And it’s both legs, which is what’s bothering me.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright to feel frustrated when a simple cold seems to be causing more trouble than expected. It's good you came in to get it checked out. Both legs being affected is certainly worth investigating. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this cold?
PATIENT: Oh, it was nothing special. Just the usual – runny nose, sore throat, a bit of a cough. Lasted about three or four days, like always. I didn’t bother with anything for it, honestly. I don't believe in running to the doctor for every little ache and pain. I just let it run its course. Then, right after it started to clear up, my legs just…gave way, nearly. It wasn't a dramatic fall, thankfully, but it was unsettling. And they’ve been weak ever since. Do you really need to know about the details of my cold? It seems…unimportant.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your perspective, Ms. Firestone. You're right, sometimes the details of a preceding illness aren't crucial. However, it can be helpful to rule out any potential connections. Just to be thorough, could you describe the cough?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. It was…productive. Meaning, there was mucus. Not a lot, mind you. Just a tickle in my chest that would bring one or two things up. It wasn't a hacking cough, more of a…a gentle expulsion, if that makes sense. And it wasn't constant. Mostly in the mornings, and when I lay down. Look, are we getting somewhere with this, or are we just going to dissect every sneeze I had last week? It’s a bit…demeaning, if you ask me. I'm a perfectly healthy woman, generally. This is very strange.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Firestone, and I apologize if I'm being too detailed. My intention isn't to demean you at all. I’m simply trying to gather enough information to understand what might be causing your leg weakness. Let's move away from the cold for a moment, then. When you say your legs feel weak, can you describe how they feel weak?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like a sudden inability to move them, if that makes sense. It's…difficult to explain. It's like trying to push through thick mud. They feel heavy, and it takes a conscious effort to lift them, even just to walk. And they're…tiring easily. I used to be able to walk for miles, no problem. Now, I have to stop and rest after just a short distance. It’s not a pain, exactly, but there’s a…a sluggishness to them. Honestly, it’s quite unnerving. Do you understand what I mean? It’s not like anything I’ve ever felt before.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Firestone, I absolutely understand what you mean. That description – heavy, sluggish, requiring conscious effort – is very helpful. It sounds like you’re experiencing significant weakness, and the fact that it’s tiring you out quickly is concerning. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if this weakness started suddenly, or did it come on gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually, I suppose. It wasn't like I woke up one morning and couldn't walk. It started as a little…hesitation, maybe. Just a slight difficulty lifting my feet. I didn’t really pay much attention to it at first, I thought it was just me being tired. But then, over the next couple of days, it just got progressively worse. Now, it’s…noticeable, and frankly, quite bothersome. It’s just…inconvenient. I have things to do, places to be. I don't have time for this. Are you going to ask me about my childhood now? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Firestone, and I assure you I'm not trying to delay or make this more difficult. Asking about your past medical history and family history can sometimes provide valuable clues, but we can certainly focus on your current symptoms if you prefer. Before we go further, can you tell me if you’ve noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. That's what’s so strange about this! No fever, no pain anywhere else, no numbness, no tingling. Just…weak legs. It’s like they’ve forgotten how to work properly. I feel perfectly fine otherwise. A little tired, perhaps, but that’s just from the stress of dealing with this whole…situation. And frankly, it’s rather unsettling, you know? A healthy woman, suddenly with weak legs. It doesn’t make any sense. Are you sure it wasn't just a bad dream? I'm starting to feel a little foolish being here.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly reasonable to feel foolish when something doesn't make sense, Ms. Firestone. I want to assure you, your concerns are valid, and you are not wasting my time. Given your description, and the lack of other symptoms, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your reflexes, muscle strength, and balance. It will just help me to narrow down the possibilities. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. But don't expect any dramatic findings. I told you, it's probably nothing. And please be quick about it. I have a lunch appointment, you know. I don't believe in letting a little weakness ruin a perfectly good afternoon. Just…get it over with, please. But be gentle, I don’t want to pull anything. I'm a woman of a certain age, you know. This is all rather undignified.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Firestone. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. It won't be uncomfortable, I promise. First, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you please sit on the examination table and let your legs dangle freely?
PATIENT: Alright. Just…get on with it. And try not to poke and prod too much. I really don't understand why you need to do all of this. It’s just legs, not a complicated machine. Honestly, doctors these days…all tests and no common sense. It used to be a simple house call and a sensible diagnosis. Now, it’s all this…fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just checking your reflexes now. I’m noting 2+ reflexes bilaterally, which is normal. Now, could you please try to push your feet against my hands like you're trying to push a pedal?
PATIENT: There. Is that what you wanted? It feels…artificial, you know? I’m perfectly capable of walking, but pushing against your hands like this…it doesn’t feel like a natural movement. Honestly, I'm starting to feel a bit ridiculous. Are you going to make me lift weights now? This is utterly preposterous. And please, tell me what you're looking for, instead of just poking and prodding in silence. I’m not a child, you know. I deserve an explanation.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Firestone. I apologize for the lack of explanation. I'm assessing your muscle strength in your legs. Your strength is 4/5 bilaterally, meaning you can move your legs against moderate resistance. That’s slightly weaker than normal, which correlates with what you’ve described. Now, if you're comfortable, could you please stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It's not a graceful walk, I'll admit, but I can walk. And it's certainly not getting any easier doing it in here, with all of this scrutiny. Honestly, it’s probably just a muscle strain. I should have just rested it. All of this fuss over nothing, I tell you. I bet if I just took a warm bath and went to bed, I'd be perfectly fine tomorrow. Are you going to take a blood sample now? Please don't. I hate needles.
DOCTOR: I noticed a slight hesitancy in your steps and a little favoring of your left leg, which I'll note. It's good you are able to walk, but the subtle differences are important. To get a clearer understanding of what may be causing your weakness, I would like to order a few simple blood tests. These will help rule out any underlying deficiencies or infections. I also recommend an MRI of your lumbar spine to evaluate for any compression of the nerves. It won’t be painful. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: An MRI? Absolutely not. I told you, it's just weak legs! No need for fancy machines and expensive tests. I'm not going to be subjected to a ridiculous procedure based on a few tentative steps. Blood tests, maybe. Just maybe. But no MRI. I'm perfectly capable of making my own decisions about my health, you know. And my decision is no MRI. Honestly, the things they come up with these days... It's all about the money, isn't it? Just trying to line their pockets. I'm starting to regret coming here. This is utterly preposterous. I want a second opinion. And I want it now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Firestone, and I respect your decision. I wouldn't want to proceed with any tests that you're not comfortable with. However, given the gradual onset of weakness in both legs, and the lack of other clear explanations, I strongly believe that an MRI would provide valuable information and help us rule out more serious causes. While a simple muscle strain is possible, it’s less likely with both legs affected and the persistent nature of your symptoms. If you're hesitant about an MRI, would you be open to a referral to a neurologist for a second opinion?
PATIENT: A neurologist… Fine. Yes. A neurologist sounds… reasonable. Someone else to look at my legs and tell me it’s nothing. But a referral, yes. Just a referral. I’m not promising anything. I still think it’s just a muscle strain, and all of this fuss is unnecessary. Honestly, doctors these days... So quick to order expensive tests instead of using common sense. But fine. A neurologist. Get me the referral. And please, tell me how long it will take to get an appointment. I have a life, you know. I can’t just sit around waiting for weeks to be told it's nothing.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Firestone. I understand your concerns about the wait time. I’ll make the referral to Dr. Elena Novak, a highly-respected neurologist in the area. I’ll also have my staff contact you with information about scheduling an appointment. They will do their best to find a time that works for you. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest your legs and avoiding any strenuous activity. I'll write you a prescription for a mild anti-inflammatory to help with any discomfort. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. I think you've taken enough of my time for one day. Just…make sure the referral is sent quickly. And tell Dr. Novak to be sensible. I don’t want any unnecessary tests. I’m not made of money, you know. And honestly, if it’s still just weak legs after all of this, I'm going to be very displeased. I think that’s all. Thank you. Or…well, I suppose it is. Just get me out of here now, please. I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Firestone. My staff will assist you with scheduling and ensure the referral is sent promptly. I understand your frustration, and I hope Dr. Novak can provide you with a clear diagnosis and treatment plan. Here is a prescription for naproxen, and a summary of our consultation today. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Thank you for coming in today. Have a pleasant afternoon, and I hope your lunch appointment is enjoyable.
PATIENT: .
