DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's a waste of my time, but my insurance insisted I come. I've had… issues. Diarrhea. For weeks now. Everything I've tried hasn't worked, and frankly, I don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring. Even if it feels like a waste of time, it's good to get things checked out, especially when it's been going on for weeks. And I appreciate you coming in despite that. "Weeks" is a bit vague, though. Could you tell me roughly how long this has been happening?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Do I have to be precise? Fine. Maybe… six weeks? Something like that. It started after that salmon I got from Old Man Hemlock. Probably bad fish, but he swears it was fresh. Look, I just need something to stop it, okay? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, six weeks. And it started after eating salmon from Old Man Hemlock. That’s helpful information. It does sound like something food-related might be the culprit. Now, to get a better understanding, could you describe the diarrhea itself?
PATIENT: Describe it? What am I, a gastroenterologist? It's… watery. Frequent. And unpleasant. Is that specific enough for you? It’s not like it’s a picnic, Doctor. It's ruining my life, and I don’t need a detailed interrogation about the consistency of it.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I came across as interrogative, Ms. Woodring. I just need to gather enough information to help you. “Watery and frequent” is a good start. Are there any other symptoms accompanying the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Look, I’m tired. And cramping, okay? Bad cramping. And… a little nauseous sometimes, but I haven't actually thrown up. Is that what you want to know? Honestly, it's just… miserable. I’ve tried everything over the counter, and nothing touches it.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping and occasional nausea. And nothing over-the-counter has helped. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or fever accompanying this?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Absolutely not. And no fever. I'm not that sick. I just… can’t get it to stop. I’m a painter, you know. I need to be able to… well, function. Running to the bathroom every hour isn’t exactly conducive to climbing ladders. I'm losing money here.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize again for the questions, but they are important. So, no blood in the stool and no fever. Have you noticed any weight loss since this started?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. If anything, I'm probably lighter from… well, you know. But I haven't been weighing myself. I’ve got better things to worry about. Look, can we just skip to the part where you give me something to fix this? I don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant weight loss. I hear you about wanting a solution. Before I prescribe anything, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. It's just to rule out anything serious and get a better sense of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… be quick about it. I really don’t have the patience for a drawn-out ordeal. It’s just… embarrassing, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. I’ll be as quick and efficient as possible. If you could lie down on your back for me, please. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first with the stethoscope. Then I’ll just gently palpate it to check for any tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. I’m hearing normal bowel sounds… a bit hyperactive, which isn’t surprising with diarrhea, but nothing alarming at this point. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Stop. That’s… uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, but… invasive. And frankly, unnecessary. I told you, it’s just diarrhea. You don’t need to poke around in my stomach to figure that out. It’s… cramping. Like I said. Can we please just skip to the medicine now? Honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring. I apologize if that was uncomfortable. I understand your frustration. I was just trying to rule out other potential causes. Based on what you've described – six weeks of watery diarrhea after eating salmon, with cramping and occasional nausea, but no fever or blood in the stool – it sounds most likely to be infectious gastroenteritis, possibly from the salmon. However, given the duration, we should consider other possibilities and rule them out. To be thorough, I’d like to order a stool test to check for bacteria, parasites, and viruses. It will also check for inflammation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A stool test? You’re kidding me, right? More inconvenience. More poking around. Look, I understand you’re a doctor and want to be “thorough,” but I've already told you what’s wrong. Bad fish. Simple as that. I don't need to send a sample of… that to a lab. Just give me something to stop it. I’m wasting a perfectly good day here. I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Woodring, and I truly apologize for the inconvenience. However, persistent diarrhea for six weeks warrants further investigation to rule out more serious conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease or chronic parasitic infection. While it could be a simple case of food poisoning, it’s important to be certain. If you are absolutely opposed to the stool test at this time, I can prescribe an anti-diarrheal medication to help manage your symptoms. However, I strongly recommend we reconsider the test, as it could prevent more serious complications down the line. If you choose to proceed with just the medication, I will need you to sign a waiver acknowledging you have declined the recommended diagnostic testing. Before we make a decision, do you have any questions about the stool test, or why it's recommended?
PATIENT: A waiver? Seriously? You're making me sign something just to refuse your tests? This is ridiculous. Look, I'm a grown woman. I know my body. It’s bad fish. Fine. Give me the medication. I'll sign whatever paperwork you need to get out of here. But I’m telling you right now, if this doesn’t work, I’m going to be very unhappy. Just… let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring. I understand your frustration, and I respect your decision. I will prepare a prescription for Loperamide, an anti-diarrheal medication. It should help to slow down the frequency and consistency of your bowel movements. I'll also write a waiver for you to sign acknowledging your refusal of the stool test. Here’s what I want you to do: take two capsules initially, then one capsule after each loose bowel movement, up to a maximum of eight capsules per day. Please drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. If your symptoms worsen or don't improve within 48 hours, or if you develop a fever, abdominal pain, or blood in your stool, please seek medical attention immediately. Here is the prescription for the medication and the waiver for you to sign. Do you have any questions about the medication or the instructions?
PATIENT: No. Just… let me go. I’ve wasted enough time here today. There. Happy? Can I go now? I have work to do. And frankly, a bathroom to get back to.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Woodring. You’re all set. Here is a copy of the prescription for your records. I strongly encourage you to reconsider the stool test if your symptoms persist. Please remember to stay hydrated and contact us if you experience any worsening symptoms. I’m sorry this wasn’t a more satisfactory experience for you. Thank you for coming in, and I wish you a speedy recovery. Have a good day. .
