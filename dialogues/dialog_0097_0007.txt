DOCTOR: Hi Lakiya, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. My back… it is painful. Has been for some time now. I would like to get it looked at, if you please.
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain. That’s a pretty common complaint, thankfully we can usually figure things out. “Some time now” – could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: About… three months, I believe. Started after I was building a fence for Mr. Henderson. Heavy work, lots of lifting. It hasn’t gotten better with rest, which is… concerning.
DOCTOR: Three months, and it started with the fence building… that's helpful. And it hasn't improved with rest, you said. Okay. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: It is a dull ache, mostly. But when I bend over, or try to lift something… it is a sharp pain. Goes right down my leg sometimes, the left one. Not all the time, but it happens. Feels like… a bad pull, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache with sharp pains when bending or lifting, and sometimes radiating down your left leg. That sounds like it could be a few different things. Does the pain stay in your back, or does it always go down your leg?
PATIENT: It mostly stays in my back. But, like I said, when I really strain myself… it shoots down the leg. Not always the same spot, either. Sometimes it’s the whole leg, sometimes just the calf. It's… difficult to explain properly. It’s not a constant thing, the leg pain. Just when I push myself too hard.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, you're explaining it just fine. It's good you're noticing those patterns - that's really helpful information. So, mostly back pain, and radiating pain down the left leg with exertion. Before we go any further, have you noticed any numbness or weakness in your leg or foot?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No numbness. And my leg feels… normal, as far as strength goes. I can walk alright, I can still do my work, though it is harder. It just… hurts afterwards. I can still lift, but I avoid it when I can now.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know there's no numbness or weakness. And you're still able to function, just with some difficulty. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever had back problems before this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I've always been strong. Worked hard my whole life. This is… new. My husband… he had some trouble with his knees, but that was from working in the fields. This is different. I’ve never had trouble with my back before this fence job.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this is a new issue, and not related to any previous back problems. That’s good to know. Have you had any other medical conditions diagnosed, like diabetes or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. I have Medicare, I go for my check-ups. They haven’t said anything about any of those things. I’m… relatively healthy, I believe. Just this back. It is a nuisance, to say the least.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s reassuring. And you said you have Medicare, which is good. Let’s talk about any medications you are currently taking, and any allergies you have. Do you take any regular medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take anything regularly. Not even aspirin. I try to avoid pills if I can. And I don’t have any allergies, as far as I know. Never had a reaction to anything. My husband… he was allergic to bee stings, but that was him. I am fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications and no known allergies. That simplifies things nicely. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: I erect fences, Doctor. Mostly for ranches and farms. It is hard work. Lots of digging post holes, lifting wood, stretching wire. I own my own small business, been doing it for twenty years. Used to have help, but… after my husband passed, it’s just been me. It’s good work, but it’s… physically demanding.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re a fence builder, physically demanding work, and you've been doing it for twenty years. That helps me understand the situation better. Alright, Lakiya, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. I would like to know what is causing this pain, if you can find out. Please. Let’s get it done. I have things to do, but I want to be sure this is taken care of.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could lie down on your stomach on the table for me, please. I’ll start by just feeling your back, checking for tenderness or muscle spasms. Then I'll check your reflexes and strength. Just let me know if anything feels particularly painful.
PATIENT: Alright. I will let you know. Be gentle, if you please. It does hurt.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm just feeling along your spine now. Can you tell me if you feel any pain right here?
PATIENT: Yes… there. That is… tender. Not sharp, but… uncomfortable. Like a bruise, almost. Everything else feels… alright. Not as bad as that spot, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, that spot is definitely tender. I’m feeling some muscle tightness there as well. Now, I'm going to gently move your leg in a few different directions to check your range of motion and nerve function. I’ll ask you to tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort during these movements.
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes… that is painful. Down my leg, like before. Not all the way, but… definitely in the calf. It’s… a pulling sensation, almost. Stop, please. That hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm stopping right now. That’s helpful to know. That pain radiating down your leg with that movement suggests there might be some irritation of the sciatic nerve. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs.
PATIENT: Everything feels… normal, Doctor. My legs feel strong enough. I can push against you, I can move them alright. It is just… that pain when you lift my leg. And the tenderness on my back. Everything else feels… the same. I don’t feel weak, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength is good in both legs. That's reassuring. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you likely have a lumbar strain with some possible sciatic nerve irritation. It's likely related to the heavy lifting from building the fence. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Lumbar strain… sciatic nerve… Is that… serious, Doctor? Will I need surgery? I need to be able to work, I have bills to pay. I don’t have time to be laid up. Will it get better on its own? I’m sorry, I’m asking a lot of questions. I just worry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Lakiya. It's good you’re asking questions, and it's understandable to worry. No, a lumbar strain with sciatic nerve irritation is usually not serious. Most people improve with conservative treatment - that means things like rest, ice or heat, over-the-counter pain relievers, and physical therapy. Surgery is rarely needed. We’ll start with a trial of those things. I’m going to order some X-rays of your lower back just to rule out any fractures or other structural problems. We can discuss the results when they come back. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding heavy lifting and bending as much as possible. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-rays… alright. Avoiding lifting… that will be difficult, but I can try. Physical therapy… what does that involve? And what kind of pain relievers are you recommending? Something strong, if possible. I need to get back to work as soon as I can. I understand avoiding lifting, but I have to do something.
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s talk about that. Physical therapy will involve exercises to strengthen your back and core muscles, improve your flexibility, and teach you proper lifting techniques. It will also help to reduce the inflammation and pain. We can get you a referral to a good physical therapist in the area. For pain relief, I recommend starting with over-the-counter options like ibuprofen or naproxen. Those are NSAIDs – nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs – and they can be very effective at reducing pain and inflammation. I don't recommend starting with something strong right away, as we want to avoid any potential side effects. If those don’t provide enough relief, we can discuss other options, but let’s start conservatively. I'm going to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant, just to help with the muscle spasms. It's not a long-term solution, but it can provide some temporary relief. Now, let's talk about work. Is there any way you can modify your work to avoid heavy lifting for a while?
PATIENT: Modifying work… I can ask Mr. Henderson if I can focus on the easier jobs for a while. Fixing fences that are already up, things like that. No digging post holes, no stretching wire. I can’t just stop working, Doctor. I have bills. And I have to be careful, if I ask him, he might just hire someone else. He's not a patient man. I suppose I can try, but it won’t be easy. The muscle relaxant… is that habit-forming? I don't want to get hooked on anything.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Lakiya. It's good you’re thinking about that. The muscle relaxant I’m prescribing is not highly addictive, but it's important to use it as directed and only for a short period of time. We’ll monitor you closely and adjust the dosage if needed. Okay, so focusing on easier jobs for now sounds like a good plan. That will help to reduce the strain on your back and allow it to heal. I'm going to write you a work note, explaining the limitations. I'll also give you a handout with some exercises you can do at home to help strengthen your back and core muscles. And remember, if your pain worsens or doesn't improve after a week or two, please come back and see me. Here's your prescription, your work note, and the handout. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is everything. Thank you. You have been… helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I will try to follow your instructions. And I will come back if it gets worse. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to get back to work.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lakiya. I'm glad I could help. Remember to take it easy, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. And please, listen to your body. Get well soon, and have a good day. .
PATIENT: .
