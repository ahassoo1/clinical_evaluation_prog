DOCTOR: Hi Armando, good to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, one of the family medicine doctors here. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. Doctor Morenomartinez. I have a… a thing I want to get done. A clearance, you see. For… improvements. I don’t have all day to explain, if that’s alright. It’s a cosmetic… procedure. A simple one. I just need a paper saying I’m fit enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you need a medical clearance for a cosmetic procedure and want to keep this brief. I can definitely help with that. To make sure everything is safe, I still need to ask a few questions, just like I would for any other check-up. It won’t take long, I promise. First, can you tell me a little bit more about this “improvement”?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, with all due respect… does it really matter? It’s… personal. It’s a little… tucking. That's all. Under the chin. I don’t see what my medical history has to do with that. It's not like I'm asking to climb a mountain. Just a quick check, and I'll be on my way. Are you going to ask me a million questions or what?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Armando, and I apologize if I'm being intrusive. You’re right, it might seem unnecessary for a small procedure, but even something minor can have risks, and it’s my responsibility to make sure you’re a good candidate and to minimize those risks. It’s standard procedure, truly. Okay, let’s start with the basics then. Do you have any current medical problems – like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart issues, or anything else?
PATIENT: Problems? No, not really. I was… a little tired last year. A bit run down. But I got over it. I used to be very strong, you know. Worked with towers, heavy equipment. Cellular, radio… all that. But that was a long time ago. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a very long time. Can we just skip this part? I feel perfectly fine now.
DOCTOR: Okay, “a bit run down” last year…and you haven’t seen a doctor in a long time. That’s good to know. Just to be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with any long-term conditions?
PATIENT: Diagnosed? Goodness, no. I don't look like I need diagnosing! I told you, I was strong. Towers, Doctor. You have to be strong for towers. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I have appointments to keep. Is this going to take all day? I don't remember much of anything from the past. It's all a blur.
DOCTOR: Alright, Armando. It sounds like recalling medical history is difficult for you. That’s perfectly okay. Let’s try a different approach. Do you take any medications regularly – prescription or over-the-counter – vitamins, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don't put things in my body. I used to… drink something for my nerves, maybe. A long time ago. But I stopped. Don't need anything. I’m a perfectly… capable man. Though, now that I think about it, Mrs. Gable next door gave me a little something for my joints. But I only took one. It didn’t seem to do anything. Honestly, I don’t remember what it was. Can we please hurry this up?
DOCTOR: Okay, so maybe something for your nerves a long time ago, and a single dose of something for your joints from Mrs. Gable. We'll note that. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, latex, anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, no allergies. Never had one in my life. I eat anything. Everything. Don't be silly. I used to work outside all the time. Dust, dirt, who knows what else. Never bothered me. Look, Doctor, I'm starting to feel a little… uncomfortable. This is very intrusive. Is this clearance going to happen or not? I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Armando, I understand your frustration. Let’s switch gears again. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospital? Hmm… maybe. A long time ago. Something with my… back, I think. But it was nothing serious. Just a little tweak. And… I might have had something removed. A… growth. But it was small. Very small. I don’t remember the details. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I keep forgetting things. Is this important? Because I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: Okay, something with your back and a growth removed… It is important, Armando. Knowing these things helps me assess your overall health and ensure this procedure is safe for you. Do you remember where on your back this was, or anything about the growth – where it was located?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I'm telling you, it was a long time ago. Back... lower back, I think. Maybe. It was small. I don't remember the details. Details are… unimportant. I was younger then. Stronger. I worked with towers! All those wires, that equipment… I can barely remember what I had for breakfast! Look, I don’t understand why you need all this information. It’s just a little tuck! Are you going to give me the clearance or not? This is ridiculous. I have better things to do. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Armando, I understand you're feeling rushed and frustrated, but I need to prioritize your safety. Given your difficulty recalling your medical history and past surgeries, and the fact that you haven't seen a doctor in a long time, I can't responsibly provide a clearance right now. I recommend we do a few basic tests – blood work, and possibly a quick EKG – just to get a baseline understanding of your health. It’s a simple precaution. It will take a little longer, but it will give me the information I need to ensure this procedure is safe for you. Alternatively, I can refer you to a specialist who can do a more thorough evaluation. Would you be open to either of those options?
