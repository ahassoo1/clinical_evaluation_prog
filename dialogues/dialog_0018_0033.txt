DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven’t the slightest idea why I’m here. My…daughter, I believe, scheduled this appointment. Something about not being able to see or hear very well. It’s all rather…inconvenient, if you must know. I have patients waiting, you see.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds as though this appointment was scheduled due to some concerns regarding your vision and hearing, perhaps without a full discussion with you beforehand. That is inconvenient, and I apologize for that. We'll certainly get to the bottom of this and make sure your time isn't wasted unnecessarily. To start, could you tell me a bit more about what you’ve been experiencing with your vision?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose things are…a bit blurry. Not constantly, mind you. It comes and goes. And everything seems…distant. I can’t quite make out faces properly, even when I’m close. Though, to be frank, most faces aren’t terribly interesting to begin with. Is this going to take long? I really must get back to the hospital.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about time, Ms. Julie. We will proceed as efficiently as possible. Blurriness that comes and goes, and difficulty seeing faces clearly… that's helpful information. Could you describe when you notice this blurriness the most?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When? Honestly, I don’t keep track of such things. Probably when I’m tired, I suppose. Or…when there’s a lot of glare. And sometimes, even when I’m perfectly rested, things just…fade. It’s not as if I’m completely blind, you know. Just…not as sharp as it once was. This is all rather tiresome, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is understandable to find this frustrating, Ms. Julie. It sounds like the blurriness is variable, and may be affected by factors like fatigue and lighting. That gives us a starting point. Now, regarding your hearing – has your daughter mentioned any concerns about that?
PATIENT: Yes, well, she’s constantly saying I don’t listen. Which is ridiculous, naturally. I hear perfectly well when I want to. But… I suppose sometimes voices do sound muffled. Like they're far away, even when someone is standing right next to me. Though, truthfully, most of what people say isn’t worth hearing in the first place.
DOCTOR: I see. So, muffled sounds and difficulty hearing clearly at times, despite feeling like you should be able to. That’s good to know. To get a clearer picture, have you noticed any ringing, buzzing, or other noises in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? Buzzing? Goodness, no. I haven't been paying attention to my ears, Doctor. I have far more important things to worry about than what noises they're making. I have lives in my hands, you see. Pediatric surgery is not for the faint of heart.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Julie. Your work is certainly demanding. It’s easy for subtle changes to go unnoticed when you’re so focused on others. Now, let's move on to some more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any changes in your overall health recently – any new illnesses, injuries, or significant weight changes?
PATIENT: Well, I had a rather nasty fall last year, tripped over a…a potted plant, I believe. Nothing broken, thankfully. Though I was rather bruised. And my daughter keeps insisting I’m losing weight, but I think she’s simply exaggerating. I eat perfectly well. A bit of salad, mostly. Though I haven’t much appetite these days. Too much on my mind, you see.
DOCTOR: A fall last year and some recent weight fluctuations… thank you for sharing that. Bruising from the fall—did you experience a head injury at all?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that, Doctor. Just a bit shaken up, that’s all. I distinctly remember being quite cross with the gardener for leaving the plant in such a precarious location. Honestly, these people! It was a perfectly good antique pot, too. I was more concerned about the pot than my own well-being, if I’m being truthful.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like the pot was a greater concern at the time. That’s good to know you didn't sustain a head injury, Ms. Julie. Now, thinking about your medical history – do you have any chronic conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the foggiest. I have patients to see, you see. I don’t have time to worry about my own ailments. My daughter handles all of that. I simply present myself for whatever procedures she deems necessary. I’m a surgeon, not a…a patient!
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Julie. It sounds like your daughter manages your medical care. That is helpful to know. Perhaps we can get a detailed record from her physician?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be…ideal, Doctor. Honestly, I'm wasting valuable time here. I have a surgery scheduled in less than an hour. A rather delicate case, you see. Can we simply get this over with? Perhaps a quick eye test and a hearing check?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. We can absolutely proceed with a quick eye and hearing assessment. I do want to quickly ask about any medications you might be taking, just to rule out anything that could be contributing to your symptoms. Even over-the-counter medications or vitamins. And any allergies you may have?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, I don’t believe so. I eat everything. As for medications… I take a small dose of something for my nerves, my daughter insists. Something blue, I think? And occasionally an antacid, if I’ve had too much coffee. That’s it. Really. Now, if you could just get on with the tests…
DOCTOR: Very well. A small dose of something blue for your nerves and occasional antacids. We will get started with the examination. If you’ll have a seat, we’ll start with a basic eye exam. I’ll need you to look straight ahead while I check your visual acuity.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is all rather undignified. But very well, let’s get it over with. Just…try to be quick, please. I have lives to save, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Julie. I will be as efficient as possible. Alright, Ms. Julie, please cover your left eye with your hand and read the smallest line you can make out on this chart. Take your time.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, these letters are terribly small. And blurry, naturally. E…F…P… something… Honestly, I can’t make out a thing. Is this really necessary? It’s all so…frivolous.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Julie. That’s helpful to know. It appears your visual acuity is significantly reduced in that eye. Now, please cover your right eye and let me know what you can see on this chart with your left eye. Again, take your time.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it's all a blur. A complete and utter blur. Perhaps I need new glasses? Though I doubt that would make much difference. My eyesight has been deteriorating for years. It’s simply a sign of aging, you see. A perfectly natural process.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Julie. It appears your vision is significantly reduced in both eyes. We’ll need to assess this further. Now, let’s take a look at your ears. This won’t take long. I’m simply going to look inside your ear canals to check for any blockages or abnormalities. Please remain still. Hmm… Your ear canals appear clear. However, there is some cerumen buildup, but nothing significant. Now, I’d like to perform a quick hearing screening with some tones. I’ll place these headphones on your ears, and you simply indicate when you hear a sound in either ear. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, must you poke around in there? It’s terribly invasive. Very well, proceed. But do be quick about it. I have a very important surgery to prepare for. A child’s life is at stake, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Julie. I will be as efficient as possible. This will only take a few moments. Alright, Ms. Julie, I’m going to emit some tones. Please raise your hand when you hear a sound in either ear, regardless of how faint it may be. …And how about now?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don’t hear a thing. Absolutely nothing. Perhaps the machine is faulty? Or perhaps I’ve simply had enough of this…nonsense. It’s all rather…distracting.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Julie. That’s helpful to know. The hearing screening indicates a significant hearing loss in both ears. Based on the examination, Ms. Julie, your vision and hearing are both significantly reduced. The eye test shows reduced acuity in both eyes, and the hearing screening indicates substantial hearing loss in both ears. The cerumen buildup in your ears could be contributing to the hearing loss, but further investigation is needed. It’s also important to consider the possibility of underlying medical conditions or medication side effects. Given these findings, I recommend a comprehensive audiological evaluation with a specialist, and a referral to an ophthalmologist for a detailed eye exam. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, more appointments? More tests? It’s simply…exhausting. Very well. If you insist. But I expect these specialists to be…efficient. I haven't the time for prolonged examinations. And make sure they are reputable. I will not tolerate incompetence. My daughter can handle the arrangements, I suppose. Just give me the referrals. Now, if you’ll excuse me…I really must be going. A life is waiting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. Here are the referrals to a highly-rated audiologist and ophthalmologist. I’ve noted their contact information on the slips. I will also have my staff send your electronic medical record to their offices to expedite the process. Before you go, I would like to emphasize the importance of addressing these issues. Untreated vision and hearing loss can significantly impact your quality of life and overall health. Thank you for your time, Ms. Julie. I wish you all the best with your surgery, and please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns.
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Very well. Thank you. Or perhaps not. It's hardly worth mentioning. Lives to save…that’s what matters. Not blurry vision and muffled sounds. Honestly, the fuss people make… .
