DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain in my side… my flank, I think you’d call it. And I seem to be getting urinary tract infections quite often now. It’s been happening for a little while.
DOCTOR: Okay, flank pain and frequent UTIs. I see. Let’s start with the flank pain. Can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a dull ache, really. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s just a little niggle, and other times it’s… well, bothersome enough to keep me up at night. It’s usually on my right side, but sometimes I feel it on the left too. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. A dull ache that comes and goes, on either side… okay. And how long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. It’s hard to say exactly… probably at least a year, maybe a little longer. It started off very mild, and I just put it down to getting older, you know? But it’s definitely been getting worse lately. I think it was after I had a particularly bad bout of one of those water infections that it really started to bother me more consistently.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been roughly a year, and it seemed to worsen after a UTI. And you said you’ve been getting these UTIs frequently – about how often would you say you’ve had them in the last year?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… I'd say at least four, maybe five times. It feels like just when I get over one, another one starts. It’s very disruptive. I’m trying to drink plenty of water, like the nurses always tell you, but it doesn’t seem to make a lot of difference.
DOCTOR: Four or five times in a year is definitely frequent. Let's talk a bit more about those UTIs. Can you describe the symptoms you experience when you have one?
PATIENT: Well, the usual things, really. A burning sensation when I… you know. And I have to go to the toilet very often, but only a little bit comes out each time. And sometimes, there’s blood in my urine. It’s not a lot, but enough to worry me, of course. And I feel… tired, generally unwell. A bit achy, too. It's quite unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning with urination, frequency, blood in the urine, and feeling generally unwell. That sounds quite bothersome. Now, let’s switch gears a little. Have you had any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting associated with either the flank pain or the UTIs?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No fever or chills. I haven’t been sick to my stomach either. It's mostly just the pain and the trouble with my waterworks. I do get a bit weak sometimes, but I put that down to my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. Just the pain and urinary symptoms. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor a few years back told me I have something called polycystic kidney disease. He said it runs in my family. I’ve not really had much trouble with it before, just the usual check-ups. Until recently, of course. He did say it could cause problems with my kidneys down the line, but I didn’t really pay much attention at the time. It all seemed a long way off. Perhaps I should have listened more carefully.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease… okay, that’s important information. And you said it runs in the family?
PATIENT: Yes, my mother had it, and I believe one of my sisters too. They didn’t live very long, sadly. The doctor explained it was something to do with cysts growing on the kidneys, but I didn’t fully understand it, to be honest. I just know it’s something I inherited. It was a long time ago now, when I was diagnosed. I can’t recall all the details.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, but that was a very long time ago. And I had a bit of a stay in hospital with pneumonia once, but nothing major. I've always been a fairly healthy person, until recently. I like to think so, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Just the usual things, Doctor. I take a tablet for my blood pressure – it’s called Amlodipine, I think. And I take a multivitamin every day. Nothing else, really. Oh, and sometimes, when I have a water infection, the doctor prescribes me antibiotics. But I try not to take them unless I really have to. I don't want to build up a resistance, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine for blood pressure, a multivitamin, and antibiotics as needed for UTIs. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I haven't ever had a problem with any medication. I'm pretty lucky, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. That’s just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Please go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92, and your pulse is 88. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Can you tell me if you feel any pain when I do this?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright. It’s a little tender… here, on my right side. And… a bit here too, on the left, but not as much. Oh, and… a little lower down, just above my hip. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache, like I was telling you earlier.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting some tenderness in your right flank, and to a lesser extent, your left flank, and lower abdomen. I’m also tapping your back to listen for any unusual sounds. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. This is just to make sure everything is functioning normally. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, please do. I don’t mind at all. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, everything seems normal with your reflexes and strength. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like your flank pain and frequent UTIs could be related to your polycystic kidney disease. The tenderness in your flanks could be due to enlarged kidneys or cysts. Frequent UTIs are also common in people with PKD. However, to get a more definitive diagnosis and rule out other potential causes, I recommend some further testing. Would you be willing to have a urine analysis and a kidney ultrasound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If that’s what you recommend, then yes, I’m happy to have those tests. I want to get to the bottom of this and find out what's causing all the trouble. A kidney ultrasound sounds… thorough.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll order those tests for you right away. The urine analysis will check for infection and other abnormalities, and the kidney ultrasound will give us a detailed picture of your kidneys. The lab will contact you to schedule the appointments. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, it’s important to continue drinking plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. If you develop a fever, chills, or worsening pain, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think you've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Drinking plenty of water and watching out for fever… I can do that. Thank you for taking the time to listen and for ordering the tests. I feel a little bit better now, knowing we’re getting things checked out. I’ll wait to hear from the lab.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m glad I could help. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your appointments. Have a good day, and I’ll see you soon. .
