DOCTOR: Hi Delron, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, I gotta be quick, alright? I'm here for that exam. The military one. Gotta get it done. Don't really have time for... chatting. Just need to know if I'm fit enough, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're on a tight schedule. We can definitely focus on getting the necessary exam completed for your military requirements. Just to be clear, is this for initial enlistment, or is it a periodic check-up during service?
PATIENT: Enlistment. First time. Never been in before. Look, I'm a strong guy. Always been good with machines. Worked on 'em my whole life. That should count for somethin', right? Not some desk job kinda fella. Need to know if I pass, that's it. Don’t need a lecture about… well, anything.
DOCTOR: Right, initial enlistment. Okay. Machine work is great—shows good aptitude and problem-solving skills, definitely. But the exam is to make sure you’re physically prepared for the demands of service. We'll check your vital signs, do a physical assessment, and likely some basic bloodwork and a urine sample. To start, can you tell me about any current medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Nah. Not really. Had a bit of a bad back once, lifting a engine block, but that was years ago. Healed up fine. Nothing botherin' me now. I'm tough, like I said. Don't get sick much. Maybe a cold now and then, but who doesn't? I don't take any pills or nothin’ either. No need for fancy doctor stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No current medical issues, back injury years ago that's resolved, and no medications. Just to be thorough, have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Hmm... let me think. When I was a kid, maybe? I broke my arm fallin’ out of a tree. But that was ages ago. Like, sixty years ago, somethin’ like that. It healed up just fine. Didn't need much doin', just a cast. Didn't stay in there long. Honestly, I don’t really remember much of it. It was a long time ago, like I said. Is that even important? I mean, I'm fine now.
DOCTOR: Okay, childhood broken arm, healed without complications. It’s good to have a complete history, even things from a long time ago. Now, have you ever had any major surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No. Never had any. Not a fan of knives, you know? Always been able to fix myself up, mostly. A few stitches here and there from workin' on the engines, but nothin’ major. No big operations. Never needed 'em. I think I'd remember somethin’ like that, wouldn’t I? It's kinda hard to forget bein’ cut open.
DOCTOR: Right, no surgeries. Okay, good. Now, thinking about your family – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family? Hmmm… My old man… he had a weak heart, I think. Kept coughin’ all the time, always tired. He didn’t take care of himself, though. Smoked like a chimney, drank too much. Died when I was young. My mother… she had… well, just old age, I guess. She lived a long life. Not really anythin' serious that I know of. No one with, like, cancer or nothin’ like that. Just… old people stuff. Is that what you’re askin’?
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of a weak heart in your father, and general old age in your mother. Now, just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. Not to pollen, not to cats, not to nothin’. I can eat anything, touch anything, breathe anything. Seriously. Never had a reaction to anythin' in my life. Always been a strong constitution, like I said. I eat whatever's in front of me. No problem. Don't need to worry about that. Is this important? We’re runnin’ out of time here.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Good. Now, let’s move onto some quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently use any tobacco products, including cigarettes, vaping devices, or chewing tobacco?
PATIENT: Nah. Not anymore. Used to smoke, years ago. When I was younger, stupid things. But I quit a long time ago. Maybe twenty years ago. Good for me, right? Doctor always told me to. Been breathin’ easy ever since. Don’t need that stuff. Waste of money, waste of time. Now, let's get on with it, alright? I'm wastin' daylight here.
DOCTOR: Okay, former smoker, quit 20 years ago. That’s excellent. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes. A beer with the lads now and then. Not a big drinker, though. Never been one for gettin’ plastered. Maybe a couple on a Saturday night, that’s it. Don’t need it. Not like I need anything. It's just social, you know? Keeps things normal. Not a problem, I assure you. I can stop anytime, alright? Don’t need a lecture.
DOCTOR: Okay, social drinker – a couple of beers on the weekends. And lastly, do you currently use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Recreational… what? Look, I’m a mechanic, not a… whatever. Never touched that stuff. Not interested. Not my kinda thing. Waste of time, waste of money, waste of life. Seriously. I got work to do, engines to fix. Don't need anythin' cloudin' my head. Next question, alright? I'm startin’ to lose patience here. This is gettin’ ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recreational drug use. Alright, Delron. That completes the basic questionnaire. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Just standard stuff – listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, things like that. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. Don't poke around too much, alright? I got things to do. Engines aren't gonna fix themselves. Just… be quick about it. And no funny business, alright? I don't like bein' touched.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Quick and efficient is the plan. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs auscultated. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 130/80. A little elevated, but not overly concerning given you’re a little tense. Now, can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Stand up? Fine. There. Happy? Just get on with it. I’m startin’ to sweat now. This is ridiculous. I could be fixin’ an engine right now. What’s next? Is this gonna take all day? Just tell me if I pass or not, alright? This is important.
DOCTOR: Okay, thanks. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please sit back down. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, normal response. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion in your shoulders and elbows. Can you raise your arms above your head?
PATIENT: There. Like that? It's a bit tight, alright? Worked on engines my whole life. Gets a bit stiff. Not much you can do about it. It’s not gonna stop me from lifting somethin’ heavy, alright? Don’t need perfect flexibility, I need strength. Get on with it. This is… uncomfy.
DOCTOR: Okay, some mild stiffness in the shoulders bilaterally, but full range of motion achieved. Now, I'm going to quickly palpate your abdomen. No tenderness noted. Okay, that completes the physical exam. To be absolutely thorough, we’ll need a urine sample and some bloodwork. Then we can review the results and determine if you meet the requirements. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Urine sample and bloodwork? Fine. Whatever. Just tell me where to go. Don't need a long explanation, just point me in the right direction. And make it quick, alright? I’m losin’ daylight. This is gettin’ ridiculous. Just gettin’ in the way of progress here. Point. Me. Now.
DOCTOR: Okay. The restroom is just down the hall on the left, and the lab is right next door. They’ll draw your blood there. Once you’ve completed those, come back and I’ll review the results with you. It should be fairly quick. We'll get this sorted out for you.
PATIENT: Fine. Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. Wasting a perfectly good day on… tests. Should be fixin’ an engine. Just gettin’ in the way of progress. .
