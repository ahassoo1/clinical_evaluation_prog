DOCTOR: Hi Larin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. My back… it really hurts. Bad. It's been hurting for a little while now, but it’s much worse these days. It makes it hard to do things.
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain. I understand. “A little while now” and “much worse these days” are pretty vague, so let’s try to get a bit more specific. Can you tell me when the pain first started, even roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe three months ago? Around the end of April, I think. It wasn’t so bad then, just a little ache after I worked. But it’s gotten worse every week, I think. Like, now it hurts even when I’m just sitting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about three months ago, end of April, started as an ache after work and now it’s constant, even at rest. That’s helpful. Where exactly on your back is the pain?
PATIENT: It’s… lower back. Right in the middle, mostly. Sometimes it feels like it goes around to the side a little, but the worst part is right in the middle of my lower back.
DOCTOR: Okay, mid-lower back, sometimes radiating to the sides. And can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: It’s… not sharp, not really. It’s more like… a heavy ache. Like someone is sitting on my back, or squeezing it really tight. And sometimes it feels… burning, a little. Not a lot, but sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense – a heavy ache, squeezing, and sometimes burning. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain better or worse?
PATIENT: Yes! Lying down helps. When I lie flat on my back, it feels a little bit better. But standing… or walking… or bending over… that makes it much worse. And work… work is the worst. I do a lot of lifting at the factory.
DOCTOR: Okay, relieved by lying flat, worsened by standing, walking, bending, and especially lifting at work. Have you tried anything to help manage the pain – like over-the-counter medications, heat or ice, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes, I tried those little pain pills… the ones you can buy at the store. Ibuprofen, I think they’re called? They help a little, but not much. And I tried putting a warm towel on it, but that didn’t really do anything either. It just… doesn’t seem to help.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen provides minimal relief, and heat doesn't seem to help. Now, I want to ask about other symptoms. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. My legs feel okay. Sometimes they’re a little tired at the end of the day, but that’s just from work, I think. No weakness, though. I can walk just fine.
DOCTOR: Good. That's helpful to know. Have you had any changes in your bowel or bladder function?
PATIENT: Changes? I… I don’t know what you mean. Like… going to the bathroom? Everything seems normal there. I haven’t had any problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in bowel or bladder function. That’s good. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever had back problems before – like a previous injury, surgery, or anything diagnosed by a doctor?
PATIENT: Yes… I had an x-ray a few years ago, maybe five years? The doctor said something about… arthritis, I think. In my back. But he didn’t do anything about it. Just said to take it easy. And… and I know I have… cancer. The doctor told me about that last year. It’s… in my lungs.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for telling me that. So, a previous x-ray showed some arthritis and you were diagnosed with lung cancer last year. I’m sorry to hear that. Knowing about the lung cancer is very important as we figure out what’s going on with your back pain. Do you recall what kind of treatment you’ve had for the lung cancer?
PATIENT: I had… some medicine. Pills I had to take every day. And… and some radiation. That was last year, too. It made me very tired. I finished the radiation a few months ago. The doctor said… it was helping, but it didn’t go away completely.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you received both chemotherapy and radiation for the lung cancer. I’m accessing your electronic health record now to get more details on those treatments. It looks like you were treated with carboplatin and pemetrexed, and had a course of stereotactic body radiation. Now, let’s talk about family history. Does anyone in your family have a history of back problems, arthritis, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother… she had arthritis in her hands. Very bad arthritis. She couldn’t use her hands much when she got old. And… and my brother… he had cancer too. Different kind, I think. He had it in his stomach. He… he passed away a few years ago.
DOCTOR: I'm sorry to hear about your mother and brother. That’s a lot. And just to complete the picture, can you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean? Like… do I have friends?
DOCTOR: That's a good question. It just means things like whether you smoke, drink alcohol, what your job is like, and what your daily activities are. You mentioned working at a factory, which is helpful. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. I used to smoke, a long time ago. But I stopped… maybe fifteen years ago? And I don’t drink alcohol. Never really liked it. My job… it’s hard work. Lifting boxes all day. It's… it's a lot on my back. I try to help around the house when I can, but it's hard now with the pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, you quit smoking fifteen years ago and don't drink alcohol. Your job involves heavy lifting. Now, one last question about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. The doctor gave me some pills before, for the cancer, and I didn't have any problems with those. I think that’s everything?
DOCTOR: Okay, great. No known allergies. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Larin. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a physical exam to get a better understanding of your back pain. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That's alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, I'm going to listen to your lungs. Your breathing sounds a little diminished on the right side, with some crackles at the base. This is likely related to your lung cancer and previous treatment. Now, I'm going to gently feel your spine, checking for tenderness, muscle spasms, and range of motion. There's definite tenderness to palpation in your lower lumbar region, particularly over the L4-L5 vertebrae. Your muscle spasms are present bilaterally, but more pronounced on the right side. Your range of motion is limited in all directions, especially with bending forward. Finally, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Your reflexes are normal and strength is 5/5 bilaterally. I don’t see any signs of neurological deficit. Based on what you’ve told me and what I found during the exam, it’s likely your back pain is related to a combination of factors, including your history of lung cancer, previous treatment, and the physical demands of your job. It's difficult to say definitively without further imaging, but my concern is that the cancer may have metastasized to your spine. To rule that out, I’d like to order an MRI of your lumbar spine. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Metastasized? What… what does that mean? Is it… is it bad? I… I don’t want it to be worse. An MRI… okay, if you think it’s important. But… is it going to hurt? I don’t like being in those machines. It makes me feel… closed in.
DOCTOR: It's understandable that you're worried, Larin. "Metastasis" means that the cancer cells have spread from the lungs to other parts of your body. It can be serious, but it doesn’t automatically mean things are hopeless. We need to know for sure what’s going on before we can discuss treatment options. An MRI will give us a very clear picture of your spine and help us determine if the cancer has spread there. The MRI itself isn't painful. You'll lie on a table inside a large machine, and it makes a lot of noise. You will be able to communicate with the technician at all times, and they can provide you with earplugs or headphones to help with the noise. It can be a bit claustrophobic for some people, and you're right, it can feel closed in. If you have any anxiety about being in the machine, we can discuss options like medication to help you relax, or even a shorter, less comprehensive scan. Would you like me to explain the scan in more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… medicine would probably be good. I… I don’t like small spaces. And explaining it would help, I think. What… what will it show me? Will I be able to see the cancer, if it’s there?
DOCTOR: Okay, we can absolutely discuss medication to help with the anxiety. We typically offer a mild sedative for patients who feel claustrophobic. As for what the MRI will show, it uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of the structures within your spine – the bones, discs, nerves, and spinal cord. It doesn’t use any radiation. If there is cancer spread to your spine, the MRI will show it as areas of abnormal signal. We can see if there are any lesions or growths on the bones or affecting the spinal cord. The radiologist, a doctor who specializes in interpreting images, will review the scan and send a report to me. I want to be clear: we don't know if the cancer has spread yet. The MRI is simply a tool to help us get more information. I’m ordering it to rule out the most serious possibilities and to guide our treatment plan. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes… okay. It makes a little more sense. So it won't show me the cancer, but the doctor will tell me what it shows? And medicine will help me not feel… scared? When… when can I get the scan? I just want to know. I don't like waiting.
DOCTOR: Exactly. The MRI technician will take the images, and then a radiologist will review them and create a report. I will then discuss the findings with you in detail. And yes, the medication should help you feel more relaxed and less anxious during the scan. We can prescribe something to take about an hour before your appointment. Let me check the availability at the imaging center. They have an opening tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 PM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow… okay, yes, that's good. 2:30 is fine. Can… can I still go to work in the morning? I need the money.
DOCTOR: Yes, you should be able to go to work tomorrow morning. The medication I’m going to prescribe shouldn't impair your ability to work, but it may make you a little drowsy, so please be careful. Also, you'll need someone to drive you to and from the imaging center tomorrow, as you shouldn’t drive after taking the medication. I’m also going to give you a prescription for a pain reliever to help manage your back pain in the meantime. I want to emphasize that this is just to provide some temporary relief while we wait for the MRI results. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very well. And thank you for the medicine. I’m… I’m still scared, but I feel a little better knowing what’s going on. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Larin. It's completely understandable to be scared, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. I'll have the nurse print out your prescriptions and schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the MRI results. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. I'll see you next week. .
