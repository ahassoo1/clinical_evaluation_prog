DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor... Overgaard, yes? I’m here for… a check-up. For the team. A sports team. It’s… important. I think. My… ex-wife, she signed me up for something. Honestly, I don't recall all the details. It’s about… being athletic, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Right. A check-up for the team. And your ex-wife arranged this, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that's correct. She... likes to keep me busy. Though, truthfully, I haven't been much of an athlete in… some time. Not since… well, it doesn't matter. She said something about needing a paper, a doctor's note, for… trying out. For the team. Is that what you need? A paper? I don't even know what team.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, with all due respect, this is rather vague. We need to understand why you're here. Is this a pre-participation physical for a specific sport?
PATIENT: Specific? No, not that I know of. Look, Doctor, she just said “team”. She’s always… enthusiastic. A bit much, if you ask me. She probably saw something on the television and thought I should try it. I used to… lift things, a long time ago. Construction, you understand? Heavy work. But a team? I don’t… I don’t follow. Is this going to take long? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's try this a different way. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm. Well… my back. Sometimes. When I bend over. It’s old. From the lifting, you see? Years of it. Not a sharp pain, more of a… ache. And my knees, a little. They creak. Like an old door. Is that what you mean by pain? The usual aches of getting older, Doctor. Nothing… serious, I don't think. Though, honestly, I haven’t really looked at them.
DOCTOR: Okay, back and knees. And when did this back pain start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start? That's... a difficult question. It wasn’t sudden, you understand? It just… was. Years ago, I suppose. Probably when I was still working. Lifting heavy things, like I said. It just got… worse over time. A little bit each year. I don't remember a specific incident. Just… the years. A lot of years. Is that helpful? I never really paid it much mind. Just took some… pills sometimes. The red ones. Or maybe the white ones. I forget.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s try to get a clearer picture. Do you remember what kind of pills they were?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. My… ex-wife handled all that. She has a… system. Little bottles, different colors. She’d tell me which ones to take. I just… took them. I don't pay attention to those things. It was for the pain. That's all I knew. I think they helped. Sometimes. Or maybe it was just the rest. It’s all a bit… fuzzy, you understand? I’m not good with remembering details. It’s been a long time. And a lot of pills. Different colors. Is this important, Doctor? It feels like we're going in circles.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Bartok. We need to know what medications you're taking, or have taken recently, to ensure there are no interactions or contraindications. Do you have any idea at all what they might have been for, besides pain?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. She always said they were… good for me. For my health. She watches a lot of television, you see. Different doctors on the television. She probably got the idea from one of them. She’s very… proactive. She always wants me to be… optimal. That’s her word. Optimal. I just… took the pills. I don’t question her. It avoids… complications. Look, Doctor, I’m just here for the team. If you need a paper saying I’m… generally okay, I suppose, I'd be happy to have one. But this questioning about pills… it’s making me uncomfortable. Can we just… get on with it? Is this team very important?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your discomfort, but I cannot simply write a note stating you're "generally okay" without a proper assessment. That would be irresponsible. We need to know your medical history, your current health status, and any medications you're taking to ensure your safety. Let's start with this: do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm... That's... another good question. Let me think. I think I had a rash once. A long time ago. From… something. But I don’t remember what. Maybe it was poison ivy? Or a bug bite. It was itchy. Very itchy. My ex-wife gave me some cream. It went away. I don’t think it was a serious allergy. Just… itchy. I've never had trouble breathing or anything like that. I don't recall any specific allergies, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to those things. It’s just… itchy things sometimes. Does that help? I really don’t understand why we need to know so much. It’s just a team!
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on. Do you have any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Medical conditions... Well, Doctor, I’m an older man. Things… ache. Like I said. My back, my knees. Is that a condition? I wouldn’t say I have problems, exactly. Just… the usual wear and tear. My ex-wife keeps talking about my cholesterol, something about numbers being too high. She makes me eat a lot of… oatmeal. And fish. She says it’s good for my heart. She’s always going on about my heart. I don’t think I have any serious conditions. Just… old. A little creaky. I don't go to the doctor much, you see. If it doesn't hurt too bad, I just… ignore it. Is that bad? I really don’t understand why this team requires so much paperwork. It seems… excessive.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, your ex-wife mentioned high cholesterol. Do you know what your cholesterol numbers are, or are you currently taking any medication for it?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. She showed me a piece of paper once. Lots of numbers. I didn't understand any of them. She said some were too high, some were too low. She uses words like… HDL and LDL. It all went over my head. I just nodded and smiled. She started making me eat more fish. And oatmeal. Like I said. I don't take any pills specifically for it, not that I know of. She puts them in my food sometimes. Little white pills. Or maybe they're red. I honestly can't remember. She says they're good for me. That's all I know. I really don’t pay attention to these things, Doctor. I'm just a simple man. This team… it’s getting more complicated than I expected. Is there any way we can just skip to the part where you tell me if I’m allowed to play?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your frustration, but I cannot clear you for any physical activity without a more thorough assessment. It's irresponsible and potentially dangerous. We need to understand your medical history to ensure your safety. Let's try this: do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Not me. Never liked it. Always thought it smelled… unpleasant. My father smoked, a long time ago. But I always stayed away from it. Always preferred fresh air. My ex-wife doesn’t like it either. She’s very… health-conscious. She says it’s bad for your lungs. She always watches those television programs. So, no, I’ve never smoked. Never even tried it. Is that helpful? Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel a little… overwhelmed. All these questions… for a team. It's just supposed to be fun, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Let's start with a basic physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you need. I'll try my best. Deep breath… like this? I take a very loud, exaggerated breath. Is that good? My chest feels a little tight, if you don't mind me saying. All this talking… and all the questions. It’s making me a little anxious. Just let me know if you need anything else. I’m a simple man, you see. Not used to all these… procedures. Hopefully, this won’t take too long. I have… things to do, you know? Important things. For the team. Or at least, that’s what my ex-wife tells me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and I'm hearing some slight wheezing in your lungs. Do you have any history of asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Asthma? Bronchitis? Hmm... let me think. I did have a bad cough once. A long time ago. Wintertime, I think. My ex-wife gave me some… syrup. Cherry flavored. It tasted awful. But it helped. I coughed a lot, but it eventually went away. I don’t know if that was asthma or bronchitis. She just said it was a “chest infection”. She’s very good at knowing these things, you see. Always watching those television programs. I don’t remember ever being officially diagnosed with anything. Just… a bad cough. And cherry syrup. Is that helpful? Honestly, Doctor, I'm starting to feel a little lightheaded. All these questions… and you listening to my chest… it’s a bit unnerving. Can we please get this over with? I really don't understand why a simple team requires so much scrutiny.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, given your reported history of a "chest infection" and the wheezing I'm hearing, I'm concerned about possible underlying lung issues. I need to be cautious. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test to get a better understanding of your lung capacity and rule out any serious conditions.
PATIENT: X-ray? Pulmonary function… what now? Doctor, that sounds… serious. I just want to play on a team! Is that really necessary? I don’t understand all these… tests. And I don’t like being poked and prodded. My ex-wife will be furious if I miss… whatever this team thing is. She made it sound very important. She said it would be… good for my health. But this sounds… unhealthy. Can’t you just… write a note? Saying I’m generally okay? I promise I’ll take it easy. I’m not planning on running a marathon. Just a little bit of fun, Doctor. Please? This is all getting very complicated. And I'm starting to feel very anxious. I think I need to sit down.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your anxiety, but I cannot compromise your safety. An X-ray and pulmonary function test are standard procedures to assess lung health. Given your symptoms and reported history, it's the responsible course of action. I'm going to write you a referral to a specialist for these tests. We'll need to review the results before I can clear you for any physical activity. I'm sorry, but I cannot simply write a note stating you're "generally okay" without proper evaluation. It would be unethical, and potentially dangerous. Would you like me to call you a nurse to sit with you while we arrange these tests?
PATIENT: I shift uncomfortably in my seat. Tests… specialist… This is getting out of hand. My ex-wife is going to kill me. She'll say I didn't try hard enough. She'll say I'm not taking my health seriously. I run a hand through my thinning hair. Look, Doctor, is there anything else I can do? Anything at all? Can I… can I take some vitamins? Or… or eat more fish? Maybe that will help? I really don't want to go to a specialist. And I definitely don't want to have an X-ray. It sounds… scary. I pause, looking pleadingly at the doctor. Just tell me… is it completely impossible to play on this team? Without all these… procedures? I slump back in my chair, looking defeated. This is a disaster. A complete and utter disaster. Yes, please. A nurse would be… very helpful. I think I’m going to faint.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your concerns, but I must prioritize your health. Unfortunately, without a proper evaluation, I cannot clear you for physical activity. It would be irresponsible of me to do so. I will call a nurse to sit with you and help you calm down. We can discuss the referral to the specialist and schedule the tests at your convenience. Perhaps the nurse can also help you communicate your concerns to your wife. I will also document your strong resistance to further testing in your medical record. Please, try to relax. I assure you, the tests are relatively simple and will provide valuable information. I reach for the phone. Would you like me to call your wife to explain the situation as well?
