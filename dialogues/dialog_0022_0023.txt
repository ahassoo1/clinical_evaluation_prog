DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, my chest… it hurts. Not all the time, but sometimes. It’s like… a sore feeling. It's been happening for a couple weeks now, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore feeling in your chest for a couple of weeks. Can you tell me a little more about that soreness?
PATIENT: It's... hard to say exactly. It's not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache. And it’s not always in the same place. Sometimes it’s more on the left side, sometimes the right. It doesn't hurt to touch it, really. Just… feels uncomfortable. Like after a hard workout, but I haven't been working out hard.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache that varies in location, not related to activity… that's helpful. Does anything specifically make it worse – like breathing deeply, coughing, or lying down?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don't think so. Breathing doesn't make it worse. Coughing… maybe a little, but not much. Lying down… no, I don’t think so either. It just… comes and goes. Sometimes I don't even notice it. It's more annoying than anything, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s fairly intermittent and doesn’t seem to be triggered by anything specific. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this chest discomfort?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Um… not really. No fever, no cough. My appetite is okay. I haven't noticed anything different with my… you know… the skin on my chest. No bumps or anything. Just the soreness. I'm married, if that matters. My wife… she didn't notice anything either.
DOCTOR: That’s good information. Your wife hasn’t noticed any visible changes, and you haven’t had any fever or other associated symptoms. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness, or unexplained fatigue lately?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No shortness of breath. No feeling sick to my stomach. Not dizzy. And I'm… I’m usually pretty tired from work, but that's normal. Nothing more than usual. I’m a roofer, you know? It's a hard job.
DOCTOR: Okay, a physically demanding job… that’s good to know. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I haven’t really been to the doctor much. Just for check-ups when I was a kid, I think. I usually just try to tough things out. My wife is always telling me I should go more often. I don’t have insurance, so… it's expensive.
DOCTOR: I understand. Many people avoid seeking care due to cost. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. And I haven’t been in the hospital. Not ever. I try to be careful on the roof, you know? Accidents happen, but… I try my best. Is this something serious, Doctor? My wife will be worried.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. I appreciate you being open with me. It's good that you're careful at work. It’s too early to say definitively whether it’s serious, but we need to investigate this chest discomfort to rule out anything concerning. To get a better picture of what's going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your chest wall. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Just… try not to make it too uncomfortable. I don’t like being poked and prodded too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll be gentle. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. There's some tenderness to palpation in the mid-sternal area, but no significant muscle spasm or bony abnormalities. Your breathing is normal. Based on the exam, the tenderness is fairly localized, but we still need to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I know of. I can take most things. My wife gives me medicine when I have a cold, and I haven't had any problems. It’s still a little sore, but not too bad. What possibilities are you thinking about? My wife is always worried about cancer.
DOCTOR: That's understandable that your wife is concerned about cancer. It's good you discuss these things with her. We need to consider a range of possibilities, but I don’t want to alarm you. It could be a musculoskeletal issue – like strain of the chest wall muscles from your work. It could also be related to acid reflux or heartburn, even if you don’t experience typical burning. Less likely, but we need to rule it out, could be something cardiac. To help narrow things down, I’d like to order a few basic tests. A chest X-ray to rule out any lung abnormalities. And an EKG – that's a simple test to check the electrical activity of your heart. Would you be able to get those done?
PATIENT: X-ray and EKG… okay. I guess so. Where do I go for those? And… how much will they cost? I don’t want to surprise my wife with a huge bill. I really don't have much money right now.
DOCTOR: That's a valid concern. Let me see what I can do. There’s a clinic down the road – Rural Health Services – they often have a sliding scale for patients without insurance. I'll write you a referral and also call ahead to inquire about their pricing and potential financial assistance programs. Here’s the referral. The phone number for Rural Health Services is on the slip. Call them and explain you were referred by me, Dr. Tosca, and you’re uninsured. They can schedule the X-ray and EKG and give you an estimate of the cost. Once you have the results, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… good. Thank you, Doctor. You’re being very helpful. A sliding scale would be a big help. I'll call them tomorrow. Is there anything else I should do or know?
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I'm glad I could help. For now, try to avoid any strenuous activity that aggravates the chest discomfort. If you experience any sudden, severe chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or sweating, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately – don’t wait for a follow-up appointment. Otherwise, just focus on getting those tests done and we’ll go from there. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You explained everything very clearly. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate your help. I'll call tomorrow and schedule the tests. Hopefully, it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I hope it’s nothing serious as well. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up. Take care, and have a good day.
PATIENT: Okay, you too Doctor. Thank you.
