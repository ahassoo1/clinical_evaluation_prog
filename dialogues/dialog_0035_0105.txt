DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um... well, I'm here about getting surgery. For my weight, I mean. My wife helped me set it up. It’s… bariatric surgery, she called it? I don't really remember all the details, honestly. It was a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Okay, bariatric surgery. That’s perfectly alright – it is a lot to take in. And it’s good your wife is supporting you. So, you’re looking for a consultation to discuss weight loss surgery. Just to get a better understanding, how long have you been considering this as an option?
PATIENT: Considering it… that’s a good question. Not long, I don't think. Maybe a few months? My wife has been talking about it for a while, saying it would be good for my health. I've been… feeling pretty tired lately, and it’s hard to keep up with my kids. I just… kinda agreed. I don’t really have a good memory for things like that, if that makes sense. It all feels a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, and it’s perfectly alright if the details are fuzzy. We can definitely go over everything together today. Okay, so fatigue is a big part of what's bringing you in. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. It’s just… all the time, really. Even after a full night’s sleep, I wake up feeling like I didn’t sleep at all. And throughout the day, I just… drag. It makes it hard to do anything. Playing with the kids is exhausting, even just walking around the house. It’s been getting worse, I think. My wife says I’ve been more irritable, too. I don’t really notice it myself, but she's pretty good at noticing things. Does that… make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Fatigue and irritability can definitely go hand-in-hand, and it’s good your wife is observing these things. Have you seen a doctor about this fatigue before, or have any other medical conditions we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Um... I think so. I've been to the doctor a few times, but it’s always been just… general check-ups. They usually just tell me to get more sleep and exercise, which is… hard, honestly. I don't think they ever really looked into it. As for other conditions… I don’t think so? I had my appendix out when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. I don't really remember anything else. I’m sorry, I’m not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: You're not being unhelpful at all, Mr. Kochubey. It's common to have a lot of details fuzzy, and it’s good to know what hasn’t been addressed. Okay, so no other major medical issues that you’re aware of. Let’s talk about your family a little bit. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of weight problems, diabetes, heart disease, or anything else that runs in the family?
PATIENT: That's… a tough one. My family is back in Iraq, mostly. We don't really… keep in touch a lot, you know? It's hard to talk to them, and when we do, we don't really talk about health stuff. I know my dad had some problems with his heart, I think? But I don't know what kind of problems, or how serious it was. My mom… she was always pretty healthy, I think. But honestly, I couldn’t tell you for sure. It was a long time ago, and I was pretty young. Sorry again. I wish I knew more.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. Family history can be difficult to gather, especially with distance and limited communication. We'll work with what we have. Okay. Let's switch gears a bit. What about your current lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle... Hmm. Well, I work at a retail store. Mostly standing around, helping customers. It's not very active. I drive to work, so I don't walk much. And when I get home, I'm usually pretty tired, so I just... relax. Watch TV, spend time with my wife and kids. We eat dinner together most nights. I guess it's pretty typical, really. Not much exercise, unfortunately. My wife tries to get me to go for walks with her, but I usually end up… too tired. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like a pretty standard, busy life. Okay. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, no medications. I haven't really needed any. And no allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, pretty much. My wife always makes me try new things, even if they look weird. I don’t think I’ve ever had a reaction to anything. At least, not that I remember. Sorry. I'm starting to feel like a broken record, aren't I? Always saying 'I don't remember'.
DOCTOR: You’re not a broken record at all, Mr. Kochubey. It’s perfectly alright to not remember everything. It’s actually quite common. Okay, one last quick question before we move on to a physical exam. What's your typical diet like?
PATIENT: Oh… the diet. That's… not great, to be honest. A lot of fast food, probably too much. My wife tries to cook healthy meals, but sometimes I just grab something quick after work. Pizza, burgers, that kind of thing. And I like sweets. A lot. I try to eat vegetables sometimes, but it's hard. I know I should eat better, but it's just… easier to eat what's fast and convenient. I feel bad admitting that, but it's true. Does that…sound awful?
DOCTOR: It doesn't sound awful at all, Mr. Kochubey. It’s very honest, and many people struggle with that. It's good you’re aware of it, and we can certainly talk about that as part of your overall health plan. Okay, great. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That's fine. Whatever you need. I guess I should probably get changed into one of those gowns, right? Is there a bathroom I can use? I hope this isn't going to be too bad. I don't really like doctors' offices.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right, a gown would be great. And yes, there’s a bathroom just down the hall to your left. Take your time, and just change to the best of your comfort. I’ll be right outside when you’re ready. And don't worry, we'll make this as quick and comfortable as possible.
PATIENT: Okay. Thanks, Doctor. I'll be right back.
