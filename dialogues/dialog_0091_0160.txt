DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, doctor, no need for all the pleasantries. I’m tired. Really tired. And I have... a strange habit, I guess you could call it. It's embarrassing, honestly. I just… eat dirt. Clay, mostly. Don’t look at me like that. It’s been getting worse lately, and frankly, I don't have the energy to deal with it anymore. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Thank you for being candid with me, Ms. Hardenburgh. I assure you, I’m here to listen without judgment. It takes courage to discuss something like this. You mentioned feeling tired and consuming clay. Could you tell me more about this habit?
PATIENT: Well, it started… oh, I don’t know, years ago. Just a little bit here and there. I'd be out in the garden, and… it just seemed appealing. Like a craving, I suppose. Not like wanting a sweet, more like… needing something. Now, it's almost every day. I find myself specifically looking for good dirt. Red clay is the best, if you must know. And it doesn't help with the tiredness, obviously. I just… do it. It's stupid.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound stupid at all, Ms. Hardenburgh. It sounds like a very unusual craving, and it's good that you're addressing it. You mentioned it started years ago and has increased in frequency recently. About how much clay would you say you consume on a typical day now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... It's not like I'm eating shovelfuls, doctor. Though sometimes I feel like it. Maybe… a handful? Two? It depends. If I’m really stressed, or just feeling weak, then more. It's hard to say precisely. I don’t measure it! Honestly, do you have to be so specific?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh, and I apologize if my questions seem overly detailed. It’s simply important for me to get a clear understanding of the situation. A “handful” or two provides a helpful starting point. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and clay consumption?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, I’m always tired, obviously. And a little… achy, I guess. My stomach isn't always right, but that could be anything. I'm an old woman, doctor, things are bound to be a little off now and then. I haven’t really… connected it to the dirt, if that makes sense. Just assumed it was my age. What else would I be looking for?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable, Ms. Hardenburgh. It’s good you’ve been considering potential causes. Let’s explore some of those potential connections systematically. I’m going to ask a few questions about different parts of your body. Could you tell me if you’ve noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat when I need to eat. It’s not like I’m losing weight, if that's what you’re getting at. Though I haven’t been gaining any either. Just… normal. I don’t fuss much over food, never have. I eat what’s available and hope for the best. Is that a satisfactory answer?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly satisfactory, Ms. Hardenburgh. It sounds as though your weight has remained relatively stable. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea recently?
PATIENT: No, no vomiting. Heavens, no. Nausea… sometimes. A little queasy, especially after… well, you know. After the dirt. But it passes quickly. Diarrhea… not usually. Maybe a little loose stool now and then, but nothing dramatic. I’m not spending my days in the bathroom, if that’s what you're worried about. This is taking a long time, doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration with the length of the questions, Ms. Hardenburgh, and I appreciate your patience. The information you’re providing is very helpful. You mentioned feeling queasy after consuming the clay, which is significant. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements aside from the occasional looseness?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? It’s… waste, doctor. What do you expect? It’s not like I’m documenting it in a ledger! Look, I’m an old woman. Things happen. Sometimes it’s harder, sometimes it’s softer. Sometimes it’s just… normal. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh. I'm trying to gather as much information as possible to understand what’s going on. Changes in bowel habits can sometimes point to underlying issues, and it's important for me to rule those out. Let’s try a different approach. Do you experience any abdominal pain or cramping?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain… sometimes. A dull ache, really. Lower part of my stomach. It comes and goes. Not sharp, not terrible. Just… annoying. I usually just ignore it. It’s probably just gas. Or old age, like everything else. Honestly, doctor, I don’t think this dirt-eating is causing all this fuss. I think you’re making something out of nothing.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Hardenburgh. It's possible it’s unrelated, but we need to explore all possibilities. Now, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. High blood pressure, I think? Years ago. They put me on a pill for a while, but I stopped taking it. Didn’t like the way it made me feel. And arthritis, of course. What old woman doesn’t have arthritis? Just the usual aches and pains. Nothing serious. Nothing that requires constant attention, if that's what you're asking.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Were you ever prescribed any medications for these conditions, besides the blood pressure medication you mentioned?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pill. And… some cream for the arthritis sometimes. Nothing regular. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. They always make me feel worse. I prefer to just… deal with it. That's what people used to do, you know. Now everyone wants a pill for everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference, Ms. Hardenburgh. And now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Not that I know of. Maybe a little sniffle when the pollen is bad in the spring, but that's it. I’ve eaten all sorts of things in my life, and I’m still here, aren't I? I don’t fuss about with allergies.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… my mother had… something. I can’t remember exactly. Heart trouble, maybe? And my brother had diabetes, I think. But he didn’t take care of himself. Always eating sweets. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to family history. People get sick, people die. It's the way of things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hardenburgh. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What does that even mean? I live… I live quietly. I have a small garden, I watch some television. I don't go out much anymore. It's not safe these days. I mostly keep to myself. It’s… a simple life. Not much excitement. Definitely not enough excitement to cause me to eat dirt. Honestly, I don't see what all these questions are for.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Hardenburgh. I apologize if the questions feel intrusive. I'm asking these questions to get a complete picture of your health. Based on what you've told me, I'm concerned about a condition called Pica. This is the compulsion to eat non-nutritive substances, like clay, and can sometimes indicate a nutritional deficiency, such as iron deficiency. The tiredness and abdominal discomfort could be related. To rule this out, I would like to order some blood tests to check your iron levels, complete blood count, and electrolyte levels. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Ugh. Honestly, doctor, this is what I was afraid of. More poking and prodding. Look, I’m an old woman. I’m tired. I eat a little dirt. It’s not going to kill me. I’ve lived a long life, and frankly, I don't need a bunch of tests to tell me what I already know.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Hardenburgh, and I respect your wishes. However, even if you feel well, identifying the cause of the clay consumption is important. It could also be a sign of other underlying health issues we wouldn't want to miss. If we don’t investigate, we could miss an easily treatable condition. Would you at least consider a basic iron level test?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Just an iron test. But that’s it. No full panels, no poking and prodding all over. Just the iron. And can we get it over with quickly? I have things to do, you know. And if it’s normal, you’re dropping the whole thing. Deal?
DOCTOR: That is a deal, Ms. Hardenburgh. Just the iron level test. I'll write the order now, and the nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. It shouldn't take long. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, I recommend avoiding consuming any clay for the time being, as it may be contributing to your discomfort. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just get it over with. And I hope these results are quick. I really don’t have the energy for all this fuss.
