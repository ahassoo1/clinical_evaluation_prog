DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Rakosky, you say? Nice name. Well, it's this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right at the back of me head, you see? Been botherin’ me for a bit now. Not constant, comes and goes, but when it does come... ooh, it's a proper nuisance.
DOCTOR: I see. A headache at the back of your head that comes and goes. That is bothersome. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like a throbbing headache, not usually. More of a… a dull ache, spread out. Sometimes it feels tight, like someone’s put a band around me head. And it definitely gets worse when I'm bendin’ over, like when I'm doin’ a pedicure. Makes it hard to concentrate, y’know? I gotta really focus to get the polish just right for me customers. It doesn’t make me see stars or nothin’, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache, sometimes tight, worse with bending over, and doesn’t cause visual disturbances. And this is interfering with your work, focusing on your pedicures. How long has this been going on for, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, oh, maybe three, four months ago now? At first, it wasn’t too bad, just every now and then. I thought it was just from bein’ on me feet all day. But it’s been happenin’ more often lately. And last week, it was bad enough I had to send one of me regulars home early. Felt terrible about that, she was lookin’ forward to it.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it’s been gradually worsening over the past three to four months. And it's now affecting your ability to work consistently. Do you notice anything else that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Well now, that’s a good question. Let me see… restin’ helps, definitely. If I sit down with me eyes closed for a bit, it eases up. And… funny you should ask, but a warm shower seems to take the edge off too. Cold makes it worse, though. Especially the back of me neck. Gets stiff and achey even quicker. I don't think I've noticed anything specific with food or drink, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, rest and a warm shower provide some relief, while cold temperatures exacerbate it. No connection to food or drink. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, just to get a better overall picture. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... Well, I’ve been a little more tired than usual, I suppose. But at me age, who isn’t? It’s hard to say if that's related or just… gettin’ older. No fever, no blurry vision, no dizziness… nothin’ like that. I haven’t been sick recently, if that’s what you’re askin’. No numbness or weakness either. Just the headache and a bit of fatigue. I've been sleepin' alright though, surprisingly.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fatigue, but no fever, vision changes, dizziness, recent illness, or numbness/weakness. And you’ve been sleeping reasonably well. Now, have you had headaches like this before, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get the occasional tension headache, you know, from stressin’ over a busy day or somethin’. But this is different. This is… more persistent, and it's always in the same spot. And the way bendin’ over makes it worse is new. I’ve never had a headache that flares up with physical activity before, not like this. This feels… different, like somethin's actually wrong.
DOCTOR: You're right to point that out – the change in character and the association with activity are important. Let’s move on to some medical history questions, if you don’t mind. Do you have any medical conditions that you are currently being treated for, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ like that, Doctor. I’ve been lucky, always been pretty healthy. I used to worry about me blood pressure, but the doctor checked it a few years back and said it was fine. No diabetes, no heart problems… just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old, really. I don’t take any regular medications either, just a pain reliever now and then for me arthritis when it flares up. And I don’t have any allergies, not that I know of.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No chronic medical conditions, no medications, and no allergies. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh, years ago, when I was a young man, I broke me arm playin’ cricket. Had to have it set, but that was a long time ago, and healed up fine. And me wife, bless her heart, had her gallbladder removed a few years back. But other than that, no, nothin’ significant. Never been in the hospital for anything serious, thankfully. I’ve always tried to stay active and take care of meself. I believe that's why I'm still kickin’ at me age.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. Just the broken arm years ago and your wife's gallbladder removal. Now, let's talk about family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, children – have a history of frequent or severe headaches, or any neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a tough one. Me mother, she used to get migraines, bad ones, but she passed away years ago. And me sister, she had high blood pressure, but I don’t recall her ever complainin’ about headaches. Me father, he was a strong, quiet man, never said much about his health. And me children... they're all healthy as far as I know, no major problems. I don’t think anyone in me family had headaches like this, though. Just the usual stuff, you know, tension headaches, nothin’ serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. History of migraines in your mother, high blood pressure in your sister, but no one with similar headaches. Finally, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and definitely no. Never touched a cigarette in me life. Me wife and I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner now and then, but we stopped a few years back, just tryin’ to be healthier. And I certainly don’t go near any of those recreational drugs. Never saw the appeal, and never wanted to start. I like me peace and quiet, and takin’ care of me customers. That's enough excitement for me, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: That's very good to know. No smoking, no alcohol, and no recreational drug use. Alright, Mr. Popova. Thank you for answering all of those questions. That gives me a good understanding of your medical history and lifestyle. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination to get a better idea of what might be causing your headaches. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. I’m happy to do whatever it takes to figure out what's goin’ on with me head. Just let me know if there’s anythin’ I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated, but not terribly concerning given your age and potential anxiety about the headache. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Your heart sounds are normal, no murmurs or irregularities. Your lungs are clear, with good breath sounds bilaterally. I’m feeling some mild tenderness in the muscles at the base of your skull, and a little bit of stiffness. Your reflexes are normal, and your strength and sensation are intact. I notice some limited range of motion in your neck, with discomfort when you look to the side and slightly downward. Your pupils are equal and reactive to light. Based on the examination, I’m finding some tenderness and stiffness in your neck muscles, limited range of motion, and a slightly elevated blood pressure. Your neurological function is normal, which is reassuring. It's possible this is a tension headache, exacerbated by the stress of your work and possibly some muscle strain in your neck. However, given your age, it's important to rule out other possibilities. The fact that bending over makes it worse is concerning, and the limited range of motion in your neck is also significant. I'd like to order some blood work to check for inflammation and other potential causes. And I'd also like to recommend a CT scan of your head to rule out any structural problems. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Well, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. A bit worryin’ to hear about structural problems, to be honest, but I suppose it’s best to be safe than sorry. If you think it’s necessary, then yes, I'm comfortable with the blood work and the CT scan. Whatever you recommend. I trust your judgement. Just… let me know what to expect, alright? I don’t like bein’ kept in the dark. And how long will I have to wait for the results? It’s a little hard to get time off from the salon, you know. I got regular customers dependin’ on me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Popova. It’s good that you’re asking questions, and I want to assure you that we’re doing this to be thorough and get a clear understanding of what's going on. It’s far more likely this is a musculoskeletal issue, but it's important to rule out anything more serious. The CT scan will take about 20-30 minutes. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. It’s painless, but you need to remain very still. The radiologist will then review the images and send the results to me. The blood work will only take a few minutes. We’ll draw a small sample of blood from your arm. The results usually come back within a couple of days. I’ll call you as soon as I have the results, and we can discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I’d recommend taking an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or naproxen for the headache, and applying a warm compress to your neck. Try to avoid activities that aggravate the pain, and if possible, take some time to rest and relax. While we're waiting for the results, I'm also going to prescribe a muscle relaxant to help ease the tension in your neck. I'll also give you a referral to a physical therapist, who can teach you exercises to strengthen your neck muscles and improve your posture. Do you have any questions about the medication or the physical therapy?
PATIENT: Muscle relaxant and physical therapy… alright, that sounds good. I’ve always been a bit stooped over, bendin’ over people’s feet all day. Makes sense to strengthen me neck, I suppose. I don't think I've ever taken a muscle relaxant before. What kind of side effects should I be lookin' out for? And how long will it take to start workin'? I got customers comin' in tomorrow, wouldn't want to be fallin' asleep in their lap! And what about the physical therapy? How often do I need to go? And what does it cost? I'm not insured, you see, so I gotta be careful with me money. I appreciate you explainin' everything so clearly, Doctor. It makes me feel a little better, knowin' what to expect.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about the side effects and costs, Mr. Popova. It’s important to be informed. I’m prescribing cyclobenzaprine, a common muscle relaxant. The most common side effects are drowsiness, dizziness, and dry mouth. It can also cause constipation and blurred vision in some people. It is very important not to drive or operate heavy machinery while taking this medication, especially when you first start. That's why I advise against work tomorrow, if possible. If you experience any severe side effects, like difficulty breathing or an irregular heartbeat, stop taking the medication immediately and contact me. It typically starts working within 30-60 minutes, but it may take a few days to reach its full effect. As for the physical therapy, I’m referring you to a clinic nearby that offers affordable rates for uninsured patients. A typical course of treatment involves 6-8 sessions, spaced once or twice a week. The cost per session is around $75-$100, depending on the specific exercises and techniques used. They may also offer a sliding scale based on your income. I can give you a list of clinics and their contact information. It’s best to call them directly to inquire about their rates and availability. I'll also write down a list of instructions regarding the medication, including the dosage, potential side effects, and when to contact me. It’s important to follow these instructions carefully. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time, Mr. Popova?
PATIENT: $75-$100 a session… that’s a bit steep, but I suppose it’s worth a try if it helps me neck. I’ll call them and see what they say. Thank you for writin’ all that down, Doctor. Helps me remember things, these days. I think that’s all for now. I just… I hope it’s nothin’ serious. I got customers dependin’ on me, and I enjoy me work. I wouldn't want to have to stop. But I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to me, and explainin’ everything so clearly. You're a good doctor. Should I schedule a follow-up appointment now, or wait until I get the results back?
DOCTOR: You’re very kind, Mr. Popova. I understand your concerns about your work and your customers, and I assure you, we’ll do everything we can to get you back on your feet as quickly as possible. Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today, to discuss the results of the blood work and CT scan. That will give us time to review everything and develop a treatment plan that’s right for you. How does next Thursday at 10:00 AM sound?
PATIENT: Next Thursday at 10:00 AM sounds perfect, Doctor. Thank you. Alright, I think that's everything. I'll try to rest up this week, and call those physical therapy places. And I'll hold off on workin’ tomorrow, just to be safe. Thank you again for everything, Doctor Rakosky. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Popova. Take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
