DOCTOR: Hi Courtnye, it’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um, well, it's about my bruising. It’s been getting worse, even though I’m already on blood thinners, which...doesn't make sense, right? It just seems to be happening a lot easier now.
DOCTOR: You’re right to question that – it doesn’t make sense for bruising to worsen while on blood thinners. Okay, let’s talk about this bruising. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It started, I guess, maybe a month ago? Little bumps, like from just knocking my arm on something, but they turn purple and stay for ages. Now even just…sitting on the couch feels like it’s leaving a mark. And it’s not just my arms, it’s my legs too. It’s just…a lot more than usual. I don’t remember hitting myself or anything. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Courtnye. That’s a really important detail – bruising happening with minimal trauma, and in more places than usual. A month ago is good to know as a starting point. Let's try to get a clearer picture. When you say "ages", about how long do these bruises typically last?
PATIENT: Ugh, normally? A few days, maybe a week. These ones…it feels like two weeks at least, sometimes longer. And they’re…darker. Not just a little purple, like really deep, almost black sometimes. And they hurt. Not like a bad pain, but a constant ache. It's annoying, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, lasting two weeks or longer, darker discoloration, and with an ache…that’s definitely concerning, especially with the blood thinners. Just to be thorough, are you noticing any bruising in unusual places, like your trunk or face?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s mostly my arms and legs, like I said. Maybe a little bit on my shoulders, but that could just be from carrying things. Definitely not my face or chest or anything like that. And no, there's no swelling or anything else going on with it, just the bruising and the ache. It's just… worrying me, you know? I don't want to end up in the hospital.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Courtnye, and it’s good you’re getting this checked out. It's right to be cautious. Let's go over some other things. Have you had any changes in your medications recently, even over-the-counter things like ibuprofen or aspirin?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. I’ve been on the same blood thinner for…oh, gosh, maybe five years now? And I don't take anything else regularly. Sometimes I'll take Tylenol for a headache, but that’s it. I’ve definitely not started anything new. I try to avoid taking anything if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And have you had any recent illnesses – a cold, the flu, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… actually, yeah. I had a pretty bad cold about a month ago. It knocked me out for a week or so. Just a regular cold, though, you know? Runny nose, sore throat, the usual. I didn’t go to the doctor for it, just rested and drank a lot of fluids. Is that… could that be related? I didn’t think much of it at the time.
DOCTOR: That could be related, Courtnye. Sometimes viral illnesses can temporarily affect blood counts. Let's talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. Just high blood pressure, which is why I'm on the blood thinner. And… oh, I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago. That’s it, I think. Nothing major. I’m pretty healthy otherwise, honestly. I try to eat well and get some exercise when I can. I’m not one for sitting around, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and gallbladder removal – that’s helpful. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my mom had high blood pressure too. And my grandma… she had some problems with bleeding, but I don’t really know the details. She lived back in Tonga, so it was hard to get information. It wasn’t anything serious, as far as I know. Just… she bruised easily. I guess it runs in the family. Look, is this getting me nowhere? I really just want to know why this is happening.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of easy bruising is good to know. It doesn't necessarily explain everything, but it’s a piece of the puzzle. I want to do a quick physical exam to check things out. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay, sure. Whatever you need to do. I just… I don’t want this to be something serious. I have things to do, you know? I just want to get to the bottom of it and get back to normal. Please, let's hurry, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Courtnye. I understand. Alright, let's take a look. I’m going to gently examine your arms and legs, and check for any other areas of bruising. I’ll also listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Just relax as much as you can. Okay, I'm seeing quite a bit of bruising on your arms, and some smaller spots on your legs. Your heart and lungs sound good, and your abdomen feels normal. The bruising does seem widespread. I'm going to need to order some blood work to get a better idea of what's going on. It's going to be a complete blood count, and a coagulation panel to check how well your blood is clotting. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Blood work… okay, fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have appointments and things. But yes, okay, do the blood work. What are you looking for exactly? And is this going to be expensive? I don't have insurance, you know. I really just want to know what’s wrong and how to fix it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about cost and time, Courtnye. We'll try to keep things as efficient as possible. The blood work will help us check your platelet count, which is important for clotting, and see how your blood is functioning overall. It will also tell us if your blood thinner is at the right level. It’s possible your levels need adjusting, or there could be another reason for the bruising. Regarding cost, I'll ask the lab to give you the most affordable options. We can also explore assistance programs if needed. It's hard to give you an exact price upfront, but I'll make sure to discuss the costs with you before proceeding. We'll figure this out. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that could cause injury, and let me know immediately if the bruising gets significantly worse or you develop any new symptoms, like bleeding from your gums or nose. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… get the blood work done. And please, hurry. I really just want to get this sorted. Okay. I guess I’ll go wait for the lab tech then?
DOCTOR: Okay, Courtnye. I'll get the order sent to the lab right away. They'll be expecting you. Please let the lab technician know you're here for Dr. Rosanova’s order. I'll review the results as soon as they come in, and we'll discuss them as soon as possible. Don't hesitate to come back if you have any concerns before then.
