DOCTOR: Right. Darl Nini, 79 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Osga, is it? Yes, that’s right. Well, it’s a bit silly, really. My daughter, she’s always fussing… says I should just know my blood type. Something about… emergencies? I don't rightly remember ever having it checked. Just thought I'd best get it done, you know? For peace of mind.
DOCTOR: Blood type. Yes, alright. It is good to know, I suppose. Though, honestly, at your age, it's not usually a pressing concern unless you're undergoing surgery. Still. We can certainly do it. It's a quick draw. Anything else bothering you while you're here?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no surgery planned! Thank goodness. Just… things are a bit foggy these days, you see? I forget a lot. I mostly just wanted to get this blood type thing sorted. Is it… painful? I don't like needles much.
DOCTOR: Foggy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, terribly so. Not all the time, but… names, dates, what I had for breakfast… it all slips away. It's frustrating, believe me. And no, I don't think it's painful, Doctor. Just a little pinch, really. I've heard. Though my memory... well, you understand. Is it a long pinch?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, the blood draw itself is quite quick. A few seconds, really. However, if your memory is as unreliable as you say, we'll need to rule out other things. Have you noticed any changes in your thinking, besides just forgetfulness?
PATIENT: Changes…? Hmm. That's a good question. Let me think… I suppose I get a bit confused sometimes. Like, I might walk into a room and not remember why I went in there. Or… repeat myself. Does that count? My daughter says I tell the same stories over and over. But, honestly, I've always been a bit scattered. It's hard to say what's new and what isn't. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Scattered. Yes, alright. And has anyone mentioned anything about… difficulty with language?
PATIENT: Language? Oh… no, not really. I can still speak, can’t I? I mean, I'm talking to you perfectly well, aren't I? Sometimes the right words don’t come as quickly, maybe. But I’ve never had anyone say I wasn’t making sense. Unless I’m telling one of my stories, perhaps! They might get tired of hearing them. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: No, not exactly. Look, this forgetfulness… is it interfering with your daily life?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a tricky question. It depends on the day, I suppose. Some days I’m perfectly fine. I can still manage my little garden, and I cook for myself. Other days… I might forget to turn off the stove, or I can’t remember if I locked the door. My daughter… she worries a lot. She's the one who pointed out the stove thing. I mostly just try to keep busy, you know? It's better than dwelling on it. But, yes, sometimes it gets in the way. Mostly small things, though. Nothing… terrible.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll start with the blood work, as requested. Then, I’d like to do a brief cognitive assessment. It’s just a few simple questions, to get a better idea of what's going on. And no, it's not a test to fail. It's just… information gathering. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, questions. Yes, alright. As long as they aren’t too difficult! I don’t like feeling… put on the spot. A cognitive… what was it? Assessment. Yes. Information gathering. Sounds sensible enough. Just… try not to make me feel like a silly old woman, please. Is that alright, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Nini. No silliness involved. Let's just start with the basics. What is today's date?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. The date… Now, let me think. It's… August, isn't it? Yes, definitely August. But the number… Oh dear. Is it the second? No… wait. My daughter said something about… the fifth? No, that doesn't sound right either. I am terrible with dates, you see. August… the… second? Is that it? I’m really not sure. I apologize.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s… noted. Let’s try something else. Can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Oh! That one's easy! This is… well, it's a big city! Lots of buildings… I believe it's… Urbanville? No… that doesn't sound right. Is it… New Town? It's a very busy city, isn't it? I haven't lived here long, you see. It’s all a bit of a blur, really. Perhaps you could remind me? I feel rather foolish.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Nini, we are in Urbanville. You've been a patient here for three years. Look, I understand your memory isn’t what it once was. But this is more than just simple forgetfulness. I’m concerned about possible early signs of dementia. We need to run some tests, including an MRI and a referral to a neurologist. Do you understand the gravity of this?
PATIENT: Oh. Dementia…? Oh dear. That’s… that's my mother. She… she didn’t recognize me at the end. MRI? Tests? Oh, goodness. Is it… is it bad? I just wanted to know my blood type… I didn't want any trouble. A neurologist…? What will they do? I’m frightened, Doctor. Frightened.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Nini, let's not jump to conclusions. An MRI will simply give us a clearer picture of what's happening in your brain. The neurologist is a specialist; they'll do a thorough evaluation and help us determine the best course of action. It doesn't necessarily mean it is dementia. We need to rule out other possibilities first. I’ll order the blood work, schedule the MRI, and write you a referral to Dr. Ramirez. Her office will contact you to set up an appointment. Now, about this blood type… just to clarify, no known allergies to latex or anything?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies? No, I don’t think so. Not that I recall. My daughter always handles the medical things. I just… show up. Is the test very uncomfortable, Doctor? Because I really do dislike needles… and the thought of all these… evaluations… it’s all a bit much, isn’t it? I just wanted to know my blood type. I just… wanted to know.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Nini, I understand you're upset. And yes, the blood draw will be quick. A small pinch, as you said. Look, I'm going to have my nurse, Emily, come in and draw the blood, and explain everything to you step-by-step. I'm also going to give you some information about local support groups for memory concerns. Perhaps talking to others in a similar situation would be helpful. I’m writing the orders now. Emily will be with you shortly. Just try to relax.
PATIENT: .
