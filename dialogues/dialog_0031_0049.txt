DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor… Rakosky, is it? Yes, well, it’s me ears, I think. They ain’t what they used to be, that’s for sure. Everything’s a bit… muffled, like talkin’ underwater, y’know? Not terrible, but… hard to hear folks sometimes. Especially the young ones! They mumble so.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Difficulty hearing is a common concern, Mr. Schneer. “Muffled” is a good way to describe it. And you’re right, it can be particularly challenging with softer voices or faster speech. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me when you first noticed this change in your hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I notice it? That's a tricky one. Seems like… a long while now. Maybe a couple o’ years? Hard to say, really. Things just… faded, bit by bit. I used to be able to hear the birds clear as a bell, but now… not so much. I don't rightly remember when it started bein’ harder, just that it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, “bit by bit over a couple of years” is helpful. And it’s not unusual to not pinpoint an exact moment. Has this hearing difficulty been getting progressively worse, or has it stayed relatively stable for the last year or so?
PATIENT: Oh, I think it’s been gettin’ worse, yeah. Not a lot at once, but… slow and steady, like. Last year I could still hear the television okay, but now I have to turn it up pretty loud, and even then I miss bits and pieces. My neighbor, Mrs. Gable, she says I shout when I talk on the phone now. I don't mean to, honest!
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s a good observation about needing to increase the volume on the television and your neighbor mentioning you might be speaking louder. It sounds like it’s definitely progressing. Now, besides the muffled hearing and difficulty with volume, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes… sometimes I get a ringin’ in me ears. Not all the time, just now and then. It’s a high-pitched sort of whine, like… like a tea kettle almost boilin’. And… oh, I don’t know if this counts, but I feel a bit dizzy sometimes. Not fallin’ over dizzy, just… off balance, a little. That might be somethin’ else, though. I’m an old man, things are bound to go a bit wonky, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all very helpful information, Mr. Schneer. The ringing in your ears – we call that tinnitus – and the occasional dizziness are important to note. It’s good you’re mentioning everything, even if you’re unsure if it’s related. To clarify the dizziness, does it happen when you change positions quickly – like standing up or lying down?
PATIENT: Oh, now that you mention it… yes, I think it does. Standin’ up too fast, mostly. I gotta hold onto the furniture sometimes, just to steady myself. Not every time, mind you, but… more often than it used to. It’s a quick thing, though. Just a little bit of the room spinnin’ for a second, then it’s gone. I always figured it was just me gettin’ old and slow!
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. Dizziness with quick changes in position is important to note. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that you are aware of – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, now… let me see. The doctor told me a few years back I had a touch of high blood pressure, but he put me on a little pill for it, and I’ve been takin’ it ever since. Seems to be keepin’ it under control, I guess. Aside from that… I don’t think so. I had a bad knee when I was younger, workin’ in the shoe factory, but that’s been fixed with a replacement. Other than that, I’ve been pretty lucky, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and a previous knee replacement. Have you had any surgeries other than the knee replacement?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don’t believe so. The knee was the only one. I had all me teeth pulled when I was younger, but that weren’t a surgery, really. Just… took ‘em all out. And I’ve had a few stitches here and there over the years – scraped knees, cuts from the factory machinery – but nothin’ major, nothin’ that needed a hospital stay.
DOCTOR: Alright, no major surgeries other than the knee replacement. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any hearing loss, tinnitus, or dizziness issues that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Now that’s a tough one. Me mother, she was a bit hard o’ hearin’ when she got older, but I figured that was just old age. Me father, he had a good pair o’ ears right up ‘til the end. And me brother… well, he wasn’t much for talkin’ anyway, so I never really noticed! I don’t rightly remember anyone else havin’ trouble with their ears, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No strong family history of hearing issues that you’re aware of. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked a day in me life. Always thought it was a silly habit. Me father tried it once, said it made him dizzy, and that was the end of that. I worked in the shoe factory for forty years, and there was plenty o’ folks smokin’ in there, but I always kept me distance.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, I enjoy a wee dram now and then. A glass of whiskey with me supper, maybe a couple on the weekends. Nothin’ excessive, mind you. Just a little somethin’ to warm the belly. I’m not a big drinker, never have been.
DOCTOR: Alright, moderate alcohol consumption. Now, let's talk about any medications you're currently taking, besides the medication for your blood pressure. Do you take any vitamins, supplements, or over-the-counter medications regularly?
PATIENT: Just the pill for me blood pressure, like I said. And I take a little somethin’ for me arthritis, mostly when it’s cold and damp. It’s just… an over-the-counter thing, you can get it at the drugstore. Helps with the achin’ in me joints. Can't remember the name of it right off hand, but it’s the orange bottle.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for blood pressure and an over-the-counter arthritis medication. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat just about anything put in front of me. Me mother always said I had a cast iron stomach.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That gives me a good overview of your medical history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical examination, if that’s alright with you. I'll check your ears, nose, throat, and do a brief neurological assessment to check your balance. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m used to doctors pokin’ and proddin’. Forty years in the shoe factory, you get used to aches and pains and folks lookin’ at you!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. Let's start with your ears. I'm just going to take a quick look inside to see if there’s any wax buildup or any signs of infection. This might feel a little cool. Okay, your ear canals are clear. I do see some cerumen – that’s earwax – but nothing significant. Your eardrums appear intact, but slightly… dull. That could be related to fluid in the middle ear. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Finally, I'm going to check your balance. Could you please stand up and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Alright, sounds good. A bit chilly, but nothin’ bad. Okay, eyes closed… Feels a bit funny standin’ like this. Always been a bit wobbly, to be honest. Me brother used to say I had two left feet! Just tryin’ to keep me balance here…
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schneer, you are exhibiting some mild unsteadiness. It’s not severe, but it’s worth noting. Please open your eyes now. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary examination, it seems likely you’re experiencing hearing loss, potentially related to fluid in the middle ear. The tinnitus and dizziness could be connected, or they could be separate issues. The mild unsteadiness could be age-related, but it’s good we’ve documented it. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order an audiogram – that’s a hearing test – and possibly a tympanogram, which measures the movement of your eardrum. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Hearing test, you say? Sounds sensible. Better to know what's goin' on, right? Yes, go ahead and order whatever tests you think are best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I just wanna be able to hear me television again, and not feel like I'm gonna fall over every time I stand up!
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll get the orders sent to the audiology department. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. It’s usually a quick and painless procedure. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a nasal saline spray to help clear any congestion in your nasal passages, which can sometimes affect your ears. I’ll also recommend avoiding loud noises as much as possible. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Nasal spray, alright. Sounds easy enough. Avoid loud noises… well, that’s not gonna be easy livin’ in the city! Um… let me think. Will the spray help me hear better right away? And… what if the hearing test shows somethin’ bad? Will I need… surgery? I don’t fancy bein’ cut open, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Those are both excellent questions, Mr. Schneer. The nasal spray won’t restore your hearing immediately, but it can help relieve any pressure in your ears and improve drainage, which may provide some temporary relief. It's more about optimizing the conditions in your ear. As for the hearing test, it’s impossible to say what it will show definitively. It could reveal a simple blockage, fluid buildup, or, in some cases, a more permanent hearing loss. If it’s a more significant issue, we'll discuss all your options, which could include surgery, but that's certainly not the first step. We would explore other solutions first – like hearing aids, for example. We’ll take things one step at a time, and I'll explain everything thoroughly. Do you have any other concerns or questions before we wrap up?
PATIENT: Hearing aids… hmm. I’ve seen folks wearin’ them. Don’t look very comfortable. But… I suppose if it helps me hear, I’d give ‘em a try. No, I think that’s all for now, Doctor. You’ve answered all me questions, and put me mind at ease a bit. Thank you for takin’ the time to listen to an old man ramble.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It’s my pleasure. Remember, we'll get the results of the hearing test and discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden worsening of your hearing, dizziness, or any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Here’s a copy of the prescription for the nasal spray, and a summary of our discussion today. Thank you for coming in, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Well, thank you kindly, Doctor. I appreciate that. I’ll see you when I hear from the audiologist. Have a good day now.
