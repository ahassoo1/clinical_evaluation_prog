DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburroough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. Well, I want to know… about my family. Long time ago, you know? I hear you can… find things out with a little bit of spit? About where people come from?
DOCTOR: I understand. You’ve heard about genetic ancestry testing, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right! Genetic… that sounds right. My niece, she told me. She said it can tell you… who your people were. I want to know more about that. I’m Marshallese, but… before that? It’s a long story, maybe. I just want to know where I really come from.
DOCTOR: It's a very interesting question, Mr. Scobie, and genetic ancestry testing can sometimes give us clues. However, it's important to understand what it can and can't do. It looks at your DNA and compares it to reference populations. It can give you percentages related to different regions, but it’s not always a complete picture, and doesn’t tell the whole story of your family history. It's also important to remember that populations have moved and mixed over time. Before we go further, can you tell me a little more about why you're interested in this now?
PATIENT: Hmm… okay. That’s a lot. Percentages… I guess that’s okay. It’s just… I’m getting old, Doctor. Old man now. And I want my grandkids to know. They ask about their great-grandpa, and I tell them stories, but… it’s just stories. I want something… real. Something they can see. You know? I don’t want the stories to be lost when I’m gone. It’s important for them to know who they are.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Scobie. That’s a very important reason to want this information - preserving your family history for future generations. It’s wonderful that you’re thinking about that. Before we discuss the testing options, I'd like to get a better understanding of your medical history, just as a standard precaution. It doesn’t directly relate to the ancestry test, but it's important for overall care. Do you have any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. I have the usual old-man stuff. Knees ache a bit, especially when it rains. And my back… sometimes it's grumpy. I see Dr. Miller for that. He gives me pills. And I have Medicare, so that helps. Nothing serious, though. I eat good fish, mostly. And I walk a little bit. Not much running these days!
DOCTOR: Okay, I see your Medicare information and a note about Dr. Miller treating your back. Good to hear you're staying active. Are you currently taking any medications, besides what Dr. Miller prescribes for your back?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Dr. Miller gives me… Naproxen, I think it’s called. For the back. And sometimes, when the knees are really bad, I take something… Tylenol, maybe? Just when I need it. I don’t take them every day, though. Just when they bother me. And a little bit of fish oil. My niece says it’s good for the brain. Old man brain needs help!
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen as needed for back pain, Tylenol as needed for knee pain, and fish oil supplement. No known allergies?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had any trouble with medicine or food. I eat everything. I used to go fishing all the time, you know? Catch a big tuna, and eat it right there on the boat! Good fish. Always good.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies. Now, let’s talk about this ancestry test. There are several companies that offer these tests, usually involving a saliva sample. They send you a kit, you spit in a tube, and mail it back to them. The results typically take a few weeks to come back. It's important to be aware that these tests aren't perfect, and the results can sometimes be ambiguous. They can also raise complex questions about identity and family history. Would you like me to go over some of the different companies, and their pros and cons?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds good. Pros and cons… that’s smart. I don’t want to just give them my spit and get… nothing. Or something I don’t understand. Which ones are good for… people like me? Marshallese people? Do they know about that part of the world? My niece, she used one… 23andMe, I think it was. Is that a good one?
DOCTOR: 23andMe is a popular choice, and they have a fairly large database. However, their reference populations are more heavily weighted towards European ancestry. That doesn’t mean they won’t be helpful, but the results for populations like Marshallese may be less precise. Another company, AncestryDNA, also has a large database, and may offer slightly better coverage for Pacific Islander populations, but still primarily focuses on European and Asian ancestries. There's a newer company, Living DNA, which claims to have better coverage for specific regions, including Oceania, but it’s generally more expensive. It’s important to note that none of these companies specifically focus on Marshallese ancestry. The results will likely give you a percentage breakdown based on broader regional populations. Would you like me to print out some information on these companies for you to review?
PATIENT: Hmm… complicated. Not much for Marshallese, you say? That’s… not so good. Maybe it’s not worth it then. I just want to know… where my people came from. Not just percentages. But if that’s all I can get… I guess. Printing the information sounds good. I can look at it with my niece. She’s good with computers. She can explain it better. What does it cost, anyway? Just so I know.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here's some information on 23andMe, AncestryDNA, and Living DNA. Each company has different pricing tiers, depending on the level of detail you're looking for. 23andMe and AncestryDNA generally cost around $100-$200, while Living DNA is typically more expensive, around $250-$300. These prices can fluctuate, so it’s always best to check their websites for the most up-to-date information. I want to reiterate that these tests aren't definitive. They can be a good starting point for exploring your family history, but they shouldn't be considered a complete answer. Is there anything else I can help you with today, Mr. Scobie?
PATIENT: Okay, $200… that’s… a lot of fish. But maybe it’s worth it for the grandkids. I’ll talk to my niece. She can help me decide. No, I think that’s all for today, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. You didn’t laugh when I said I just wanted to know where my people came from. That’s good. Thank you very much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Scobie. It’s a perfectly valid question, and I’m happy I could help. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions after you’ve had a chance to discuss it with your niece. Have a lovely day, and please give my best to your grandkids. .
