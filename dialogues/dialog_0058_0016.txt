DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, it's about my bruising. It's… excessive. I'm on that blood thinner, you know, Warfarin, and I seem to be getting black and blue spots from… well, nothing much at all. It’s quite bothersome, really. And frankly, I expect better these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see you’re on Warfarin. Excessive bruising is a common side effect, unfortunately. But we need to figure out how excessive. Can you tell me a little more?
PATIENT: A little more? What do you mean, "a little more"? It's quite obvious, isn't it? I bump into a chair – a chair – and I look like I've been in a fight. It's not normal. And it's getting worse, I think. Last week, just shaving! Shaving, Doctor! A tiny nick and suddenly my face was spotted. It’s… undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. I understand your frustration. “Getting worse” is helpful. So, it’s progressed even with careful activity?
PATIENT: Careful activity? Of course it’s with careful activity! Do you think I'm deliberately throwing myself down the stairs? I take reasonable precautions. I’m not a fool. It’s just… happening more and more frequently, even when I'm being perfectly sensible. And the bruises are larger, darker… and they stick around longer. It’s… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes? Let me think. Well, I have been feeling a bit… tired lately. More tired than usual, perhaps. But honestly, at my age, who doesn't feel tired? It could be anything. Though I suppose it's worth mentioning. I haven’t been bleeding excessively from cuts, just bruising, mind you.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any bleeding from your gums when you brush, or any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Nothing like that. I'm not falling apart here, Doctor. Just the bruising. And the tiredness, which, as I said, could be anything. I do keep myself very busy, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Can you roll up your sleeves and pant legs so I can look at the bruising?
PATIENT: Roll up my sleeves? Very well. Though I can assure you, it won’t be a pretty sight. Honestly, I should have been a lawyer. Less… physical discomfort.
DOCTOR: Okay. The bruising is quite extensive, as you described. And it appears to be in multiple locations, at varying stages of healing. I'm not seeing any obvious signs of injury. I'll also listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Just a standard check.
PATIENT: Hmph. Standard check. As if I haven’t had a thousand of those in my life. My late wife always insisted on regular check-ups. A very sensible woman. Though, frankly, I suspect most of this is just the blood thinner doing what blood thinners do. It’s… inconvenient. And, truthfully, rather frightening to see it getting worse.
DOCTOR: Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your abdomen is soft. But given the increased bruising, and your concerns about it worsening, I’d like to order a complete blood count – a CBC – and a PT/INR test to check your Warfarin levels. That will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: A test. Of course. Well, get it done quickly, if you would. I have… commitments. Important commitments. And frankly, I don’t want to spend the rest of my life looking like a battered old plum.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. The lab is just down the hall. It shouldn't take long. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and adjust your Warfarin dosage if necessary. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that could cause injury, even minor ones. And let me know immediately if you notice any significant bleeding.
PATIENT: Significant bleeding? Really, Doctor? I’m not that careless. Fine, fine. I'll be careful. And I expect a prompt response when the results are in. I don't have all day to sit around worrying about turning purple. .
