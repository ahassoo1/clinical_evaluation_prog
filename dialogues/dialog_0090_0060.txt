DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's probably nothing, but my mother… well, she’s been having some issues, and my grandmother before that. Heart stuff, mostly. I just want to make sure I’m okay. Preventative, you know? I don’t want to end up like them. It's just… it runs in the family.
DOCTOR: “Preventative” is always good, Mr. Theriot, though frankly, worrying about what might happen isn't always the most productive use of your energy. Still, we can certainly take a look. “Heart stuff” is rather vague, though. Can you be a bit more specific about what your mother and grandmother experienced?
PATIENT: Ugh, vague is… probably accurate. My mother had something with her rhythm, I think? She had tests, and then… pills. Lots of pills. And Grandma… well, she just… collapsed, and they said it was her heart. It was a long time ago, so I don't remember specifics. They didn’t have all the fancy stuff back then, I guess. It’s just… a general anxiety, really. I don't want to drop dead unexpectedly, if you catch my drift. And honestly, I don't have time for a lot of medical drama. I'm teaching, you know? Very demanding.
DOCTOR: “Pills” and “collapsed” are, again, not terribly helpful, Mr. Theriot. But I understand the anxiety. It's good you're thinking about this. Being a teacher is demanding, certainly. Let's start with you. Have you experienced any palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, dizziness, or fainting spells?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Nothing like that. I get tired, obviously. It’s a lot of work. And sometimes I feel… a bit winded after running up the stairs to get to class, but honestly, who doesn't? I eat reasonably well, I think. Not perfect, but no fast food every day. I've always been… lean, I guess you'd say. Never had trouble with weight. I just… I want to know if I need to be worried, or if I'm just… overreacting because of my family.
DOCTOR: “Reasonably well” isn't a diagnosis, Mr. Theriot. And being “lean” doesn’t automatically equal healthy. But alright. Let’s get some basic information, then we can determine if further investigation is necessary. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I find it repulsive. My ex-wife smoked, which was… a whole other issue, frankly. And I stay away from people who do. It’s just… bad for you. No, definitely not a smoker. Honestly, I’m quite careful about what I put into my body. I’m not a health nut, but I’m not reckless either.
DOCTOR: Good. And alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Socially, mostly. A glass of wine with dinner occasionally, maybe a beer when watching a game. I’m not a drinker, per se. I don’t need it, if you understand. It's not like I'm out every night getting sloshed. I have responsibilities, you know? Teaching requires a clear head.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. Very responsible, I see. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, anything at all?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Never. I've had the usual colds and flu, a broken arm when I was a kid—clumsy, that was—but no serious illnesses. I get a yearly physical, just the standard checkup, and it’s always been fine. The doctor usually just tells me to get more sleep and drink more water. Honestly, I think they just say that to everyone. I suspect it’s a waste of time.
DOCTOR: “Waste of time,” you say?
PATIENT: Well, I didn’t mean completely a waste of time, but… they never find anything. I go, I answer their questions, they poke around a bit, and then they tell me to get more sleep and drink more water. It feels… perfunctory. Like they're just checking a box. I’m a fairly intelligent person; I can assess my own health reasonably well. I just want to know if I'm at risk, given my family history. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, while I appreciate your self-assessment, and intelligence doesn’t preclude the possibility of underlying medical issues. And I assure you, I do not simply “check boxes”. However, your history, as you've presented it, is unremarkable. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to be thorough. Blood pressure, heart and lung sounds. Nothing invasive. Just a baseline. Are you agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. If it makes you feel better. But I'm telling you, it's probably all perfectly normal. And honestly, if it's going to take too long, I have a lesson plan I need to finalize. I just hope this isn’t going to be a complete waste of my afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get this over with. Please, have a seat on the exam table. I'll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… try to be quick, okay? I have things to do. And please, don’t tell me to get more sleep and drink more water. I’m serious.
DOCTOR: 128 over 76. Not bad. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please, take a deep breath for me... and exhale. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Hmm. Everything does sound normal. But... given your family history... Let’s just get a basic EKG done. Routine precaution. Shouldn’t take more than a few minutes.
PATIENT: An EKG? Really? Isn't that a bit… excessive? I mean, you just said everything sounds normal. Look, I appreciate your thoroughness, but I'm starting to feel like you’re just fishing for something that isn’t there. I have a very busy schedule, Doctor. Is this absolutely necessary?
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, I understand your concerns, and frankly, your impatience. But an EKG is a simple, non-invasive test. It doesn't mean I think you're actively having a heart attack. It's a baseline assessment. Given your mother and grandmother's history, it's prudent. And frankly, it will give both of us peace of mind. It's a few minutes, and it’s covered by Medicare. Do you want me to order it, or shall we stop here and just agree you’re perfectly healthy and risk a potentially serious, unforeseen event down the line?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, order the stupid EKG. But if it shows absolutely nothing, I expect a full apology for wasting my time. And a very detailed explanation of why you thought it was necessary in the first place. I have a right to understand why I'm being subjected to these… inconveniences. This is ridiculous. Really ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll get the order put in now. The technician will be in shortly. Here you go. Just take this to the EKG room. And Mr. Theriot, while I appreciate your… intellectual curiosity, I assure you, I am a trained physician. I do not order tests on a whim.
PATIENT: Whatever. Waste of time… absolutely a waste of time.
