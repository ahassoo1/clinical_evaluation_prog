DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s…well, it’s rather inconvenient, truthfully. My vision, it’s just…gone a bit cloudy. And my hearing isn’t what it used to be. It all happened quite suddenly, you see. Honestly, I have better things to do than sit around explaining this.
DOCTOR: Cloudy vision and some hearing loss…suddenly, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, suddenly. As in, within the past few days. It's most bothersome. I haven't a clue what could have caused it. I don't have time for illnesses, Doctor. I'm a surgeon, you know. A pediatric surgeon.
DOCTOR: A pediatric surgeon, yes, I see that in your file… Quite a busy profession, I imagine. And this cloudiness…is it in both eyes?
PATIENT: Of course it's in both eyes, Doctor. Do you think I’d bother coming all the way here if it was just one eye? Honestly. It’s like looking through…well, I haven’t the foggiest, but it’s unpleasant. And the hearing…muffled, everything is just muffled. It makes conversation…difficult.
DOCTOR: Both eyes, muffled hearing…and this started within the last few days. Any dizziness or headaches with this, Ms. Julie?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I haven’t the time for headaches. No dizziness either. Just…this. A nuisance, really. I don't do dizziness. Are you quite finished with your questions, Doctor? I have appointments, you see. Important ones.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Just a few more, and then we can get a quick look. Any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? Well… now that you mention it… perhaps a slight…tinnitus? Though honestly, I’ve always had a little background noise. It's hardly something I'd notice. Is that important, Doctor? Because if it’s not, I really must insist we proceed.
DOCTOR: A little tinnitus…Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your balance, or perhaps any weakness on one side of your body?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor. Are you suggesting I've had a stroke? I assure you, my coordination is excellent. I operate on children, for heaven's sake! No weakness, no balance issues. This is becoming rather ridiculous. I think I’d know if I couldn’t stand, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Of course, of course. Just routine questions, Ms. Julie. It's good you have such awareness. Now, let’s just do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But please be quick, Doctor. I haven't all day. And do try to be gentle, I have a very important surgery scheduled for tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Alright, let's start with your eyes. Could you follow my penlight with your eyes, please?
PATIENT: Really, must you wave it about like that? It’s…distracting. Hurry up, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light. I do note some mild pallor of the optic disc in both eyes… difficult to assess fully without a more detailed examination, but it’s worth noting. Now, let's check your hearing. I'm going to place this tuning fork on the mastoid bone behind your ear… can you tell me when you can no longer hear it?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor. Must you poke and prod? I really dislike being touched unexpectedly. I… I suppose I can't hear it anymore. It's gone. Though it's terribly uncomfortable, this whole process. I'm a surgeon, remember? I give orders, I don't receive them. Can we please be done soon? .
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Very good. Now, just a quick neurological assessment… quick balance test if you don't mind… Just stand with your feet together and close your eyes. I see some mild unsteadiness. Nothing dramatic, but worth observing. Okay, Ms. Julie. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some sudden onset hearing loss and vision changes, accompanied by some mild unsteadiness. It's difficult to say definitively what's causing this without further investigation, but we need to rule out some serious possibilities. It’s possible this is related to a vascular issue, a neurological event, or perhaps even an inner ear problem. I'm going to order a full audiological evaluation and an MRI of the brain with and without contrast. I also want to get a complete blood workup. Would you be able to schedule those appointments?
