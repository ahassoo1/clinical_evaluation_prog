DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Tkac. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you as well, Doctor Georgiou. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. My name is Lennie Tkac. I’m here today… well, my niece thought it best I get checked over before I move into the Meadowbrook Senior Living Facility. Just want to be sure everything is alright, you understand. A formality, really.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very thoughtful of your niece, Mr. Tkac. It’s always a good idea to get a check-up before a big transition like that. “A formality” is a good way to put it, but it’s a very important one. We’ll do a thorough exam just to make sure everything is alright and get a baseline for your health records at Meadowbrook. So, let's start with a little bit about why you’re moving to Meadowbrook, if you don't mind sharing. Are you finding things a little more difficult at home, or is it more about wanting the social aspect of living with others?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s not that things are difficult, exactly. I’ve lived in my home for a long time, you see. Sixty years, come October. But it’s… a large place for one man these days. And the winters… the snow can be a bit much to manage on my own. My niece, bless her heart, she worries. Meadowbrook is close by, so she can visit easily. And it does sound nice to have folks around, you know? A bit of company. I used to bake for the whole town, you see. A bakery was my life. Now… not so many folks stopping by for a loaf of bread.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mr. Tkac. Sixty years in one home—that's a wonderful thing. And it’s very wise to think about safety, especially with the winters. It's perfectly natural to want some company, too, and Meadowbrook sounds like a lovely solution. It's good you have such a caring niece. So, let’s talk a little bit about your health, generally. Have you been seeing a regular doctor?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I had a good man, Dr. Henderson. He retired about five years ago. I haven’t really… found another one that felt quite right, so I’ve just been… taking it easy. Nothing major wrong with me, you see. A little arthritis in my hands, makes the baking a bit harder, but I manage. I still make a good sourdough, when I feel up to it. And I get my eyes checked yearly. Old age, you know. Things start to… wear down. But my heart’s still strong.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Tkac. It’s understandable to miss a good doctor, and “taking it easy” sounds like a sensible approach when things aren't urgent. And a strong heart is excellent! Now, about that arthritis… where exactly are you feeling it, and how much does it bother you on a typical day?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my fingers, Doctor. And my wrists, a little. It doesn’t hurt constantly, you understand. More like… stiff. Especially in the mornings. It takes a bit to get them working. And it makes kneading the dough… difficult. Used to be I could knead for an hour without a thought. Now… maybe fifteen minutes, and I have to stop and rest. It flares up sometimes, after a cold snap, or if I’ve been doing a lot of baking. But a warm soak usually helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Stiffness in the mornings, particularly affecting kneading, and flares with cold weather... and relieved by warm soaks. That sounds very much like typical osteoarthritis. We can certainly talk about ways to manage that. Now, aside from your hands, have you noticed any other aches, pains, or changes in your body recently?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, Doctor, my legs do get a little tired when I walk for a long distance. Not constantly, you understand. If I go to the store, maybe a block or so, I have to stop and rest a little. And sometimes, I get a bit… dizzy when I stand up too quickly. Nothing serious, I don’t think. Just old age catching up with me again. I’ve always been a big man, you see. Maybe it’s just the weight.
DOCTOR: Okay, leg fatigue with walking and dizziness upon standing... That’s good information to have, Mr. Tkac. While it could be related to age and your size, those symptoms are worth checking out just to be sure. We'll do a quick physical exam and maybe a few simple tests. Before we get to that, let me ask: have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… Nothing major, Doctor. I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was… a long time ago. And I broke my arm once, falling off a horse. I was a bit of a wild one in those days. Other than that… just the usual childhood illnesses. Nothing serious. I’ve always been a strong man, you see. Good Lakota genes, I reckon. I’ve been pretty lucky, all in all.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Tkac. And yes, good genes certainly help! It sounds like you’ve had a healthy life, all things considered. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I never married. Didn’t find the right woman, I suppose. My brother, he had a large family. Several children and grandchildren. They live out west, mostly. I see them when I can, but it's… difficult to travel these days. My niece, Sarah, she’s my closest family. She’s a good woman. Very caring. She checks on me often. Always making sure I’m eating right and taking care of myself.
DOCTOR: That's lovely to hear, Mr. Tkac. It’s wonderful to have such a caring niece. Family is very important. Now, before we move on to medications or allergies, I’d like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. My mother always said it was a foolish habit. And I don’t drink alcohol either. Never had a taste for it. And as for… recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I’m an old man, you see. I prefer a good cup of coffee and a quiet afternoon. And maybe a slice of sourdough bread, when I’ve made it.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very sensible way to live, Mr. Tkac. A good cup of coffee and sourdough bread is an excellent combination! Now, let's talk about any medications you're currently taking, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like food or pollen?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I don’t take any regular medications. Just a little ibuprofen now and then for my arthritis, when it flares up. And a multivitamin, Sarah makes sure I take that. She’s always worried about me getting enough… vitamins, you see. As for allergies… I get a bit of hay fever in the spring, but nothing serious. And I can’t eat shellfish. Had a bad reaction to it when I was a boy, and I’ve avoided it ever since.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, a multivitamin, and a shellfish allergy. We'll make sure to document those clearly. Alright, Mr. Tkac, now I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your hands and legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Do what you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable, you understand. I’m an old man, but I still have some sense left.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Tkac. I'll explain everything as I go, and please stop me at any time if you feel any discomfort. Alright, Mr. Tkac, everything looks reasonably good, but I do want to order a few simple tests just to get a better understanding of what's going on. I’m thinking a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray to check out that crackling sound I heard in your lungs. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. If that’s what you think is best. A few tests won’t hurt, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t involve too much… poking and prodding, you understand. My niece, Sarah, she usually handles these things. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? Fasting, or anything like that? I wouldn’t want to ruin the results.
DOCTOR: No poking and prodding, I promise! Just a little blood draw and a quick image with the X-ray machine. And yes, good question! For the basic metabolic panel, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drinks except water. The complete blood count doesn’t require fasting. I'll give you a requisition form with detailed instructions. Sarah can help you schedule the tests at the lab, and she’ll be aware of the fasting requirement. While we're waiting for the results, I’m going to recommend some over-the-counter pain relief for your arthritis – perhaps a cream or gel with capsaicin. It can be very effective for localized pain. I’ll also suggest some gentle exercises to help maintain your range of motion. And, considering your slight dizziness and swelling, I recommend wearing compression socks. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that all sounds… manageable. Compression socks, capsaicin cream, and gentle exercises. Sarah will know what to do. She always takes good care of me. I suppose this is all for the best, you know? To make sure I’m… fit and ready for Meadowbrook. I don’t want to be a bother to anyone.
DOCTOR: That's very thoughtful of you, Mr. Tkac, and it sounds like you have excellent support with Sarah. And yes, getting a baseline and addressing these minor issues now will definitely make your transition to Meadowbrook smoother. So, to summarize: we've discussed your history, performed a basic physical exam, and ordered some blood tests and a chest X-ray. We'll also focus on managing your arthritis with over-the-counter remedies and gentle exercise, and I’ve recommended compression socks. Once we have the test results, we can discuss them in detail and formulate a more comprehensive plan. I’m going to print out a summary of our conversation, the requisition forms for the tests, and some information about arthritis management. Do you have any questions before I do that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve covered everything. You’ve been very thorough and… reassuring. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to an old man like me. And thank you for not making me feel like… a specimen or something. Sarah will be very pleased with this. I think that’s all for now.
DOCTOR: It was my pleasure, Mr. Tkac. You are not a specimen, and I’m glad I could reassure you. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll schedule that once we have the test results. And remember, taking care of yourself is never a bother. We're here to help. Have a good afternoon, Mr. Tkac. And please give Sarah my best. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Georgiou. You as well. And I will certainly give Sarah your regards. Good afternoon to you.
