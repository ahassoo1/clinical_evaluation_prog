DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Haggar, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Mande Haggar. It’s nice to meet you, Dr. Overgaard.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let’s not waste time with pleasantries. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. But after I eat fava beans… I get really sick. My skin turns yellow, and I just feel awful. Like, really weak and tired. It’s happened a couple of times now, and I finally decided to come get it checked out. It’s the jaundice that worried me the most.
DOCTOR: Jaundice, you say. And specifically after fava beans?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Every time. I didn’t really connect it at first, you know? I eat a lot of different things. But then it happened a third time, and I thought, “Okay, that’s… unusual.” It's definitely the fava beans. I’ve tried to avoid them since, just to be sure.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long after eating the fava beans does this… episode begin?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It usually starts within a few hours, maybe four or five. It’s not immediate, but it’s definitely before the end of the day. And it lasts a couple of days, usually. Long enough to really knock me off my feet.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any other symptoms besides the yellowing of the skin and fatigue?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Sometimes my urine gets really dark, almost brown. And… well, this is a little embarrassing to talk about, but my stools are also quite pale. Like, much lighter than usual. I didn't know if that was connected, but I thought I should mention it.
DOCTOR: Pale stools and dark urine… Interesting. Have you had any fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No fever, thankfully. I do sometimes feel a bit nauseous when it starts, but I haven't actually been sick. No vomiting. My appetite… it’s a little off, I guess. I don’t really feel like eating when I’m feeling unwell, but it’s not like I can’t keep anything down. And no abdominal pain, no. Just really tired and weak. Is this… serious?
DOCTOR: Serious is a relative term. But the combination of jaundice, pale stools, dark urine after ingestion of fava beans… leads me to suspect G6PD deficiency. It's a genetic condition. Do you have any family history of similar issues?
PATIENT: G6PD deficiency? I… I don’t think so. I’ve never heard of that. My family… well, my parents were both Romanian, and they didn’t really talk much about medical things. I don't recall anyone ever being sick like this. We weren't really big on doctors, if that makes sense. Would that mean I inherited it? I don't even know what it is exactly. Is it… contagious? I hope not!
DOCTOR: No, it’s not contagious. It’s a genetic enzyme deficiency. You inherit two copies of the gene, one from each parent, to have the deficiency. It's more common in people of Mediterranean, African, and Middle Eastern descent, which, given your Romanian heritage, isn’t entirely surprising. We need to run a blood test to confirm. A complete blood count and a G6PD enzyme assay. Also, I’d like to check your bilirubin levels, liver function tests, and a reticulocyte count. It’s fairly straightforward. Do you have any allergies to medications, or are you currently taking anything at all?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. And I'm not taking any medication regularly. Just over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes, for headaches. Nothing else. That sounds like a lot of tests, though… is it going to be expensive? I do have private insurance, but… you know how it is. And if it is this G6PD thing… what does that mean for me? Can it be treated?
DOCTOR: Insurance will cover what it covers. We're not here to debate billing. As for G6PD deficiency… it's manageable. The primary thing is avoiding triggers – fava beans being a significant one. Certain medications can also cause a reaction, so we’ll need to be careful with what you're prescribed in the future. We'll do the blood work now. I'll need to draw a few vials. After that, we'll review the results and discuss a long-term management plan. It’s not a death sentence, Mrs. Haggar, but it does require some vigilance. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Avoid fava beans and be careful with medications. Vigilance. Okay. I think so. Drawing blood… alright. Is it going to hurt a lot? I’m not a fan of needles, if I’m being honest. And thank you, Dr. Overgaard, for explaining everything. It’s a relief to finally have some idea of what’s going on. Let’s just get the blood work done, then.
DOCTOR: It’s a small prick. Hardly noticeable for someone of your… constitution. The phlebotomist will be in shortly. Try to relax. We’ll get this sorted. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Okay. I will. Thank you, Doctor.
