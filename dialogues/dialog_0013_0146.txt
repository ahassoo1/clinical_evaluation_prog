DOCTOR: Hi Edric, good to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Chriselda. It's... muscle weakness, mostly. It’s been getting worse for a few weeks now, and honestly, it’s starting to worry me. I don't really know how to explain it beyond that. It's just... harder to do things.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle weakness that’s been progressively worsening over a few weeks. I understand that's concerning. To get a better picture of what's going on, can you tell me a little more about where you’re experiencing this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm. It started in my legs, I think. Mostly my thighs. Now, it's… everywhere, kinda. My arms feel it too, when I try to lift things. Even my hands sometimes. It’s not like I can’t lift things, it just… takes more effort. And it feels tiring afterwards, quicker than it used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started in your thighs and has gradually spread to your arms and hands. And it's associated with increased effort and fatigue. That's helpful. Is this weakness the same on both sides of your body, or is it worse on one side than the other?
PATIENT: It feels pretty even, actually. Both legs feel about the same. Same with my arms. It's not like one side is completely useless or anything, but… yeah, pretty symmetrical, I'd say. It’s just… all kinda weak.
DOCTOR: Okay, symmetrical weakness is good to know. Now, has anything specific triggered this weakness, or did it just come on gradually?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I honestly can’t think of anything. I haven’t done anything different, no new exercises, no injuries… I mean, I work, mostly sitting. I drive to work. It just… started. I noticed it when I was helping my neighbor carry some boxes a few weeks ago. That was when I first thought, "Huh, that’s harder than it used to be."
DOCTOR: Okay, so it wasn’t related to a specific event or injury, and it seems to have come on gradually while doing normal activities. And you mentioned you mostly sit for work. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I’ve been a little more tired than usual, maybe? But I figured that was just from work. No pain, no numbness, no tingling… I haven't noticed anything else, really. Sometimes I feel a little… off balance, but that happens sometimes anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain, numbness, or tingling. A little extra fatigue and occasional mild dizziness. Do you have any history of medical problems, like diabetes or heart issues?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I’ve been pretty healthy, honestly. I've had the usual colds and flu, but nothing serious. My dad had high blood pressure, but that’s about it, as far as I know. I don’t really go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No significant medical history, and your father had high blood pressure. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. No surgeries, no hospital stays. Like I said, pretty healthy. I try to eat okay, I don't smoke, I don't drink much… nothing exciting. This weakness is just… weird, because it’s something.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations, and you maintain a generally healthy lifestyle. Do you take any medications regularly, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don't take anything. Not even vitamins, usually. I try to get what I need from food. I'll take something for a headache if I have one, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications or supplements. And you mentioned you're uninsured. That’s good to know as we think about potential testing. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to figure out what's going on. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Great. If you don't mind, could you lie down on the table for me?
PATIENT: Sure. Let me know if I need to adjust anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m checking your reflexes now… Good. And now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Like that? It doesn't feel as strong as it used to be, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I notice that's a little weaker than expected. Now, I'm going to ask you to resist me as I try to move your arms and legs. Just try to hold your position, don't push back. Starting with your arms… Can you keep your arms straight while I push down?
PATIENT: It’s… getting harder to hold them still. Is this normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noticing some weakness in your legs as well. Now, I'm going to check your balance. Can you sit up and stand without using your arms, if you're able?
PATIENT: Whoa… that was a little unsteady. I normally don't have trouble with that.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. That was a little unsteady, yes. Alright, that completes the physical exam for now. Based on what you've told me, and what I’ve found during the exam – progressive muscle weakness, symmetrical involvement, and some difficulty with balance – I’m concerned about a few possibilities. It’s too early to say definitively, but we need to investigate further. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had a reaction to anything. So… what possibilities? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, that’s good. As for the possibilities, it could be a number of things. It could be related to a vitamin deficiency, like vitamin D. It could also be a nerve issue, or even a muscle condition. In rare cases, it could be something more serious, like a neurological disorder. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood work. Specifically, I want to check your vitamin levels, electrolytes, and thyroid function. We should also check your creatine kinase level, which can help us assess your muscle health. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… a lot. Vitamin deficiency, nerves, muscles… That does sound serious. Blood work sounds fine, I guess. What’s creatine… whatever that is? And will it be expensive? I… I don’t have a lot of money.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern. Creatine kinase, or CK, is an enzyme released when muscle cells are damaged. It helps us see if there's any ongoing muscle breakdown. It's a pretty standard test. And I completely understand your concerns about the cost. Since you're uninsured, the cost can be a worry. Let me see what I can do. I can write the order, and then our billing department can give you a breakdown of the costs. They may be able to offer a discount or a payment plan. We can also look into free or low-cost clinics in the area that may be able to help. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: That would be… really helpful, actually. A payment plan would be amazing. Free clinics would be even better. I just… I don't want this to be something I can’t afford to figure out. I've got enough worries without adding expensive medical bills to the list.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. I'll write the order for the blood work now, and then I'll have a member of our billing department come in and speak with you about the costs and payment options. I’ll also ask them to look into those free clinics for you. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any strenuous activity, and if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like difficulty breathing, changes in vision, or severe fatigue – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that covers it. Just… thank you. For not dismissing me, and for trying to help with the cost. It really means a lot. I’m… just worried, you know? But I guess the blood work is the first step.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I understand your worry, and I’m here to help in any way I can. Getting the blood work done is a good first step, and we'll take it from there. I'm going to have someone come in now to draw the blood and discuss the costs with you. Is there anything else I can do for you before they arrive?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Chriselda.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’ll let them know you’re ready. Please don’t hesitate to ask if anything comes to mind. I’ll also send a copy of my findings to your chart so that you have them readily available. We’ll get to the bottom of this. .
PATIENT: .
