DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I have been… how you say… wheezing. It is hard to breathe sometimes, like a little whistle sound. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Not very good.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kilton. “Wheezing,” you say. And it’s been going on for a few weeks. Can you describe when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm. When it happens… let me think. It is worse when I walk fast, or… when I climb the stairs. Sometimes at night, when I am lying down. But not every night. It is funny, really. Sometimes I feel okay, and then… whoosh! It comes back.
DOCTOR: So, it’s exertionally related – with walking or stairs – and intermittent, occurring at night sometimes but not always. Do you have any pain associated with this wheezing?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain. More… tight. My chest feels tight when I breathe. Like a band around it. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. And makes me worry, you know? I used to be very strong. I am an Athletic Trainer, I help people be strong. But this… this is not good for my work.
DOCTOR: Chest tightness accompanying the wheezing. And it's impacting your ability to work, which is understandably concerning. Now, have you had a fever, cough, or any recent illness?
PATIENT: No fever. No cough. I haven’t been sick, not really. Maybe a little… cold, a month ago? Very small cold. Nothing like the flu. Just a little sniffle. But the wheezing, that came after the little cold. I am sure of it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no cough, a minor cold about a month ago that preceded the onset of the wheezing. Let’s talk about your medical history, Mrs. Kilton. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: No, never. Doctor always said I was very healthy. Very strong lungs, they said. I always took care of myself, even now. I eat good food, I walk… well, I used to walk fast. This is… new. Nothing like this before.
DOCTOR: Okay. No prior diagnoses of asthma or lung conditions. And you've generally been in good health. Have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I broke my arm when I was a little girl, a long time ago. That is it, I think. No hospital, not really. Just the doctor fixed my arm. Everything else, I stayed healthy. No big problems, until now.
DOCTOR: Alright, broken arm as a child, no other surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let's discuss your family history. Does anyone in your family have asthma, allergies, or lung problems?
PATIENT: That is… a good question. My mother, she had… how you say… allergies. Sneezing a lot, red eyes. But not asthma, not that I know of. My father, he was very strong, healthy. No problems. My brother… he smoked for many years, but I don’t know if he had lung problems. We do not talk much now.
DOCTOR: Allergies in your mother, smoking history in your brother. And you yourself, have you ever smoked, or been exposed to a lot of secondhand smoke?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Never liked it. And I always stayed away from people who smoked. Very bad for you, you know? I always told my students, “Do not smoke!” Very important. I have always been careful.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Sometimes I take a little something for my… how you say… aches and pains. But just when they are very bad. Nothing every day. Just a small pill, from the store. For my muscles, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Occasional over-the-counter pain relief. Now, I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your heart. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need, Doctor. I trust you. My lungs… they used to be very strong. I am worried now.
DOCTOR: Please, if you’ll have a seat here. I’m going to listen to your breathing with my stethoscope. It will be quick. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… and out… Okay. I am hearing some wheezing on both sides, particularly when you exhale. Your breathing is slightly labored, but your oxygen saturation is currently 95%, which is acceptable. Your heart sounds are regular. No tenderness to palpation. I also want to check your pulse. Your pulse is a little elevated at 88, but within normal limits. Based on what you’ve told me, and my initial examination, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms consistent with asthma, although your history is atypical for a late-onset presentation. We need to get some further testing done to confirm. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a pulmonary function test. Would you be able to get those done today?
PATIENT: Asthma? But I never… never had asthma before. That is… surprising. A chest X-ray and a test? Yes, I can do that. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to breathe easier. It is scary when you cannot breathe. So, yes, I will do the test and the X-ray.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kilton. I’ve ordered the chest X-ray and pulmonary function test. The staff will let you know when and where to go for those tests. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler to help open up your airways and relieve some of the wheezing. It's a rescue inhaler, you'll use it as needed when you feel short of breath. We’ll review the results of the tests when they come back and discuss a long-term management plan if necessary. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: An inhaler? Like they use when you are… very sick? Will it help me breathe? And what if the test… what if it is something bad? I am a little worried, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Mrs. Kilton. The inhaler delivers medication directly to your lungs to help relax the muscles and open your airways. It’s very safe and often provides quick relief. As for the tests, they're simply to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Most likely, we're dealing with asthma that’s developed later in life, which is becoming more common. But we need to rule out other possibilities. We'll discuss the results thoroughly when they come back. Here's the prescription for the inhaler. The pharmacy will explain how to use it. Please use it as directed, and contact the office if you experience any side effects. Do you feel comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. If it helps me breathe, I will try it. And the pharmacy will show me how? Good. That is good. I do not want to do it wrong. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind. And I will call if something is wrong.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Kilton. The pharmacy staff is excellent; they’ll be happy to demonstrate the proper technique. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Here is a work note excusing you from strenuous activity for one week, pending the results of your tests. I’m scheduling a follow-up appointment for you in one week to discuss the results and determine the next steps. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: One week… yes, that is fine. A work note too? That is very helpful. My boss, he is not always understanding. Thank you again, Doctor. You have put my mind at ease a little. I will go to the pharmacy now, and then home to rest.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please do. And remember, if your symptoms worsen significantly before your appointment, or if you experience any chest pain, difficulty speaking, or bluish discoloration of your lips or fingernails, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, I’ll see you next week. Take care, Mrs. Kilton.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will be careful. You take care too. Goodbye.
