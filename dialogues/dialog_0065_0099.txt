DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Minatra. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, I received the results from that… internal examination I had done, and the nurse said they weren’t quite normal. I’m a bit worried, to be honest. I was hoping you could explain them to me in a way I can understand.
DOCTOR: Of course. It’s good you came in to discuss them. “Not quite normal” can mean a lot of things, and it's best to go through it systematically. Let’s start with the basics. Before we dive into the results themselves, can you tell me a bit more about why you had this internal examination done in the first place?
PATIENT: Certainly. For the past few months, I’ve been having some… discomfort. It’s difficult to describe precisely. A sort of ache, mostly in my abdomen, and sometimes a feeling of fullness even when I haven’t eaten much. It wasn’t constant, which is why I waited a bit before seeing anyone. But it started happening more frequently, and then… well, then my appetite began to change, too. I wasn’t feeling quite myself, and my primary care physician suggested the examination to rule things out.
DOCTOR: Okay, abdominal discomfort and changes in appetite. And how long ago did your primary care physician recommend this examination?
PATIENT: It was… let me think. It was back in June, I believe. Around the middle of June, yes. She wanted to be cautious, given my age and… well, a family history of similar issues, though not precisely the same. It was about three weeks ago, perhaps a little more, that I actually had the procedure done. I remember it was a very warm day.
DOCTOR: A family history of “similar issues” is rather vague, Ms. Minatra. Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, forgive me, Doctor. It is vague, isn’t it? My mother, and then her sister, both had… troubles with their digestion as they got older. Nothing formally diagnosed, as far as I know. Just… discomfort, loss of appetite, that sort of thing. They both felt quite unwell in their later years. My mother passed away when she was seventy-two, and my aunt was seventy-five. It wasn’t a quick passing, but it was… unpleasant for them, and worrying for the family. It’s probably nothing, truly, but my doctor thought it best to investigate, given my lineage.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a history of vague digestive issues in your mother and aunt. And you mentioned the discomfort started a few months ago. Has it been getting progressively worse, or has it been fluctuating?
PATIENT: Fluctuating, I’d say. There are days where I barely notice it, and then other days it’s… more pronounced. It doesn’t come after eating, specifically. It’s just… there. Sometimes it feels like a dull ache, other times a sort of pressure. And the appetite changes aren’t consistent either. Some days I have no desire to eat, and others I’m perfectly normal. It's quite perplexing, really. I've tried to keep track, but it's difficult to pinpoint any patterns. I do feel more tired lately, though. That’s been fairly consistent.
DOCTOR: Fatigue is a notable symptom. Now, let’s talk about other things. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That… that has been happening, too. I’ve noticed… well, it’s less frequent, and when it does happen, it’s… different. More difficult to pass, if you understand what I mean. And sometimes… there’s blood. Not a great deal, usually just a few drops, but enough to worry me. It’s mostly after straining, but it's been happening more and more lately. I wasn't sure if it was related to the other symptoms, or just… something else. It's quite embarrassing to discuss, I apologize.
DOCTOR: It’s important to be thorough, Ms. Minatra. There’s no need to apologize. Blood in the stool is always something we need to investigate. And how often would you say you’re experiencing this bleeding?
PATIENT: It’s… sporadic. Perhaps once a week, maybe a little more. It’s not every time, certainly. And the amount varies. Sometimes it’s just a few flecks, barely noticeable, other times it’s a bit more… substantial. It started around the same time as the discomfort, I think. It’s difficult to recall precisely, but I believe it was within a week or two. I tried to dismiss it as a minor irritation at first, but it hasn’t gone away. I do take a fiber supplement occasionally, to help with… regularity, but it doesn’t seem to make much difference. I’m starting to become quite anxious about it, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ve covered quite a bit. Before we discuss the examination results, I need to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me see. I had my gallbladder removed when I was in my early forties. That was… unpleasant, but I recovered fully. Other than that… I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, things like that, but nothing serious. I did have high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years now. And… oh, I had a hysterectomy when I was thirty-five. That was… a long time ago. I've been taking the medication for the blood pressure for, oh, fifteen years, I suppose. I see my primary care physician regularly for check-ups. She monitors everything quite closely.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, hysterectomy, and controlled hypertension. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: No, just the medication for the blood pressure. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. And the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but that’s it. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible, though they don’t always help with the discomfort. I do take a multivitamin every day, but I don’t consider that a medication, exactly. And as I mentioned, the fiber supplement, but I haven’t been taking that as much lately, as it doesn’t seem to be doing much good. I’m fairly careful about what I eat, too. I try to avoid processed foods and sugary drinks.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s discuss the results of your internal examination. The findings indicate some… irregularities in your colon. There’s a polyp present, and the biopsy results were not entirely conclusive. It’s a concerning finding, Ms. Minatra. It’s not necessarily cancerous, but further investigation is required to rule out malignancy. The report also noted some inflammation, which could be contributing to the bleeding and discomfort you’ve been experiencing.
PATIENT: Oh dear. A polyp… and inflammation. That doesn’t sound good at all. Not conclusive… what does that mean, exactly? Does it mean I need more tests? And malignancy… you mean cancer? I must admit, Doctor, I’m quite frightened now. Is it… serious? What are the next steps? I’m trying to remain calm, but this is all rather overwhelming.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be frightened, Ms. Minatra. “Not conclusive” means the biopsy didn’t provide a definitive answer. It could be benign, but we can’t rule out the possibility of precancerous or cancerous cells without further testing. We need to perform a colonoscopy. This will allow us to visualize the entire colon, remove the polyp for a more thorough examination, and take additional biopsies if necessary. It’s the most accurate way to determine the cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. As for the severity… it’s too early to say. The presence of a polyp doesn’t automatically mean you have cancer. Many polyps are benign. However, it’s crucial to investigate further to ensure there’s no cause for concern. I'm going to order the colonoscopy immediately. We’ll need to prepare you for the procedure, which involves cleaning out your colon. We'll discuss that in detail. I'll also need to refer you to a gastroenterologist, Dr. Ramirez, who specializes in these types of procedures. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy… and a specialist. Yes, that sounds acceptable, Doctor. I understand it’s necessary, even if it doesn’t sound pleasant. Cleaning out my colon… I suppose I should ask, is it… painful? And how long will I be… out of commission? I have a small garden I tend to, and I wouldn't want to neglect it for too long. And Dr. Ramirez… is he a good doctor? I do appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor Duplichan. It helps to know what to expect. I trust your judgement, and I'm willing to do whatever is necessary to get to the bottom of this.
DOCTOR: The preparation can be… uncomfortable, Ms. Minatra. It involves drinking a large volume of a laxative solution to empty your colon. It’s not painful, but it can cause cramping and frequent bowel movements. Most patients find it the most challenging part of the procedure. As for being “out of commission,” most patients can resume normal activities the following day, although you may feel some fatigue and mild cramping. Gardening shouldn't be a problem after a day or two, provided you don’t exert yourself excessively. Dr. Ramirez is an excellent gastroenterologist. He’s highly respected in the community and has a very good reputation. I wouldn’t refer you to anyone I didn’t have complete confidence in. I’m going to write you a referral for Dr. Ramirez, and his office will contact you to schedule the colonoscopy. I’ll also provide detailed instructions for the bowel preparation. Do you have any questions about any of that at this point?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything for now, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your patience with my questions. The bowel preparation sounds… unpleasant, but I’ll manage. And I trust Dr. Ramirez will be capable. I suppose I should just brace myself and get it over with. Thank you again, Doctor Duplichan. You’ve put my mind at ease, despite the… concerning news. Is there anything I should avoid eating or drinking in the days leading up to the procedure? Or any medications I should stop taking? I want to be as prepared as possible.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Minatra. It’s good you’re asking these questions. For the three days leading up to the colonoscopy, you should follow a low-fiber diet. Avoid fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and nuts. You can eat things like white bread, pasta, and cooked chicken. The day before the procedure, you’ll need to switch to a clear liquid diet – broth, clear juices, gelatin. You must stop taking any iron supplements seven days before the procedure, as iron can interfere with the visualization. If you’re taking any blood thinners, like aspirin or warfarin, you’ll need to discuss this with Dr. Ramirez, as they may need to be temporarily discontinued. I’m going to include a detailed list of dietary restrictions and medication guidelines with the referral. Please read it carefully. Do you have any other concerns I can address before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You've been remarkably helpful and clear. I’ll read the guidelines carefully and contact Dr. Ramirez’s office as soon as possible. Thank you again for your time and patience. I feel much better informed now, even though the news wasn’t ideal. I’ll… I’ll try to remain optimistic. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Minatra. Remember, early detection is key. And don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. I wish you all the best with the procedure. Have a good day.
