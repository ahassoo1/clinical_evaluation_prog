DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I’m Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this daytime sleepiness, really. I’ve been using one of those machines at night – a CPAP, I think they call it – for a while now, and it should be helping, but I’m still awfully tired during the day. It’s… frustrating, to be honest. I thought this would fix things.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A CPAP machine, yes. And you’ve been using it for… how long now, would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It must be close to two years now. Maybe a little more. They got me set up right after they told me I was stopping breathing a lot when I slept, you know? The sleep study and all that. It was a bit of a shock, finding that out. Two years and a few months, I'd wager.
DOCTOR: Right. And has the setting on the CPAP been adjusted at all since you started?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I honestly don’t remember. They had me come in a few times at the beginning to make sure the mask fit right and everything, and they fiddled with the numbers then. But nobody’s really asked me about it since then, if that makes sense. I just… keep using it. Is it supposed to be adjusted regularly? I didn’t realize that.
DOCTOR: It should be assessed periodically, yes. The pressure can change over time with weight fluctuations, or just naturally. Alright. And besides the daytime sleepiness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… my mouth does get pretty dry sometimes when I’m using the machine. And I wake up with a bit of a sore throat occasionally. Nothing terrible, just… noticeable. I’ve been drinking more water before bed, hoping that helps. I also sometimes feel a little… congested in the mornings, but I figured that was just allergies. It's been a pretty humid summer.
DOCTOR: Okay. Dry mouth, sore throat, some congestion. And is this congestion primarily nasal, or more in your chest?
PATIENT: Mostly in my nose, I think. Not a lot of coughing or anything like that. Just… stuffy. It’s hard to explain. It feels like my nasal passages are a little… irritated, maybe? And then, like I said, it’s worse in the mornings after using the machine all night. It's not debilitating, Doctor, but it's certainly not comfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any headaches?
PATIENT: Headaches… hmm. Not really frequent ones, no. I get the occasional tension headache, like anyone else does, but nothing that I'd associate with the machine or the sleepiness. It's not like I wake up with a pounding headache every morning. I’ve always had a bit of a sensitive head, if that makes sense. Stress brings on headaches more than anything, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's move on to a quick review of systems. Do you have any chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain at all. And I haven’t had any trouble breathing, thankfully. I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit over thirty years ago. Best decision I ever made, that was. No shortness of breath, though, not at all. I walk every morning, about a mile, and I manage that just fine.
DOCTOR: Good. Any palpitations, or irregular heartbeats that you're aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. My heart feels… regular, as far as I can tell. I get a little anxious sometimes, like anyone does, and I think I feel it beat faster then, but not anything unusual otherwise. I had a check-up with my regular doctor a few months back, and he didn't mention anything about my heart being irregular, if that's worth anything.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is relevant. Now, how about your digestive system?
PATIENT: Oh, well… it gets the job done, mostly. No major problems, thankfully. I've always been pretty regular, if you know what I mean. No constipation or diarrhea, nothing like that. I do get a little heartburn sometimes, especially if I eat something spicy, but I just take some over-the-counter medicine for that. Nothing out of the ordinary, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, have you noticed any changes in your urinary habits?
PATIENT: No, no changes there, Doctor. I get up once during the night, maybe twice if I've had a lot to drink, but that's been the same for years. Nothing more frequent, nothing less frequent. Everything's… predictable, thankfully. Is this… is this getting to the bottom of things? I'm happy to answer whatever you need to know, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me see... I had my appendix out when I was a kid, a long time ago. And I was diagnosed with high blood pressure a few years back, but it's been well-controlled with medication ever since. Other than that… nothing major, really. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. I had a bout of pneumonia once, but that was years ago, and I recovered fully. Oh! And my divorce, of course. That was a medical experience of sorts, emotionally speaking. But I suppose you're asking about physical ailments.
DOCTOR: Yes, primarily physical ailments, Mr. Paske. What medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, of course. Let me think… it's Lisinopril, I believe. 20 milligrams, once a day. And I take a baby aspirin every day, just as a preventative measure, my regular doctor recommended it. Other than those two, nothing else. I used to take something for cholesterol, but my numbers improved with diet and exercise, so they took me off of that a few years ago. I'm quite proud of that, actually. I like to stay active, when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries other than your appendix removal?
PATIENT: No, just the appendix. Nothing else. I’ve been lucky, really. I’ve always been careful. My ex-wife had all sorts of surgeries, but that’s a story for another day, and probably best left untold. No, just the appendix. I haven't been under the knife since I was a boy. Is that important? Should I be thinking of anything else?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my father had heart trouble, eventually needed a bypass surgery. And my mother had diabetes, type 2, I think. My sister, she has arthritis, pretty bad. And my brother… he had high blood pressure too, just like me. Nothing too dramatic, really. A lot of the usual suspects, I suppose. Heart trouble, diabetes, arthritis… the things you hear about. Did that answer your question? Is there anything specific you're looking for?
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, regarding your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking, as I mentioned before – quit over thirty years ago, best decision I ever made. I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I’ve cut back considerably. Maybe once a month now, if that. And no recreational drugs, never have, never will. I prefer a good book, honestly. I live alone, mostly keep to myself, but I have a few close friends I see regularly. We play dominoes, mostly. It keeps the mind sharp. Is that what you needed to know? I'm happy to answer anything else you might ask.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske, thank you for that thorough history. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam. We’ll start by checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll take a look at your nose and throat. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm ready when you are. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to all of that. It's good to have someone ask, you know? Sometimes you feel like you're just talking to the air. Let's get this done, shall we?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paske. Relax your arm… good. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Heart sounds… regular rhythm, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let’s take a look at your nose and throat. Nasal passages… some mild congestion and redness, but no significant polyps or masses. Throat is slightly inflamed, some mild redness at the back of the throat. No exudate detected. Your uvula appears slightly elongated, and there's some mild swelling of your soft palate. Do you snore loudly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do snore. My ex-wife used to complain about it constantly. It's one of the reasons she started sleeping in the guest room, actually. I hadn’t thought about it much myself, but she said it was like a freight train. I do wake up feeling tired, even with the machine, so maybe it's not working as well as it should. Is that… is that a problem? Is that what you're thinking? The swelling you mentioned… is that connected to the snoring?
DOCTOR: It’s possible, Mr. Paske. The swelling I observed, along with your report of loud snoring despite CPAP use, suggests a potential issue with your upper airway. The CPAP machine delivers air pressure, but if there's anatomical obstruction or inflammation, it may not be fully effective. And the elongation of your uvula can contribute to airway obstruction during sleep. It’s possible you have mild obstructive sleep apnea despite being on CPAP, or that the CPAP isn’t adequately addressing the source of the problem. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a repeat sleep study, specifically one that evaluates your upper airway dynamics while you're on CPAP. This will help us determine if the machine is properly adjusted and if there are any other underlying issues contributing to your symptoms. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: A repeat sleep study… hmm. I suppose it makes sense. I was hoping the machine would fix everything, but it sounds like it’s not that simple. Will it be anything like the first one? All those wires and the uncomfortable sensors… and sleeping in a strange place? That wasn’t my favorite experience. And what if it is a problem with the machine? What are my options then? Will I need a different mask? Or… something more serious? I'm a bit anxious about this, to be honest. I just want to feel rested again.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Paske. A repeat sleep study is necessary to get a proper diagnosis, and I’ll do my best to make the experience as comfortable as possible. The technology has improved since your first study; the sensors are often smaller and less intrusive. If the study reveals suboptimal CPAP settings, we can adjust the pressure. If the issue is related to mask fit, we can explore different mask types and sizes to ensure a better seal. In some cases, if there's significant upper airway obstruction, a consultation with an ENT specialist might be recommended to evaluate for structural issues, such as enlarged tonsils or adenoids, or nasal polyps. In rare cases, surgery might be considered, but that’s usually a last resort. For now, let’s focus on the sleep study. I’ll write you a referral to the sleep center. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. It’s important to bring your CPAP machine and mask with you, as they’ll need to evaluate your current setup. In the meantime, to help with your symptoms, I recommend using a saline nasal spray before bed to help with the congestion, and I can prescribe a mild corticosteroid nasal spray to reduce the inflammation in your nasal passages. Would you like me to write you prescriptions for those?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be wonderful. The saline spray sounds good, and the corticosteroid spray… anything to help me breathe a little easier. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It's reassuring to know there are options. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not just dismissing it as a minor inconvenience. A referral to the sleep center… and bring my machine… alright, I can do that. Is there anything else I should be doing in the meantime? Any particular sleeping positions I should avoid? Or foods I should cut out? I'm willing to try anything to feel better.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. It’s important to address these concerns to improve your quality of life. Regarding sleeping positions, try to sleep on your side rather than your back, as this can help reduce airway obstruction. As for diet, avoid alcohol and heavy meals before bedtime, as these can worsen snoring and sleep apnea symptoms. Maintaining a healthy weight is also important. I’m also going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to rule out any other underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your fatigue. We’ll get the results back within a few days. I’ll also give you a handout with information about sleep hygiene and strategies to improve your sleep quality. It covers things like creating a relaxing bedtime routine, limiting screen time before bed, and ensuring a dark, quiet, and cool sleeping environment. Alright, I'm sending the prescriptions to your pharmacy now. And I’ll print out the referral to the sleep center and the sleep hygiene handout for you. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate your kindness and patience. I feel much better just knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. Thank you again for your help. I'll schedule the sleep study as soon as possible and try to follow your recommendations. Hopefully, we can get to the bottom of this and I can finally get a good night’s sleep. I appreciate your time, Doctor Paulino.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. I’m glad I could help. Remember, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact my office. I wish you all the best with the sleep study. Hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon. Have a good day, Mr. Paske.
