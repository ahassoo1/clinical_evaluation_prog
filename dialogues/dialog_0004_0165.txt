DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brege. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… this fever. Keeps coming back. It's been a pain, honestly. Feels like it shows up every other week now.
DOCTOR: Okay. A recurring fever, you say. Every other week. Can you tell me more about this fever?
PATIENT: Well, it usually starts with chills, then I just feel hot. Real hot. I get tired, achy… like the flu, but it doesn’t stay like the flu, you know? It goes away after a couple days, then… boom. Back again. It’s been happening since… oh, I dunno, maybe June? Hard to keep track, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Since June, alright. And you said it feels like the flu, but doesn’t last as long. How high would you say your temperature gets when you have a fever?
PATIENT: Honestly, I haven't been taking it regularly. My wife usually does that, and she's at a bingo tournament this week. But I'd say… probably around 101, 102 when it's bad. Maybe a little higher? I feel pretty miserable, that's for sure. It's just… annoying more than anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, roughly 101 to 102 when you're feeling the worst of it. And it's been consistently recurring since June. Now, aside from the fever and aches, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No cough. No runny nose. No… diarrhea or anything like that. I have been sweating a lot more, even when I don't have the fever. Just… clammy, you know? And I've been a little… tired, but I'm 65, Doctor. I'm always a little tired. It's hard to say what's normal anymore.
DOCTOR: Sweating and fatigue. Right. It's good you recognize what's new for you. Have you experienced any weight loss recently, Mr. Brege?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Nah, not really. Maybe a pound or two, but my wife makes good food, I ain't missin' meals! I think my pants might be a little looser, but that's probably just… old age, you know? Everything's startin' to sag.
DOCTOR: I understand. Let’s move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any long-term medical conditions – diabetes, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not really. High blood pressure, the doctor told me a few years back, but it's been under control with… well, I take a little pill for it, but it ain't bad. Besides that, just the usual aches and pains of gettin' older. Nothing serious, never needed anything major.
DOCTOR: Alright, high blood pressure, managed with medication. Good. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Just my appendix when I was a kid. That’s it. Nothing since. Oh, and I had a mole removed from my back a while back, but that wasn't a big deal, the doctor said it was nothing.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy as a child, mole removal. And your family – do you have any history of serious illnesses in your immediate family – parents, siblings?
PATIENT: My mom had… arthritis, real bad in her knees. Dad… he had a heart attack when he was older. My brother's okay, as far as I know. We don't talk much anymore. Just the usual stuff, you know? Nobody with anything… strange, or contagious, or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any problems with allergies, thankfully. My wife’s the one with all the sniffles and sneezes. I’m pretty tough, Doctor. Can handle most things.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure pill. That's it. And some vitamins, you know, the usual stuff. Nothing fancy. Fish oil, vitamin D… my wife keeps me stocked up. Nothing that would cause any trouble, I'm sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to ask you a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife hates 'em. And she's got a pretty strong personality, so… that's probably for the best. I drink… a little beer sometimes, with dinner. Nothing crazy, just a couple.
DOCTOR: Alright. A couple of beers with dinner. And do you work, or are you retired?
PATIENT: Retired. Been retired for… oh, must be fifteen years now. Used to be a chiropractor, myself. Funny, huh? Now I’m the patient. But mostly I just… putter around the house, help my wife with things. Keep busy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your temperature, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Let’s get this over with. I got a bingo tournament to get back to, you know? My wife’s countin' on me.
DOCTOR: Temperature is 101.2 Fahrenheit. Heart rate is 78 beats per minute, regular rhythm. Blood pressure is 130/80. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears appear normal. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. No apparent signs of acute illness on initial examination. I will need to order some blood work to investigate this recurring fever.
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work, huh? Alright, whatever you think is best. How long is that gonna take? And will I have to come back another day? I really don’t wanna miss bingo again.
DOCTOR: The lab work should take a couple of days to process, Mr. Brege. You’ll need to come back for a follow-up appointment once the results are in. I’ll have the receptionist schedule that for you before you leave. We need to rule out some potential causes for this recurring fever, and blood work is the best first step. It’s important, even if it means missing a bingo game. It could be something simple, or it could be something that needs attention sooner rather than later.
PATIENT: Fine. Okay, fine. Blood work. Follow-up. Whatever. Just… get it done quickly, alright? My wife will kill me if I miss another tournament. And if it's somethin' serious... well, I don't even wanna think about that right now. Just let me know when and where to go for the blood work, Doctor. I wanna get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a few inflammatory markers to start. The receptionist will give you the requisition form and directions to the lab. Please fast for 12 hours before the blood draw. I understand your concern, Mr. Brege. We'll get these results back as quickly as possible. In the meantime, if your fever spikes above 103 degrees, or if you develop any new symptoms like severe headache, shortness of breath, or confusion, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah. Fast for 12 hours, emergency room if it gets bad. Got it. Look, can I go now? My wife's probably already thinkin' I ran off with a younger woman. .
DOCTOR: Yes, you can go now. The receptionist will schedule your follow-up appointment as you leave. Thank you for your patience, Mr. Brege. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
