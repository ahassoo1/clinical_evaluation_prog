DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Trendler, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, it’s about my… appearance. Not happy with it, you see. Been this way a while now, and I’d like it fixed. Quickly, if possible. Don't have all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're not happy with your appearance and would like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. Can you tell me a little more specifically what’s bothering you?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Really, doctor? You need me to tell you? Look at me! I'm… shrinking. Like a prunes in the sun. Everything’s going downwards, and inwards. Used to be a strong man, you know. Pile driving is hard work. Now… … this. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. You’re concerned about a loss of muscle mass and overall stature, and that it's impacting how you feel about yourself. And it sounds like this has been happening gradually over time. Just to get a better understanding, has anything specific changed recently that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Contributing? No! Nothing’s changed. Life changes, doctor. Getting old changes things. You think I haven't noticed? I'm 76! What do you take me for? Everything goes downhill eventually. It’s just… faster than I’d like, that’s all. And unsightly. Very unsightly.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. You're experiencing changes consistent with aging, and you'd like to address them. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit about your typical day?
PATIENT: Typical day? What’s to tell? I wake up. I eat. I try to keep the house tidy. I mostly sit, to be honest. No more pile driving, obviously. Bad for the back, they said. And it’s not like anyone needs a pile driver operator anymore. Everything’s done with machines now. Mostly just… exist. Not much to tell, really. A waste of a good frame, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a relatively sedentary lifestyle, and you’ve stopped physically demanding work. And you mentioned your back isn’t what it used to be. Do you have any trouble with your appetite?
PATIENT: Trouble? No. I eat plenty. Just… don't seem to stay with me, if you understand. Food goes in, disappears. Never used to be like that. Used to be able to eat a whole chicken and not think twice. Now… … it’s all air. And worry. Mostly worry.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re eating normally, but not feeling as satisfied as you used to, and you've noticed some weight loss alongside this. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Let me think... …Well, I get tired easy. Really easy. Even walking to the mailbox feels like a marathon these days. And my bones… ache sometimes. Especially when it’s cold. But everyone aches when they get old, don’t they? It’s just…more noticeable now, I suppose. A constant reminder. A constant reminder of… well, you know. It’s depressing, doctor. Really depressing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue, bone aches, especially in cold weather, and you’re understandably feeling down about these changes. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any existing health conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Health conditions? … I had a touch of the flu a few years back, but that’s about it. Nothing serious. High blood pressure, they said, but they gave me a little pill for that. Take it every morning. Been taking it for…oh, must be ten years now. Aside from that, I was a strong, healthy man. Always been a strong, healthy man. Until recently, of course. This shrinking… it’s what worries me. More than the aches, more than the tiredness. It's… unbecoming. Frankly. .
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication for about ten years. And you’re generally feeling unwell. And just to be thorough, are you currently taking any other medications or supplements?
