DOCTOR: Hi Brando, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Maskal. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, well… something about a check-up? For… a performance, I think. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. I do a lot of ushering and ticket-taking, mostly. Not much performing, if that makes sense. They just said I needed to be cleared. I’d like to get this over with quickly, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Of course, Brando. No problem at all. It sounds like this check-up is for a work requirement, which is perfectly fine. Just to clarify, is this for a new position, or a continuation of something you’ve been doing for a while?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I… really don’t remember. It feels like it's been a while since anything new started. Probably a continuation. I’ve been at the theater for… oh, goodness, decades. Yes, decades. But things blur together after a while, you know? I mostly just want to make sure I’m still able to… stand for long periods, I suppose. That’s what they need, isn’t it? Standing and… directing people.
DOCTOR: Yes, standing and directing people sounds right. Okay, Brando, let's start with a quick run-down of your medical history. Have you seen a doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Regularly…? Not… particularly. I try to avoid it, if I’m honest. Never been one for hospitals or doctors. A little ache or pain, I usually just… rest it off. My ex-wife, she was always the one who insisted on check-ups. I haven't really kept up with it since… well, you can imagine. A long time ago. Is this important? Will it take long?
DOCTOR: It’s okay, Brando, no judgment at all. It’s good you’re here now. Knowing your history helps me get a better picture of your overall health. We'll try to make this as quick and painless as possible. Let’s start with allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I’m aware of. I eat… most things. Maybe a little sensitive to shellfish, once in a very, very long time, but nothing serious. I’ve never had a really bad reaction to anything, not that I recall. I think I'm alright, Doctor. Truly. Is that alright? Do you need me to think harder?
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Brando. No need to strain yourself. So, no known allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't like taking pills. Never have. A little tea sometimes, for a cough, but that’s it. Just plain tea, nothing fancy. And sometimes… a little ginger ale for my stomach. But those aren’t… medicines, are they? I really try to avoid anything the doctor would prescribe. It’s just… I don't trust them, if you understand. Makes me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: I understand, Brando. No medications currently. Okay, let's move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions, like heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking things I really can’t remember. My ex-wife handled all that paperwork. I think… maybe a little something with my blood pressure, years ago? But it was very mild, she said. Nothing to worry about. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve been quite healthy. Always been a slim build, you see. I walk a lot, with my job. Directing people around… keeps me active. It’s just… the memory isn't what it used to be. Sorry. Is this important for the theater thing?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Brando, don’t worry about it. It’s helpful to know anything you do remember, but we can work with what you have. So, potentially some mild blood pressure issues in the past. Did you ever have any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. I think… I had my tonsils out when I was a child. A very long time ago. And… oh yes, a minor operation on my knee, decades ago, after a silly fall. Nothing serious. Just a quick procedure. And… that’s it, I believe. No major hospital stays. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. I avoid accidents. Mostly. Is this taking much longer, Doctor? I have a performance to… oversee, later.
DOCTOR: No, not much longer, Brando. Just a few more questions, then we can do a quick physical exam. So, tonsils removed as a child and a minor knee surgery. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are your parents or siblings still living?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a difficult question. My parents… they’re both gone now. A very long time ago. And I… I don’t have any siblings. I was an only child. It was… a quiet upbringing. We didn’t talk much about… family history. My mother… she wasn’t one for sharing. And I… well, I haven’t thought about it much over the years. Sorry. I’m not much help on that front, am I? Is that okay? Should I try harder to remember?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Brando. No need to apologize. It’s not always easy to remember family history, and it’s okay if you don’t have that information. Let’s move on to your social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not. Never have. Never will. I’ve always been a very… temperate person. A little tea, as I mentioned, but that’s it. And water, of course. Lots of water. Alcohol… it makes me feel unwell. And the others… well, I wouldn’t dream of it. A quiet life is the best life, Doctor. A very quiet life. Is this… nearly finished? I feel a little lightheaded, honestly. Perhaps it’s the questions.
DOCTOR: Yes, almost finished, Brando. Just a quick physical exam, and then we can discuss everything. I apologize if the questions are making you feel lightheaded. It's just to get a complete picture. Okay, let’s start with your height and weight. I see here you are 199 centimeters and 118 kilograms. Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, goodness. That… sounds about right, I suppose. I am rather tall, you see. Always have been. And… yes, I haven't been as careful with my diet lately. But I walk a lot! Directing people, it's surprisingly strenuous. I suppose the numbers are accurate, Doctor. But perhaps a little… generous? Is that alright? I don't really pay attention to such things.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Brando. We can double-check if you'd like. Now, can I listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Oh… must you? It makes me a little anxious, all that… listening. But… alright. If you must. Just be quick, please. And gentle. It feels… invasive, somehow. I prefer not to know what’s going on inside. I trust you, of course, Doctor. But still… a little unnerving. Please tell me if anything is… wrong, but also, please don’t dwell on it, if you understand?
DOCTOR: Of course, Brando. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, and then check your blood pressure. Take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, although a little fast. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140/90. That’s slightly elevated.
PATIENT: Oh. Elevated, you say? Is that… bad? I told you I walk a lot! Perhaps it’s the excitement of the performance. Or the questions. This has been… quite a stressful experience, honestly. Do I need to worry? Should I rest? I really do need to oversee things later. Is this going to affect my ability to… direct people? It’s very important work, you know. I have a reputation to uphold. And the theater… well, it wouldn’t be the same without me.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Brando. Slightly elevated blood pressure isn't necessarily cause for immediate alarm, but it's something we should keep an eye on. Given your history and the stress you've been under today, it could be a temporary spike. Because you haven't seen a doctor regularly and you have slightly elevated blood pressure, I recommend a few things. First, let's try to manage your stress levels. Second, I'd like you to monitor your blood pressure at home for a week. I can arrange for a machine to be delivered. And third, given your age and blood pressure, I think it would be wise to get some basic blood work done to rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh. Blood work… a machine… more tests… It seems… a lot. But alright, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary. I just want to get back to my work. And not cause any trouble. A machine… at home…? Will it be difficult to operate? I'm not very good with… technology. And the blood work… will it hurt? I really dislike needles. But… alright. If it means I can continue directing people… and keep the theater running smoothly… then yes. Please, just make it as quick and painless as possible. And please, don't dwell on the results, if you understand. I prefer not to know too much. Just tell me if I’m fit to work, alright? That’s all I need. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Yes, Brando, that’s absolutely possible. We'll keep it as quick and painless as possible. The blood work is just a routine check, and the machine for your blood pressure is very simple to use. I'll have a nurse explain everything to you before you leave. I'll order the blood work now and arrange for the nurse to come in and show you how to use the blood pressure machine. For now, try to get some rest and reduce your stress levels. Based on what we’ve discussed today, and knowing your level of activity, I don’t see any reason why you can’t continue working. But it's important to monitor your blood pressure and get the blood work done, just to be safe. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That… sounds alright. Monitoring… blood work… as long as I can continue working. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve… been very patient with me. Despite all my… forgetfulness and anxiety. I appreciate it. Is that all? Can I… go now? I really must oversee things. The performance… it’s very important. And I have a reputation to uphold. Please, just tell me when the nurse will be here. And… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. .
DOCTOR: Yes, Brando, you’re all set. The nurse will be in shortly to explain everything. Take it easy, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. And Brando, thank you for coming in. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
