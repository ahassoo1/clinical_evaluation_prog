DOCTOR: Right. Well, Triana, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s been… a disaster. I’ve been dealing with this… problem for weeks now. Weeks! And nothing seems to help. I’ve tried everything the drugstore has, and it just… keeps happening. It's embarrassing to even talk about, really.
DOCTOR: “Drugstore remedies,” hmm?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t need a lecture on proper healthcare, okay? I work with my hands. Painting, you know? I can’t exactly be running to specialists every time my stomach acts up. I just need something to stop it. It’s interfering with my job, and frankly, it's just… unpleasant. I thought I could handle it, but it’s not getting better.
DOCTOR: Right, right. “Interfering with your job.” So, this… “problem,” can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? It’s… diarrhea. A lot of it. And it's not just a little rumbling, it’s… explosive. Okay? I’ve had it on and off for nearly a month, and it just won’t quit. I’ve tried those things for upset stomachs, the bismuth stuff, and… I don’t know, charcoal tablets, something like that. Nothing touches it. It just keeps going, and going, and going. I’m exhausted from it, honestly.
DOCTOR: "Explosive diarrhea" for a month… and you’ve self-treated. Any fever?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Not that I've noticed. I mean, I haven't been taking my temperature, if that's what you mean. I just… feel weak, tired. And really, really annoyed. I don't sit around taking temperatures when I've got work to do. Is this going to take long? I've got a deadline on a job, and I really can't be here all day.
DOCTOR: Weakness and tiredness… alright. Any blood in the stool?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? You have to ask these things? Look, I’m not going to inspect every… detail. No, I haven’t looked for blood, if that’s what you want to know. It's… unpleasant enough as it is. I just know it’s a lot, and it’s not stopping. I’m a painter, not a doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it's important information. Have you noticed any cramping, nausea, or vomiting alongside this… issue?
PATIENT: Cramping, yes. A lot of it, actually. That’s part of why it's so hard to work. Makes it difficult to even stand up straight sometimes. Nausea, sometimes. Not usually vomiting, thankfully. Just… a general feeling of being awful. Honestly, it feels like something I ate, but I haven’t changed my diet or anything. Which is why I don’t understand what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any recent travel?
PATIENT: Travel? No. I haven’t left town in months. I told you, I’ve been working. I'm trying to get this job finished. I don't have time for vacations. Are we getting anywhere with this or are we just going to keep asking pointless questions?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's move on. What about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, not much. I’m generally healthy. I mean, I work hard, eat okay, don’t smoke or drink much. Had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing major. I was widowed a few years back, if that's what you're looking for, but that wasn’t exactly a health issue. I have private insurance, if that matters. I’m not one for doctors usually, as you can probably tell.
DOCTOR: Widowed… alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. Like I said, I don't really take medication. A pain reliever now and then, maybe, but nothing regular. This is getting ridiculous. Can't you just give me something to stop this? I'm losing money every day I'm stuck dealing with this.
DOCTOR: Look, I need to understand the full picture before I can just give you something. Okay?
PATIENT: Fine. But hurry it up. I have a deadline. Look, I haven't been sick like this in years. I'm normally very regular, if you want to know. This is completely out of character for me. It started a few weeks ago, just a little bit of discomfort, and then it got worse and worse. I really think it might be something I ate, but I can't figure out what. I eat pretty much the same things all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick abdominal exam. Just lie down on the table and I'll listen to your stomach. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Ugh, really? Do I have to? I'm not comfortable with that. Can’t you just prescribe something? I’m a grown woman, I can tell you what’s wrong with me. I’ve got diarrhea, badly, and it’s not going away. I don't need someone poking around my stomach.
DOCTOR: Look, I need to examine you to rule out anything serious. It's part of my job, and it’s for your benefit. If you refuse, I can't properly assess your condition and provide appropriate treatment. I understand your discomfort, but this is non-negotiable.
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. And don't expect me to be comfortable. Honestly, this whole thing is just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay. Bowel sounds are a little… active. Some tenderness down here, but nothing alarming. I'm going to check your temperature and blood pressure now.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. Honestly, you're making me more anxious just poking around. It’s not like I need a detailed diagnosis, I just need something to stop it. I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Temperature and blood pressure are normal. Given your symptoms, the duration, and the lack of fever or other serious signs, it's likely a case of acute gastroenteritis – probably viral. It should resolve on its own, but it's unpleasant. We can rule out anything more serious with a stool sample, just to be safe.
PATIENT: A stool sample? Seriously? You want me to… do that? Look, I already told you, I’m a painter. I don’t have time for… that. Can’t you just give me something to calm my stomach down? Something to stop the… everything? I’m really starting to regret coming here.
DOCTOR: Look, a stool sample is standard procedure. It helps rule out bacterial infections or parasites. But fine. We can try symptomatic treatment. I'm going to prescribe you loperamide – that's Imodium – to help slow things down. And plenty of fluids – electrolyte solutions are best. Avoid dairy, greasy foods, and caffeine for a few days. But if your symptoms worsen – fever develops, you see blood in your stool, or you become severely dehydrated – you need to come back immediately, or go to the emergency room. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine. Loperamide. I'll look it up. And I'll try to drink more water, though it’s not easy when you're running to the bathroom every ten minutes. Look, just… write down the instructions clearly. And I really hope this works. I've got a deadline, and I'm losing money with every hour I’m out of commission.
DOCTOR: Here you are. Loperamide, 2 capsules initially, then 1 capsule after each loose stool, up to a maximum of 8 capsules per day. Drink plenty of fluids. Avoid dairy, greasy foods, and caffeine. If your symptoms don’t improve within 48 hours, or if they worsen, come back immediately. I also recommend a bland diet – toast, crackers, bananas, rice. And try to get some rest. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you. I guess. I’ll be going now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get well soon. And please, don't hesitate to come back if things don’t improve. .
PATIENT: .
