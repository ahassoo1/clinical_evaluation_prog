DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Calvery, welcome. I'm Dr. Batara. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Batara, was it? Yes, well… honestly, I’m not entirely sure. My daughter, she insisted. Said I should get “checked out.” You know how they are. Always fussing. It's just… curiosity, I suppose. Though, I feel perfectly fine. Perfectly.
DOCTOR: “Perfectly fine,” you say. Well, that’s good to hear, of course. But even people who feel perfectly fine often have things going on that are worth looking into. Your daughter sounds… attentive. Let’s start with this “checking out” – is there anything specific she mentioned she was worried about?
PATIENT: Specific? No, not really. Just… general health, I think. She worries about my memory, mostly. Honestly, it is a bit… patchy these days. Not that I need reminding of everything, mind you. I was a surgical tech for… oh, goodness, decades! I saw everything. Though, recalling what I had for breakfast this morning… that’s another story. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Patchy memory, you say. And a long career as a surgical tech – that’s good background information. It can be helpful, knowing what someone’s been exposed to, and what their baseline is. We’ll definitely want to explore that a little further. Now, aside from the memory, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Let me think… Well, I get tired easier, I suppose. Not like I’m bedridden or anything. Just… a bit more of a nap in the afternoons than I used to. And my hands… they tremble a little sometimes. But that could be the age, right? My mother’s hands were shaky when she got old. It runs in the family. Nothing to get worked up over, I'm sure.
DOCTOR: Tremors and increased fatigue… okay. Family history is important, certainly, but we still need to determine if these are just age-related, or something we should investigate further. Now, tell me about these tremors. Do they happen with activity?
PATIENT: Activity? Well… sometimes when I’m trying to button my coat, or… pouring tea. Small things, really. Not like when I was assisting in surgery, I could hold a scalpel steady as a rock. This is just a little… quiver. And it doesn’t happen all the time. Mostly when I'm… concentrating, perhaps? It's very subtle, Doctor. You probably wouldn’t even notice it.
DOCTOR: Subtle tremors can still be significant, Mrs. Calvery. We’ll take a closer look. Now, let's move on to your fatigue. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes. Some days I feel… quite sprightly, actually. I can potter around the garden for hours. Other days… I just feel drained. Like my batteries are flat. And I need a little… doze. It’s not like a proper sleep, more of a… rest. It’s hard to explain. I just don’t have the energy some days. It started… oh, maybe six months ago? I don't keep track of such things.
DOCTOR: Six months ago, that’s useful information. Let’s talk about other systems in your body, just to get a full picture. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite is… normal, I suppose. I enjoy my food. Though, I haven’t been cooking as much lately. Too much effort. I mostly eat… simple things. Soup, toast, things like that. As for weight… well, I’ve probably gained a few pounds, haven't I? But who hasn't these days? It’s nothing dramatic, Doctor. I'm not obese or anything. Just… a little fuller around the middle. It's probably the inactivity.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… oh dear. Is that really necessary, Doctor? It’s… private, isn’t it? Let’s just say they are… regular enough. No problems there. Honestly, I don't think it’s important. I'm not having any… issues, if you must know. Can we talk about something else now? This is all a bit… intrusive.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mrs. Calvery, but these questions are important for a thorough assessment. Changes in bowel habits can be indicative of underlying issues. I'm not trying to be intrusive, merely comprehensive. But alright, we can move on. Have you experienced any dizziness or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Dizziness? Hmm… not really. I might feel a little lightheaded if I stand up too quickly, but that happens to everyone, doesn’t it? As for vision… well, it’s not as sharp as it used to be, naturally. I need reading glasses. But I’ve had those for years. Nothing new there. Honestly, Doctor, I feel perfectly well. Perfectly. My daughter just worries too much.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Calvery, I appreciate you telling me you feel perfectly well. However, you have mentioned several symptoms – tremors, fatigue, a patchy memory, and some changes in your vision – that warrant further investigation. I’d like to perform a brief neurological exam, and order some routine blood work to check your thyroid levels, vitamin levels, and rule out any other potential causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A neurological exam? Blood work? Is something seriously wrong, Doctor? My daughter didn't say anything about exams and blood. She just said a “check-up”. I… I don’t like the sound of this at all. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite anxious. I think… I think I might just go home now. I’m sure it’s nothing. It’s probably just old age. .
DOCTOR: Mrs. Calvery, please. Let’s not jump to conclusions. A neurological exam is a simple assessment of your reflexes, balance, and coordination. It’s not an indication of anything serious, just a precaution. And the blood work is standard procedure. It will help us determine if there is a simple explanation for your symptoms, or if further investigation is needed. I understand your anxiety, but avoiding testing won’t make anything better. It's far better to be proactive and rule things out. We can take things slowly, and I will explain everything as we go. Let’s start with the exam, and then we can discuss the blood work. It will take only a few minutes. Would you be willing to do that?
