DOCTOR: Hi Jacquille, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, hello Doctor. Well, to be frank, my wife insisted. She's a bit…overly cautious, you see. I just wanted to get checked for…that HIV thing. Just to keep her happy, really. Though I highly doubt it's necessary.
DOCTOR: Hmm, alright. So, just to be clear, you're here today primarily for an HIV test, at the request of your wife?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Though, I should add, I’m quite careful. Very careful. I wouldn’t…you know. It’s probably just a waste of everyone’s time, but she’s been on at me for weeks. Honestly, the worry some people have.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you're getting it checked out for peace of mind, even if you feel it’s unlikely. We want to make sure everything is alright, and it's always better to be safe. Before we proceed with the test, let me ask a few questions, just to get a better understanding of things. This is all confidential, of course. Have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections diagnosed in the past?
PATIENT: Good. Confidential is…important. No, absolutely not. Never. I told you, I'm careful. My wife asks a lot of questions, but I assure you, there’s nothing to…find. It's just her nerves, you see. She worries about everything. Honestly, sometimes I think she reads too many articles online.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And have you ever shared needles with anyone, or used intravenous drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! Are you implying something, Doctor? I find that question rather…forward. I've never even seen someone use a needle like that, let alone…share one. Really, this is all quite unnecessary. I'm a married man, a respectable one at that.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions came across as insensitive. I assure you, I'm not implying anything. I have to ask these questions as part of a standard assessment for HIV risk, regardless of anyone’s personal beliefs or behaviors. It's just protocol. Let’s move on. Have you ever received a blood transfusion?
PATIENT: A blood transfusion? Oh, goodness, no. Not me. I haven’t been that sick. Not even close. I keep quite healthy, you know. I eat well, I exercise… generally take good care of myself. My wife makes sure of that, naturally. Though I still think all this is a bit excessive.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. So, just to confirm, no blood transfusions, no sharing of needles, and no prior sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Precisely. You’re finally getting it. No, no, and absolutely not. My wife will be relieved to hear you're finally understanding the situation. Honestly, the amount of worry some people carry. It’s… exhausting. Can we just get on with the test then, please? The sooner this is over, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright, sounds good. Before we do the test, I just want to quickly ask about any recent illnesses or infections you may have had – even something as simple as a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: A cold? Oh, goodness, I had a bit of a sniffle last winter. Very mild. Barely worth mentioning. My wife insisted I take a week off work, naturally. Said I was looking peaky. A bit of a sore throat, that’s all. Nothing serious, Doctor, absolutely nothing. Honestly, it was just a slight tickle in my throat. Can we please move on now? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild cold last winter. That's good to know. Now, the test itself is a simple blood draw. We'll send the sample to the lab, and it usually takes a few days to get the results back. Would you prefer a call or an email when they are available?
PATIENT: Email is fine. Faster, you see. I don’t really have the time to be on the phone. Just send it to… belanjac@email.com. And please, be discreet. I don’t want my wife knowing the results before I do. She'll only worry more.
DOCTOR: Okay, belanjac@email.com noted. And I assure you, your privacy is of utmost importance. The results will be sent directly to your email address, and no one else will have access to them. Now, let's proceed with the blood draw. If you could just follow me this way…
PATIENT: Fine. Let's get this over with. Honestly, all this fuss over nothing. Though I suppose it will appease my wife. .
