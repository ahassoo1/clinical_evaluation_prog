DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Altine. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get right to it. It’s my stomach. Food… comes back up. It’s unpleasant, obviously. I’ve had it for a few weeks now, maybe longer. Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a good start, Mr. Altine. Thank you for sharing that. When you say "comes back up," could you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Well, what do you mean, "describe"? It goes up my throat! Like... like when you're sick, but not sick sick. Just… the food. Sometimes it’s just a little bit, other times… more substantial. It happens after I eat, usually. Not always right away, sometimes a couple of hours later. It’s just… not right. It’s very disruptive. Do I have to explain every single detail?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. I apologize if I’m asking a lot of questions; it's simply to get a clearer picture of what’s going on so I can best help you. When you say "substantial," about how much food are we talking?
PATIENT: Honestly? It depends on what I ate. A few bites, maybe half a plate. Look, I eat good food. Steak, potatoes… not that rabbit food everyone’s pushing these days. And sometimes, when it comes back up, it's… well, it's a waste of good steak. That’s what bothers me, more than anything. It’s expensive, you know. And it's just… messy. I don't like making a mess. Is that helpful enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, thank you. So, it sounds like you're experiencing regurgitation of food, sometimes shortly after eating and sometimes a couple of hours later, and it's happening with solid foods like steak. Does it happen with liquids as well, or just solids?
PATIENT: Liquids? Not really. Maybe a tiny bit of the sauce, but not the liquid itself. I drink my milk with dinner, no trouble there. I drink coffee in the morning, no problem. It’s the food. Real food. Not some juice or… whatever people are drinking these days. Honestly, I don't pay attention to what other people eat or drink. It’s all nonsense if you ask me. So, it's definitely the solid foods. Is that what you wanted to know? Can we speed this up? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good to know, Mr. Altine. It’s helpful that it’s primarily solids. And I appreciate your patience. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this regurgitation?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? I don’t run a lab in here, doctor. It comes up, alright? It’s… uncomfortable. That’s a symptom, isn’t it? I suppose I feel a little heartburn sometimes, a burning feeling in my chest. But I’ve had that for years. Probably just age. It’s not like it’s new. And, well… I do burp a bit more than I used to, if that counts. But I eat good food, like I said. Good food causes burps. Is that what you want to know? Really, I’m not a complicated case here.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. So, you’ve experienced some heartburn and increased burping alongside the regurgitation. And the heartburn has been present for years. Do you find anything makes the heartburn or regurgitation worse, such as certain foods, lying down, or bending over?
PATIENT: Now you’re asking things. Honestly? Lying down… maybe. Sometimes. If I eat a really big steak, then lie down immediately? Probably not the smartest thing. Bending over… I don’t know. I bend over to tie my shoes, what do you want me to say? Big meals seem to be the problem, mostly. And spicy food. I had some Italian the other day, really good, but… yeah. That didn’t end well. It’s common sense, really. Don’t eat a huge spicy meal and then lie down. Look, I'm not an idiot. Is this going somewhere or are we just cataloging my life choices?
DOCTOR: No, you’re not an idiot, Mr. Altine. We’re gathering information to understand what’s going on. It sounds like larger meals and spicy foods are triggers. Now, have you noticed any weight loss recently, or any difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No! I’ve gained weight, if anything. A good steak puts weight on, you know. And difficulty swallowing? No. I eat my steak just fine. I chew it, I swallow it. It goes down. Sometimes it comes back up, but that’s not difficulty swallowing. It's a different problem entirely. Honestly, are you sure you know what you're doing? This feels like a waste of my time. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Altine. Let's see if we can get to the bottom of this. Given your symptoms – regurgitation of solids, especially after larger or spicy meals, with some heartburn and burping, and no weight loss or difficulty swallowing – it could be a few things. One possibility is gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. Another could be a motility issue with your esophagus. To help narrow it down, I'd like to do a brief physical exam and then discuss some possible next steps, perhaps some imaging or further testing. Would that be alright?
