DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm Dr. Vanochten. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It’s driving me a little crazy, to be honest. Just... really bothersome. I don’t know what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Itchy skin can be very unpleasant. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s all over, really. My arms, my legs, my back… even my stomach. It doesn’t look bad, not really. No rash or anything, just… feels like little ants crawling all the time. It’s worse at night, I think. Makes it hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay, all over, worse at night… and no visible rash. That helps. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I can recall. I’ve been eating pretty much the same things. I haven’t started using any new soaps or lotions, no. Oh! I did change laundry detergents a couple of months ago, maybe around April? It was on sale, a new brand. But I’ve been using it for a while now… I don't know if that could be it.
DOCTOR: Okay, the laundry detergent change is good to know. Do you remember the name of the new detergent?
PATIENT: Oh dear… names aren’t my strong suit. It was… blue, I think? And it said “sensitive skin” right on the bottle. Something about being hypoallergenic. Ugh, I wish I'd paid more attention. It was a big bottle, though. A good deal!
DOCTOR: Alright. A blue, “sensitive skin” detergent. It’s possible that could be contributing. And how long have you been experiencing this itch, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… it started… I'd say maybe two, three months ago? Around the same time as the detergent, actually. It started slowly, just a little bit here and there. Now it’s pretty much constant. It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, about two to three months, coinciding with the new detergent. Now, aside from the itch, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no tiredness, nothing like that. Just the itch. And… well, I’ve been a little more restless at night, because of it, of course. Not sleeping well makes me a little grumpy, I suppose. But other than that, I feel alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms. Let's take a quick look at your skin. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds good. Go right ahead, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your skin looks normal, no rash or anything obvious. I don't see any signs of irritation. The skin feels normal to the touch as well. Let's get a quick medical history. Have you had any major medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I had my gallbladder out many years ago. Maybe… thirty years? And I had a bit of a problem with high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been controlled with medication for years now. Other than that, nothing major. I used to get migraines, but those have mostly stopped as I’ve gotten older. Oh! And I had pneumonia when I was in my fifties, but I recovered fully.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, controlled hypertension, history of migraines and pneumonia. And are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, every morning for my blood pressure. And… sometimes I take Tylenol for aches and pains, but not very often. Maybe once a week, if that. And I take a vitamin D supplement, because my doctor told me my levels were low.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily, occasional Tylenol, and Vitamin D supplement. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to worry about bee stings, but I haven’t been stung in years! I’m pretty lucky, I guess. My mother was allergic to penicillin, but that’s not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And, just to get a full picture, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, my mother had diabetes, Type 2 I think. And my father had heart problems, he had a stroke when he was older. And… my sister has arthritis, pretty bad actually. Other than that, nothing that I can recall. We didn't really talk about medical history much when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: Okay. Diabetes, heart problems, and arthritis in the family. And lastly, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, not at all! Never smoked a day in my life. I used to have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I haven’t had any alcohol in… oh, maybe ten years now. And definitely no recreational drugs. I'm a pretty healthy person, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s good to know. So, it sounds like the itch started around the time you switched laundry detergents, and you haven’t had any other symptoms or changes in your routine. Given the history, my suspicion is that it could be a mild allergic reaction or irritation from the detergent.
PATIENT: That's… actually what I was thinking too. It just seemed so silly! I mean, a laundry detergent? But it is the only thing that changed. So, what do we do about it? Do I need a cream or something? Or stop using it altogether?
DOCTOR: You’re right to think it could be the detergent! It’s certainly the most likely culprit. I recommend stopping the use of the new detergent immediately and switching back to your previous brand. We can try an over-the-counter anti-itch cream, like hydrocortisone 1%, to help relieve the symptoms. If that doesn't improve things within a week, or if the itch worsens, we may need to consider other possibilities, like a mild skin condition or medication side effect. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I can definitely switch back to my old detergent. And I think I have some hydrocortisone cream in the bathroom. I'm willing to try that. It's just so uncomfortable! I really appreciate you listening to me, Doctor. It's nice to have someone take it seriously, even if it's just an itchy skin.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m glad we could discuss it. It’s important to address these things, even if they seem minor. Try the hydrocortisone and the detergent switch, and if you’re not seeing improvement in a week, please call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment. Here's a summary of our discussion and instructions to take home with you. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That's all very clear. Thank you so much for your time, Doctor Vanochten. You've been a great help. I feel much better just knowing what to do.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm glad I could help. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day!
