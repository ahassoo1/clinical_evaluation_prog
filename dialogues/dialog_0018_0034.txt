DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It’s nice to meet you too, Doctor… Stilaire, right? I just… moved here. I think I need to get, like, checked out? It’s all new, so I'm not really sure what I’m supposed to do. I have Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Yes, Emileigh, “Stilaire” is correct. And Medicare is perfectly helpful, thank you. It’s quite alright if you're unsure of the process – many new patients feel that way. Getting "checked out" is a good start. To help me understand what you’d like me to focus on today, could you tell me a little more about what’s been concerning you?
PATIENT: Hmm… concerning? Not really anything specific, I guess. Just… I haven’t seen a doctor in a long time. And my husband thought it was a good idea, since we moved. I work with, like, machines all day… building and fixing stuff. Does that matter? I mostly just want to make sure everything’s okay. I forget things sometimes too, if that’s important.
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible of both of you, Emileigh. Preventative care is always a good idea, especially with a change in location and lifestyle. And yes, your work does matter – building and fixing machines can involve certain physical demands and potential exposures. You mentioned forgetting things. Could you elaborate on that a little?
PATIENT: Um… it’s not like, big things. More like… where I put my keys, or what I was about to say. Little stuff. Sometimes I have trouble remembering names, too, even people I’ve met a few times. It doesn’t happen all the time, though. I just… worry about it sometimes, you know? Is that something a doctor even looks at? I don't want to make a fuss about nothing.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable to bring up, Emileigh. Memory concerns, even if they seem minor, are important to address. We absolutely assess those as part of a general health evaluation. It’s much better to discuss it now than to let it become a larger concern. To get a clearer picture, let’s start with a brief review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I don’t really remember. It was a long time ago, and not a lot happened. I think I broke my arm when I was a kid, but that’s about it. I definitely haven't had any surgeries. I went to the doctor for check-ups before, but I can’t really remember what they did. It was a different doctor, and a different place. Everything’s kind of fuzzy. Does that make things harder? I’m sorry I’m not more helpful.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Emileigh. It’s very common for patients not to recall details from their past medical history, especially if it was some time ago. We can work with what you do remember, and if necessary, we can attempt to obtain records from your previous healthcare providers. Let’s move on to your family history then. Are there any significant illnesses that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Um… my mom had, like, high blood pressure, I think? And my dad… he worked a lot, so he went to the doctor sometimes for work stuff, but I don’t know what for. Nothing serious, as far as I know. My grandma on my mom’s side… she got really old, but I don’t remember what she died of. Everyone on both sides just… got old, mostly. Sorry, I'm really not good at remembering all this. Is it okay if my husband comes in? He's better at remembering things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It’s often difficult to recall such details. And yes, absolutely, your husband is more than welcome to join us – having someone who can help provide information is very helpful. Before we call him in, let's briefly discuss your current medications and any allergies you might have. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s about it. And no allergies that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. I had a rash once when I was a kid, but it wasn’t from food or anything. Just… a rash. I don't take anything regularly, though. Definitely no prescriptions. I haven't needed anything like that.
DOCTOR: Good. No current medications or known allergies is helpful to know. Now, Emileigh, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no! Definitely not. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a year. And I definitely don't do any of… that stuff. I work with machines all day, so I need to be clear-headed. My husband doesn't either, he's really healthy. We mostly just eat dinner and watch TV. It’s pretty quiet.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to hear, Emileigh. A healthy lifestyle is certainly important. Now, let's move on to a brief physical examination. Would you mind stepping on the scale and I’ll check your height and weight?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Sure. Is this going to take long? I have to get back to work later… not that I have anything super important to do, but… my boss likes things done on time.
DOCTOR: No, it won't take long at all, Emileigh. Just a few quick measurements and then we’ll move onto checking your blood pressure and listening to your heart and lungs. Your height is 150 centimeters, and your weight is 82 kilograms. We’ll use those numbers to calculate your Body Mass Index, which gives us a general idea of your overall health. This might feel a little tight on your arm. Just relax, and breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay… I don’t like things tight. Is it going to hurt? I get nervous easily, sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand, Emileigh. It shouldn't hurt at all. It's just a temporary pressure to measure your blood pressure. I’ll make sure it’s not too tight. Just focus on taking slow, deep breaths. Your blood pressure is 138/88 millimeters of mercury. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. I don’t hear any unusual noises. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Do you experience any abdominal pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No… not really. Sometimes I get a little bloated after dinner, but that’s about it. Nothing serious. It goes away pretty quickly. Is everything okay so far? You’re not finding anything bad, are you? I get worried about… everything.
DOCTOR: No, everything seems fine so far, Emileigh. That’s good news. Bloating after dinner is very common and usually not a cause for concern. Based on what you've told me and the preliminary physical exam, I'd like to order a few basic blood tests to get a more complete picture of your health. These tests will check your cholesterol, blood sugar, kidney function, and thyroid levels. They’ll also check for any vitamin deficiencies. Do you have any objections to having blood work done?
PATIENT: Blood work? Oh… um… I don’t really like needles. But if you think it’s important… okay. I guess. Will it hurt a lot? And how long will it take? I really don’t have a lot of free time, as you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Emileigh. Needles aren’t pleasant for anyone. The discomfort is usually very brief – just a quick pinch. It shouldn’t hurt a lot, and it only takes a few minutes to draw the blood. We'll only need a small sample. The lab is just down the hall. I’ll write you a requisition form, and they'll take care of everything. They’re very good at what they do. While you're waiting, I can also discuss some preventative health screenings that might be beneficial for you, such as a mammogram or a Pap smear, depending on your age and medical history. But we can definitely hold off on those for now if you’d prefer. Would you like me to explain those a little further?
PATIENT: Oh… um… no, thank you. That sounds… scary. Just the blood work is fine. I don't really understand any of that other stuff. I just want to make sure I'm healthy, but I don't want anything… complicated. Can I just get the form, please? And then I can go to the lab?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emileigh. Just the blood work is perfectly fine. No need to feel pressured to do anything you’re not comfortable with. Here you go. The lab technician will explain the process to you when you arrive. They're very efficient, and it won't take long. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan to address any concerns. Do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor Stilaire. You were very nice, even though I was… nervous. I hope the blood work is okay. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emileigh. It’s my pleasure. And don't worry about being nervous – it’s perfectly normal. I'm confident everything will be fine. I’ll see you in a few days when the results are back. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
