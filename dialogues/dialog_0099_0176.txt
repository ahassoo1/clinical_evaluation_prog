DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I’m Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… the hiccups. They just won’t stop. It’s been over two days now, and it’s really starting to get to me.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, hm?
PATIENT: Yes! It sounds silly, I know. But it's not just a few little ones. It’s constant. And it’s… exhausting. I haven’t had a proper night's sleep.
DOCTOR: Right. Exhaustion from hiccups. Well, it is unusual for them to last this long. Let's get some details. Tell me, is there anything specific that seems to trigger them?
PATIENT: That’s a good question… honestly, not that I’ve noticed. I tried thinking back – did I eat something weird? Drink too much water? Nothing comes to mind. They just… started. I was actually in the middle of planning the summer festival at the community center when they began. It was a Tuesday, I believe.
DOCTOR: Planning a festival… and hiccups just started?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. I was finalizing the music lineup, making calls, very busy. And then… hic… this. It’s really throwing off my schedule, to be honest. The festival is a big thing for everyone. hic… I need to get this sorted.
DOCTOR: Alright. We need to rule out anything…serious. Have you had any other symptoms along with the hiccups?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… hic… No fever. No pain, not really. Maybe a little bit of heartburn sometimes, but I get that anyway. hic… No dizziness or anything like that. Just… the hiccups. And being really tired. hic… It’s just… irritating. I feel perfectly fine otherwise.
DOCTOR: Okay. And you mentioned heartburn sometimes… Do you take anything for that?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Just over-the-counter stuff. Tums, mostly. Or something similar. Nothing regularly, just when it flares up. hic… I don’t take any other medication, Doctor. Not for anything. And I haven’t been to the hospital in… oh, goodness, it must be ten years. Just a routine check-up, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. hic… I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Food, drugs, pollen… nothing. I used to live very close to the Nile, you know, so lots of dust. Never bothered me. hic… My mother always said I had a strong constitution.
DOCTOR: Right. And family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother lived to be 85, very healthy. She had some arthritis in her later years, but that was it. hic… My father… he died when I was young. Heart problems, I think. But that was a long time ago. hic… No history of… prolonged hiccups, if that’s what you mean. It’s just very unusual.
DOCTOR: Unusual is putting it mildly. Now, let’s have a listen to your chest and abdomen, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. hic… I’m happy to cooperate. Just… I hope you can find something. This is really getting to me. hic… It’s making it hard to think straight.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just lie down on your back, please. And try to relax. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender… no masses. Anything cause you pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not at all. It doesn’t hurt. hic… Just… the hiccups, always the hiccups. It feels… strange, pressing on my stomach while I’m hiccuping, honestly. hic… Like a little vibration. But no pain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Diaphragm feels normal. Your vital signs are stable. Look, Ms. Redeye, sometimes hiccups just… happen. It's often benign. We can try a few things… I'll write you a prescription for Baclofen. It’s a muscle relaxant. May help calm the diaphragm. But frankly, I suspect this will resolve on its own.
PATIENT: Baclofen… okay. hic… A muscle relaxant. Will it make me sleepy? I need to be sharp for the festival. hic… I have a lot to organize. And is there anything else I can do? Any home remedies? I’ve heard about holding your breath, drinking water upside down… hic… I’m willing to try anything.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, those are largely anecdotal. Holding your breath might work temporarily, but it's not a solution. Baclofen can cause drowsiness, yes. Start with a low dose and see how you tolerate it. Honestly, Ms. Redeye, I think you’re getting unduly stressed about this. Try to relax. Get some rest. And if it persists for another week, then we’ll consider further investigation – possibly a referral to a gastroenterologist. But right now, I suspect it’s just a stubborn case of hiccups. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: A week… hic… Okay. A week. I suppose I can try to manage for a week. And I understand you don’t think it’s serious, Doctor. hic… It's just… frustrating. hic… I really appreciate you seeing me, though. And writing the prescription. No, I don’t think I have any other questions right now. Just… a week. I'll try to relax. Thank you again. hic…
DOCTOR: Alright. Get some rest. Goodbye, Ms. Redeye. And try not to worry. It’s just hiccups.
