DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’m having trouble going to the bathroom. It’s… difficult to start, and then it’s not a strong stream, if you understand what I mean. It’s been going on for… oh, maybe a couple of weeks now, getting worse each day.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It’s not embarrassing at all, Ms. Yadao – these things happen, and it's good you're addressing it. So, difficulty starting urination, and a weak stream, for about two weeks, progressively worsening. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, it started slowly. Just taking a moment longer than usual to get going. Now, I really have to push to get anything out. And when it does come, it’s… well, it doesn’t go very far. It feels like it stops and starts. It’s… frustrating, to be honest. And I find myself going more often, but not getting much out each time. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, you’re experiencing hesitancy – difficulty starting – and intermittency, the stopping and starting you described. You’re also noticing increased frequency, but with reduced volume. Have you noticed any pain or burning with urination?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning. It’s not uncomfortable, exactly, just… difficult. And tiring, to be honest, having to push like that. It's more of a struggle than anything. I haven’t seen any blood either, thankfully. It just… doesn’t work like it used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know there’s no pain, burning, or blood. Just the difficulty and intermittency, and the increased effort. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits at all?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Hmm… let me think. Not really, no. Everything’s been… regular, if you want to call it that. Maybe a little constipated lately, but that happens sometimes. I eat a lot of white bread, I suppose. But nothing different than usual, if that makes sense. It's not like I’m straining or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any dribbling after you finish urinating?
PATIENT: Yes! Yes, that happens sometimes. A little bit. I have to… blot a little with the tissue after I'm done. Not a lot, but enough to notice. It's quite annoying, really. I thought it might just be old age, but… I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful information, Ms. Yadao. So we have hesitancy, intermittency, increased frequency with reduced volume, post-void dribbling, and a possible connection to some constipation. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, I have high blood pressure, they told me years ago. I take a pill for it every morning. And… I had my gallbladder removed a long time ago, maybe twenty years ago. Other than that, I think I’m pretty healthy for my age. Oh! And I have arthritis in my knees, but that’s just old age again, I suppose. It doesn’t really bother me too much. Medicare covers everything, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, history of gallbladder removal, and arthritis in the knees. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have it right here in my purse. Ah, here it is. It’s… Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. I’ve been taking it for… oh, goodness, I don’t even remember anymore. A long time. Years, definitely.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril 20mg daily. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything, really. Never had a reaction to anything. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. She used to let me eat anything she found on the floor as a little girl, and I never got sick! But no, no allergies. None at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Now, just to finish up with the history, have you had any previous surgeries besides your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don’t think so. Gallbladder was the only one. Oh! Wait, when I was a little girl, I had my tonsils taken out. But that was so long ago, it doesn’t really count, does it? I was maybe six or seven years old. It was a long time ago, before… well, before a lot of things. No, just those two, I think. Gallbladder and tonsils.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsils and gallbladder removal. Now, one final question before we move on to a quick physical exam. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, I take a Vitamin D supplement. My doctor said my levels were a little low last year, so she told me to take one every day. Just a little chewable one. And… sometimes I take an over-the-counter stool softener if I’m feeling a little… stuck, if you know what I mean. But that's not every day, just when I need it. Nothing else, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so Vitamin D daily and a stool softener as needed. That's very helpful, Ms. Yadao. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. I’ll just listen to your abdomen, and I’ll do a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes. And, if you're comfortable, I’d like to do a digital rectal exam. It’s just a quick check of the prostate to rule out any enlargement, which can sometimes cause these symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh. A… a digital rectal exam? Well… I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… necessary? I mean, I’m a little embarrassed, if you don’t mind me saying so. And… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Yadao. It's perfectly normal to feel a little embarrassed. A digital rectal exam, or DRE, is a quick examination to feel the size and shape of your prostate gland. It can give us valuable information about what might be causing your urinary symptoms. While it’s not the most comfortable exam, it shouldn’t be painful. I’ll explain everything as I go, and we can stop at any time if you’re uncomfortable. It’s often the best way to get a quick initial assessment. If we don’t do it, we’d have to consider further testing, such as a referral to a urologist for more in-depth investigation. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Hmm… Well, I don’t want to have to go to a urologist if I can avoid it. Those specialists always want to do more tests, and I’m not getting any younger for all that poking and prodding. And you said it shouldn’t hurt? Alright. Alright, go ahead. But… be gentle, please. And tell me what you’re doing as you go. And… maybe distract me?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Yadao. I'll be as gentle as possible, and I’ll explain every step. It’s a quick exam, and I'll talk to you throughout to distract you. First, I’ll just have you lie on your side with your knees bent. Then, I’ll apply some lubricant to my gloved finger and gently insert it into your rectum. I’ll be feeling for the size, shape, and texture of your prostate gland. It should only take a minute or two. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds alright. Just… just tell me what you're doing. And… hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. Just relax your muscles as best you can. I’m going to gently insert my finger. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Take a few deep breaths. I’m feeling the prostate now. It feels… slightly enlarged, but not significantly. The texture is smooth, no obvious nodules or irregularities. Okay, that’s enough for now. The exam is complete. It went well, Ms. Yadao. No immediate concerns, but the enlargement is something we should investigate further. I’m noting the findings now.
PATIENT: Oh… enlargement, you say? How enlarged is enlarged? And… what does that mean? Is it serious? Do I need… surgery?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, Ms. Yadao, but it’s something we need to monitor. Prostate enlargement, or benign prostatic hyperplasia – BPH – is common as men age. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong, but it can cause the urinary symptoms you’re experiencing. It’s like a slightly swollen muscle that's pressing on your urethra. The enlargement I felt wasn't dramatic, but it was enough to warrant further investigation. Surgery is rarely the first step. We usually start with lifestyle modifications and medication. Before we go there, however, I’d like to order a simple urine test to rule out any infection or other underlying cause. I will also order a PSA test, which is a blood test to screen for prostate cancer. It’s a routine precaution. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A blood test… and a urine test. That sounds… reasonable. Better than surgery, anyway. So, what do I have to do? Do I have to… collect the urine first thing in the morning? And… how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to be waiting weeks and weeks.
DOCTOR: Good, I'm glad that sounds alright. For the urine test, we'll have you provide a small sample right here in the clinic. It doesn't need to be a first-morning sample, just a clean catch mid-stream is fine. I'll give you instructions and a sterile cup. The blood test can be done right here in the clinic as well, or at any lab convenient for you. Typically, the results take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once I have those results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. We can then discuss lifestyle adjustments and medication options. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… manageable. 3-5 days isn't too bad. And I can do everything right here in the clinic, which is good. Alright. Let's get the tests done, then. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and you’ve put my mind at ease a little. I’ll go do the urine sample now.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Yadao. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns. I’ll get the paperwork started for the blood test, and I’ll send a nurse in to collect the urine sample once you’re finished. Please let me know if you have any questions at all. Take your time, and we’ll get everything sorted out.
