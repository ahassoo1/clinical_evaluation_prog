DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I’m Dr. Havird. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor Havird. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I requested a general wellness check, a lab panel, if you will. I just like to keep tabs on things, make sure everything is running smoothly, you understand. At my age, one doesn’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly understandable. A sensible approach. Alright, so a general wellness check and a lab panel… we can certainly do that. It's good you're proactive. Now, to get started, can you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Well, generally speaking, I’d say I’m quite fit for a man of seventy-four. I still work, you know, construction. Keeps me moving. My wife, bless her heart, always makes sure I eat a good dinner. No major illnesses, thankfully. A few aches and pains, naturally, but nothing that slows me down too much. I have private insurance, so I try to see a doctor regularly, even when I don't feel unwell. Does that answer your question, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Construction, you say?
PATIENT: Indeed. I’ve been doing it for… well, a very long time. Forty years, I believe. It’s honest work, keeps the blood flowing. Though I must admit, it's not as easy as it used to be. Mostly framing and roofing these days, nothing too strenuous. But it’s important to stay active, don’t you agree? It's better than sitting at home, I always say.
DOCTOR: Yes, activity is… good. Have you noticed any specific problems with that activity, though?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a fair question. Let me think… Well, my knees have been a bit creaky lately, especially after a long day on the job. And sometimes, my lower back feels a little stiff, particularly if I’ve been lifting heavier materials. Nothing debilitating, mind you. Just… the usual wear and tear, I suppose. I do try to stretch each evening, my wife insists upon it. I wouldn't say it’s a problem that stops me, but it's certainly something I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Right. So, creaky knees and some lower back stiffness. And you’re stretching… good. Now, beyond the knees and back, are you experiencing any pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, not really. No pain anywhere else, no. Occasionally, a little bit of soreness in my shoulders after a long day, but nothing that a warm bath won’t fix. My hands can get a bit tired, naturally, from gripping tools all day, but that’s to be expected. But no persistent pain, no. I don't suffer from headaches or chest pains or anything like that, thankfully. I feel quite fortunate, actually, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright. No headaches, no chest pain. Just the knees, back, and some occasional shoulder and hand soreness. Do you ever notice any swelling in your joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… That’s a good question. Let me think carefully. Sometimes, yes. After a particularly strenuous day, my knees can get a little puffy, particularly around the kneecap. But it usually goes down overnight with a bit of rest and a cold compress. It’s not constant, not every day. And it’s never anything severe, just… noticeable, you understand? It doesn't limit my movement, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, intermittent swelling in the knees after exertion. Have you ever been officially diagnosed with anything, like arthritis or… anything at all, really?
PATIENT: Well, no, Doctor, not officially diagnosed with anything, no. I’ve seen doctors over the years, of course, for regular check-ups, and the occasional injury. They've mentioned “wear and tear” on my joints, but nothing specific was ever diagnosed. They always just told me to take it easy and use a good liniment. My wife always says I should have gone to a specialist years ago, but I’ve always been one to avoid doctors if I can help it. I’m not one for labels, you see. As long as I can still work and enjoy my life, I’m not overly concerned. But I understand the value of getting a proper assessment, which is why I'm here today, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. No official diagnosis. So, we've got intermittent knee swelling, knees, back and some shoulder/hand soreness. Now, let’s talk about your medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Let me see... Not a great deal, thankfully. I take a low-dose aspirin daily, as recommended by my previous doctor, to help with my heart health. And sometimes, if my knees are particularly sore, I'll take ibuprofen, over-the-counter, of course. But that’s it, really. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. My wife makes me a lot of herbal teas, she swears by them for all sorts of ailments. And I take a multivitamin every morning, just to be on the safe side. Nothing else, Doctor. I don't have any allergies to medications, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Right. Aspirin, ibuprofen as needed, a multivitamin and herbal teas. Any family history of… anything significant?
PATIENT: Yes, let me think. My father, bless his soul, had high blood pressure later in life. And my mother had diabetes, unfortunately. She had to be quite careful with her diet. On my wife’s side, her brother had heart problems, I believe. And her mother had arthritis, quite severe, actually. She was in a wheelchair for the last few years of her life. So, there is a bit of a history of heart issues and arthritis in the family, yes. I try to stay healthy and active to avoid those same problems, of course. But it’s always in the back of my mind.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems and arthritis in the family. Now, how about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, as I mentioned, I work in construction, so I’m on my feet most of the day. I try to eat a balanced diet, mostly home-cooked meals. My wife is a wonderful cook. We don’t smoke, never have. I enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I wouldn’t say I drink heavily. And I don’t do a lot of traveling, mostly stay around home. I enjoy gardening in my spare time, it’s very relaxing. I wouldn’t say I have any particularly bad habits, Doctor. I try to live a simple, healthy life. Is there something specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Just trying to get a complete picture. Gardening... good. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at those knees. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. A thorough assessment is always a good idea. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Please, proceed. I understand it's all part of the process. And I appreciate you taking the time to do a proper examination. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit here on the examination table… good. First, I'm going to take your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur. Nothing alarming at this point. Lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at those knees… There's some crepitus in both knees, and slight swelling. Range of motion is a little limited, particularly with extension. Alright. A little tenderness on the medial joint line of both knees. Not severe, but present. Okay. Now, can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There you are. A little stiff getting up, if I’m honest, but that’s nothing new. My knees always complain a bit when the weather changes. I suppose it's the old age catching up with me. Is there anything specific you’re looking for as I stand? I want to make sure I’m cooperating as best as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: There. A little bit of a limp, perhaps, but nothing too noticeable, I hope. My wife always tells me to slow down, but I’m a bit of a stubborn old man, I’m afraid. Is that sufficient, Doctor? Or would you like me to walk further? I want to make sure you get a good look at my gait.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's sufficient. There is a slight antalgic gait, favoring the right leg. Okay. Alright. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a rheumatoid factor test. That will give us a better idea of what's going on. And I’d also like to order an X-ray of both knees. Just to rule out any structural damage. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. Blood work and an X-ray, yes. I trust your judgment completely. It’s always best to be thorough. I don't mind at all. When do you need me to come back for the results? And is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Perhaps avoiding strenuous activity? Or applying ice to my knees? Just let me know what you recommend.
DOCTOR: Yes. Avoid strenuous activity for now, and ice your knees after any activity. We can schedule a follow-up appointment for a week from today to discuss the results. I’ll have the lab results back by then, and we can review the X-ray images together. In the meantime, I'm prescribing a low-dose anti-inflammatory to help manage the pain. And I'm referring you to a physical therapist. They can teach you some exercises to strengthen your knees and improve your range of motion. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds excellent. Avoiding strenuous activity, ice, anti-inflammatory and a referral to a physical therapist. I appreciate your thoroughness and attention to detail. I will definitely follow your instructions. A week from today for the follow-up appointment is perfect. And I’m happy to see a physical therapist. It sounds like a good plan. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my concerns and for developing a course of action. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I leave? Or any questions you have for me?
DOCTOR: No, I think that covers everything for now. Just… be mindful of your pain levels. And if you experience any sudden swelling or severe pain, please don't hesitate to call the office. Here are your prescription and referral information. The front desk can help you schedule the physical therapy appointment. Alright. We’ll see you next week. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Havird. I appreciate your care and attention. I will be sure to follow your instructions and schedule the physical therapy appointment right away. And I’ll call if anything changes. I look forward to seeing you next week. You have a good day as well. .
DOCTOR: Goodbye.
