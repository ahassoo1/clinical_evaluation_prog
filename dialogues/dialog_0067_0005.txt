DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tkac. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you too. My name is Lennie Tkac. I believe I have an appointment to get cleared for a senior living facility. My daughter, bless her heart, thought it best I have a proper check-up before making any final decisions. Just want to make sure everything is alright, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of your daughter, Mr. Tkac. A pre-placement physical is an excellent idea. It’s good to have a baseline and address anything that might need attention before you transition. Okay, I see here you're 81 years old. And I have your height and weight listed as 6’2” and 183 pounds – is that still accurate?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is quite accurate. Six foot two, and… well, I haven’t weighed myself recently, but 183 sounds about right. I’ve always been a tall man, you see. Comes with being Lakota, I suppose. Do you need a more precise number? I could step on the scale if you’d like.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, Mr. Tkac. 183 pounds is fine. It’s good to know you’re staying consistent. To get started, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, I’ve been… fortunate, I suppose. Never had any serious illnesses, not a one. A few aches and pains, naturally, at my age. My knees bother me some days, and my back isn’t what it used to be, but nothing debilitating. I still manage my bakery, you see. Though I don’t do as much heavy lifting as I once did. Mostly overseeing things now, and making sure the recipes are followed correctly. I've always been careful about what I eat, and I try to stay active, even if it’s just a gentle walk in the mornings.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Tkac. Staying active and involved is so important. And running a bakery sounds lovely! Now, let’s talk a little about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, like diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a one. Never been diagnosed with anything of the sort. My father lived to be a good age, and he was healthy as an ox. I always figured I inherited good genes. Now, I had the flu a few times, of course. And broke my arm when I was a boy, climbing a tree. But those weren’t… conditions, you see? Just childhood things. I’ve had regular check-ups over the years, and my doctor always said my heart was strong and my blood pressure was good. Though I haven’t seen a doctor in… well, perhaps a year now. Things just slipped my mind, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about your family history and past health, Mr. Tkac. It's helpful to have that context. And don’t worry about the gap in appointments – life gets busy. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the broken arm you mentioned?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never been in the hospital for anything else. Never had any surgeries, either. Just the broken arm when I was a young lad, and that was a simple fix. A cast and a bit of time to heal, that was all. I’ve always been a careful man, you see. Tried to avoid any risky situations. I believe in letting younger folks do the daring things. Besides, my mother always said I had nine lives, but I didn't want to test her theory.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Tkac. It sounds like you’ve been very fortunate. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, that’s a fairly easy question. No, I’m not taking any regular medications. Not a one. I don’t believe in relying on pills if I can help it. A good night’s sleep and a healthy diet, that's my prescription. I do take a multivitamin every now and then, just to be on the safe side, you see. And sometimes, if my joints are particularly sore, I'll take an over-the-counter pain reliever, like ibuprofen. But that's only when absolutely necessary. My daughter, bless her heart, keeps urging me to take something for my arthritis, but I haven’t gotten around to it yet.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Just the occasional ibuprofen for joint pain and a multivitamin. And your daughter is suggesting something for arthritis – is that a recent development?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, it is fairly recent. She noticed I was moving a bit slower this past winter, and my hands were a little stiff. She's a very observant girl, my daughter. Always looking out for me. She brought me some cream for my hands and suggested a few different pills, but I haven't tried any of them yet. I told her I’d wait and see if it improved on its own. It seems a bit better now that the weather is warmer, you see. I don't like taking things I don't need.
DOCTOR: That’s understandable, Mr. Tkac. It’s always best to be cautious. And it’s good that things have improved with the warmer weather. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not a one. Never had an allergic reaction in my life. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had any trouble with medications. I’ve always been fortunate that way. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. Though I prefer a simple diet, you see. Nothing too fancy. But I’ve never had to avoid anything because of an allergy. I’ve even been stung by a bee a few times, and I was just fine. A little swelling, that was all.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Mr. Tkac. No known allergies is excellent. Alright, Mr. Tkac, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a better overall picture of your health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I’m happy to cooperate. I haven’t had a proper physical in quite some time, so I’m sure it’s a good idea. Just let me know what you'd like me to do. I’m a simple man, easy to examine, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just hop up on the table for me, that would be great. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 138/82, which is slightly elevated but not overly concerning given your age. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpated. I’m noting some mild crepitus in your wrists and finger joints, consistent with age-related changes, and possibly some early arthritis. There is some limited range of motion, but no significant swelling or redness. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. Good pulses in your feet. No edema noted. Alright, Mr. Tkac. Overall, your exam is quite good for your age. You have some mild crepitus in your joints, which is common, and some limited range of motion. Your heart and lungs sound good, and your abdomen is normal.
PATIENT: That’s a relief to hear, Doctor. I appreciate you being so thorough. I figured my joints weren’t what they used to be, but it’s good to know everything else is functioning properly. It’s always good to have a professional confirm what you suspect, you see. What does this mean for the senior living facility, though? Will my joints be a problem?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Tkac. The crepitus and limited range of motion in your joints aren’t likely to be a problem for entering the facility, but they are something we should address to ensure your comfort and maintain your quality of life. It sounds like you have early signs of osteoarthritis. To get a clearer picture, I’d recommend getting an X-ray of your hands and wrists to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity. We could also discuss some options for managing the symptoms – things like gentle exercise, over-the-counter pain relievers as needed, and potentially referral to a physical therapist. Do you have any concerns about pursuing these options, Mr. Tkac?
PATIENT: An X-ray sounds reasonable, Doctor. If it will give us a clearer picture, I’m happy to have one. I don’t mind a little poking and prodding if it means I can stay comfortable and active. Gentle exercise I can manage, and a bit of pain reliever now and then is fine. I’m not keen on a physical therapist, though, if it means a lot of strenuous activity. I'm an old man, you see. I prefer to take things slow and steady. Is that alright? What about the senior living facility? Will this affect my eligibility?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Tkac. We can tailor the plan to your comfort level. Gentle exercise is key, and we absolutely won't push you beyond your limits with a physical therapist. We can discuss alternative options for managing your joint pain if PT doesn’t seem like the right fit. As for the senior living facility, these mild joint changes shouldn't affect your eligibility. Most facilities are equipped to accommodate residents with varying levels of mobility. However, it’s always a good idea to inform them of your condition so they can provide appropriate support and assistance. I’m happy to provide a summary of your exam and recommendations to the facility, if you’d like. Would you like me to order the X-rays today?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be wonderful. Ordering the X-rays today would be excellent. And yes, please do send a summary of everything to the facility. It would put my daughter’s mind at ease, you see. She worries about me something fierce. Is there anything else I should be concerned about? Anything I need to do to prepare for the X-rays? Or anything I need to avoid? I just want to make sure I do everything right.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will get the orders for the X-rays sent over to the radiology department right away. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. As for preparation, there's nothing specific you need to do. You can wear comfortable clothing, and you’ll just be asked to remove any jewelry or metal objects from your hands and wrists. The procedure is quick and painless. Overall, Mr. Tkac, you’re in good health for your age. These mild joint changes are something we can manage effectively. I’m happy to answer any further questions you may have. Do you have any specific concerns about the facility itself, or anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and put my mind at ease. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I’ll await the call from the radiology department, and I’ll let my daughter know about the X-rays. Thank you again for everything, Doctor Pfennig. You’ve been a great help. I think I’ll head home now and make a cup of tea. It’s been a long morning.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Tkac. It was my pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. And enjoy your tea. Have a wonderful day, Mr. Tkac.
