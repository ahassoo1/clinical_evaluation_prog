DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. It's lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yes, well, I suppose you know why I’m here. My… people told me I needed this clearance before I can get this… thing done. Honestly, a waste of time, but they insisted. It’s about the face, you see. Getting a bit… droopy. Don't see what all the fuss is about, frankly.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So this is a pre-operative clearance for a facial procedure. Just to clarify, is this an elective cosmetic procedure, or is there a medical reason behind it, like vision impairment or difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Elective, of course! What do you take me for? Though, it is getting harder to see my reflection properly, now that things are… shifting. But that's just vanity, I suppose. Not a medical issue. Just want to look presentable. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Orwin. It's perfectly reasonable to want to feel good about your appearance. And it’s good you’re getting a clearance – even elective procedures benefit from a quick check-up. Alright, I see here you’re 81 years old, Norwegian descent, and your height and weight are recorded as 166cm and 125lbs. Do you have any known allergies to medications, or any current medical conditions we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I eat everything. And conditions… well, I’m 81! What doesn’t ache? But nothing… serious. I used to be a terrazzo worker, you know. Hard work. Lots of dust. But that was decades ago. I’ve got private insurance, if that matters. Stop fussing with that machine and just tell me if I’m cleared or not.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Mr. Orwin, it helps me get a complete picture. Okay, no known allergies, and you mentioned a history of working with terrazzo – that’s helpful. To be thorough, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? Let me think… Oh! Yes. A little something for the water retention. Doctor gave it to me a few years back. And… sometimes a pain reliever for my knee. Just when it flares up, you understand. It's nothing regular. Small blue pill, I think. And… that’s it. Don’t bother asking about vitamins, I barely remember what I had for breakfast.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for water retention and a pain reliever for your knee as needed. Do you happen to know the names of those medications, or can you describe the pills to me?
PATIENT: Names? Heavens, no. I leave all that to my daughter. She handles all the… paperwork. The water pill is small, white, and… roundish, I suppose. And the pain reliever… yellow, maybe? It's one of those things. I just take what she gives me. Honestly, I don’t pay attention to details. Are we getting anywhere with this? I’ve got a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. We're getting there. It’s helpful to know even approximate descriptions. Now, could you briefly tell me about any surgeries or serious illnesses you've had in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Appendicitis when I was a young man. That was… a long time ago. And… I had a bit of a problem with my prostate years back, but that was sorted. Nothing major. No heart trouble, no lung problems, no… the usual things old people get. I've always been a sturdy Norwegian, you see. Good genes. Now, can we please wrap this up?
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and a prostate issue, both in the past. That’s good to know. And you’ve had no heart or lung problems. Alright, Mr. Orwin, just a few more quick questions, then we'll do a brief physical exam. Do you have any family history of serious medical conditions – things like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… ugh. My father lived to be 95, stubborn old man. He smoked like a chimney and drank everything. No heart trouble, as far as I know. My mother… she died relatively young, something with her… digestion, I think. And my brother… he wasn’t very healthy, always sickly. But other than that, we’re a pretty sturdy bunch. Now, is this “exam” going to take long? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your father lived to 95, your mother died from a digestive issue, and your brother had health problems. That's helpful. Alright, Mr. Orwin, just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, a check of your blood pressure, and a quick look in your ears and throat. It shouldn't take more than five minutes. After that, we can discuss whether you’re cleared for the procedure. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. But don’t go poking around too much. I haven’t got all day, you know. And try not to make a fuss. Honestly, all this… bother. Just tell me yes or no. That’s all I want. Yes, I’m cleared, or no, I’m not. Stop with the questions!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. I understand. Just a quick exam, and we’ll get you an answer. Okay, your heart sounds regular, lungs are clear, and your blood pressure is 140/90. That's a little elevated, but not drastically so for your age. Now, let me just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Ears look clear, throat is a little dry, but no obvious inflammation. Now, do you have any shortness of breath or chest pain?
PATIENT: No, no shortness of breath. And no chest pain. Though sometimes a little… discomfort, after a heavy meal. But that’s just indigestion. Like my mother. Look, are we done yet? I can feel my lunch getting cold. And I haven’t even told my daughter I'm here! She’ll be frantic. Stop poking around in my mouth!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Everything seems stable, but your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and you mention occasional discomfort after meals. Given your age and the planned procedure, I recommend a quick EKG and a basic metabolic panel to rule out any underlying issues before we clear you. It’s just a precaution, to ensure everything is optimal before proceeding. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An EKG? A what? Look, I told you, I haven’t got time for all this… fuss! I just want a simple “yes” or “no.” If you can’t give me that, I’m leaving. My daughter will have my hide! And frankly, I don't see what a heart test has to do with getting a little… smoothing done on my face. Are you deliberately trying to waste my time? Just tell me if I can have the procedure or not! !
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Orwin. Given your insistence and the potential risks of delaying the procedure due to your schedule, I will provisionally clear you, with the understanding that this is not ideal. However, I strongly recommend you follow up with your primary care physician within one week for a complete check-up, including blood pressure monitoring and an EKG, to ensure your health is optimal. Do you understand?
