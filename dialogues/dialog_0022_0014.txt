DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Hmm… what brings me in… right. Well, my wife, she’s been on me about some… papers. Something about needing them for… well, for time off, I think? Or maybe something to do with… not being able to work? It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. She said something about FMLA, does that ring a bell? I’m Ronnald, by the way. Limtiaco. Though you probably already know that.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Limtiaco, I do. And thank you for clarifying. FMLA, or the Family and Medical Leave Act, often requires documentation from a healthcare provider. It sounds like your wife is being proactive about ensuring you have the support you need. To best assist you with that, and to understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about why you might need time off?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. See, that’s the part that’s… hard to pin down. It’s not one thing, exactly. Just… feeling a bit worn out, I suppose. Tired a lot. And… well, concentrating isn't what it used to be. It’s been going on for a while, I guess. Months, certainly. I still go to work, do my duties… directors work, you know? Religious activities and education. But it takes… more effort. And I forget things. Small things, mostly. Names, appointments… that sort of thing. Is that… does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Limtiaco. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing some gradual changes, and it’s good you're acknowledging them. Feeling tired, having trouble concentrating, and noticing some memory difficulties – those are all things we should explore further. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about the fatigue?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like I’m collapsing or anything. It's more… a constant dragging feeling. Like I’m wading through something thick. Even after a full night’s sleep, I wake up feeling… not refreshed, you see? And it doesn’t really get better with a nap, either. It just… is. It affects my work, of course. It takes me longer to prepare things, to focus on the meetings… sometimes I just… zone out. My wife says I seem more irritable too. I don’t really remember feeling that way, but she’s usually right. She’s a good woman, my wife.
DOCTOR: It sounds like this fatigue is significantly impacting your daily life, and it's good your wife is noticing and supportive. The fact that it's not relieved by sleep is definitely something we want to investigate. Now, you mentioned difficulty with concentration and some memory problems. Could you give me a specific example of those difficulties?
PATIENT: Hmm… a specific example… let me think. Well, just last week, I was preparing a presentation for the elders at the church. A very important one. I had all my notes, everything laid out, but I kept… losing my train of thought. I’d start a sentence, then completely forget what I was going to say. And I had to re-read the same paragraph three or four times just to understand it! And the names… Oh, the names! I’ve known these people for years, but suddenly, I can’t recall their children’s names, or where they live… it's embarrassing, honestly. It doesn’t happen all the time, but it's frequent enough to be worrying. I even forgot where I put my car keys yesterday. Found them in the refrigerator, can you believe it?
DOCTOR: That is concerning, Mr. Limtiaco. Losing your train of thought, difficulty with recall, and misplacing items – those are all things we need to evaluate. And it's good you're aware of these changes. Now, let’s broaden the picture a little. Have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… other changes… Well, I suppose my appetite hasn’t been the greatest lately. Not that I’m not eating, just… not enjoying it as much. Food tastes a bit… bland, you know? And I’ve been sleeping… okay, generally, but I wake up a lot during the night. Not necessarily needing to do anything, just… restless. And, oh! This is something my wife mentioned. She says I’ve been a bit more… quiet. Less interested in things I usually enjoy. Like gardening. I used to spend hours out there, but lately, I just… don’t feel like it. It’s hard to explain. Just… a lack of motivation, I guess. And sometimes, I feel a bit… down. Not deeply sad, just… a general feeling of… emptiness. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Limtiaco, that is very helpful. Those symptoms – decreased appetite, sleep disturbances, loss of interest in hobbies, and feelings of emptiness – all contribute to a clearer picture. To get a more comprehensive understanding, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Let me see. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… nothing serious. As an adult… I had my appendix removed years ago, that was about it. No heart problems, no diabetes… nothing major, really. I see Dr. Moreau for my annual checkups, but he usually just tells me I’m doing well. Blood pressure is a little high sometimes, he puts me on medication for it, but otherwise… healthy, I suppose. Oh, and my mother… she had some memory problems when she got older. I don’t know exactly what it was, just… she started forgetting things. It was very upsetting. But that was a long time ago. Does that… matter?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. It's good to know about the appendectomy and blood pressure. And yes, your mother’s history of memory problems does matter. It’s important information. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. For my blood pressure, I take… Lisinopril, I think it’s called. A small white pill, once a day. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take Ibuprofen. Just over-the-counter, when I really need it. And… oh! My wife gives me a multivitamin every morning. She says it’s good for me. That’s about it, I think. Nothing else. I try to stay away from too many pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. That’s helpful to know. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Not me. I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, years ago, but I haven’t had a drink in… well, decades. My wife doesn't approve. And smoking? Never touched a cigarette in my life. Too dangerous. And recreational drugs… that’s not my style. I’m a religious man, you see. I keep myself busy with church activities and spending time with my family. That’s enough excitement for me. I'm a pretty simple man, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Limtiaco. Thank you for being so open with me. That information is very helpful. Alright. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Just a quick look at your vitals, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic neurological assessment to check your reflexes and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you need. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m not a fan of… poking and prodding, if you know what I mean. But I want to get to the bottom of this, so do whatever you need to do. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will do my best to make it as comfortable as possible. First, I’ll check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound good. Now, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam. I'm going to check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: There you go. That's easy enough. Though… it's a little harder than it used to be, if I'm being honest. Sometimes, my eyes… wander a bit. Old age, I suppose. But I'm following, Doctor. You just let me know if I'm messing up.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. That’s good to know. I did notice a slight slowness in your eye movements, and a little bit of shaking, which is something we'll want to investigate further. Now, can you please tell me what year it is?
PATIENT: Hmm… the year… oh dear. That’s a good question. Is it… 2023? No, that feels wrong. 2024? No, definitely not. Is it… 2025? Yes, I think it's 2025. August, right? You said August. Yes, 2025, I’m pretty sure. It’s just… the days all seem to blend together these days. I used to have a much better memory for dates.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Limtiaco. That’s alright. It’s not uncommon to have occasional memory lapses. Now, I'm going to check your balance. Could you please stand up and try to balance on one foot for about 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Alright, one foot… hmm. This is… not as easy as it used to be. Whoa there… just a minute. Oh dear. I almost fell. I think my balance isn’t what it used to be. Perhaps you should have a chair nearby?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It's good to know your limits, and safety is our priority. Thank you for trying. Based on what you've told me, and the brief physical exam, I'm concerned about possible cognitive impairment. The fatigue, memory loss, difficulty concentrating, and the changes I observed during the neurological assessment warrant further investigation. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I also recommend a brain scan, such as an MRI or CT scan, to get a better look at your brain structure. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… and a brain scan… yes, that sounds… sensible. I mean, I want to know what’s going on, right? If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then I trust your judgement. A brain scan… that sounds a little scary, to be honest, but if it will help… then yes, let’s do it. What do I need to do? Just let me know. I'm just hoping it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Limtiaco. It's natural to be anxious, but we're just trying to gather information to get to the root of the problem. I’ll order the blood tests, and I'll write you a referral for the brain scan. You'll receive a call from the imaging center to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until we have the results. I also suggest you continue to stay active and engaged in activities you enjoy, as much as you’re able. I’ll also have my nurse go over some resources for cognitive support. It might be helpful to have some information on hand while we wait for the results. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I just… I’m a little worried, to be honest. It’s just… my mother… I don’t want to end up like my mother. But I trust you. I’ll get the tests done. And I’ll… try to stay positive. Thank you, Doctor. Really, thank you. And thank your nurse for the resources. I appreciate it. Is there anything you need from me before I leave?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Limtiaco. I understand your concerns, and we will work through this together. It’s important to remember that we don’t know anything for sure yet. No, I don’t need anything further from you at this time. Just focus on taking care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. I’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. I’ll have the nurse come in to review the paperwork and schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today. Thank you for coming in, Mr. Limtiaco. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes.
PATIENT: .
