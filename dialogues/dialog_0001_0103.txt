DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vankampen, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Thank you. Well, it’s my back. My lower back is… hurting. Been hurting for a little while now, I think. Not real bad all the time, but enough to bother me. It's getting worse, maybe? I don't know. It just… aches.
DOCTOR: A little while now, you say. And it's getting worse…maybe. Right. Okay. Can you tell me a bit more about this ache?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a sharp pain, not like if you fall or something. It's more… dull. Like a heavy feeling. And it feels worse when I stand for a long time, or… when I bend over to pick something up. Sometimes it feels stiff in the mornings, too. It takes a bit to get moving. I used to be able to do so much more, you know? But now… things are harder.
DOCTOR: Stiff in the mornings, worse with standing and bending… Okay. And how long has it been since you noticed this getting worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I’d say… maybe the last three months or so? It started slow, just a little discomfort. I thought it was just getting old, you know? But then it started to really bother me after I helped my daughter move some boxes. Lots of bending, lots of lifting. It just hasn’t felt right since. Do you… need me to be more specific? I’m not good at remembering exact dates.
DOCTOR: Three months, alright. Don’t worry about exact dates. Helped your daughter move boxes… that likely aggravated it. Any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. Just the ache, mostly. Sometimes it goes down my legs a little, but it's not… pins and needles or anything like that. Just feels tired, maybe? Like they’re heavy. Is that…normal? I haven’t been to a doctor in a long time, so I don’t really know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Tired legs… alright. Well, it sounds like you’ve got some lower back pain radiating down your legs. Let's do a quick exam, see how things move. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Okay, yes, I can stand. There we go… a little slow, but I can do it. My knees aren’t what they used to be either, if you need to know. Everything just… hurts a little these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me have you bend forward, slowly, and touch your toes if you can. Don’t push yourself to the point of pain, just go as far as you comfortably can. I’m going to watch your back as you do this.
PATIENT: Oh… woah. That’s… not as easy as it used to be. Nope, can’t quite reach my toes. And it hurts a little when I go down, and even more when I come back up. Is that bad? Everything feels… tight. Like something is stuck.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion, pain with forward flexion… and you mentioned tightness. Let’s try a straight leg raise. Lie down on your back, and I’m going to lift your leg, one at a time. Just tell me if you feel any pain shooting down your leg.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Lie down, you say? Yes, alright. This is… not my favorite position, but I’ll do it. Tell me what to do. And I might need help getting back up afterwards, if you don’t mind. My bones aren’t very strong.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax your leg as I lift it. Tell me right away if you feel any pain down your leg. Not just in your back, specifically the leg. How does that feel?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s okay so far. A little stretch in my hamstring, but not pain. But… wait a second. Oh, there it is. A little… shooting pain down my leg now. Not terrible, but definitely there. Feels… like a zap. Is that what you were looking for? A zap? It’s on the outside of my leg, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Shooting pain, radiating down the outside of the leg… alright. Let's lower your leg slowly. Sounds like you might have some sciatic irritation. Now, let’s see if you have any reflexes or strength issues. Can you gently push your foot against my hand?
PATIENT: Yes, yes I can. Like this? Is that enough? I’m not very strong, Doctor. I haven’t done much these past few years. Is it strong enough? I don’t want to disappoint you.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little weak, but not alarming. We'll need to get some imaging done to get a better look at things, just to rule out anything serious. For now, it seems like a muscle strain or a pinched nerve is the most likely cause. I’m going to order an X-ray of your lower back, and possibly an MRI if the X-ray doesn’t give us enough information.
PATIENT: Oh, imaging, you say? X-ray? MRI? That sounds… serious. Is something really wrong? I just thought it was old age, you know? I don’t want to get any shots if I don’t need them, I don’t like needles. And I don’t have a lot of money for all this… will insurance cover it? I don't have any insurance right now.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Vankampen. We need to rule things out. As for costs… I understand not having insurance. We can explore options, look into assistance programs at the hospital. Let's focus on getting the X-ray done first. We can discuss the financial aspect afterward. I’ll also prescribe you some anti-inflammatory medication to help with the pain and swelling. And I want you to avoid any heavy lifting or bending until we have a better idea of what’s going on. We'll also need to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the imaging. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, anti-inflammatory… that sounds good, maybe. Less pain would be nice. And I will definitely avoid lifting anything heavy, I promise. No more boxes for me! And yes, a follow-up sounds alright. But… could you help me get up? I don’t think I can do it on my own. And… what kind of help is available for the cost? Is it a lot? It worries me.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let me assist you. There we go. Easy does it. As for the costs… our hospital does have a financial assistance program for uninsured patients. We can also explore generic medication options, which are significantly cheaper. I’ll have the receptionist give you some information on how to apply. I'll write you a prescription for naproxen. Take it with food. And again, avoid any strenuous activity. We'll schedule that follow-up appointment when you're ready. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: Naproxen… okay. With food, I can remember that. And I appreciate you helping with the cost, Doctor. That’s a big worry off my mind. Hmm… let me think. Yes, one question. Is this something that will… get worse? Will I end up in a wheelchair? I’ve seen things happen to people. And… will it ever get better? Is there anything I can do to help it, besides the medicine? Like exercises or something? I don't want to just sit around and wait for it to get worse.
DOCTOR: It’s unlikely you’ll end up in a wheelchair, Mr. Vankampen. Most lower back pain resolves with conservative treatment – medication, rest, physical therapy. As for what you can do… gentle stretching and low-impact exercises can help strengthen your back muscles and improve flexibility, but only after the pain subsides a bit. I'll give you a handout with some basic stretches. But don't push yourself. And if the pain worsens, stop immediately. We'll assess your progress at the follow-up, and if needed, refer you to a physical therapist. Here. Read this carefully. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Okay, stretching… gently. And stop if it hurts. I can remember that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything to me. I think that’s all my questions for now. I just hope it gets better. Thank you again, Doctor. And thank you for helping me up. I don't know what I would have done without your help. .
