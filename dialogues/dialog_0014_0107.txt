DOCTOR: Right. So, Mr. Puder, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello. My heart… it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s jumping, but not… hard. Just… fast. It happens and then stops. It’s been happening for maybe one month now.
DOCTOR: "Funny," huh?
PATIENT: Yeah. Not good funny. Like a bird flapping inside. And sometimes I feel… weak when it happens. Not fall-down weak, but… tired. It makes me worry. My wife, she says I should come see you.
DOCTOR: Right. A month now… and this “flapping” feeling. When does it usually happen?
PATIENT: Um… it’s hard to say when. Not when I’m working, not really. Maybe when I’m relaxing? Watching TV, or before I sleep. Sometimes just… nothing special. It just starts. And stops after a little bit. Maybe five minutes? Sometimes longer, maybe ten. I don’t keep good time when I’m worried.
DOCTOR: And does anything seem to bring it on?
PATIENT: No, not that I know. I drink tea, maybe? But I always drink tea. I don't… I don’t smoke, I don't drink coffee. I eat normal food, you know? Rice and… meat, sometimes. Vegetables. Nothing fancy. I’ve not changed anything I do. That’s why I don’t understand it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said “normal food”. Any palpitations after eating?
PATIENT: No, not after eating. It doesn't matter what I eat, just happens sometimes. It’s not tied to food, I think. More when I’m… quiet. When my body is resting. And not when I work hard, no. I lift heavy things at work, everything okay. It’s strange.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what kind of work do you do, exactly?
PATIENT: I work with… chemicals. At the plant. I make sure the machines are running good. Like… filling and emptying tanks. Cleaning things. Not dangerous, I think. We have rules. And I wear gloves and… a mask when I need. Chemical Equipment Operator, that’s what they call it. Been doing it for eight years now. Everything okay there, no problems with the work.
DOCTOR: Right. Chemicals. Eight years. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with this… flapping?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms? Let me think. Sometimes I get… a little short of breath, maybe? When my heart is jumping, I feel like I can't take a big breath. But it goes away when the heart stops. And… I guess I feel a little dizzy sometimes too, but not like I will fall. Just… light-headed. It’s hard to explain. Everything happens so fast.
DOCTOR: Right. Short of breath, lightheaded. Have you had any chest pain at all with this?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Not ever. Just the flapping and the… weak feeling and the short breath. And the light head. No pain. It’s not a squeezing pain, or anything like that. Just… uncomfortable when my heart is fast. Like a bird trapped, you know? I don’t understand why it’s happening. Is it bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Okay, okay. Let's just take a listen, alright?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That sounds good. I hope you can find out what's going on. My wife is very worried about me. I don’t like to worry her, but this… it makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is a little elevated, but that’s probably from talking. Lungs are clear. Nothing immediately alarming. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is… a bit on the lower side. 110/70. Normal, but could be better.
PATIENT: Okay. That’s good to know. Lower side, you say? What does that mean? Is it because of the chemicals? I don’t feel… sick, just the heart. And a little tired sometimes. Is something very wrong? I'm getting a little scared now. My wife… she'll be very worried.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Puder, it’s probably just anxiety. You’re a healthy young man, and you’re worrying yourself sick. These palpitations… they often happen when people are stressed. You work with chemicals, it's a stressful job. It's likely nothing serious. But, to be on the safe side, I'm going to order a basic blood test and an EKG just to rule things out. It’s standard procedure. But I honestly don’t think it's anything to worry about.
PATIENT: Okay… anxiety. Maybe you are right. It is a little bit scary, the job. But I try not to… worry too much. A blood test and EKG… okay. When can I do that? Will they take a long time? And… will it cost much? I don’t have insurance, you see. My wife, she works very hard.
DOCTOR: Look, the lab is right down the hall. Blood test won’t take long, maybe fifteen minutes. EKG, another ten. As for cost… I don't know the exact price. You'll have to ask them directly. It's not expensive, relatively speaking. But, yes, it will cost something. I’ll send the orders over now. And, honestly, try to relax. Worrying is just making things worse. I suspect that's all this is. Here you go. Go down to the lab, and they’ll take care of it. Come back next week, and we'll look at the results. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Okay… relax. Right. I will try. It's hard, when my heart is doing funny things. But I will try. Next week… okay. Thank you, Doctor. No, that is all. Thank you. I hope it is just the worry. .
DOCTOR: Alright. See you next week. Don’t stress.
