DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Knoch, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Johney Knoch. Though most folks just call me Johney. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Doctor… Batara, was it?
DOCTOR: Batara is fine. Though I prefer Pinky. Now, Johney, let’s not waste time with pleasantries. You're 74, and frankly, you look it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Pinky, it’s about the smoking, you see. Been at it a long time – nearly sixty years, I reckon. And I’ve decided, finally, it’s time to try and… well, stop. My sister, bless her soul, she passed last year from something the doctor said was connected to the lungs, and… it got me thinking. I’d like to quit, if that’s possible at my age.
DOCTOR: Sixty years. Goodness. Alright. So, you want my help to quit smoking. Let’s be clear: quitting after six decades isn’t exactly a walk in the park, and your chances of… complications are higher, given your age and history. Have you tried to quit before?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Many times. Patches, gum… even hypnosis, back in the seventies. Nothing stuck for long, I’m afraid. A week, maybe two, and then… back to it. It’s a habit, you see. A very strong habit. And lonely, sometimes. It’s something to do with my hands, I think. I worked in the factory for… well, a very long time. Always fiddling with something. But I'm determined now. More determined than ever.
DOCTOR: A habit. Yes, well, habits are often just a sign of poor willpower, aren’t they?
PATIENT: Now, hold on a moment, Pinky. I wouldn’t say poor willpower. It’s… addictive, you see. The nicotine, it takes hold of you. It’s not simply a matter of wanting to stop. It’s a real struggle. I worked hard my whole life, in the factory, and hard work builds habits, good and bad. It's not about will, it's about… the grip it has on you. And after sixty years, that grip is strong.
DOCTOR: Addiction is a… convenient excuse. Alright, let’s not rehash the psychology of smoking. We need facts. Do you cough?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. A bit, especially in the mornings. Not a terrible cough, mind you. More of a… tickle, really. And it gets worse in the winter, when it’s cold. I always thought it was just the weather. But now… now I'm not so sure. It's been a bit more persistent lately. And I get… short of breath sometimes, walking up the stairs. Nothing dramatic, but noticeable.
DOCTOR: Short of breath, morning cough… predictable. Do you wheeze?
PATIENT: Wheeze? Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t thought about it specifically. Let me think… sometimes, after I’ve been coughing for a bit, there's a sort of… whistling sound. Not all the time, mind you. More when I’m really trying to clear my chest. Like that, perhaps? It's faint, though. Very faint. I always put it down to old age.
DOCTOR: Old age. Convenient again. Alright. Any chest pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. Not chest pain, exactly. But sometimes… a tightness. A sort of… pressure, in the middle of my chest. It doesn't come on with activity, not usually. More when I’m… anxious, perhaps? Or when it’s very cold. It’s not sharp, not like a heart attack, mind you. Just… uncomfortable. It comes and goes, mostly. I never paid it much mind, to be honest.
DOCTOR: You “never paid it much mind.” Right. Let me just take a listen to your lungs. Please, sit up straight and take a deep breath when I tell you to. And don't try to tell me it's "just old age" this time.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Straight as I can be. I’ll try my best not to mention the age. Though it does seem to be the answer to everything these days. And I’ll take a deep breath when you tell me. Ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath… and exhale. Again. Deep breath… and exhale. Hmm. Your breathing is… diminished. Quite a bit of wheezing, even at rest. And some crackles in the lower lobes. We need a chest x-ray. And a pulmonary function test. I'm not ruling anything out at this point, though I suspect this is… advanced COPD, likely exacerbated by your decades of smoking. I'm going to have my nurse draw some blood as well, just to get a baseline.
PATIENT: COPD? Is that… serious, Doctor? I've heard the name, but I don't… I don't know what it means, exactly. And a chest x-ray… will that show something? I’m a bit nervous, to be honest. I just wanted to quit smoking, not… discover something was wrong with my lungs. Will the tests… hurt? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. It means your airways are blocked, making it hard to breathe. Yes, it’s serious. And it’s… common in smokers. The x-ray will show us the extent of the damage to your lungs. The tests won’t hurt. The x-ray is just a picture. The pulmonary function test involves breathing into a tube. It’s… inconvenient. As for results, the x-ray should be back today. The pulmonary function test… a few days. Now, let's not get ahead of ourselves. We don’t know the extent of the damage yet. But you need to understand this is serious, and quitting smoking, while still important, may not undo all the years of harm. My nurse will take you to get the blood work and schedule the imaging. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with any medicine. Though my sister, God rest her soul, she was allergic to penicillin. But that's not me. Just me, Johney Knoch, hoping to breathe a little easier. I appreciate you being honest, Doctor. It's… unsettling to hear all this. But I suppose it's better to know. I'll go see the nurse now. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will explain everything. And Mr. Knoch… try to manage your expectations. .
PATIENT: .
