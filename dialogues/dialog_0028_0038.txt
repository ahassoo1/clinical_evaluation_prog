DOCTOR: Right. Evann Buoniconti. 35 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Memmolo. It’s… a bit difficult to explain, truthfully. I understand this is about planning for… well, for what if something were to happen. A friend suggested I look into these forms – an Advance Directive, or a POLST, she called it. I’m hoping to get something in order, just in case. My memory isn't what it used to be, and I want to be sure my wishes are known.
DOCTOR: Advance care planning… Yes, yes. A sensible, if somewhat…morbid, pursuit. Though, at your age… Still. Look, I have a very full schedule. Let's try to be concise. You said your memory is… unreliable?
PATIENT: That is… a polite way to put it, Doctor. It’s not complete loss, more… fragmented. Important details slip away. I can recall… the feeling of things, sometimes, but specifics… dates, events… they are often hazy. It’s been… unsettling. That’s largely why I want to have this done. I want to ensure my preferences are clear, before… well, before they become even more difficult to articulate.
DOCTOR: Fragmented. Right. And what preferences are we talking about, specifically?
PATIENT: That's... the challenging part, isn't it? It’s not as if I have a detailed list prepared. Mostly, it’s… I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of recovery. No quality of life. But defining “quality of life”… that’s the issue. I’m… I’m not entirely sure how to phrase it. I believe my ex-husband might have some thoughts on the matter, but… our relationship was complicated. I wouldn't necessarily rely on his judgement. Is there a questionnaire, perhaps? Something to guide me?
DOCTOR: A questionnaire… Yes, we have a standard form. It’s rather… broad. It asks about basic things: feeding tubes, ventilation, resuscitation. Let's start with resuscitation. If your heart were to stop, would you want CPR?
PATIENT: CPR… That’s… a difficult question. I suppose… if there was a reasonable chance of recovery, then yes, absolutely. But if it was clear… if the doctors knew there was no hope… then no. I wouldn’t want to be… prolonged unnecessarily. Though, honestly, I don’t know how one would know for certain in that moment. Is there a way to specify… a threshold? A certain level of brain activity, perhaps? I apologize for being so vague. It’s all so confusing.
DOCTOR: Brain activity… We can note your preference for neurological prognosis to be a factor. However, establishing that… accurately… in an emergency situation is not always feasible. We can document “full code” or “do not resuscitate.” Do not resuscitate means no CPR, no intubation, no advanced life support measures. Are you leaning towards… one or the other?
PATIENT: I believe… “do not resuscitate” is… closer to my wishes, yes. If it’s determined that there’s truly no hope. But I don't want to be… hasty. Perhaps a qualified assessment is needed before that decision is made? I understand emergencies happen quickly, but I’d feel better knowing there’s a level of… professional judgement involved before those measures are withheld. It's a difficult thing to contemplate, to be so… definitive.
DOCTOR: Very well. "Do Not Resuscitate" documented. We'll add a note about the need for professional assessment of neurological prognosis. Now, feeding tubes and ventilation. If you were unable to eat or breathe on your own, would you want those measures taken to prolong your life?
PATIENT: That feels even harder to answer. Prolonging life… at what cost? I… I suppose, if it was temporary, a reasonable expectation of recovery, then yes. But if there was no hope… if I was simply existing, without any quality of life… then no. I wouldn’t want to be a burden, either. And I worry about the… the discomfort involved. I vaguely recall my grandmother… it wasn't pleasant. Is there a distinction between those two things? Ventilation versus feeding tubes? Can they be considered separately?
DOCTOR: Yes, they can be considered separately. Ventilation – a breathing machine. Feeding tube – provides nutrition. Both are invasive. We can document “no artificial ventilation” and “no artificial nutrition.” That means you would not want either measure taken. Is that correct?
PATIENT: That… feels quite absolute, doesn’t it? No artificial anything… Perhaps that's too strong. I think… I would want the option of nutrition, if it allowed for some level of comfort, some dignity. If there was no hope of recovery, but it prevented suffering… then yes. But no ventilation, if it's simply prolonging a life without any quality. So, “no artificial ventilation” is certain. But “no artificial nutrition”... I’m not comfortable with that phrasing. Is there a way to say “artificial nutrition only if it provides comfort”? I’m sorry to be so indecisive. It’s all so overwhelming.
DOCTOR: We can note “artificial nutrition for comfort measures only.” It’s… imprecise, but we can add that to the documentation. It’s important to understand that those are guidelines, not absolute mandates. In an emergency situation, the medical team will use their best judgement. Are there any other preferences you would like to document?
PATIENT: That… that’s better, yes. Thank you. I… I believe that covers the most pressing concerns. I don’t recall anything else at the moment. Perhaps… it would be helpful to review this documentation with my ex-husband, just to ensure I haven’t overlooked anything? Although, as I said, his opinion… isn't definitive. But it might give me some peace of mind. Is that possible? Perhaps a copy I could share?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can provide a copy of the documentation. However, I must inform you that I cannot guarantee the validity of any changes made outside of a formal medical setting. And I strongly advise against relying on the opinion of someone who is… not directly involved in your care. Here is the form. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Memmolo. I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your honesty. I will keep your advice in mind. No, that will be all for today. I… I feel much better having addressed this, even if it’s a difficult topic. Thank you again for your patience. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day. .
