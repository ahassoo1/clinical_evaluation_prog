DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. I’m Dr. Vanochten. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been noticing a lump, a mass, in my lower abdomen for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. And how long have you been noticing this lump, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… probably about three months, give or take a week or two. It hasn’t grown a lot, but it definitely hasn’t gone away on its own. It just… is there.
DOCTOR: Alright, three months. And would you describe it as painful at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. It’s not painful to the touch, and I don’t feel any pain in it, if that makes sense. Sometimes, if I’ve been doing a lot of physical activity – I’m a choreographer, so I’m often moving around – I feel a bit of a general ache in my lower stomach, but I don't think that's directly from the lump itself. It's more like muscle soreness.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain directly from the lump, more like generalized muscle soreness with activity. Good to know. And has there been any change in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: That's a good question. No, not that I've noticed. Everything seems pretty regular, if you know what I mean. No constipation, no diarrhea… just normal.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any unintentional weight loss, fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. My weight has been stable, and I haven't felt sick at all – no fever, chills, or anything like that. I’ve been sleeping alright too, no excessive sweating at night. I feel generally healthy, besides this lump, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. Let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had a pretty standard childhood – chickenpox, things like that – but nothing major. I don’t have any diagnosed conditions, like diabetes or heart problems, and I haven't had any surgeries. My wife keeps telling me I’m too healthy for my own good! I do have Medicare, though, just in case.
DOCTOR: Alright, no significant medical history, no surgeries. And what about family history?
PATIENT: That's a bit complicated, actually. My father’s side of the family… we don't talk much, and I don’t know a lot about their medical history. My mother… she passed away a few years ago, and she had some issues with high blood pressure, but nothing else that I recall being specifically hereditary. I don’t think there’s a strong history of cancer on either side, but honestly, I couldn’t say for sure. It's not something we discussed much as a family.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited family history information. That's alright, we'll proceed. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to any medications I’ve taken in the past, which isn’t many, thankfully. And no allergies to food or anything like that either. I can take penicillin without issue, if that’s what you were wondering.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I try to stay away from medications if I can. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, maybe, but nothing regularly. I don’t take any vitamins or supplements either. I try to get everything I need from my diet.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no medications, no allergies, limited family history... let's do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best to figure out what’s going on. I trust your judgment, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope, and then I’ll gently palpate, or feel, the area to assess the lump. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay. I do feel a mass in your lower abdomen, as you described. It's about… two centimeters in diameter, somewhat firm, and doesn't appear to be particularly tender. It seems to be located… just to the left of your midline. No rebound tenderness noted. I don’t feel any enlarged lymph nodes in the area either.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… about right, I think. Two centimeters seems like a reasonable size. I'm glad you didn't feel any tenderness, that's reassuring. What do you think it could be, Doctor? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say definitively without further investigation. There are a number of possibilities. It could be a lipoma, which is a benign fatty tumor, or a hernia, or something else entirely. It's not possible to determine the cause just by feeling it. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. The CBC will help rule out any signs of infection, and the CT scan will give us a detailed image of the mass and surrounding tissues. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you need more information to figure out what it is, then that’s what you should do. A CT scan and blood work seem reasonable. Will the CT scan involve any dye? I’ve heard things about reactions to dye.
DOCTOR: That's a good question. Yes, the CT scan will likely involve intravenous contrast dye to help improve the image quality. While reactions to the dye are uncommon, they can occur. We'll take precautions to minimize the risk, and we'll ask you about any allergies or kidney problems beforehand. We’ll ask you to fill out a form to assess your kidney function and allergy history before the scan. If you have any concerns, we can discuss alternative imaging options, but the CT scan generally provides the most detailed information in this case. Do you have any kidney problems or a history of allergies, specifically to iodine or shellfish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any kidney problems that I know of, and I don’t have any allergies to iodine or shellfish. My wife is the one with allergies, not me! So, I think I’m okay with the dye. What about the blood work? Is that just a standard test? And how will I get the results of everything?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies or kidney issues. The blood work is a standard complete blood count – CBC – to look at your white blood cell count and other markers that can indicate infection or other issues. As for the results, the lab results should be available within 24-48 hours. The CT scan images will take a little longer – probably a couple of days for the radiologist to review and send a report. My office will contact you as soon as the results are in to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. Do you have a preferred phone number or email address for us to reach you?
PATIENT: Yes, you can reach me at 555-1212. That’s my cell phone. And my email address is amy.raghunathan@email.com. A follow-up appointment sounds good. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It’s… reassuring to know what’s going on, even if we don’t know exactly what it is yet.
DOCTOR: Okay, 555-1212 and amy.raghunathan@email.com. I’m glad I could help put your mind at ease a little. I'm going to write up the orders for the CBC and CT scan now. The front desk will schedule the CT scan for you before you leave. They’ll also give you instructions on how to prepare for it. Is there anything else I can answer for you at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I’ll go speak with the front desk now. I appreciate your time and patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Amy. If you have any questions before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call my office. Have a good day, and we'll talk soon.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you as well, Doctor. Thank you. Have a good day too.
