DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailia. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… rather concerning, actually. I’ve been losing weight, despite eating quite normally, and I’m constantly exhausted. And… well, I’ve been waking up drenched in sweat most nights. It’s terribly inconvenient, and frankly, quite distressing. I assure you, I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, so this is… unusual.
DOCTOR: “Quite normally,” you say. Could you be a bit more specific about that?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I have three meals a day, predominantly protein and vegetables. I avoid excessive carbohydrates, and I do not indulge in sugary drinks or processed foods. I prepare everything myself, ensuring optimal nutritional value. Portion sizes are… moderate, of course. I find that excessive consumption is simply… uncouth. I also exercise regularly – yoga three times a week and brisk walks daily. It’s a disciplined routine, I assure you. I find maintaining standards is essential.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long has this weight loss and night sweats been going on?
PATIENT: Approximately three months, Doctor. It began gradually, initially I dismissed it as stress from a recent… relocation. However, it has progressively worsened. The night sweats are the most bothersome, truthfully. They disrupt my sleep and… well, it’s simply not dignified. I've attempted to adjust my bedding, but to no avail. I suppose that’s why I’m here, seeking a… proper explanation.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any other changes, Jailia?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I’ve been… rather thirsty lately, more so than usual. And, if I may be frank, Doctor, I've experienced a slight… diminution of my appetite, despite maintaining my regular meal schedule. It’s difficult to describe; the desire simply isn’t as… robust. Also, my husband has mentioned that I seem… more irritable than usual, though I find that assessment somewhat… presumptuous. He doesn't fully grasp the complexities of maintaining composure, naturally.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any family history of… anything like this?
PATIENT: That’s a rather broad question, Doctor. My maternal grandmother suffered from… digestive issues, but nothing particularly severe. My father's side of the family is… robustly healthy, if that’s the correct term. They’re primarily farmers, quite active outdoors. No history of… wasting illnesses, certainly. My husband's family has a predisposition towards… common colds, but that hardly seems relevant, does it? I assure you, we come from… solid stock. I find that genetics play a role, of course, but lifestyle is paramount.
DOCTOR: Let's do a quick physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I trust your facilities are… up to standard? I’ve had rather unfortunate experiences in the past with… inadequate hygiene practices. I do hope we can maintain a certain level of… decorum throughout the examination. And please, do be gentle; I have a rather sensitive constitution.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let’s start with your weight and blood pressure. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your abdomen. Please step onto the scale.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I do hope this is calibrated correctly. One must be precise, after all. And please, do refrain from commenting on the result until I’ve had a moment to… compose myself. It’s rather sensitive information, naturally.
DOCTOR: 105 pounds and blood pressure is 110 over 70. A bit on the lower side, but not concerning in and of itself. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath… and exhale. Deep breath again… and exhale. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: There. That’s… mildly uncomfortable, Doctor. Just below the… sternum, I believe. Not excruciating, but… distinctly unpleasant. I maintain a strict diet, naturally, so tenderness is… unexpected. Perhaps it’s simply muscular tension? I do occasionally practice advanced yoga poses, which can be… strenuous. Though I assure you, I’m quite proficient. It’s hardly something one would normally associate with… illness.
DOCTOR: Hmm. And what about here?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, that’s… considerably more disconcerting, Doctor. Quite sharp, actually. It’s… not a comfortable sensation. I really must insist you be gentle. This is quite alarming. I haven’t experienced anything like this before. I… I do hope it’s nothing serious. I have a very busy schedule, you see, and… disruptions would be… unacceptable. I maintain a very precise routine, naturally. It’s… essential.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your symptoms and this tenderness, I'd like to order some blood work. We need to check your glucose levels, electrolytes, and a complete blood count. We should also do a urinalysis. And I think it would be prudent to get a chest X-ray, just to rule out anything further. It’s a precaution, of course.
PATIENT: A chest X-ray? Doctor, are you suggesting I have something… serious? I assure you, I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. And I do not appreciate unnecessary procedures. Are you certain this is warranted? I’ve had unfortunate experiences with… radiation exposure in the past. It’s… detrimental to one’s complexion, you see. And I have a very important social engagement next month. Perhaps a more… conservative approach would be prudent? A simple blood test would suffice, surely? I maintain a very rigorous wellness regimen, naturally.
DOCTOR: Jailia, I understand your concerns. However, your weight loss, night sweats, thirst, irritability and the tenderness in your abdomen are concerning. While a blood test is certainly helpful, it doesn’t give us a complete picture. A chest X-ray is a relatively low-risk procedure and will help rule out several possibilities. It’s a precaution, but it’s a necessary one given your symptoms. We must be thorough. I’m not suggesting you have anything serious, but we need to investigate. Do you have any known allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. If you insist. But I must register my extreme displeasure. And I do hope the radiologist is… competent. I’ve had unfortunate experiences with… subpar imaging quality in the past. As for allergies… I believe I had a mild reaction to a cosmetic product containing… lanolin, several years ago. It caused a slight rash, but nothing particularly severe. I trust your facilities have appropriate emergency protocols in place, should a similar reaction occur? And I do hope this won’t take too long. I have a very busy schedule, you see. Maintaining my routine is… essential.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ve made a note of the lanolin allergy. We'll take appropriate precautions. The lab and radiology departments are right down the hall. The nurses will guide you. I'll review the results as soon as they are available, and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms—fever, severe abdominal pain, dizziness—please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Doctor, you are unduly alarming me. Is there any possibility this could be… something contagious? I have several social commitments next month, you see. And I certainly wouldn't want to… inconvenience anyone. As for questions… yes. What is the approximate timeframe for receiving these results? I have a very precise schedule, naturally. And will this… affect my ability to maintain my rigorous fitness regimen? I do hope not. Maintaining my standards is… paramount.
