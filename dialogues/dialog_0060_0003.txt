DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I told the nice lady on the phone, it’s this…shaking. It’s just annoying, is all. Been going on for…well, a while now. Don't bother me with details, alright? Just fix it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. “Shaking,” you say. And you've had this for a "while now." Okay. To “fix it,” as you put it, I do need some details. It's difficult to address something without knowing what specifically is happening, when it happens, and how it affects you. Let’s start with when you first noticed this shaking. Can you recall roughly when it began?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. That's what I'm telling you! Old age, probably. Things just…start going wrong, you know? It’s not like I have a calendar marking the exact day my hand started to tremble. Weeks? Months? A year? Doesn't matter. It's now that it’s bothersome. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Baide, that is…something. But even a general timeframe helps. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly when I'm trying to do something…precise. Like, uh…holding a fork. Or signing something. Used to be good with a pen, you know. Directed a lot of films, lots of signatures. Now? It's a mess. And it’s embarrassing, frankly. Don't need to know every little detail, just…it happens.
DOCTOR: Alright. And where is the shaking located?
PATIENT: In my hands, mostly. Sometimes it feels like it's up my arm a little, but it's really the hands. Both of 'em. Like I said, it's annoying. Look, I don't need a whole examination, do I? You see it, right? It’s shaking! Is there a pill for this or not? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide. However, a proper assessment is crucial, even if it seems obvious. I need to rule out other potential causes. I will need to perform a brief neurological exam and take your medical history. It will only take a few minutes. Before we do that, let’s go through some basics. Do you have any other symptoms – weakness, numbness, dizziness, changes in your speech, or any difficulty walking?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Look, no, I don’t have any of that fancy stuff. Just the shaking. And getting old, if that counts as a symptom. Used to be a strong man, directed action films, you know. Lots of running around. Now, I sit. And shake. Is that enough? Medicare covers this, right? I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Baide, Medicare should cover the necessary evaluations. We can verify that with the billing department if you’re concerned. Now, have you noticed anything that makes the shaking worse besides fine motor tasks, or anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Let me think… Coffee makes it worse. Definitely coffee. And stress. Though what doesn't cause stress these days? Being old is stressful, believe me. Sitting here talking about my shaking is stressful. Resting helps a little. Sitting still. Not doing anything. Which, frankly, is what I prefer these days anyway. Less trouble. Is that what you wanted to know?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. And have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Ugh, now you’re getting into things I don't remember. Look, I had a doctor once. A good one. But that was…years ago. I think he said my blood pressure was a little high, maybe. Gave me a pill. Took it for a while. Can't recall what for, honestly. Widowed, you know? After my wife passed, things got blurry. All the details… they fade. Just fix the shaking, alright? That's all I care about. Medicare…pill…done.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Baide. I understand you're frustrated. I will need to conduct a brief physical and neurological exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. It will involve checking your reflexes, strength, coordination, and balance. Before we begin, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones or supplements?
PATIENT: Supplements? Good lord, no. I eat. Sometimes. Mostly just…forget. Oh! Wait. There’s that little orange pill the lady down the street gave me for my joints. Said it would help. Take it sometimes when it rains. Can’t recall the name. Probably something fancy. That’s it. Just the orange pill. Don't bother with all the details, I just want this over with. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. I understand your impatience. Let's proceed with the exam, then. Please sit back and relax. Could you please extend your arms in front of you, palms up?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just get it over with. Don’t tell me I have something terrible. I’m an old man, things are falling apart. It's just nature. Nature and coffee, mostly. And stress. Now hurry up.
DOCTOR: Now, could you touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: See? It’s just a shaking thing! What more do you need to know? I told you. Just…fix it. I haven’t got all day. And honestly, this is embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Now, please sit still and close your eyes. I'm going to test your reflexes. This will involve a quick tap with a small hammer on your knees and ankles. Now, I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Please don't move your head.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. It's just…old age, I tell you. Everything's falling apart. Is this thing over yet? I'm getting a headache. And frankly, this is a waste of my time. Just give me a pill and send me home. Medicare…pill…done. That’s all I care about.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Thank you for your patience. Based on my examination, you have a tremor, primarily in your hands, that is worsened by fine motor tasks and appears to be somewhat relieved with rest. Given your age and the characteristics of the tremor, the most likely possibility is essential tremor. However, other conditions can cause similar symptoms, and it’s important to rule them out. To do that, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a thyroid panel, a complete metabolic panel, and a vitamin B12 level. I also recommend a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation and to confirm the diagnosis. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding excessive caffeine and managing your stress levels as much as possible. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Blood tests? A neurologist? Good lord. Look, I don't want any fancy tests. I just want a pill! Is there a pill for essential…whatever it is? Just fix the shaking, alright? I'm an old man, I haven't got time for all this. And honestly, I don't want to see another doctor. I’ve had enough of doctors for one lifetime. Just give me the pill. Medicare…pill…done. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Baide, I understand your frustration, but I cannot simply prescribe a pill without a proper diagnosis. It's irresponsible and potentially harmful. There are medications that can help manage the symptoms of essential tremor, but they have potential side effects and interactions, and they may not be appropriate for everyone. Before I can prescribe anything, I need to rule out other possible causes of your tremor, such as Parkinson's disease, thyroid problems, or medication side effects. The blood tests and neurological consultation are essential for that. I strongly recommend that you follow through with these recommendations. If you refuse, I cannot provide you with any treatment. However, I can provide you with information about essential tremor and resources for managing the symptoms. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Fine! Give me the information. But no promises about seeing another doctor. I’m an old man, and I've lived this long without them. Just…give me the information. And hurry up. My headache is getting worse. And for the love of all that is holy, don’t try to convince me to see a neurologist again. Just…information. Medicare...information...done. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Baide. Here's some information about essential tremor. It details the symptoms, potential causes, and treatment options, including medication and lifestyle modifications. It also includes resources for support groups and further information. Please read it carefully. And, while I respect your decision not to see a neurologist at this time, I strongly encourage you to reconsider. It’s the best way to get an accurate diagnosis and develop a personalized treatment plan. Do you have any other questions for me today?
