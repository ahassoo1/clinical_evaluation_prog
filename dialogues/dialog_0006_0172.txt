DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s… a visit, I suppose. My husband insisted. New to the area, you see. Just moved here last month, and he’s very particular about… things. Medicare said I should come. Honestly, I don’t recall why exactly. It’s all rather… a bother.
DOCTOR: Right, a general check-up then, getting established. That’s perfectly fine. It is good to get things sorted when you move. Hmm… and you said you don't quite remember what prompted the visit specifically?
PATIENT: Prompted? No, I wouldn’t say prompted. He told me to come. Reginald is… thorough. Always has been. It’s probably just… the usual. Old age, you know. Though I feel perfectly fine, thank you very much. I’ve always been rather… robust.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, even feeling robust, a quick check-up is never a bad idea. Just to make sure everything is as it should be. Are you experiencing any specific symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Goodness, no. Not that I’ve noticed. A little… creaky in the mornings, perhaps. But that’s just… getting up. Reginald complains about his knees, but honestly, he’s always been a bit of a drama queen. I wouldn’t call that a symptom, would you?
DOCTOR: No, I wouldn't necessarily call that a symptom either. Just… part of getting older, as you said. Alright. Let's just do a quick run-through of things, just to be complete. Have you had any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Reginald does insist on very… precise portions. And I’ve probably lost a bit of weight, now that I think about it. The food here isn’t quite as… substantial as it was back home. But I wouldn’t say it’s concerning. Honestly, I just don't enjoy cooking anymore. It’s so… tedious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your energy levels?
PATIENT: Energy? Perfectly adequate, thank you. I manage my book club just fine, and I keep Reginald in line, which takes a considerable amount of energy, I assure you. Though I do take a nap in the afternoons. Everyone does, don't they? Is that… a problem?
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not! Afternoon naps are perfectly normal. Just trying to get a complete picture. Now, have you been having any trouble with your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? No, I sleep soundly enough. Reginald snores, of course. Like a… walrus. But I sleep. Though I do wake up a few times during the night to… adjust the blankets. He insists on keeping the house at a rather chilly temperature. It's quite unnecessary, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally good sleep, though some nighttime awakenings to adjust blankets due to temperature. Alright. Now, Candice, have you had any changes in your bowel or bladder habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that’s a rather… personal question, isn’t it? I suppose… everything is as it should be. I really don’t see the necessity of discussing such things with a… a doctor. Are you quite finished with these… inquiries?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask. I apologize, Candice. I sometimes get carried away with the checklist. It’s just standard procedure, but it’s perfectly fine if you’d rather not go into detail. Let's move on then. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Palpitations? Goodness, no. I’ve always had a rather… strong constitution. Chest pain… well, I get a bit of indigestion sometimes, if Reginald makes something too spicy. But that’s hardly a medical concern. Honestly, I think I’ve answered quite enough questions for one afternoon. Is there anything else? I have a book club meeting at four.
DOCTOR: You're right, you’ve been very patient. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It won’t take long. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and just a general look around. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. I suppose that’s… acceptable. But do hurry. And please, be gentle. I bruise easily. And absolutely no cold instruments. I detest cold instruments.
DOCTOR: Of course, perfectly gentle. And no cold instruments, I promise. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax and take a few deep breaths.
PATIENT: Honestly, are you quite finished yet? This cuff is rather… constricting. And I do believe Reginald has made a rather strong pot of tea. It will be quite cold by the time I return.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice, blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not concerning at the moment. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear, but with slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally.
PATIENT: Diminished breath sounds? Honestly. I've never had any trouble breathing in my life. It’s probably just… the air in this area. It’s rather… dry, isn’t it? Can we be quite finished now? I really must go.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. Everything sounds generally okay, but I do think it would be a good idea to get a chest X-ray just to rule out anything causing those diminished breath sounds. It’s a quick procedure. Would you be willing to schedule that?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Absolutely not. I detest radiation. It’s terribly unhealthy, you know. And frankly, I find this whole examination rather… unnecessary. I came because my husband insisted, and now I’ve answered all your questions and submitted to… poking and prodding. I think that’s quite enough. I'm leaving now. And please, don’t bother calling. Reginald will handle any… correspondence.
DOCTOR: Alright, Candice. I understand your hesitation, but I truly believe an X-ray would be beneficial. However, I respect your decision. Perhaps we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss your concerns further. In the meantime, if you experience any shortness of breath, chest pain, or fever, please go to the emergency room immediately. I’ll have the nurse give you a handout with those symptoms listed. I will also note in your chart your refusal of the X-ray. Have a good afternoon, Candice.
