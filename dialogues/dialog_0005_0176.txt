DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Redeye. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it's these hiccups. They just…won't stop. Started a couple of days ago, and honestly, they’re driving me a bit crazy. It’s been over 48 hours now, I think. Maybe even longer. I lost track, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hiccups, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, hiccups. I know it sounds silly, but they're really persistent. Not just a few little ones, they come in waves, and they're… strong. It’s making it hard to sleep, and I had a work event last night I barely made it through. I manage events, you see, and it’s hard to be professional when you’re… hic… constantly jerking.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, hiccups are usually self-limiting. Most people try holding their breath or drinking water upside down. Have you tried anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness yes! Everything. Holding my breath until my face turns red, drinking water as fast as I can, trying to scare myself… my neighbor thought I was completely mad when I asked him to jump out and yell at me! hic Nothing’s worked. That’s why I came in. I just… I don’t understand why they won’t go away. Is there something wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Let's take a look at your history here. You're 50, no major medical problems listed… event planner, so stress is probably a factor. Now, 48 hours of hiccups is… unusual, but not necessarily alarming. Have you noticed anything else going on?
PATIENT: Well, I was divorced about five years ago. It was… difficult. Still is, sometimes. But that’s been a while now. hic And work is busy, always, especially this time of year. Lots of weddings and corporate things. I guess I am stressed, if I’m honest. But I’m used to being stressed! It’s never bothered my hiccups before, though. I haven't been sick, no fever or anything, and I'm eating normally. Although… now that you mention it, I have been a little more tired than usual. But honestly, who isn’t these days?
DOCTOR: Alright. Tiredness… Okay. Any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just… tired. And these hiccups, of course. hic They feel… almost like they’re coming from my chest sometimes, not just my throat. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain. It's not painful, just… a weird feeling. Like a little flutter before each one.
DOCTOR: Fluttering…Hmm. Okay. Let's have a listen to your heart and lungs, just to be thorough. And I'll palpate your abdomen, see if anything feels off. Just standard procedure. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. hic I just want them to stop. It's really starting to wear on me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness to palpation. Everything seems normal, physically. But persistent hiccups like this… we need to rule out a few things. Have you had any recent changes in medications?
PATIENT: No, no changes in medication. I take a vitamin D supplement, that's it. Been taking that for years, the doctor said my levels were low. Nothing new, I promise. hic I haven't even taken anything for the hiccups, I figured they'd go away on their own. I don't really like taking pills unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, sometimes hiccups can be caused by… less common things. We could order some blood work – just to check your electrolyte levels, rule out any underlying issues. And maybe a chest X-ray, just to be completely sure nothing’s going on in your lungs. It's probably nothing, but we need to be thorough. It's a precaution.
PATIENT: Oh. Blood work and an X-ray? hic That sounds… serious. Is it something bad? I mean, you said it's probably nothing, but… I’ve never had an X-ray before. And I don't really like needles. Is there really no other way? Maybe if I just… wait a little longer? I’m really not fond of hospitals or tests, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: Ms. Redeye, I understand your apprehension, but we're not talking about a major ordeal here. A blood draw is quick, and the X-ray is painless. It's a standard procedure to rule out anything serious. We need to investigate why you've had hiccups for this long. Prolonged hiccups, while usually benign, can sometimes indicate an underlying problem, like a neurological issue or, rarely, something affecting the diaphragm. It's better to be safe than sorry. Do you have any allergies that I should know about before we proceed?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. hic Okay… you’re right, I suppose. It's just… I’m a bit anxious about these things. A neurological issue? That sounds… frightening. Is that common with hiccups? hic And what about my diaphragm? What could be wrong with that? I manage events, you see, I need to be… composed. This is making me very nervous.
DOCTOR: Ms. Redeye, I understand your concern, but let's not jump to conclusions. The vast majority of hiccups are not caused by serious neurological issues or diaphragm problems. However, to rule them out, we need to gather some information. The blood work will check your electrolytes and rule out any metabolic imbalances. The X-ray will give us a picture of your diaphragm and lungs. I'm ordering both as a precaution, not because I suspect anything serious. We’ll get the results back quickly, and then we can discuss the next steps. Do you have insurance?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Not anymore. It… it got too expensive after the divorce. Everything got too expensive, really. hic So, what will this cost me? I'm on a fixed income, you see, and I really wasn't planning on any medical bills right now.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, without insurance, the blood work will be approximately $150, and the chest X-ray around $200. I can write you a prescription for an anti-anxiety medication, lorazepam, which sometimes helps with persistent hiccups. It's a temporary solution, but it might provide some relief while we await the results. It’s about $30, generic. Of course, it won’t address the underlying cause. We can discuss payment options with the billing department. Do you want me to proceed with ordering the tests and the medication?
PATIENT: Oh… that's… a lot. $430. hic I hadn't expected it to be so much. I… I don’t know. I really don't have that kind of money right now. Maybe… maybe the anti-anxiety medication? Just to try and calm down a little? hic I could try to hold off on the tests for a few days, see if they go away on their own? It feels like I’m being asked to spend a fortune just to find out it’s nothing. Is there absolutely no other way?
DOCTOR: Ms. Redeye, I understand your financial concerns, but I am obligated to provide a reasonable standard of care. Prolonged hiccups warrant investigation. The anti-anxiety medication may provide temporary relief, but it won't address the underlying cause. I cannot ethically discharge you without ordering some diagnostic tests. Look, I’ll see if we can get a slight discount on the blood work, but I cannot waive the X-ray. It’s a simple scan, and the potential benefits outweigh the cost. Are you able to pay for the blood work and the X-ray at a minimum?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. Yes, I can manage the blood work and the X-ray. It'll be tight, I'll have to… rearrange things. But yes. Please. Just… please let's get this over with. hic And thank you… for trying to understand. I just… I want to be normal again. Let's do the tests.
DOCTOR: Very well. Here are the requisitions for your blood work. The lab is down the hall, first door on the left. And here’s the order for the chest X-ray; the radiology department is on the third floor. They’ll call you when they’re ready for you. As soon as you have the results, bring them back here, and we’ll discuss them. In the meantime, I’m prescribing you lorazepam, 0.5mg, twice daily as needed for the anxiety. It's a low dose, and it should help with the hiccups somewhat. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. hic I… I hope they don’t find anything serious. And I really appreciate you trying to work with me. I’ll go get the tests done now. .
DOCTOR: Another one. Just what I needed. .
