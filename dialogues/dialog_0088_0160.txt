DOCTOR: Good morning, Candis. I'm Dr. Piet. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s about feeling just… worn out. And it’s not just a little tired, you know? It's been getting worse. And… well, this is embarrassing, but I’ve been eating dirt. Actual dirt. Don't look at me like that, I don't want to be doing it! I just… have to. It makes me feel better for a bit, then I’m even more tired. Is that even… possible?
DOCTOR: Okay. Feeling worn out, and it's been progressively getting worse… and you've been experiencing cravings to eat dirt. That is unusual, and it’s good you’re telling me about it. It’s definitely possible that those two things are connected. Let's try to understand what's going on. Can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Ugh, where do I even start? It's just… everything takes so much effort now. Even getting out of a chair. And I sleep plenty, more than I used to, but it doesn't help. It’s not like I’m doing anything strenuous, either! I work at the rehab center, helping people with their exercises. It’s not exactly a hard job, but even that leaves me drained. It's been going on for months, maybe six or eight. I don't keep track of those things. It just… gradually got worse. Honestly, I thought I was just getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to eight months of increasing fatigue, even with adequate sleep… and it's affecting your ability to do your job at the rehab center. And you've noticed it’s gotten worse gradually. Before we delve deeper, Candis, could you tell me a bit about any other symptoms you're experiencing?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Honestly, I mostly just feel… blah. A little weak, maybe. I haven’t been eating much, which I guess makes sense if you're tired all the time. Things just don't taste good anymore, so what's the point? I get a bit of heartburn now and then, but I always have. And, this is probably nothing, but my skin feels dry. Very dry. I use lotion, but it doesn’t seem to help much. Is that all you need to know? I’d really like to get this over with, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased appetite, things don’t taste good, occasional heartburn – which you already experience – and dry skin despite using lotion. It sounds like we're building a bit of a picture here. Now, Candis, I'm going to ask you some more detailed questions, okay?
PATIENT: Fine, get it over with. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: Not that I recall. Maybe high blood pressure, years ago? The doctor put me on a pill for a while, then took it off when it went down. That was… oh, goodness, decades ago. Nothing else. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life, honestly. Just… this dirt thing. And the tiredness. It’s probably just old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure managed with medication in the past, but currently off medication. Any surgeries or hospitalizations you can recall?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Not ever. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that’s it. No hospitalizations, unless you count the day I gave birth, but that was a long time ago, and it wasn't serious. I don't see what any of this has to do with me eating dirt. It's rather embarrassing, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s embarrassing, Candis, and I appreciate you being open about it. We need to understand all aspects of your health to figure out what's going on. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… well, my mother was always a bit… frail. She had arthritis something awful. And my brother, he had heart problems. But other than that, nothing much. My father was strong as an ox, lived to be ninety, but he didn’t bother with doctors, so who knows what he had going on? No one in my family ever ate dirt, if that’s what you’re asking. It's ridiculous, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of arthritis and heart problems. No one with similar eating habits. Now, let’s talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! I never touched a cigarette in my life. And I don't drink, haven't had a sip of alcohol in decades. Not my cup of tea. And certainly no… substances. I'm a respectable woman. Just tired. And eating dirt, apparently. Are we getting anywhere with this? I've been perfectly clear, I'm just tired!
DOCTOR: Yes, Candis, you’ve been very clear. And we are getting somewhere. Just trying to rule things out. Now, let’s talk about medications. Besides the blood pressure medication years ago, are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just some vitamins. A multi-vitamin, and calcium for my bones. The woman at the drugstore said I should. Nothing else. I don't trust all those pills the doctors push on you. They just want to make money. Are you going to tell me I'm deficient in something now? Because I don't want to hear it. I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, multi-vitamin and calcium supplements. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Never had an allergic reaction in my life. I eat everything. Well, except dirt, but that's… different. Honestly, I'm starting to feel like you're just asking questions to fill time. This is taking far too long. I need to get back to work. People depend on me. Are you going to do something or just keep asking me about my life?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Candis, and I apologize for the wait. We’re trying to get a complete picture of your health. Now, I think it's time to do a brief physical examination. That might help us get to the bottom of this. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine, get it over with. But don't expect miracles. It's probably just old age, I tell you. It really is. I feel perfectly fine, aside from the tiredness and the… well, you know. Just hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could sit up on the examination table for me, that would be great. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. I'm also going to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. And finally, I will palpate your abdomen.
PATIENT: Fine, get on with it. Honestly, doctors these days, always poking and prodding. It's a wonder anyone lives long enough to need a doctor. Just hurry up, please. I have people waiting.
DOCTOR: Okay, deep breaths in… and out… again… Your heart sounds regular, but slightly fast. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140 over 90. Pulse is 92, a bit on the higher side. Ears look normal. Nose is clear. Throat… a little dry, but no obvious signs of infection. Abdomen is soft, but slightly tender in the lower quadrants. No masses or organomegaly. Alright. That's all for the physical exam. I noticed your skin is very dry, as you mentioned. And you seem a bit pale.
PATIENT: "Slightly tender"? It's probably just gas. I haven’t been eating properly, remember? Pale? Well, I haven’t been out in the sun. It’s been raining for weeks! Honestly, all this poking and prodding isn't telling you anything new. What are you going to do now? Give me a pill? I already told you, I don't trust those things. Just tell me if it's something serious or not, and let me get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Candis. I’m not going to immediately prescribe medication. But based on your symptoms – the fatigue, the unusual craving to eat dirt, the paleness, and the dry skin – and your slightly elevated blood pressure, I think it's important to run some tests to rule out potential underlying causes. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, and a vitamin D level. These tests can help us check for anemia, electrolyte imbalances, thyroid problems, and vitamin deficiencies. It’s also important to investigate why you’re craving dirt – this is called pica. It can be associated with iron deficiency, but it could also be due to other nutritional deficiencies or even a psychological issue. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Now you want to do tests? After all that poking and prodding and asking me about my life? It's fine, I suppose. Just get it over with. But I doubt it's anything serious. I just need to rest. And maybe stop eating dirt, though I don’t know why I'm doing it. Honestly, it's ridiculous. How long will these tests take? And where do I go? I haven't got all day. Just hurry up and tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ve sent an order to the lab for the blood tests. They’re located just across the hall, room 203. You don’t need an appointment, just tell them Dr. Piet sent you. It usually takes about an hour to get the results back. While we're waiting, I'm going to ask a few more questions about your diet and your recent emotional state. Have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite, or any significant stressors in your life?
PATIENT: Changes in my appetite? I told you I haven't been eating! What's the point of asking me the same questions again? And stressors? What kind of doctor asks about stressors? . My life is fine. Perfectly fine. I’m a perfectly capable woman. I don’t need a lecture about my emotional state. I just want to know if I'm dying or not. Is that too much to ask? . Now, are you going to order these tests or just keep bothering me with pointless questions?
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand your frustration. The tests are ordered, you can head to room 203 whenever you're ready. I just want to rule out any possibilities while we wait for the results. The information helps us build a comprehensive picture. But, if you’d prefer not to discuss it further, that’s perfectly alright. We can just wait for the lab results. It’s just, pica is sometimes linked to underlying issues, so I wanted to explore all possibilities, but it’s ultimately your choice. Would you like me to stop asking questions?
PATIENT: Fine. Stop asking questions. I told you, my life is fine. I just need to rest. And I'm starting to think this whole thing is a waste of time. But I suppose I should go get these tests done. Room 203, you said? Just hurry up with the results. I haven't got all day. Ridiculous. Eating dirt… who would have thought? .
DOCTOR: Yes, room 203. I'll have the results sent to me as soon as they're available. Please let the lab technician know I ordered them.
