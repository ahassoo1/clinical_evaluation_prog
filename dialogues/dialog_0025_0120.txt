DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Villarreal. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day, Doctor…Fourney, right? I want to get pregnant. Simple as that. I lost my husband a couple years back, and…well, I want a baby. But I want to make sure everything works. You know? I don’t want any…problems. I’m not getting any younger.
DOCTOR: Right. "Everything works." Yes, well, we’ll certainly try to ascertain that. It's good you're thinking proactively. Two years since your husband passed… that’s a significant loss, and starting a family is a big step. Let's start with some basics, shall we?
PATIENT: Basics? Look, I’m healthy. I eat alright, I walk sometimes… what kind of basics are we talking about? I don’t do a lot of…doctor stuff, usually. I just want to know if I can have a baby, okay? Is there a test for that? A quick one?
DOCTOR: “Healthy” is subjective, Ms. Villarreal. And yes, there are tests. But before we jump to tests, a basic medical history is crucial. It helps us understand your overall health and potential risk factors. It’s not about doubting you, it's about responsible care. Now, have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? I… honestly, I don't really remember. It was a long time ago. Maybe a bad flu once or twice? Nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was little, I think. Does that count? And…look, this is really embarrassing, but I had a C-section with my…with my daughter. A long time ago. That was…difficult. But that's it. I think. Don’t ask me for dates, I really don’t know. Honestly, I just want to know if I’m able, or if I’m wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsils out… and a C-section. We will need to review the records for that C-section, Ms. Villarreal. That’s important. It can affect future pregnancies. I see a note here from 2008…was that your daughter’s birth?
PATIENT: Yes, 2008. That sounds right. Look, I told you, it was a long time ago and…not a happy time. Honestly, I’d rather not talk about it. Can we just…do the test? Whatever test tells me if I can have a baby or not? I don’t need a history lesson. I just want a straight answer. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, while I understand your desire for a quick answer, dismissing your medical history isn't responsible care. It's because of your history that we need to proceed carefully. However… we can start with some initial fertility testing. It won't give us a definitive "yes" or "no," but it's a starting point. First, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don’t take anything. I try to stay natural, you know? I don't believe in all that…pharmaceutical stuff. Just vitamins, sometimes. You know, a multivitamin. The basic stuff. Nothing special. Can we please just get to the actual testing now? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll proceed with some baseline tests. We’ll need a blood draw to check your hormone levels – that’s FSH, LH, estrogen, and AMH. AMH will give us an indication of your ovarian reserve. We’ll also do a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to assess your overall health. And, given your previous C-section, we'll need to schedule a pelvic ultrasound to evaluate your uterus and ovaries. It's standard protocol. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Blood, ultrasound… whatever. Just…tell me when and where. And make it quick. I really don’t have time for a lot of…appointments. And are these tests expensive? My insurance is…okay, but I don’t want a huge bill. Honestly, the whole thing is just…stressful. Can someone just tell me what’s going to happen?
DOCTOR: The blood draw can be done in the lab right down the hall. It will take about fifteen minutes. The ultrasound will require a separate appointment, which I can schedule for next week, likely Tuesday afternoon. As for cost, your insurance should cover a significant portion, but there may be a co-pay or deductible. Our billing department can provide a more accurate estimate. Now, before you leave, can you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Allergies? Honestly… I don’t really have any. Maybe a little bit of dust sometimes. But nothing serious. No medications, no foods… I’m pretty… normal. Look, I’m really not good at remembering this stuff. Can we just… do the blood test and get it over with? I feel like I’m being interrogated. It’s just a baby, Doctor. Not rocket science.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Villarreal. Let’s get you to the lab then. I will have the nurse give you the requisition forms. Please follow up with me once you've scheduled the ultrasound. And, if you do recall any other medical information, please don’t hesitate to call the office. It’s important to have a complete picture, even if it seems insignificant. Now, let’s go.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Let's just get this over with. .
