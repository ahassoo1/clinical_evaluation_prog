DOCTOR: Good morning, Deloris. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Panjoj, was it? Yes, well, it’s about a letter. A letter for… a pet. Honestly, the whole thing is a bit silly, but they said I needed something from a doctor. Something official. I can’t quite recall why exactly, though. It’s about getting a… what do you call them… a certificate of some sort? For my… companion.
DOCTOR: Yes, Deloris, I see your name here. And it appears you’re requesting documentation for an emotional support animal, specifically for travel purposes with the airline. That's perfectly alright, many people need this. It is important to have the correct paperwork. To help me complete this for you, could you tell me a little more about your companion?
PATIENT: Oh, is that what it’s called? Emotional support… fancy. Well, it's a dog. A lovely dog, really. A big one. Brown. Very… hairy. I got him a few years back, I think. After… things. You know. The divorce. Honestly, I don't remember the breed. A rescue, I believe. They just… handed him to me at the shelter. Seemed like a good idea at the time. He's… helpful. Yes. Helpful with… being alone. Is that enough information? I'm terrible with details, you see.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Deloris. It's understandable to not remember every detail. Knowing he’s a rescue and that he provides comfort is very helpful. "Helpful with being alone" is a very good way to put it. Do you experience any specific feelings of distress or anxiety that your dog helps to alleviate?
PATIENT: Distress… anxiety… Well, yes. Sometimes. When I’m… out. Just… being in public, you know? Lots of people. Loud noises. He… he sort of grounds me. I don’t get quite so… flustered. It's hard to explain. I just feel safer with him there. He’s a good boy. Very protective. Though, honestly, he’s probably more interested in sniffing everything than protecting me. He's a bit of a… hound, I suppose. Does that make sense? I ramble, don’t I?
DOCTOR: No rambling at all, Deloris. It makes perfect sense. And it’s very common to feel anxious in public situations. It sounds like your dog provides a significant source of comfort and security for you, which is wonderful. Have you been diagnosed with any anxiety disorders or depression in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Diagnosed… hmm. I saw a therapist for a bit after… you know. The divorce. A very nice woman. We talked. A lot. She said I was… adjusting. And that I was… normal. For someone going through a divorce, anyway. I don't think she gave me any… labels. Just said I needed to… cope. Does that count as a diagnosis? I really don’t keep track of these things. It was a long time ago. I just wanted things to feel… less awful.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. Simply seeing a therapist and working through difficult emotions is a positive step, even without a formal diagnosis. It sounds like you were actively seeking support during a challenging time. And "actively seeking support" is very important. Now, to complete this documentation for your travel certificate, I'll need to ask a few more questions, just to be thorough. Have you experienced any significant changes in your sleep or appetite recently?
PATIENT: Oh, changes… hmm. Well, I sleep alright, I think. Maybe not as well as I used to, but who does, really? I get up a few times a night, sometimes. Just… needing a glass of water, or something. Appetite… that comes and goes, doesn’t it? I don’t eat as much when I’m… stressed. Which is… often. But I haven’t lost a lot of weight, or anything. I like to eat. Very much. Especially chocolate. Does that count as a significant change? I always crave chocolate when I’m upset. A very reliable craving, really. It’s… comforting. Like the dog, but edible. Is that helpful? I'm probably not making any sense.
DOCTOR: You’re making perfect sense, Deloris. A change in sleep and appetite, even if not drastic, is good to note. And a craving for chocolate during times of stress is very common, and not at all unusual. It sounds like you have healthy coping mechanisms, even if they involve a little indulgence. Now, I just want to quickly review some basic medical history. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I don't think so. Not that I’m aware of. I’m not one for taking pills, honestly. I avoid them whenever possible. I had a rash once, years ago, after using a new laundry detergent. But that wasn’t an allergy, exactly. Just… irritation. And I’m a bit sensitive to pollen, I suppose. Sneezing a lot in the spring. But that’s just… seasonal. Nothing serious. Honestly, I’m quite robust, health-wise. Always have been. Knock on wood. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. Though, she also said a lot of things. Mostly about proper posture. I don't think posture has anything to do with allergies. Does that help? I'm terrible with medical things.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Deloris. No known medication or food allergies, just some seasonal pollen sensitivity. And a history of generally good health. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not a single one. I absolutely avoid them. My mother believed in… natural remedies. And I’ve sort of carried that on. A bit of ginger tea when I’m feeling unwell. A hot bath. Lots of rest. That sort of thing. Pills are… suspicious, I think. All those chemicals. No, thank you. I’d rather suffer a little than fill my body with… artificial things. I’m quite firm on that, actually. Though, sometimes I take something for a headache. But it’s very rare. Very rare indeed. It's… aspirin, I think. Just a tiny one. And only when absolutely necessary. It makes my stomach upset. Honestly, I’d rather just lie down in a dark room.
DOCTOR: Okay, Deloris, so no regular medications, occasional aspirin for headaches, and a preference for natural remedies. That’s all very clear. Now, I’m going to do a very quick physical exam, just to document your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Yes, that’s fine. A quick one is good. I'm not one for fuss. I always get a bit… anxious at the doctor's, you see. All the poking and prodding. But a quick one is fine. As long as it doesn’t involve anything… invasive. And no cold instruments, please. I hate cold instruments. They make me jump. Honestly, I'm a bit of a… delicate flower, health-wise. Despite what my mother said. Just a quick one is perfect. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Deloris. A quick exam. No cold instruments, I promise. We'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Relax your arm for me, please. Your blood pressure is 130/80, which is slightly elevated, but not concerning at this time. Your heart sounds regular and your lungs are clear. Ears look clear. Throat looks clear as well. Everything sounds and looks good.
PATIENT: Oh, that wasn’t so bad. Thank you, Doctor. A bit… clinical, perhaps, but not terrible. Everything sounds good, you say? That’s a relief. Honestly, I was expecting something… dreadful. My mother always said I had a weak constitution. But you say everything is clear? Good. Very good. So, does that mean I can get the letter for… the dog? The companion? The emotional support… thing? I really need to get this sorted out before my trip. It's… important. And I'm dreadful with paperwork, you see. Absolutely dreadful.
DOCTOR: Yes, Deloris. Everything sounds and looks good. Based on our conversation and the physical exam, and with no significant medical history to contraindicate, I’m happy to provide you with the documentation required for your emotional support animal. Here you are. This letter details your need for an emotional support animal for travel purposes. It also includes a statement confirming your general good health. Please be aware that airline regulations can change, so it's always best to double-check with your specific airline before your trip to ensure you meet their requirements. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! Thank you, Doctor, thank you so much! This is… a great weight off my mind. Honestly, I was dreading this. Paperwork is… my nemesis. Yes, it all looks… official. Very official. I think. Hmm. Questions… let me see. Well, will this letter… last? Or do I need to come back every year? Because I travel quite a bit, you see. Not constantly, but… reasonably often. And I really don't enjoy doctor's visits. It's not the doctor, you understand. It's the… poking and prodding. And the paperwork. Mostly the paperwork. And… Oh dear, I've forgotten what I was going to ask. Honestly, my memory is… appalling. Is there anything else I need to know? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Deloris. This letter is typically valid for one year. After that, you would need to schedule another appointment for an updated evaluation. As for anything else, just remember to keep this letter with you during your travels, and be prepared to present it to airline personnel if requested. It’s also a good idea to familiarize yourself with the airline’s specific policies regarding emotional support animals. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: One year, you say? Alright. That’s… manageable. I can put a reminder in my calendar. Though, honestly, I often forget to check my calendar. Never mind. I’ll try my best. No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your patience, Doctor. And for not… poking too much. You’ve been very kind. And official. Very official. I really appreciate it. Thank you again. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Deloris. It was my pleasure. Have a safe and pleasant trip, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Goodbye.
