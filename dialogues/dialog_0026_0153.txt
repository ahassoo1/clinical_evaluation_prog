DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Just… a check-up, I think. Something about a performance, a physical? Honestly, it's all a bit fuzzy. They sent me over, said I needed clearance. It’s… for acting, I believe. Yes, acting. It’s been a while since I did that sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, a physical for acting clearance. That’s perfectly reasonable. We'll do a thorough check-up, then. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: General health… hmm. Well, I’m… reasonably okay, I suppose. I get a little tired easily, but that's probably just my age, right? Sixty-nine years is… a lot of years. I don't really do much these days. Mostly just… things. I used to be quite active, though. Ushering, mostly. Lobby work. Ticket taking. That sort of thing. I don't get sick often, not that I recall. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Krahn. It’s helpful to know you were previously active. Fatigue at 69 is common, but we'll investigate it a bit further just to be sure. You mentioned not getting sick often. Have you had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… Oh dear. Let me think. Not recently. Years and years ago, when I was a boy, I had… something. A fever, I think. Very high. But that was in China, a long, long time ago. Everything is… hazy. I don't remember much about it, honestly. I don’t really keep track of those things. It was… before my divorce, definitely. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Krahn. It’s perfectly normal not to recall details from a long time ago. We can focus on more recent things if that's easier. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I think I had my appendix out, once. Maybe. Or was that my brother? Everything gets so mixed up. I really can't be sure. It was a small thing, I think. Not a big operation. Just… a little cut. And then… nothing else comes to mind. No, definitely nothing else. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. Vague recollections are common. Let's talk about your family. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My parents were… healthy enough, I suppose. They lived long lives, both of them. But… China is a big place, Doctor. I didn’t see much of my extended family growing up. I think my mother’s sister had… something with her lungs, maybe? A cough? It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about these things much. My father… he worked very hard. He was a strong man. I don’t recall any major illnesses on his side. It's all very… distant, you understand. I apologize for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: You’re not being unhelpful at all, Mr. Krahn. Family history can be difficult to recall, especially if you weren’t closely connected. We'll make do with what we have. Now, just to get a better picture of your current health, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I’m not very picky. I used to have a bit of trouble with shellfish, once, but that was ages ago. Maybe it was just a bad oyster. I can’t remember. No, I don’t think I have any serious allergies. Nothing that requires a doctor, anyway. I haven’t had any rashes or breathing problems. Unless you count dust. I sneeze sometimes in dusty rooms. Is that an allergy?
DOCTOR: Dust is a common irritant, Mr. Krahn, not necessarily an allergy, but good to know. And that’s helpful regarding medications. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Not currently. I haven't taken anything regularly in… well, a very long time. I used to take something for my… digestion, maybe? But that was years ago. Just a little pill. I stopped taking it a long time ago. Vitamins… No, I don’t think so. I try to eat a healthy diet. Not much need for vitamins, I suppose. I do have some… tea, sometimes. Herbal tea. For relaxation. Does that count? It’s chamomile, I think. I am truly sorry for being so vague. This is quite a frustrating process, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Krahn. It’s perfectly understandable. We’ll take things at your pace. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. We’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and just have a general look around. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… fine. A physical exam. Very good. Whatever you need, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, if you could? I have… things to do. But I understand it’s necessary. Go ahead. I’ll… try to remember everything you ask. Although, I make no promises.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… Okay, that’s 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. Now, let me listen to your heart… Heart sounds are regular, but there's a slight murmur. It’s faint, so we’ll keep an eye on it. Now I’ll listen to your lungs… Lungs are clear on both sides, but there’s a slight decrease in breath sounds at the base. Resonance is normal. Now, I'm just going to take a look at your throat and ears… Throat is clear, and ears look normal. Do you have any pain anywhere?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not at the moment. Although, my knees sometimes ache, especially when the weather is cold. And my back… It’s just old age, I suppose. I used to stand on my feet all day, ushering and whatnot. It’s probably just the years taking their toll. But nothing serious. I can still walk, you know. And I can still… mostly remember things. Sometimes. Is that all? Can I… sit down now? This standing is a bit much.
DOCTOR: Yes, you can certainly sit down now, Mr. Krahn. That's helpful to know about your knees and back. It's likely related to your previous activity, as you suspect. Now, to get a more complete picture, I'd like to order a few basic blood tests. Just a standard CBC, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid check. It will help us rule out any underlying issues that could be causing your fatigue or the elevated blood pressure. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, yes, that sounds… thorough. As long as it's necessary, I suppose. I don't particularly like needles, but… I understand it’s part of the process. Will it take long? I have… appointments, you see. But yes, go ahead. Just… try to be quick, if you could? And please, no surprises. Is there anything else? Because I really must… get going eventually.
DOCTOR: The blood draw won't take long, Mr. Krahn, just a few minutes. And I promise, we’ll be as quick as possible. The lab is just down the hall. I'll write you a requisition form, and the phlebotomist will take good care of you. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and develop a plan. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions… hmm. No, I don't think so. Not at the moment. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I just… wish I could remember more about my past. It's frustrating, you know? But… that’s just the way it is, I suppose. Just… thank you for your time. And thank you for being so patient. I truly appreciate it. Can I… go get this blood drawn now?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krahn. I understand it can be frustrating, and we'll do everything we can to help. Here's the requisition form. Just take this to the lab, and they'll get you taken care of. After that, feel free to head home. I’ll have the lab results sent to me, and my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… perfectly alright. A follow-up appointment. Very good. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I think… I’ll be going now. If you’ll excuse me. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Krahn. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions.
