DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bahta. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you. My name is Lonell Bahta, as you know. I am here… because I need to know if I can get some help at home. For… when I need it. My daughter, she thinks it’s time. She arranged this visit. It is about home health, yes? And… hospice, if needed? I am not quite sure of the details.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here your daughter scheduled this appointment… regarding home health options. It sounds like you’re exploring what support might be available, which is very sensible. Before we discuss specific services, let's get a clearer picture of what’s been going on. Can you tell me a bit more about why your daughter feels this is necessary?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, my daughter, Camille. She is… very practical. Well, I had a fall, you see. About six weeks ago. Broke my hip. It has healed, the doctor said, but… I am not as strong as before. And I live alone. Camille worries. She says I am not eating enough. And she is concerned about me being able to manage the stairs. She visits often, but… she has her own life, her work. It is a lot for her. So, she wants to make sure I have some help if I need it. It is very kind of her, but I do not want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: A hip fracture six weeks ago… and now some concerns about strength, stairs, and appetite. I understand. It’s good your daughter is looking out for you. It’s not a burden to ask for help when you need it. Now, regarding the hip fracture, was this treated surgically?
PATIENT: Yes, it was surgery. At Saint Luke’s Hospital. Doctor Dubois performed it. He said it went very well. I was in the hospital for five days. Then I went to a rehabilitation facility for two weeks. They taught me how to walk again, with a walker at first. And exercises. But… it is not the same. Even with the exercises, I tire easily. And I am afraid of falling again. It’s a silly worry, perhaps. But it is there.
DOCTOR: Saint Luke’s, Dr. Dubois… excellent. And you completed two weeks of rehabilitation – that’s good. You're right to mention the fear of falling. That's a very common and valid concern after a hip fracture. Tell me, what kind of exercises are you currently doing at home?
PATIENT: At home? Well… the physical therapist at the facility gave me some. Mostly leg lifts, while sitting. And standing and raising on my toes. And… walking, of course. But not too far. Just around the house. Camille reminds me to do them. She is very good at that. But… I confess, I do not always feel like doing them. They are uncomfortable, sometimes. And I get… discouraged easily. It feels like I am not making progress. It is a small apartment, you see. Not much room to walk. And the stairs… they are the biggest problem.
DOCTOR: It’s not unusual to feel that way after a hip fracture. It takes time. But consistency with those exercises is important, even if it’s just a little bit each day. Are you experiencing any pain currently?
PATIENT: Pain? Yes, some. Mostly in my hip, when I move it too quickly. Or if I try to go up the stairs. It is not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache. And sometimes, it is in my lower back. I take a pain reliever, when it gets bad. Something the doctor at the hospital prescribed. It helps, but… I do not want to take pills all the time. I worry about the side effects. And… it does not make the stairs any easier. Perhaps I should be stronger before trying the stairs. Is that not so?
DOCTOR: It's good you're mindful of medication side effects. Now, the pain in your lower back… is that a new development, or has that been present for a while?
PATIENT: The lower back pain… it started about a week ago, I think. After I tried to vacuum the apartment. It was… a bit too much, perhaps. Camille told me not to do it. But I like to keep things tidy. I did not want to bother her to do it. It was a silly thing, I know. But I felt I could manage. It was a mistake, clearly. Now, it aches when I bend over. And it makes it harder to walk. It is… a vicious circle, is it not?
DOCTOR: Yes, it sounds like you may have aggravated something with the vacuuming. Alright. Let’s do a brief physical exam to assess your hip, back, and overall strength. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is a little difficult, Doctor. But I can manage. Please, tell me if I should stop. I do not want to fall. And… forgive me for saying so, but I am not as steady as I used to be. I am… a bit nervous, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bahta. Let’s take it slowly. I see a slight antalgic gait – meaning you're favoring one side when you walk. Range of motion in your hip is limited, particularly with internal rotation. And there is some tenderness to palpation over the greater trochanter. Your lower back does exhibit some muscle guarding, and you have some discomfort with forward flexion. Strength is… diminished in both legs, but not markedly so. I think we need to get some imaging of your lower back just to rule out anything significant. And I’m going to recommend a referral to physical therapy – a more intensive program than what you had previously.
PATIENT: Imaging? Oh dear. Is that… serious, Doctor? And more physical therapy? I already did that, you see. It was… tiring. And I did not feel much improvement. I do not want to waste my time, or your time. Perhaps I am just… too old to get better. I am not sure what Camille would say, but I do not want to be a bother. Is there anything else? Perhaps some pain medication? A stronger one? Just to get me through the stairs? I just want to be able to manage on my own, if possible.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bahta, imaging is simply a precaution. We need to rule out any underlying structural issues. And it doesn't mean anything is necessarily wrong. As for physical therapy, a different approach, a more tailored program, may be more beneficial. We’ll need to assess your specific limitations. Regarding stronger pain medication, I am hesitant to prescribe anything beyond what you’ve already been given. We need to address the underlying cause of the pain, not just mask the symptoms. Now, about home health… I think that is a reasonable consideration, at least for a short period, to help you with some basic tasks and ensure your safety. I'll write a referral for that, and we can discuss it at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Ah, home health… yes, that sounds… sensible, perhaps. Camille would be pleased. She worries about me falling, you see. And she is right, I suppose. I am not as strong as before. As for allergies… let me think. No, I do not believe so. I have never had a reaction to any medication, that I recall. Perhaps a slight stomach upset, once, with some antibiotic. But nothing serious. And… no, I do not have any allergies to food, either. Camille always asks me that, you know. She is very thorough. Is there anything else I should tell you, Doctor? About my health? Or… anything I should be doing to help myself? Apart from the exercises, which… I confess, I do not enjoy very much.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s good to know you don't have any known allergies. It sounds like your daughter is very attentive, which is good. Beyond the exercises – and I understand they’re not enjoyable – maintaining a balanced diet is important for muscle strength and overall health. I'll have the nurse give you a list of resources for senior health and wellness. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review the imaging results and discuss the progress with physical therapy. In the meantime, please call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so, Doctor. You have been very thorough. And… patient, with me. I confess, I am a bit overwhelmed, with all the appointments and exercises and imaging. But I trust your judgment. And… I will try to be more diligent, with the exercises. For Camille, if nothing else. Perhaps I should ask her to come with me to the follow-up appointment. She is very good at asking questions. Is that… permissible? And… thank you, Doctor. For everything. I think that is all.
DOCTOR: Yes, your daughter is welcome to attend the follow-up appointment. That’s perfectly acceptable. Alright then. We'll get the referrals processed. The nurse will be in shortly with some information. Have a good day, Mr. Bahta. .
PATIENT: .
