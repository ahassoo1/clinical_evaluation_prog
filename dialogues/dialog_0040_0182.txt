DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Orwin, yes. 81… Private insurance. Good. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about this… procedure. My daughter, bless her heart, she’s the one who made the appointment. Says I look… tired. I think she just wants me to look better for the family pictures. It’s a facelift, you know. Not that I think it’s necessary, but… she insisted. Let’s just get it over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: A facelift… Right. And you’re here for… a pre-operative assessment, I presume?
PATIENT: Precisely. A check-up, so I can get this done and be rid of it. Honestly, doctors these days… so much fuss over everything. I’ve had tougher scrapes from falling off a ladder. Is this going to take long? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: A luncheon… Of course. Well, we need to establish a baseline, Mr. Orwin. Just a few questions, routine things. Have you had any… significant medical issues in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? At my age, everything’s significant! Let me see… I had my appendix out, oh, sixty years ago. And a bad knee once, from a skiing accident. Fixed it, though. Mostly, I've just been… sturdy. No heart trouble, no diabetes, nothing like that. I've always been a hard worker. Terrazzo work keeps a man fit, you know. Do you need to know every little ache and pain?
DOCTOR: Terrazzo work… interesting. No, not every little ache. But have you been diagnosed with high blood pressure or cholesterol?
PATIENT: Blood pressure… hmm. Doctor Hansen checked it a few years back, said it was a little high, gave me some pills. I didn’t like how they made me feel, so I stopped taking them. Cholesterol… never been told about that. Honestly, I don’t put much stock in all that fancy testing. I eat a good breakfast, that’s all a man needs. Can we move on? I’m sure the surgeon has more important things to worry about than my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Stopped taking medication for hypertension… Right. And no known history of hyperlipidemia. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I've taken all sorts of things over the years. Painkillers for the work, antibiotics when I've had a cold... never had a reaction. My wife used to say I could eat anything. She was the cautious one. Stop trying to scare me with all these questions, young lady. It's a simple facelift, not open-heart surgery.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's just do a quick physical exam, then. Blood pressure, heart rate, lungs… Just standard procedure. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Honestly, the things I do for my daughter. Just get it over with quickly, will you? And try not to poke too much. My skin is delicate, you know. Terrazzo dust isn’t kind to a man’s complexion.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated, 150/90. Heart rate is regular but a little fast. Lungs are clear, but I do notice some mild skin laxity. It's consistent with age. No palpable lymphadenopathy. Have you noticed any recent changes in your skin?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, it’s… sagged a bit, naturally. Eighty-one years will do that to a man. And a bit thinner, I suppose. It's lost some of its… bounce. But I wouldn’t call them changes. Just… the march of time, you know? Are you implying there's something wrong with my skin, besides being old? My daughter will be furious if you say something like that.
DOCTOR: Reports mild skin laxity consistent with age... No reported changes beyond expected age-related decline. No, Mr. Orwin. Just documenting observations. Have you had any issues with bleeding or excessive bruising in the past?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Heavens, no. I’ve cut myself plenty times on the job, but nothing a little bandage couldn’t fix. I heal quick, always have. Though, now that I think about it… after I had that wisdom tooth pulled, the bleeding was a bit much. But that was decades ago, and the dentist just packed some gauze in there. Don’t go making a fuss over a single tooth. Honestly, you doctors always look for the worst in everything.
DOCTOR: Reports history of prolonged bleeding after wisdom tooth extraction decades ago. Alright. Given your history, we might want to get a basic coagulation panel done before proceeding. Just to be safe. It's a standard precaution. It will tell us how quickly your blood clots. I'll have the nurse draw some blood. It will take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Blood tests… of course. More fuss. It's a simple facelift, not a blood transfusion! Fine, get it over with. But I expect results quickly. And tell your nurse to be gentle. My veins aren’t what they used to be. Honestly, it's ridiculous. I've lived eighty-one years, survived falling off ladders, and you’re worried about a little bit of blood? Just hurry up, will you? I have a luncheon to get to.
DOCTOR: Fine. The nurse will be in shortly. It's standard procedure, Mr. Orwin. We'll get the results as quickly as possible. I'll be back to discuss them once they're available. In the meantime, try to relax.
PATIENT: Relax? Relax! After all this poking and prodding? Standard procedure… Honestly, the nerve of some people. .
