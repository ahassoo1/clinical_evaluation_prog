DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. It's a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Glazewski. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head… the back of my head… it hurts. Been hurting for maybe… three days now, I think. Not all the time, but… it comes and goes. Like a… a dull ache.
DOCTOR: Alright, a headache at the back of your head for about three days, coming and going… a dull ache, you said. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s… hard to say why it hurts. Nothing I did… I don't think. I work with the trains, you see? Been doing that… a long, long time. Maybe it’s from… looking up a lot? Or… thinking too hard about the schedules? It’s not a bad pain, not like when I broke my arm when I was a boy. Just… annoying. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it's not related to any specific injury, and you suspect it might be related to your work with the trains – perhaps from looking up or concentrating. And it’s disrupting your sleep a bit. Okay. To get a better understanding, could you describe exactly where at the back of your head the pain is located?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see. Right… about here. And a little bit… across the back, too. Not on the sides, but… right where the head meets the neck. It feels… tight there, sometimes. Like a band. A tight band around the back of my head. Does that make sense, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Mr. Brum. A tight band sensation at the base of your skull, radiating across the back. And you said it’s been present for about three days?
PATIENT: Yes. Three days, I think. Maybe four? It's hard to keep track, you see. I used to have a calendar, but… my daughter, she helped me with that. She’s busy now, with her own family. It comes and goes… more when I’m tired, I think. Or… when the weather is bad. This heat doesn’t help, I’m sure. It makes everything feel… heavy.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s easy to lose track of things, and the heat certainly can exacerbate many conditions. So, it’s worse with fatigue and possibly changes in the weather. Have you noticed anything else that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. When I lie down flat, it sometimes feels a little better. But… not always. And… when I take a nap, it sometimes wakes me up with the headache! Funny, that. Also… when I’m concentrating really hard on something… like figuring out a train schedule… it seems to get worse then too. But I have to figure out the schedules, you see. It’s my job. So I just… push through it. I take some water, that helps a little.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lying flat sometimes helps, but sometimes it's worse after a nap. And concentrating intensifies the pain. Water provides some relief. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… No fever, I don’t think. No dizziness. No blurry vision. Sometimes… my neck feels a little stiff, but that’s probably just from… old age! I get creaky, you know? No nausea or anything like that. I eat okay… not as much as I used to, but… that’s just getting old too, I suppose. I haven’t hit my head recently, Doctor. Not that I remember, anyway. I used to have trouble sleeping, but that's been better lately. Except when the headache wakes me up! It's a strange thing, this headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no fever, dizziness, vision changes, nausea. Some neck stiffness, but you attribute that to age. You haven’t had any recent head injuries. And the sleep disturbance is intermittent, linked to the headaches. Mr. Brum, with your permission, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and do a basic neurological exam – that just means I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… fine. Do what you need to do. I trust you. I haven't had much trouble with doctors, thankfully. Just this headache is… bothersome. And I want to get it fixed, if possible. Blood pressure… I used to have a little trouble with that, years ago. But it's been better lately. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Thank you, Mr. Brum. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148/82. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength. Could you please sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can sit up. Be careful with my back, though. It's a little… creaky, you know. Like everything else. Go ahead, do what you need to do. I used to be very strong, working with the trains. Not so much anymore. But I still get by.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your strength is 5 out of 5 in all extremities, which is good. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion in your neck. There’s some mild tenderness when I move your neck, and it’s slightly limited in its range of motion. I also palpate the muscles at the base of his skull. There’s some tension there as well. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing a tension headache, likely related to muscle tension in your neck and shoulders. The stress from your work and the concentration it requires could be contributing factors. It is also possible that it is a cervicogenic headache, meaning it originates from a problem in the neck. The elevated blood pressure is something we should keep an eye on as well.
PATIENT: Tension headache… That sounds… right. Always feeling tense, you know? Thinking about the schedules, making sure everything runs on time. It's a lot of responsibility. And my neck is always a little stiff. So that makes sense. Blood pressure… I guess I should watch that too. What can I do about it, Doctor? About the headache, I mean. And the blood pressure. Is there a pill I can take? I don’t like taking pills, if I can help it. But I want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference to avoid medication if possible. We can definitely start with some conservative measures for the headache. For the tension headache, I recommend: Over-the-counter pain relievers: Ibuprofen or naproxen can help reduce inflammation and pain. Follow the dosage instructions on the label. Heat or cold packs: Apply to your neck and shoulders for 15-20 minutes at a time. Gentle stretching and exercises: There are specific neck stretches that can help relieve tension. I can provide you with a handout. Stress management techniques: Deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga can help reduce stress levels. Ensure proper posture: Be mindful of your posture while working and sitting. Regarding your blood pressure, we can start with lifestyle modifications: Diet: Reduce sodium intake and eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Exercise: Regular physical activity can help lower blood pressure. Weight management: If you are overweight, losing even a few pounds can make a difference. I'd like you to monitor your blood pressure at home for a week, if possible. You can purchase a home blood pressure monitor at most pharmacies. Record the readings and bring them with you to your next appointment. If the headache doesn’t improve with these measures or worsens, we can discuss other options, including muscle relaxants or referral to a physical therapist. For the blood pressure, if it remains elevated despite lifestyle changes, we may need to consider medication. But let’s start with these conservative measures first. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: That’s… a lot. Stretching… heat packs… watching the salt… it’s hard to remember everything. I can try, though. I used to walk a lot, but… my legs aren't what they used to be. I will try the stretching, and the heat. And I will try to remember about the salt. Can you write that down for me? About the salt and the stretching? And the heat? My memory isn’t as good as it used to be. A little paper with the important things? That would be very helpful, Doctor. And… about how often to take the pain pills? Just when it hurts really bad?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Brum. It is a lot, and it’s perfectly fine to want it written down. Here you go. Headache & Neck Tension Management: Heat/Cold Packs: Apply to neck/shoulders 15-20 min as needed. Gentle Stretching: I will provide a handout with exercises. Over-the-counter pain relief: Ibuprofen or naproxen, as directed on the label. Use only when needed for pain. Home Blood Pressure Monitoring: Record readings daily, bring to next appointment. Regarding the pain pills, take them only when you have a headache and it's interfering with your daily activities. Follow the dosage instructions on the label carefully. Don't take them more often than recommended. I also have some handouts with neck stretching exercises and information on managing stress. Do you feel comfortable with this plan?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that helps a lot. Stretching, heat, and not too much salt. And the pills only when I need them. I think I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I will try my best to follow your instructions. And I will bring the blood pressure readings with me next time. When is next time? I forgot to ask.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Brum. I'm glad I could help. Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks, just to see how you’re doing with the plan and to review your blood pressure readings. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Two weeks… yes, that sounds fine. That gives me time to try the stretching and watch the salt. Two weeks from today? August 16th? Is that right? I have a little trouble keeping track of the days. But August 16th sounds good. Thank you again, Doctor. I think that's all for now. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Yes, August 16th is correct. My assistant will confirm the appointment time before you leave. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Brum. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before then. And remember, we’re here to help. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you in two weeks.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will remember to call if I have any trouble. And I will try my best to follow your instructions. You have a good day now, Doctor Glazewski. .
DOCTOR: You too, Mr. Brum. Have a good day.
