DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… muscle weakness, mostly. It’s been getting worse the last few weeks, and it’s starting to worry me. It feels like… like trying to lift something really heavy even when I'm not.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle weakness. And you said it's been worsening over the last few weeks. Can you tell me a little more about where you’re feeling this weakness?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly in my arms and legs. Not all over, thankfully. My legs feel it more when I walk, like they’re gonna give out. And with my arms, it’s hard to… lift things, like grocery bags, or even just hold my phone for too long. It's not painful, exactly, just… weak. Really tiring, too.
DOCTOR: Alright, arms and legs, more noticeable when walking and with lifting. And you're describing it as tiring as well as weak. Hmm. Have you noticed it happening more at certain times of the day, or after particular activities?
PATIENT: Yeah, actually. It’s definitely worse in the evenings. After work, mostly. I work doing insurance appraisals, auto damage…lots of walking around looking at cars, taking pictures. By the end of the day, I just… feel wiped. And it seems to be worse if I’ve been doing a lot of bending or reaching.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's exacerbated by activity, particularly at the end of the day. And bending and reaching seem to make it worse. Have you noticed any changes in your reflexes, any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet, or any cramping?
PATIENT: No cramping, thankfully. And no numbness or tingling, no. My reflexes… that’s a good question. I haven’t really paid attention, if that makes sense. I don’t think so, though. I mean, nothing that I’ve noticed. Does that sound… right?
DOCTOR: Okay, no cramping or tingling, reflexes haven't been noticeably different. Let's talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve been pretty healthy, honestly. Had the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox, measles… but nothing serious. No diabetes, no heart problems, no… anything like that. I had a pretty bad flu a couple years back, but that was it. And I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time, probably.
DOCTOR: Alright, so generally healthy, childhood illnesses, a flu a couple of years ago, and haven’t seen a doctor regularly. Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never been in the hospital, thankfully. Just… the usual bumps and bruises, broken arm when I was a kid, nothing major. I try to stay away from hospitals if I can. It always feels like bad news when you have to go.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Let's talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family with muscle weakness, neurological issues, or any conditions like multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, or anything like that?
PATIENT: That’s… a tough one. My family’s back in Yemen, mostly. We don’t talk that much. My dad… he had some problems with his joints when he got older, arthritis I think. My mom, she was pretty healthy until… well, until she passed. I don't really know much about any other family health issues, to be honest. It wasn't something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with arthritis, mother passed away, limited information about other family history. And you said you work as an insurance appraiser… can you tell me a little bit more about a typical day?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. So, I get a list of cars that need to be looked at – usually accident damage. I go to the shop or the person's house, inspect the car, take a lot of pictures – front, back, sides, engine, everything. I use an app on my tablet to record everything, estimate the cost of repairs. It’s a lot of walking, bending down to look at things under the car, reaching into the engine compartment. Sometimes I’m climbing over things. I spend a good part of the day on my feet, usually 8 to 10 hours. It’s pretty physical, even though it doesn’t seem like it. And then I have to write up reports, do paperwork… It’s a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, 8-10 hours on your feet, walking, bending, reaching, climbing. Sounds physically demanding. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. Don't smoke, don't chew, nothing. Always thought it was a bad habit. And my mother… she didn’t like it at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, non-smoker. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a drink now and then, but not regularly. Maybe a beer with dinner on the weekend, or a glass of wine if I'm out with friends. Nothing more than that. I don’t need it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol use. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes I take ibuprofen for a headache, if I need it. But that's it. No daily medications, no vitamins, nothing like that. I try to eat healthy, that's about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen as needed, otherwise no medications. Okay, Mr. McKinnon, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds good. I just… I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a few more appointments today.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We'll keep it as brief as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breaths in and out… good. Everything sounds clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Okay, reflexes are… normal. A little diminished in the ankles, but not significantly. Now, can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Like this? It feels… a little weak, if I’m being honest. Like I'm not getting as much strength as I used to. Not a lot of pain, just… not as strong. And it feels harder to hold it for very long.
DOCTOR: Okay, I noticed that as well. Your grip strength is slightly reduced. Now, I'm going to have you stand up and walk a few steps for me, if you're able. Let's see… Just walk normally, like you would walking down the street.
PATIENT: Okay… like this? It feels… a little unsteady, actually. I have to… concentrate more on putting one foot in front of the other than I usually do. Not painful, just… more effort. And my legs feel a little… shaky. I don't usually feel this off-balance.
DOCTOR: Okay, I noticed some mild instability and reduced stride length. Alright, Mr. McKinnon. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some muscle weakness, possibly with some early signs of fatigue. It’s difficult to say exactly what’s causing it without some further testing. We’re going to need to run some blood work to check for things like vitamin deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, and inflammation. We’ll also order a Vitamin D level. We should also consider a referral to a neurologist to further evaluate your condition. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… reasonable. Blood work and a neurologist… okay. I just… how long is all this going to take? And is it going to be expensive? I don’t have insurance, as you can see on the chart. I’m trying to figure out if I can afford all this.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concerns about cost, especially without insurance. Let me see what I can do. The blood work should be relatively affordable – I can write the order for a basic panel and we can explore options at a lower-cost lab if needed. As for the neurologist referral, I'll connect you with someone who offers a sliding scale fee or participates in a patient assistance program. It may take a few weeks to get an appointment, but we’ll work through it. We also have a social worker who can help you navigate these costs and find resources. I want to rule out anything serious, and getting these tests is important. Does that sound acceptable?
