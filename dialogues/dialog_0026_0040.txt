DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain I’ve been getting in my side… my flank, I think it’s called? And I seem to be getting a lot of water infections these days. It’s been happening quite a bit, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, flank pain and frequent urinary infections. I see. Let's start with the flank pain. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Right. It comes and goes, you know? Not constant. Sometimes it’s a dull ache, other times it’s… sharper. It’s mostly on my right side, I think. And it sometimes goes all the way around to my belly. It doesn't seem to be linked to anything specific, eating or moving… just happens. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. So, intermittent pain, mostly on the right side, sometimes a dull ache, sometimes sharper, and it radiates around to your abdomen. Good. And how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s hard to say exactly. I suppose… a good few years now? It comes and goes in waves, you see. There were times when it was barely noticeable, and other times… well, like now, it’s more frequent. Perhaps… three or four years, at least? It's difficult to remember precisely.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be hard to pinpoint with something that comes and goes. A few years… alright. And regarding these urinary infections… how often would you say you’re getting them now?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… It used to be maybe once or twice a year. But these last six months, it’s been… oh, I’d say at least four or five times. I’ve been to the doctor a couple of times for them, getting antibiotics, but they keep coming back. It’s quite bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: Four or five times in the last six months… That is frequent, Mr. Espinueva. And you’ve been treated with antibiotics each time?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Each time I went to my regular doctor, they did a test and then gave me a course of antibiotics. It helps for a little while, but then it comes back. They haven’t really explained why it keeps happening, to be honest. Just… more antibiotics.
DOCTOR: I see. And have you noticed any other symptoms with these infections?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Yes, usually a bit of burning when I go to the toilet. And I feel like I need to go all the time, even if there’s not much there. Sometimes a bit of a lower belly ache too. Nothing too severe, just… uncomfortable. And I feel a bit tired sometimes, but I'm an older man, so that could just be age!
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. Burning with urination, frequent urge to urinate, some lower abdominal discomfort, and fatigue… Okay. Now, let’s talk a little about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, my regular doctor told me a few years ago that my kidneys aren’t quite right. Something about lots of little… pouches, I think he called them? He said it’s something I was born with, not something I did. Polycystic kidney disease, that’s what he said. And I’ve got a bit of high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. Other than that, I'm fairly healthy for my age, I think!
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease and controlled hypertension… alright. Do you know what medication you are taking for your blood pressure, Mr. Espinueva?
PATIENT: Yes, let me see… I have it written down here. It’s… Amlodipine, I believe. Ten milligrams, once a day. I’ve been taking it for… oh, about five years now, I think. It seems to be doing its job, my doctor says my blood pressure is usually quite good.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine 10mg daily. Good. And do you have any allergies to any medications, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. I've never had a reaction to anything. My wife used to keep a list, bless her, but she’s been gone a few years now. I don’t think I’ve ever told any doctor about allergies. No, I don’t have any that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to complete the picture, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a young man, a very long time ago. And I had a hernia operation… maybe twenty years ago? Other than that, nothing significant. Nothing in the last… well, decades, really!
DOCTOR: Appendectomy and hernia repair… Okay. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I’m used to it, seeing doctors from time to time. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll palpate your abdomen. I’ll start with your abdomen. Please let me know immediately if you feel any tenderness. Does this feel tender at all?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright. Ooh, yes… a little bit there, on the right side. Not terribly painful, but… noticeable. Just a bit tender when you press. The rest feels okay, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about here?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… a bit tender too. Not sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. It’s where I usually feel the ache, you see. And it feels a bit… full, maybe? Hard to explain, really. It doesn’t feel normal.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Based on what you’ve told me, and the tenderness I’m feeling during the examination, it sounds like we need to investigate this further. Given your history of recurrent UTIs, your flank pain, and the tenderness in your right flank, I suspect a possible kidney infection, or perhaps something related to your polycystic kidney disease. To be sure, I'd like to order a urine test – a urinalysis – to check for infection, and a blood test to assess your kidney function. I'm also going to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to get a clearer image of your kidneys and rule out any other potential causes for your pain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. If you think it’s necessary, then please do. I just want to get to the bottom of this, to be honest. It’s been going on for too long now. A urine test, blood test, and… what was it, a CT scan? Yes, that sounds good.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll get those orders sent to the lab and radiology department right away. The lab will contact you to schedule the blood draw, and radiology will call to schedule the CT scan. It’s usually a pretty quick process. In the meantime, I recommend you drink plenty of fluids – water is best – to help flush out your system. We'll review the results as soon as they come in, and then we can discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That all sounds very thorough, Doctor. Drinking more water… yes, my wife always told me to do that. Thank you for listening to me, and for taking the time to sort this out. I feel much better knowing we're getting it checked properly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. That’s what I’m here for. I understand it can be worrying when something is going on for a long time, and I'm glad we can start to get some answers. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as a high fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting – please contact the clinic immediately. Here’s a summary of the orders I've placed, and our contact information. Do you have any further questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and attention. I appreciate it very much. I think I'll be on my way now. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. You have a good day as well, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. We’ll be in touch soon. .
