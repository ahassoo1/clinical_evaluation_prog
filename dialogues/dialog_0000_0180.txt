DOCTOR: Right. Well, Hedy Cantorán, 57 years old. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have all day. It's this tiredness. Just…always tired. And it's getting worse, you know? And…and I eat dirt. Not like, a lot, but…I crave it. It's embarrassing. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: "Dirt," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt! Earth. Clay. Whatever you call it. It just…feels good to eat it. Don't look at me like that. It’s not like I’m choosing to, exactly. It’s just…a feeling. And it started, oh, I don't know... a while ago now. It’s hard to remember things these days. Honestly, I don't see what's so strange about it. People do stranger things.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, craving non-food items…that’s called pica. It is unusual, and we need to figure out why you’re having these cravings. And the tiredness…how long has that been going on, specifically?
PATIENT: Specifically? Honestly, doc, I told you, a while. Years, probably. It comes and goes, but it's been worse lately. I just figured it was…getting older. My husband, bless his soul, he always said I was a bit dramatic. Maybe I just need more sleep. Is that it? Can I go now? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: “More sleep” is rarely the whole story, Ms. Cantorán. Years of tiredness and craving dirt…that suggests something else is going on. We need to rule out some possibilities. Do you feel weak?
PATIENT: Weak? Well, yeah, sometimes. Like…carrying groceries is harder than it used to be. And I get winded easily, climbing the stairs. But everyone gets tired, right? I'm not made of steel. It's probably just…normal. Look, are you going to poke and prod me? I don’t like doctors. Too much touching.
DOCTOR: We will need to do a quick physical exam, Ms. Cantorán. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, things like that. It's standard procedure. And yes, there will be some “poking and prodding,” as you put it. It's necessary. Now, have you noticed any changes in your skin, like it being paler than usual?
PATIENT: Pale? I don't know. I haven’t really looked at my skin lately. I get dressed, go to work, come home. It's all a blur. I don't sit around admiring my complexion, if that's what you're asking. And frankly, I'm starting to get a headache. Can we hurry this up? I have a garden that needs weeding. Which, ironically, is where I get the…you know. .
DOCTOR: Right. Well, before we get to the gardening discussion, let’s at least try to get some basic information. Please, have a seat on the table. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’m going to check your abdomen. And just so you know, craving dirt can sometimes be a sign of iron deficiency, which explains the tiredness and weakness. It's important to rule that out. Now, please lie back.
