DOCTOR: “Good morning, Ms. Abdollahi. Welcome to my office. My name is Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is okay to call you Lorana? My… my daughter, she say I need… paper for the place. The senior place. She say I need check-up first. For the paper.
DOCTOR: “Yes, Ms. Abdollahi, you may certainly call me Lorana. It sounds as though your daughter has been very proactive in ensuring you are able to get settled in comfortably. A pre-admission physical examination is quite standard for senior living facilities. We’ll certainly get that completed for you today. To begin, could you tell me a little bit more about why you are hoping to move into a senior living community?
PATIENT: Ah. Yes. My daughter, she work very hard. I no want to be trouble for her. The house… is too much for me now. Big yard. I used to like garden, but… not anymore. My husband… he gone two years now. Big house, just me. Is… lonely.
DOCTOR: “I understand, Ms. Abdollahi. It sounds as though this is a very thoughtful decision, and a natural step given recent changes. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and managing a large home alone can certainly be… overwhelming. We want to ensure this transition is as smooth as possible for you. To help me get a complete picture of your health, could you tell me about any medical conditions you are currently being treated for?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My back… it hurts sometimes. Old age, I think. And my feet… they swell up if I stand too long. The doctor before… he give me water pills. I still take them. And… oh! My blood sugar. It go up sometimes. Not all the time. My daughter, she check it with the little machine.
DOCTOR: "Thank you, Ms. Abdollahi. That’s helpful. So, back pain, swelling in the feet managed with water pills, and intermittent high blood sugar. Do you happen to know the name of the water pill you are taking, or perhaps the dosage?
PATIENT: Water pill… hmm. I have the little bottle at home. White bottle. Little pills, yellow color. I take… one every morning, I think. My daughter, she fill the box for me. I no remember the name. It long name!
DOCTOR: “That's alright, Ms. Abdollahi. We can look that up later. It’s common to forget medication names. Knowing it's a yellow pill, taken once a day, is a good start. Now, regarding your blood sugar, approximately how high does it get when it’s elevated?
PATIENT: Elevated… my daughter, she worry when it go over… one-fifty, maybe? She say that not good. She always tell me, “Mama, you need to watch the sugar!” I try to eat good. Not many sweet things. Just little bit of fruit.
DOCTOR: “That’s good that you're being mindful of your diet. A reading over 150 does warrant some attention. Now, apart from these issues, have you been experiencing any other symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Sometimes I feel tired. Very tired. And… I forget things. Not all things, but… small things. Like where I put my glasses! Or… what I was going to say. Like now.
DOCTOR: "That's perfectly normal as we age, Ms. Abdollahi. Many people experience some fatigue and occasional forgetfulness. We'll explore these further to make sure everything is as it should be. Now, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than what we've already discussed?
PATIENT: Hospital… let me think. Long time ago… when I was young woman, I have… the sickness. Flu, very bad flu. And… when I have my baby, I stay in hospital for few days. That was long time ago. No hospital since then.
DOCTOR: "Thank you. And have you ever had any surgeries, Ms. Abdollahi?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I think… yes. When I was little girl, I have tonsils out. And… oh! My appendix. I have that out when I was young woman, too. That was bad.
DOCTOR: “Alright, tonsils and appendix removed. Now, regarding your family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mama, she have heart trouble when she was old. My papa… he no have nothing. And… my brother, he have the sugar sickness. Like me. He take the medicine for it. He okay now.
DOCTOR: “Thank you, Ms. Abdollahi. That’s helpful to know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I no smoke. Never smoke. My husband, he smoke little bit, but he stop long time ago.
DOCTOR: “Very good. And do you drink alcohol, Ms. Abdollahi?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Little bit of wine with dinner. Just one glass. Not every day. Only when I feel like it.
DOCTOR: “Alright, occasional glass of wine. Now, finally, are you currently taking any other medications besides the water pill, or any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take the vitamins. Every morning. My daughter buy them for me. Little yellow pill, too. And… sometimes I take something for my back pain. When it hurts very bad. But I no take it all the time. Just when I need it.
DOCTOR: “Alright, Ms. Abdollahi, that’s a very thorough overview. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I would like to perform a physical examination. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a brief neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That okay. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: “Excellent. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: "Your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 142/88. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do hear some mild crackling in your lungs, which could indicate some fluid buildup. Your neurological exam is within normal limits. Now, could you please stand and I will listen to your heart again?
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: “Good. Your heart rate increases slightly when you stand, which is normal, but I still hear some crackling in your lungs. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which is also common with age. Now, I’d like to check your feet. Please remove your shoes and socks.”
PATIENT: Okay.
DOCTOR: “I do notice some swelling in both of your feet, and your sensation is slightly diminished in your toes. Your circulation seems adequate. To get a clearer picture of what’s going on, I’d like to order a few blood tests and a chest X-ray. The blood tests will check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and look for any signs of inflammation. The chest X-ray will help us evaluate the crackling in your lungs.”
PATIENT: That okay, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. My daughter, she always say I need to listen to the doctor.
DOCTOR: “Your daughter sounds very wise, Ms. Abdollahi. Alright, I'll have the lab technician draw blood for those tests, and we'll schedule a chest X-ray for you. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to take your water pill as prescribed, and try to limit your salt intake. I’ll also write you a prescription for a multivitamin, as you mentioned taking one already. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I take medicine, always okay. My daughter, she always check the box before she buy it for me.
DOCTOR: "That’s excellent. Okay, Ms. Abdollahi, once we have the results of the blood tests and the X-ray, we'll discuss the best course of action. It's possible this is simply fluid buildup related to age and mild heart congestion, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you check everything good. I just want to be able to go to the senior place. Is that okay? Will the tests say if I can go?
DOCTOR: "That’s a perfectly valid question, Ms. Abdollahi. The tests will help us determine if there are any underlying health concerns that need to be addressed before you transition to the senior living facility. If everything looks stable, we can provide the necessary documentation for you to move forward. We’ll focus on ensuring your health and safety, and if any adjustments are needed, we’ll discuss them together. It’s very possible you will be perfectly fine to move forward as planned. The lab technician will be in shortly to draw your blood, and we’ll schedule that X-ray for you. Do you have any transportation arrangements for the X-ray, or will you need assistance with that?
PATIENT: My daughter, she will take me. She always help me with everything.
DOCTOR: “That’s wonderful, Ms. Abdollahi. It sounds like you have a very supportive daughter. Alright, then. I'll have the lab technician come in, and the receptionist will help you schedule the X-ray before you leave. In the meantime, do you have any other concerns or anything else you'd like to discuss?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's all. Thank you for everything. You very nice.
DOCTOR: “You are very welcome, Ms. Abdollahi. It was a pleasure meeting you. I’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results of your tests. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Have a wonderful day, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.”
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
