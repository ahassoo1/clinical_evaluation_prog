DOCTOR: Good morning, Adyn. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're nineteen years of age. Can you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, to be honest, it's a bit hard to explain. I've just… been having trouble speaking clearly lately. It feels like my words get all… jumbled up, sometimes. I don’t really know when it started, exactly. It just… happened gradually, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds concerning when speech becomes unclear. “Gradually” is helpful information. To clarify, when you say "jumbled up," does that mean you have trouble forming the words, or trouble finding the right words, or something else entirely?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… more trouble forming them, maybe? Like, I know what I want to say, the thought is there, but when I try to say it out loud, it doesn't come out right. It's like my mouth isn’t cooperating, if that makes sense. Sometimes it feels like my tongue is heavy, too. I don’t know if that's connected, though. It’s all a bit… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Adyn. Knowing it’s the formation of the words and the sensation of heaviness in your tongue narrows things down. And it's perfectly alright that it feels "fuzzy"—we'll work to get a clearer picture. Could you tell me roughly how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh… um… that’s the hard part. Like I said, it was gradual. But if I had to guess… maybe a couple of months? It started very subtly, just a little bit of slurring here and there. I didn't really pay much attention to it at first, thought I was just tired. But it's gotten worse over the past few weeks, I’d say. Definitely noticeable now. I don't… I don't really keep track of dates very well, sorry.
DOCTOR: Don’t apologize at all, Adyn. It’s perfectly understandable. “A couple of months, progressively worsening over the last few weeks” is a good timeframe. Has anything specific happened around the time you noticed it starting?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not that I can recall, really. My husband, Leroy, and I have been working a lot on some renovations at the house. We're building a little addition for our daughter’s room. It's been quite physically demanding, lots of lifting and… well, just general construction work, you know? But nothing out of the ordinary, I don't think. No injuries or anything like that. We've just been… busy. I’m a construction manager, so I'm used to a bit of physical work, but this has been extra.
DOCTOR: That’s useful information. The physical demands of the renovations are important to note. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the difficulty speaking?
PATIENT: Um… let me see. Now that you mention it… I have been feeling more tired than usual, even when I get enough sleep. And sometimes my muscles feel a bit weak, especially in my arms and legs. It’s not crippling or anything, just… weaker than they should be, I guess. I thought it was just from the work, to be honest. I haven't really connected it to the speech thing until now. Also, I’ve been having a bit of trouble swallowing sometimes, but it’s very occasional. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that, Adyn. Fatigue, muscle weakness, and occasional difficulty swallowing are all potentially relevant details. I'd like to ask about your medical history now, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I've always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. But no major health problems. My husband Leroy says I'm a sturdy Jamaican woman, always bouncing around! I have Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly for check-ups, but nothing’s ever been… wrong, exactly. I do have a bit of trouble remembering what they tell me sometimes, though. I’m sorry. It’s like things just go in one ear and out the other. My husband usually comes with me to appointments to help me keep track of things.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Adyn. It's good to hear you've generally been healthy. And it’s excellent that you have Leroy supporting you—that’s very helpful. Do you have any family history of neurological conditions, such as stroke, Parkinson’s disease, or multiple sclerosis?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a difficult question. My family is quite large, and a lot of them live back in Jamaica. I haven't really kept track of everyone's medical history. I know my grandmother had some problems with her legs when she was older, but I don’t know what it was. And my uncle, on my mother’s side, had a stroke a few years ago, I think. But other than that, I can’t really say. It’s not something we talk about much, to be honest. I'm sorry I can’t be more helpful. It’s not that we’re secretive, just… distant. You know?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Adyn. Family history can be difficult to ascertain, and you've provided what information you have, which is helpful. Now, let's talk about medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Not really. Just a multivitamin every now and then, that's it. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but not very often. I try to avoid taking medication if I can, honestly. I believe in letting my body heal itself whenever possible. And I don’t have any known allergies, thankfully. Never had a reaction to anything. Leroy always checks the labels, just to be safe, though. He's very cautious.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No regular medications or known allergies is good to know. Finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well… as I mentioned, I work as a construction manager. It's a pretty active job, lots of being on my feet, supervising crews, making sure everything is running smoothly. My husband, Leroy, and I live in a rural area, so we spend a lot of time outdoors, working on our property. We have a small garden, and we enjoy spending time with our daughter whenever she visits. We don’t really drink or smoke, and we try to eat a healthy diet, mostly home-cooked meals. It's a simple life, but we enjoy it. I guess I'm a pretty straightforward kind of person. Is that what you mean by lifestyle?
DOCTOR: Yes, Adyn, that is exactly what I meant. Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I'm happy to do whatever I can to help. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I hope you can figure out what's wrong with me. It's just a bit… worrying, you know? But I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, and I will do my best. First, I’ll check your vital signs—blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I'd like to check your neurological function. Can you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. This is… easy enough. Just a bit tiring, maybe. My eyes aren't as sharp as they used to be, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to test your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Okay. Is that okay? It feels… a bit harder than it used to be. I hope I’m squeezing hard enough. I don’t want to disappoint you.
DOCTOR: Your grip is slightly diminished bilaterally, but not significantly. Now, let's check your reflexes. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, Achilles reflexes are also 2+ bilaterally. That's within normal limits. Finally, I’d like to examine your tongue. Your tongue appears slightly… fasciculating, and there is some mild atrophy on the left side. It's subtle, but present. I'm also noting some mild difficulty with articulation during speech assessment. I've completed the physical examination. Based on the findings—the slight muscle weakness, tongue fasciculations, difficulty with articulation, and the gradual onset of symptoms—I have some initial thoughts, but I’d like to order some blood tests and potentially an MRI to get a clearer picture. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Blood tests and an MRI… It doesn't sound good, does it? But… yes. Yes, that’s alright. If that’s what you think is necessary, then I trust your judgment, Doctor. I want to know what’s wrong with me, even if it’s bad news. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Anything I should avoid? I'm a bit worried now, to be honest. I hope it’s not something too terrible. Should I tell Leroy? He’ll be very concerned.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re worried, Adyn. It’s better to be thorough, and these tests will help us narrow down the possibilities. I don't want to alarm you prematurely, as there are several potential causes for your symptoms, and many of them are treatable. We need more information before we can make any definitive conclusions. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity until we have the test results. Continue to eat a healthy diet, and get plenty of rest. And yes, absolutely, you should tell Leroy. He’s your support system, and he deserves to be informed. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a vitamin B12 level. The MRI will focus on the brain and cervical spine. The lab work should be available within a couple of days, and the MRI will likely take a week or so to schedule. I will personally contact you as soon as the results are in to discuss them and formulate a plan. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable, I suppose. Avoiding strenuous activity and getting rest, I can do that. And yes, I’ll definitely tell Leroy. He’ll want to know. A week or so for the MRI… that seems like a long time to wait, but I understand. Um… yes, I do have a question. You mentioned several possibilities… are there any particular things you’re thinking of? I don’t want to be a bother, but… it’s just… I’m a bit scared. What are the worst-case scenarios? I know I shouldn’t ask, but I need to know. I need to be prepared. It’s just… my grandmother… she had some problems with her speech later in life, and… well, it wasn’t very pleasant. I hope it's not something like that.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly reasonable to want to know what we're considering, Adyn, and I respect your need to be prepared. Given your symptoms and the physical exam findings, we need to rule out several possibilities, including vitamin deficiencies, neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , and less common causes like certain infections. I understand your concern about your grandmother’s experience. It’s important to note that there is a wide spectrum of neurological conditions, and not all of them are progressive or debilitating. Many are treatable or manageable with appropriate intervention. I want to emphasize that we don’t have enough information yet to make a diagnosis. Jumping to conclusions would be irresponsible. The tests will provide valuable clues, and we’ll discuss the results thoroughly when they become available. Please try not to dwell on worst-case scenarios until we have a clearer picture. Do you understand?
