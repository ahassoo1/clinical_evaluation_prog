DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s about these cholesterol numbers, I reckon. My daughter, bless her heart, she got a letter from the lab and insisted I come in. Said they weren’t right. I don’t rightly know much about it, to be honest. She worries so.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, daughters often do. Let’s have a look at these numbers then. It is good she’s being proactive, I suppose. Do you have any idea what specifically she was concerned about?
PATIENT: No, not a clue. She just said “high cholesterol” and “needs to be checked.” I eat pretty normal, I think. Meat and potatoes, mostly. A little bit of fish now and then. Not much sweets, though my wife – rest her soul – she used to bake a mean apple pie. But that was years ago now. I haven't touched one of those in… oh, goodness, must be ten years. Is it bad? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: “Normal” is a rather subjective term, Mr. Bohnett. And it is important to be specific. We need to look at the different types of cholesterol – HDL, LDL, triglycerides… Have you ever had these levels checked before?
PATIENT: No, never. Doctors didn’t fuss over things like that when I was a young man. Just checked your blood pressure, maybe, if you were feeling faint. This is all new to me, honestly. HDL, LDL… sounds like alphabet soup. What are those things, exactly? And what’s a “trigly-ser-ide”? I’m gonna need you to speak slow, Doctor. My ears aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s start with the basics, then. Cholesterol is a type of fat that’s essential for your body to function, but too much of certain types can build up in your arteries, causing problems. Think of HDL as the “good” cholesterol – it helps remove the other type from your blood. LDL is the “bad” cholesterol that contributes to buildup. And triglycerides are another type of fat in your blood. We want all these levels to be within a certain range. Now, according to the lab report here… your LDL is elevated. Quite elevated, actually. Have you noticed any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness lately?
PATIENT: No, not a bit. I feel… well, I feel my age, naturally. A little creaky in the mornings, but that’s just the arthritis acting up. But no chest pain or dizziness. I’ve always been pretty strong, up until recently, of course. I used to work construction, you know? Lots of lifting, lots of walking. Built like a brick wall, they used to say. So, this cholesterol… it’s causing this even though I feel fine? That doesn’t seem right. Is there something wrong with the test, maybe?
DOCTOR: Tests aren’t usually wrong, Mr. Bohnett, although errors can occur. But your levels are significantly above the recommended range. It doesn't necessarily mean you'll feel bad immediately. This is often a silent condition, developing over time. Now, let’s review your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, heart disease, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been lucky, I suppose. A few colds, a touch of the flu here and there, but nothing serious. My wife, she had a bit of trouble with her blood pressure towards the end, but I never had any problems myself. Doctor said it was probably just stress, worrying about me working those dangerous construction jobs. We were married for fifty-two years, you know. Fifty-two wonderful years. She always took care of me.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Bohnett. While a long and happy marriage is commendable, it doesn't negate the need to address your current cholesterol levels. Now, do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No, not a single one. Never have. I always figured a good night’s sleep and a hearty breakfast was medicine enough. Though, I do take a little glucosamine for my knees, that's about it. And sometimes a little something for heartburn, when I eat something spicy. But that’s just over the counter stuff. You know, from the drugstore. Nothing fancy. Is this cholesterol… is it something I need pills for? I don’t like taking pills. They always make me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: It’s often managed with medication, yes. Statins, usually. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We need to rule out other potential causes first. Now, what about your diet specifically?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, meat and potatoes mostly. I like a good steak, now and then. And fried chicken. My daughter, she’s always telling me to eat more fish and vegetables. She makes a mean salmon, I’ll give her that. I try, but it’s just not the same as a good, solid piece of beef. I do drink a glass of milk with breakfast, and maybe a cup of coffee. I used to drink a little bit, just a little, of beer with dinner, but I cut back on that a few years ago. Doctor told me it wasn't good for my… well, for something or other. Can’t rightly remember what. I do love my gravy, though. Everything’s better with gravy.
DOCTOR: So, a fairly typical diet, then. And how much physical activity do you get these days?
PATIENT: Not as much as I used to. I used to be able to climb those scaffolding poles like a monkey. These knees… they just don’t allow for it anymore. I mostly sit around, watch the television, read the newspaper. My daughter takes me for a little walk around the block now and then, but it’s not much of a workout, I tell you what. It’s more of a stroll, really. I used to garden, but bending over is too much trouble these days. It’s hard getting old, Doctor. It really is. Everything starts to ache.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bohnett. I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and feel your abdomen. It won’t take long. And then we'll discuss possible treatment options. If you’ll just have a seat.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. My wife always said I was a good patient. Though, I always complained about the cold stethoscope.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, although slightly diminished. Pulse is a little weak, but regular. Blood pressure is elevated: 148/85. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Your blood pressure is a little high, and your pulse is somewhat weak. These findings, combined with your cholesterol levels, suggest we need to take this seriously. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My wife always said I could eat anything. Though, I do get a little heartburn if I eat something too spicy, like I said. But that’s just a little discomfort, nothing serious. I never had a bad reaction to any pills before, not that I’ve ever taken any regularly. Now, what sort of pills are we talking about? Are they big pills? Small pills? I don’t like swallowing big pills. They always get stuck in my throat.
DOCTOR: Statins come in various sizes, Mr. Bohnett. We can discuss options to find one that’s manageable. But the important thing is to lower your cholesterol. We need to reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke. Now, I’d like to order a lipid panel to confirm your levels, and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function. And I also recommend an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: EKG? What's that? Is that one of those tests where they stick things to your chest? And what about these panels… are they going to take a lot of blood? I don't like needles, Doctor. Never have. My daughter always has to come with me when I get blood work done. She’s a good girl, my daughter. Always looking out for me. Will these tests tell you how bad things are? Are we talking about surgery? I really don't want surgery.
DOCTOR: An EKG is a simple test, Mr. Bohnett. We attach small electrodes to your chest to record your heart’s electrical activity. It’s painless. And yes, the panels will require a blood draw. A standard amount – a few vials. As for surgery… we are nowhere near discussing surgery. We're simply gathering information to determine the best course of action. I want to emphasize that lifestyle modifications – diet and exercise – are crucial. We’ll start with that, and then discuss medication if necessary. Now, I'm going to order these tests, and my nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for us to review the results. Do you have any allergies to latex?
PATIENT: Latex? Hmm... I don't think so. My wife used to use those rubber gloves for washing dishes, and I never had any trouble with them. Though, I did have a bit of a rash once, when I was a boy, but I don’t rightly recall what caused it. It was a long time ago. It’s good to be thorough, though, checking for allergies. So, this nurse… she’ll call me to set up another appointment? When will I hear from her? And what if these tests show something really bad? Will you be the one to tell me?
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will call you within the next few business days to schedule a follow-up. And yes, I will be the one to review the results with you and discuss the next steps. While I understand your concern, jumping to conclusions won’t help. We are simply being proactive. I want to reiterate that lifestyle changes are paramount. Focus on reducing your intake of saturated fats and cholesterol, and try to incorporate some gentle exercise into your routine. Now, do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything pretty well, Doctor. Though, I’m still a little worried about these pills, if we have to take them. And all these tests… it’s a lot to take in. But I trust your judgment. You seem like a very capable doctor. My wife would have liked you. She always liked doctors who took the time to explain things. Thank you, Doctor. I guess I’ll just wait for that nurse to call.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bohnett. You’re welcome. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. .
