DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. I’m Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Piet. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's this cough. It just won't go away, and my heart… well, it hasn't been the best lately, you see. It feels… full. Like there’s too much in there, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. A cough that won’t go away and feeling of fullness in your chest… alright. Let’s start with the cough. How long have you had it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it started, I’d say, about three weeks ago, maybe a little longer. At first, I thought it was just a cold, you know? But it hasn't gotten better. It actually feels a little worse when I lie down, especially at night. It wakes me up.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks, worsening with lying down, waking you up at night. Is the cough producing any mucus, and if so, what color is it?
PATIENT: Yes, it does. There is mucus. It’s… mostly clear, I think. Sometimes it's a little bit white. I haven't coughed up anything… colorful, if you know what I mean. Not yellow or green, thank goodness. Just clear or whitish. It isn’t a lot of mucus, but it's there. Enough to be annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, clear to whitish mucus, not a large amount, but enough to be bothersome. And you mentioned your heart feeling full. Can you describe that sensation a bit more?
PATIENT: It's hard to explain. It's not pain, exactly. More like… pressure. A heaviness. Like someone is sitting on my chest. And it gets worse when I try to do anything, even just walking to the kitchen. And sometimes… my ankles swell up at the end of the day. They get really puffy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does. Pressure, heaviness, worse with exertion, and ankle swelling… Okay. Have you noticed any shortness of breath with this?
PATIENT: Oh yes, yes, definitely. It’s not like I can’t breathe at all, but I get winded very easily now. Even climbing the few steps to my porch… I have to stop and rest. And lately, I’ve been needing to use extra pillows when I sleep, to prop myself up. Otherwise, I feel like I'm… drowning, almost. It's a very strange feeling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Shortness of breath, worsened with exertion, needing extra pillows to sleep… Do you have any chest pain with this shortness of breath, or at any other time?
PATIENT: No, not really. Not pain, exactly. Sometimes a little tightness, like a band around my chest, but not a sharp pain. It comes and goes, but it’s not something I’d call “painful”. More… uncomfortable, really. It happens sometimes when I’m coughing a lot, I think. But mostly just the heaviness and the shortness of breath.
DOCTOR: Okay, no sharp chest pain, just tightness sometimes with coughing, heaviness and shortness of breath. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, such as heart problems, lung problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, well, about ten years ago, the doctor told me I have something wrong with my heart. Congestive heart failure, he called it. I take water pills now, and something else… a little pink one. I don't remember the name of it. I also had pneumonia a few years back, but I got over it. And arthritis, of course. Old age, you know? But the heart is the main thing. And now this cough... it feels like it's connected, somehow.
DOCTOR: Alright, congestive heart failure, currently taking water pills and a pink medication , history of pneumonia, and arthritis. Knowing that you have congestive heart failure is very helpful. Let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. It’s probably just my heart acting up, like I said. It gets worse with the weather, you know? But listen away, please. I want to get this sorted out. It’s tiring to feel like this all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90. Your heart rate is regular, but I do hear a bit of crackling in your lungs, especially on the lower lobes. And your ankles do have some noticeable swelling, plus some pitting edema when I press on them. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it does seem like your heart failure may be contributing to your symptoms, and the cough could be related to fluid buildup in your lungs. We'll need to do some further testing to confirm this and see how well your heart is functioning. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work, including a BNP level, which can help assess your heart failure status. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. A chest X-ray and blood work… I’ll do whatever I need to do. Is this something serious? Is my heart getting worse? I just want to know what's happening, you see. And if there’s something I can do to feel better. I get so tired of feeling like this all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay. It's understandable to be concerned, Nadene. The tests will help us determine the extent of the fluid buildup and how well your heart is functioning. Based on what you've described, it's possible your heart failure is becoming more symptomatic, but we need the test results to be sure. In the meantime, it's important to monitor your symptoms closely. Weigh yourself every morning, and let us know if you gain more than two pounds in a day or five pounds in a week. Also, pay attention to your breathing and let us know if you experience any new or worsening shortness of breath. I will also have the nurse review your current medications to ensure they are optimized for your heart failure. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Not that I know of, anyway. I've taken a lot of different things over the years. The doctor gave me some pink pills, like I said, and those don't bother me. And I’ve had some white ones before, for my blood pressure. Never had a reaction, thank goodness. Just a little tired sometimes, but that's old age, right? I don't remember anything specific that I'm allergic to.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known drug allergies. Now, let's try to identify that pink medication you mentioned. Can you describe the pill to me?
PATIENT: Let me see… It's small, round, and pink. A sort of… cherry pink, if that makes sense. And it has… little letters on it, but I can’t read them very well anymore. I think there’s a ‘B’ in there somewhere, maybe? And maybe a number? It's hard to tell. My eyes aren't what they used to be. But it's definitely small, round, and pink. I take it every morning with my water pill.
DOCTOR: Alright. Small, round, cherry pink pill with a possible "B" and a number. Okay, it sounds like that might be furosemide 20mg. Is that a possibility?
PATIENT: Furo… Furose… Yes! Yes, that’s it! Furosemide! That’s the pink pill. You're a clever one, Doctor! Yes, that's exactly it. I take that and the other white pill… I think that one is Lisinopril. Does that sound right? My daughter helps me keep track of things, but I try to remember too.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. So, you're currently taking furosemide 20mg and Lisinopril. That's good information. Okay, Nadene. We've covered a lot. To recap, you’ve been experiencing a cough for three weeks that worsens when lying down, accompanied by a feeling of fullness in your chest, shortness of breath, and ankle swelling. You have a history of congestive heart failure and are taking furosemide and Lisinopril. I'm going to order that chest X-ray and blood work, including a BNP level, as we discussed. The nurse will get you scheduled for those tests. In the meantime, please monitor your weight and symptoms closely, and let us know if anything changes. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I just want to feel better, you see. I get so tired. But I’ll keep an eye on my weight and call if anything changes. And thank you for figuring out what that pink pill was! I was starting to worry I was forgetting everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re very welcome, Nadene. We’ll get to the bottom of this and work towards getting you feeling better. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule the X-ray. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns at all. Have a good day, and we’ll talk soon.
