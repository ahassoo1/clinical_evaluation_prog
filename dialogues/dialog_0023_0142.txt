DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lawther. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Right, well... it's my head. Been gettin' these headaches. Pretty bad ones, actually. And I get all sweaty when they hit, and my heart kinda... races. It's been happenin' on and off for a while now, I think. Honestly, the details are a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: "On and off for a while," you say. That's… not particularly helpful, Mr. Lawther. Let's try to be more precise. When did you first notice these headaches?
PATIENT: Yeah, I get that. Fuzzy is… a good word for it. Hmm… let me think. It was… before the divorce, definitely. So, before… uh… early 2024, maybe? Or late 2023? It’s hard to say. They weren't constant then, just now and again. More frequent lately, though. A lot more. I wish I could pinpoint it better, sorry.
DOCTOR: "More frequent lately." Alright. And when you say "lately," how often are we talking?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. That's a good question. Um… at least once a week, I'd say. Sometimes more. Last week it was… three times, maybe? And they seem to be gettin’ worse each time. Longer, more intense, y'know? I haven’t kept a proper record or anything. Just… tryin' to get through 'em. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: "Tryin' to get through 'em." I understand. And can you describe the headaches themselves?
PATIENT: Right, okay. Uh… it's not like a normal headache, if that makes sense. It's… feels like pressure, all over my head, kinda. And it throbs, definitely. And like a really bad tension headache, but… worse. And like I said, the sweating, and my heart feels like it's gonna beat outta my chest. It makes me feel kinda… sick, too. Nauseous. I usually just gotta lie down in a dark room 'til it passes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Pressure all over, throbbing, nausea, and associated with sweating and palpitations. Have you noticed any specific triggers for these headaches?
PATIENT: Triggers? Hmm… that’s a tough one. I haven’t really noticed anything specific, no. I mean, sometimes they just… happen. I’ve tried to think about it, y'know? Like, if it's stress, or food, or anything. But I can't really put my finger on it. I work in a warehouse, so it's physical work, but I've been doin' that for years. I haven't changed anything about my routine recently, not that I can recall. Sorry, I'm not much help.
DOCTOR: "Not much help," you say. Well, simply describing the symptoms is helpful, Mr. Lawther. However, a lack of identifiable triggers does complicate matters. Let's move on. Any family history of headaches, migraines, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Right. Uh… my mother used to get headaches, yeah. Not as bad as these, I don't think. Just… regular tension headaches, mostly. And my grandfather, on my dad's side, he had… something with his nerves, I think? But I don't know what exactly. Old age thing, I reckon. Nobody really talked about it much. It was a long time ago. I don't think anything serious, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Maternal history of tension headaches, and a paternal grandfather with an unspecified neurological condition. And what about your social history, Mr. Lawther?
PATIENT: Social history… Oh, boy. Uh… divorced, as you know. Live alone. Don't really have a lot of close friends. I don't drink much, maybe a beer or two a week. Don’t smoke. I used to go to the gym a bit, but not so much lately. Work keeps me pretty busy, mostly. It’s… pretty quiet, to be honest. Not much going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh… nope, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I haven't taken much medication in my life, to be honest. Just… painkillers for the headaches sometimes. Ibuprofen, that kinda thing. Doesn't really do much, though. Doesn’t make them go away, just… takes the edge off, maybe. No known allergies, no.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lawther. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll do a neurological assessment – check your reflexes, coordination, and things like that. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That sounds… good. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I'm happy to cooperate. I just want to figure out what's goin' on with my head. Hopefully it's not anything too serious. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat here. First, I’ll take your blood pressure. 140 over 90. Slightly elevated. Heart rate is 88, regular rhythm. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal, bilateral and symmetric. Now, I'm going to assess your cranial nerves. Cranial nerves are intact. Finally, I'm going to check your coordination. Coordination is slightly impaired. Alright, Mr. Lawther. That's all for the physical exam. I'm going to need to order some blood work, including a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. I’m also going to order a CT scan of your head, just to rule out any serious underlying issues.
PATIENT: A CT scan? Oh. That sounds… serious. Is it somethin' you're worried about, Doctor? I mean, is it likely to be somethin' bad? I was hopin’ it was just stress or somethin’. I don’t really like hospitals much, if I'm bein' honest. But I'll do whatever you think is best, of course. Just… tell me straight, yeah? What are we lookin' for?
DOCTOR: Mr. Lawther, I understand your apprehension. A CT scan is a precautionary measure. Given the frequency and intensity of your headaches, combined with the slight impairment in your coordination, it's prudent to rule out any structural abnormalities – things like tumors, aneurysms, or bleeding in the brain. It doesn't mean I expect to find anything serious, but we need to be thorough. The blood work will help us assess your overall health and rule out any infections or metabolic imbalances that could be contributing to your symptoms. We are looking for any evidence of a serious underlying cause for your headaches. It’s far more likely to be tension headaches or migraines, but we need to be certain. I assure you, we will discuss the results as soon as they are available. And I will explain everything in detail. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay. Right. Yeah, I understand. Precautionary. That makes… a bit of sense, I suppose. It's just… a bit scary, to be honest. But you're right, gotta be sure. So, what happens next? Do I gotta go to the hospital right now? And how long will it take to get the results? Will you call me, or… what's the plan? I'm not great with all this medical stuff, sorry.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Lawther. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious in this situation. You do not need to go to the hospital right now. I'm going to write you a referral for an outpatient CT scan at the imaging center down the street – 123 Main Street. They're open tomorrow morning. You can schedule an appointment at your convenience. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. I will call you as soon as I have them. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a stronger pain reliever – Naproxen 500mg twice daily as needed for your headaches. And I also recommend avoiding any strenuous activity until we have the results of the CT scan. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Naproxen, okay. And avoid strenuous activity… right. That's… doable, I guess. Work's pretty physical, but I can take it easy for a few days. So, I just go to this imaging center, schedule an appointment, and they'll do the scan? And then you'll call me when the results are in? No need to come back here first? That sounds… good, actually. Less hassle. Just… how much does all this cost? I don't have insurance, as you know. I'm a bit worried about the bill.
DOCTOR: Yes, you simply go to the imaging center, schedule an appointment, and they will perform the scan. They will then send the results directly to me. You do not need to return here first. Regarding the cost, I understand your concern. Unfortunately, I don’t have precise figures readily available. The cost of the CT scan and the blood work will depend on the imaging center’s fees and the laboratory charges. I recommend contacting the imaging center and the laboratory directly to inquire about their pricing and potential payment options. Some facilities offer financial assistance programs or discounts for uninsured patients. I can also provide you with a statement outlining the services I have provided, which you may be able to use when negotiating payment with the imaging center and the laboratory. I'll have my nurse print you a cost estimate for my services. I wish I could offer more precise figures, Mr. Lawther, but it’s unfortunately outside of my control. Do you have any other questions before we conclude today’s consultation?
PATIENT: Okay. Right. I’ll call the imaging center, ask about the costs. And see if they have any payment plans. That’s… helpful, I guess. A statement for your services might help too. No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. I appreciate you explainin' everything so clearly, and not… brushin' me off. It’s been a bit of a stressful day, to be honest. I’ll get the scan done tomorrow, and hopefully, it’s nothin' serious. Thanks again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Lawther. I understand your anxiety, and I assure you, we will do everything we can to determine the cause of your headaches and provide you with appropriate treatment. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. My nurse will be with you shortly to provide the cost estimate and schedule a follow-up appointment once we have the results of the scan. Take care, Mr. Lawther. And try to rest. .
