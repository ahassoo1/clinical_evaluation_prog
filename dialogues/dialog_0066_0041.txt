DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Asthore. I'm Dr. Condray. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s… my strength. It’s been getting weaker, you see. Not all at once, but little by little. It’s making things… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Gradual weakness can be concerning, so it's good you came in to get it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. It’s mostly in my legs, I think. Walking is… harder now. I used to be very active, you know? Always working, always moving. Now, I have to stop and rest more often. And sometimes… sometimes my feet feel numb. Not all the time, but it happens.
DOCTOR: Alright. Weakness in the legs and some numbness in your feet… that gives us a starting point. When did you first start noticing this weakness, Mr. Asthore?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s been… maybe six months now? It started very slowly, so I didn’t pay much attention at first. I thought it was just getting old, you know? But it kept getting worse, and now it’s… well, it’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. Six months of gradual worsening is definitely something we need to investigate. Has this weakness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Some days are better than others. But mostly… it’s there. Even on the good days, it’s not like it used to be. It’s hard to explain. Like… a heavy feeling. And sometimes, it feels like my legs just won’t listen to me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fluctuating weakness with a heavy feeling and difficulty with coordination. That's helpful. Do you notice anything that makes it worse – like specific activities, time of day, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Walking a long distance makes it much worse, of course. And… when it’s hot, it feels worse too. The heat really tires me out. And… sometimes, if I get very stressed, I feel weaker. Not always, but often. It’s like my body just shuts down a little.
DOCTOR: Alright. Walking, heat, and stress seem to be triggers. Have you noticed any pain associated with this weakness, Mr. Asthore?
PATIENT: No, doctor. No pain. That’s what’s so strange. It’s not like a muscle ache or anything. It’s just… weak. And numb sometimes. No pain at all. That’s why I didn’t worry about it at first, you see? I thought, “No pain, no problem.” But now…
DOCTOR: I see. That's a valid point. Absence of pain doesn't necessarily mean there isn't something going on. Let's talk a little bit more broadly now. Have you noticed any changes in your balance, or have you had any falls recently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. My balance… it’s not as good. I stumble sometimes, especially when I’m tired. I haven’t fallen completely yet, thank goodness. But I’ve had to grab onto things a few times to steady myself. It scares my wife. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: I’m glad you haven’t had a fall, but stumbling is definitely something we need to address. Okay, Mr. Asthore, let’s move onto some other questions. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh. That… that’s a little personal, Doctor. But… yes. A little. It’s… harder to go sometimes. And I have to… go more often. It’s not a big problem, but it’s different than it used to be. I haven’t told my wife yet.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Asthore. It's important information. Changes in bowel and bladder function can sometimes be related to nerve issues. Alright, one more question for now. Have you experienced any unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No, doctor. No weight loss. If anything, I’ve gained a little weight. My wife keeps telling me I need to watch what I eat! She’s a good woman, always looking after me. But no, no weight loss at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Alright, Mr. Asthore, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, please? My legs are a little sensitive today.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Asthore. I will be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 72, and temperature is normal at 98.6. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs and feet. Your reflexes are a little diminished in both legs, but not significantly. Now, can you please lie on your back?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. That’s alright. A little uncomfortable, but alright. Just let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Okay, Mr. Asthore, can you try to push your legs against my hands?
PATIENT: I’m trying, doctor. It’s… it’s a little difficult. It feels… weak.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s helpful to know. Okay, and can you point your toes up and down for me?
PATIENT: Like this, doctor? It’s… a little slow. And it feels… clumsy. I don’t move as easily as before.
DOCTOR: Okay. And now, I’m going to check the sensation in your feet. Can you tell me when you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes… I feel it now. But… here… no. Not really. It’s… like a tingling. Or… nothing at all.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you, Mr. Asthore. So, your reflexes are diminished, there’s some weakness in your legs, and some decreased sensation in your feet. Given your symptoms – gradual onset of weakness, numbness, balance issues, and changes in bowel habits – and based on my exam, I'm concerned about possible peripheral neuropathy. It's a condition where the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord are damaged, which can cause these types of symptoms. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, vitamin B12 levels, and thyroid function tests. We also might consider an electromyography and nerve conduction study, which can help assess the function of your nerves. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Peripheral neuropathy… that sounds… serious, doctor. Blood tests and… EMG? That sounds complicated. But… if that’s what you think is best, then yes. Do what you need to do. I just want to know what’s going on, and hopefully… get better. What do I need to do next?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Asthore. It can sound daunting, but these tests will help us get a clearer picture of what's going on. The blood tests are relatively simple – just a quick draw of blood. The EMG involves placing small electrodes on your skin to measure the electrical activity of your muscles. It can be a little uncomfortable, but it doesn't usually last long. Okay, I’m going to have the nurse draw the blood for the tests. We can schedule the EMG for next week. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any activities that worsen your symptoms. And please, be careful to avoid falls. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, doctor. Never had any problems with medications before. Just… a little worried about all this. But thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate that. Be careful to avoid falls… my wife will be happy to hear me say that. She worries so much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Asthore. It's completely understandable to be worried, and I'm here to help you every step of the way. We’ll get these tests done and figure out the best course of action. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. I'll have her schedule the EMG for you as well. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me right now before I let you get dressed?
PATIENT: No, doctor. I think you’ve covered everything. Just… thank you again. You’ve been very kind and patient. I’ll wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Asthore. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Get dressed at your own pace. I'll see you soon. .
PATIENT: Thank you, doctor. I will.
