DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… It’s… the pee. Yes, the pee is hard. It doesn't come easy, you know? Like… pushing too much. I don’t remember exactly when it started, but it’s been a little while now. It’s just… difficult.
DOCTOR: I see. So you’re experiencing difficulty initiating urination – it feels like you have to strain to start, and it’s been going on for a little while. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, strain… that's a good word. It feels like I have to push, like when… well, when you're trying to get something going that just won’t. And it’s not always bad, sometimes it’s okay, other times… not so much. It’s just… unpredictable. I don't know if that makes sense. My husband, he says I take a long time in the bathroom sometimes, but I don’t really notice.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Stoffregen. Unpredictability is very helpful to know. And it's good your husband has noticed a change in how long you’re in the bathroom – that's valuable information. You mentioned it’s not always bad – can you describe what it feels like when it is better?
PATIENT: Well, when it's good… it just goes. Like normal, you know? Not much thinking about it. Just… regular. No pushing, no waiting, no… worrying. It’s been a long time since it’s been just regular, though. Mostly it’s this… effort. And sometimes, after I do go, it doesn't feel like all of it comes out. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, generally, when it's good, it flows easily with no effort, and you feel completely empty afterward. But more often, you’re experiencing difficulty starting, and you don't feel fully relieved when you’re finished. Have you noticed any changes in the stream itself – is it weak, or does it stop and start?
PATIENT: Oh, a stream… Hmm. Let me think. Sometimes… yes, I think it's weaker. Not always, but… sometimes it feels like it's not as strong as it used to be. And yes, you're right, it does stop and start sometimes. Like… little bits, then nothing, then little bits again. It’s embarrassing to talk about, really.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be embarrassed, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s my job to listen, and this is all very helpful information. Now, aside from the difficulty and changes in the stream, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Oh, dear. Let me see… I haven't really thought about it. Well, I get up at night sometimes to pee. Not every night, but… a couple of times a week maybe? And I thought that was just old age, you know? Husband says I drink too much tea before bed. But… no, I don't think so. Nothing else really… Just the pee.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're getting up a couple of times a week to urinate at night, which you’ve attributed to drinking tea, but we’ll consider that as well. And you haven't experienced any pain or burning with urination, no fever, no blood in the urine, and no increased thirst?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Definitely no burning. And no fever… I would know if I had a fever. And no blood, thankfully. Just… this. It’s just annoying, really. Makes me feel old and… helpless, I suppose. My husband is very good about helping, but I don't want to bother him all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s completely valid to feel frustrated and want to maintain your independence. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… That’s a long time ago now. Let me see… I had a little bit of blood pressure trouble years ago, but the doctor said it was fine after I started walking every day. And… I don't think so. No diabetes. Husband always says I eat too much fruit, but… no. I think that's it. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. So, you had some elevated blood pressure in the past that was managed with walking, and no history of diabetes. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Oh! Yes. I had my gallbladder out. A long time ago. When I was… oh, goodness, I don't even remember exactly when. Must have been… forty years ago? Something like that. And… I don’t think so, no. Just the gallbladder. It didn’t bother me too much. They fixed it and I went home.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gallbladder removal forty years ago, and no other surgeries. Now, let's talk about your family. Do any of your close family members – your parents, siblings, or children – have any medical conditions, like kidney problems or bladder issues?
PATIENT: Oh, family… Now, that's a hard one. Everyone is gone now, sadly. My mother… she had a bit of arthritis, I think. And my father… he was a strong man, mostly healthy. No, I don’t remember anyone having trouble with… with the pee, like me. Everyone just… got old and faded away, you know? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's difficult to recall details from so long ago. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And alcohol… just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Mostly on Sundays. Husband likes his beer, though. He's a good man. But me? Not much. Never really liked the taste, to be honest. Just a little sip now and then.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no smoking and very minimal alcohol consumption. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... Just a little bit of something for my knees. They get a bit creaky, you know? The doctor gave it to me a while back. And sometimes I take something for… well, just for aches and pains. That’s it, I think. Nothing else. Husband reminds me to take them every day, he's very good about that.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, you’re taking medication for your knees and occasionally for aches and pains. Thank you, Ms. Stoffregen, that was very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, doctor. I trust you. Just tell me what you need me to do. I’m not very strong anymore, you know, but I can manage.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you wouldn’t mind, could you please lie down on the table for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Is this alright? I’m not very flexible anymore.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is perfectly fine, Ms. Stoffregen. Please don't worry about it at all. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, then I’ll do a gentle abdominal exam. I’ll also be checking your reflexes. It may be a little bit uncomfortable, but I'll be as gentle as possible. Your abdomen sounds normal, no unusual sounds detected. I'm palpating your abdomen now… It's a little tender here on the lower left side, but nothing too concerning. Your abdomen is soft overall. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes… Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age, but still within a normal range. Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. Thank you for your patience. Everything seems generally normal, but the tenderness in your lower abdomen and your symptoms suggest we need to investigate a bit further.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Investigation? What kind of investigation? Is it something bad? I don't want to have any… any tubes or anything, doctor. I just want to be able to pee normally again. I'm getting a little scared now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Stoffregen, and I assure you we’ll take things one step at a time. It’s not necessarily something bad, but it's important to rule out any potential causes for your symptoms. The most likely scenario is that you have an overactive bladder, or possibly some mild bladder weakness. However, to be certain, I’d like to order a urine sample to check for infection, and a simple ultrasound of your bladder to see how well it's emptying. The ultrasound is non-invasive – it doesn't involve any tubes or needles, just a gel applied to your abdomen and a probe used to create an image of your bladder. It's completely painless. As for the urine sample, we can collect that right here in the clinic. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, a urine sample, that sounds alright. And no tubes… good. No needles either? That's a relief. Ultrasound… gel and a picture… that sounds… manageable. Is it expensive? I'm on a fixed income, you know. And Medicare… does it cover it? I don't want to surprise my husband.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible question, Ms. Stoffregen, and I’m glad you asked. The urine sample is very straightforward – just a quick collection in a cup. And the ultrasound doesn't involve any needles or injections, just the gel and the probe. As for the cost, Medicare should cover both the urine analysis and the bladder ultrasound. However, there might be a small co-pay depending on your specific plan. I’ll have my nurse verify your coverage before we proceed, so you won’t have any unexpected bills. She's very good at navigating the insurance process. If, for any reason, there is a significant cost, we can discuss payment options or potentially explore alternative testing methods. I want to assure you, we’ll do everything we can to make this as affordable and stress-free as possible. Would you like me to have my nurse come in and check your coverage now?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be wonderful. My husband would really appreciate that. He worries about money a lot. And I don’t want to cause him any extra stress. He's a good man. Thank you, doctor. You’re very kind. I feel a little better now, knowing that Medicare might cover it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. I'll just have Nurse Emily come in and go over the coverage details with you. In the meantime, feel free to relax. She'll also explain the process for collecting the urine sample. Nurse Emily: “Hi, Ms. Stoffregen, Dr. Chagaris mentioned you had some questions about insurance coverage?
PATIENT: Oh, hello, Nurse Emily. Yes, he did. I just want to make sure Medicare will cover the tests. My husband… he worries a lot about money. He's a good man, but… you know how it is.
DOCTOR: Nurse Emily: “Of course, Ms. Stoffregen. I completely understand. Let me pull up your information here… Okay, it looks like your Medicare plan does cover both the urine analysis and the bladder ultrasound. There will be a $20 co-pay for each test, payable at the time of service. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, $20 each? That’s… that's alright. We can manage that. It’s much better than a big bill. Thank you, Nurse Emily. You've been very helpful. Now, about this urine sample… is it… embarrassing? I hope it’s not too difficult. I’m not as nimble as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Nurse Emily: “Not at all, Ms. Stoffregen! It's perfectly normal, and we have a private restroom right down the hall. We'll provide you with a collection cup and instructions. There’s also a lid to make it easier to transport. If you need any assistance, please don’t hesitate to ask. We can help you get the sample if you're having difficulty. There's no shame in asking for help, and we do this all the time. Would you like me to show you to the restroom now?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A private restroom… that's good. And you said you can help if I need it? That’s very kind of you. Yes, please. I think I'd like you to show me the restroom. Thank you both so much. I feel a lot better now, knowing I'm not alone in this.
DOCTOR: Nurse Emily: “Certainly, Ms. Stoffregen. Here we are. The restroom is just through this door. Everything you need is inside, and I’ll be right outside if you need anything at all. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to call if you’re having any trouble. We’ll be right here waiting for you when you’re ready.”
PATIENT: .
