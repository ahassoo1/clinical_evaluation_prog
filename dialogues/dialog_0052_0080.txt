DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fabing. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Dr. Shely. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it's not really seeing you for anything specific, if that makes sense. Just need to get some forms filled out for… Medicare, I think? They said I needed a doctor's signature on a few things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's quite alright. Many patients come in for assistance with forms, especially with Medicare. I’m happy to help. Do you have those forms with you today?
PATIENT: Yep, I do. Here you go. They seemed pretty…detailed. I didn’t want to mess anything up, so figured it’d be best to just have you take a look.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Yes, these are rather comprehensive. It’s good you brought them in. To ensure I complete these accurately, I’ll need to verify some information. Let’s start with a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. I see here your date of birth is…[checks form] …August 12th, 1989. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yep, that's right. August 12th, 1989. Though, honestly, keeping track of dates isn’t my strongest suit. My grandma always said I lived more in the moment. Which is probably why I needed someone to help with these papers!
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Many people find details challenging. It's good to know. Now, regarding your medical history, have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Not that I know of. I had a pretty bad case of strep throat when I was a kid, and broke my arm once falling off a horse, but nothing…long-term, I guess? I’ve always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I do get headaches sometimes, but they come and go.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, no surgeries. Just the broken arm, and that didn't need one. They just put it in a cast. It healed up okay, though a little crooked if you look really close. Mostly just a good story now.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear it healed well enough. Now, can you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Not really. I try to avoid taking anything if I can. I take a multivitamin sometimes, just when I remember, and I'll take ibuprofen if I have a really bad headache, but that's about it. Oh! And I use this cream for my hands, 'cause they get so dry in the winter. But that's not a medicine, right?
DOCTOR: No, that's fine. The hand cream isn't a medication we need to document. And occasional ibuprofen is good to note. Now, do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, insects, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no known allergies. I’ve eaten pretty much everything put in front of me, and never had a problem. Bees aren’t my favorite, but I just avoid them. My mom always said I was a tough kid, built different, or something like that.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No allergies is always good to hear. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let's see. My grandma on my mom’s side lived to be 95, which is pretty good, I think. My grandpa had some heart trouble, though, later in life. And my dad's side... well, I don't know a whole lot about them, to be honest. He didn't talk about them much. Mostly, everyone was pretty healthy, or at least lived a long life.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. And just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little bit about your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nope, none of the above. Never been much of a smoker, and I don't really drink. Maybe a glass of champagne on special occasions, but that's about it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I've always been a pretty straight-laced person, I guess. More into hiking and being outdoors than… that stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. Now, just a quick question regarding your weight, have you experienced any recent unintentional weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing major. My weight fluctuates a little, like anyone’s, but nothing I've been worried about. I haven't been sick or anything, so I haven't lost weight unexpectedly. If anything, maybe I've put on a little bit over the winter, but I blame that on comfort food!
DOCTOR: That's understandable. Comfort food is a powerful force. Now, one final question before we move on to a brief physical exam. Are there any other concerns you have today, or anything else you’d like me to know?
PATIENT: Hmm... No, I think that covers everything. I really just needed these forms signed, like I said. I appreciate you taking the time to go through everything with me, though. It's nice to know someone's actually looking at this stuff! I just want to make sure Medicare doesn't give me any trouble.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fabing. I understand your concern. It's my pleasure. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a very brief physical exam, just to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. It's a standard procedure, and it will only take a few minutes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Sounds good. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. I'm pretty easygoing.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to take your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Sure. There you go.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 128/78 mmHg, which is within a normal range. Pulse is 72 beats per minute, regular and strong. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Okay. In... and out... in... and out... Is that good?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfect. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs or extra sounds. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Everything sounds good. Alright, Ms. Fabing, everything checks out well. I’m happy to sign these Medicare forms for you. Just let me review them one last time to ensure everything is complete.
PATIENT: Great, thank you so much, Dr. Shely! I really appreciate you taking the time to do all this. It's a big weight off my shoulders. While you're looking at those, is there anything I should be doing, health-wise? Like, anything I should be keeping an eye on, given my family history or anything?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Fabing. I’m glad I could help. Regarding your health, given your family history of heart trouble, it's a good idea to maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle. That includes a balanced diet low in saturated and trans fats, regular exercise – at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week – and avoiding smoking. I also recommend getting a lipid panel – a cholesterol test – done annually, just to monitor your levels. You’ve had a normal blood pressure reading today, which is excellent, but continue to monitor it at home if possible. And of course, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please seek medical attention immediately. Here are your signed forms. I’ll also print out a summary of our conversation today, including these recommendations, for your records. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: No, that's all really helpful, thank you. The lipid panel sounds like a good idea. I do have a blood pressure cuff at home, so I can keep an eye on it. And I definitely don't plan on starting to smoke! You’ve been very thorough, Dr. Shely. I really appreciate it. I think I'm all set. Thank you again for everything. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fabing. I'm glad I could provide some peace of mind. It was a pleasure meeting you. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don't hesitate to call the office. Have a wonderful day, and please take care of yourself.
