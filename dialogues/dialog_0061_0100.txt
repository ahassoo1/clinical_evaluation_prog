DOCTOR: Bula and welcome, Lytisha! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello! It’s nice to meet you too, Doctor… Kimm, was it? Um, let me see… Right. They told me something about a… test? A screening, maybe? It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. Something to do with… checking what’s in my system, I think. It’s for work, I believe.
DOCTOR: Yes, Kimm is correct. Okay, a screening for work. That's perfectly alright, it happens often. It sounds like your employer may have requested some routine bloodwork or a general health assessment. To help me understand exactly what they're looking for, do you happen to have any paperwork from your work or the clinic that outlines what the screening involves?
PATIENT: Oh, paperwork… Let me see… I think I had something… No, just my knitting. And… a coupon for the bakery. Honestly, I’m terrible with papers. I don't recall getting anything specific. They just… told me to come here today. Medicare covered it, so that was good. I mostly just do what they tell me these days, you know? My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lytisha, don’t worry about a thing. We can figure it out. It's quite common to forget things these days. Since you don't have the paperwork, let's start with a general overview. Medicare would typically cover a range of preventative screenings, such as a complete blood count, cholesterol levels, and a basic metabolic panel – things that give us a snapshot of your overall health. To help me narrow things down and ensure we’re doing the correct tests, could you tell me a little bit about what your work involves?
PATIENT: Oh, work… Right. I… I drive the big machines. For the roads, you know? The… the pavers. And the tampers. I make sure the roads are smooth. It’s… loud. Very loud. Been doing it for… a long time now. Decades, I guess. It’s mostly just… driving, and making sure everything is level. And sometimes fixing things if they break. It’s a physical job, definitely. Not much thinking involved, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you operate heavy machinery for road construction. That’s helpful to know. A physical job with a lot of vibration. That gives me a few ideas. Given your work, we should definitely consider a hearing test as part of your assessment – the noise levels could be a concern. We should also review your overall physical health to make sure you’re fit for duty, and check for any musculoskeletal issues. Before we proceed, have you noticed any changes in your hearing lately?
PATIENT: Changes… Hmm. Well, everything sounds a bit muffled, if I'm honest. I just assumed it was getting older. And the machines are very loud, so it’s hard to tell what’s normal anymore, you know? My husband used to complain about his hearing, too. It just… faded over time, I suppose. I mostly just turn up the volume on the TV. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily "bad", Lytisha, but it's definitely something we should investigate further. It's very common for people working in noisy environments to experience hearing loss, and it's important to catch it early to prevent it from worsening. Turning up the volume on the TV can be a sign that your hearing is changing. Let’s start with a quick physical exam, and then we can schedule a formal hearing test with our audiologist. I’ll also want to ask you some questions about your medical history, just to get a more complete picture of your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A sensible plan. Physical exam first, then the hearing test. And questions, yes. I suppose that’s what doctors do, isn’t it? Alright. Where do we start? I’m ready, I think. Though I warn you, my joints aren't what they used to be. All that driving and vibrating… it takes a toll.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll take things at your pace. I'll start by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. And yes, we’ll definitely be mindful of your joints. To begin, could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Alright… relaxing. That’s easy to say, harder to do. Go ahead, Doctor. I'm ready when you are. Just… don't be too rough with my ears, please? They’re sensitive. And the blood pressure… it sometimes gets a bit high when I’m nervous. Just a warning.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. We’ll be very gentle. And it’s perfectly normal for blood pressure to be a little elevated in a clinical setting. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. A little bit high, but understandable. Pulse is 76 and regular, and your temperature is normal. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation, no wheezes or crackles. Now, let’s take a quick look in your ears… Your ear canals are clear, but there’s a little bit of cerumen buildup – some earwax. It’s not unusual. And I see a little bit of redness in both ear canals, which could be due to the noise exposure. No sign of infection, thankfully. Everything seems alright so far, but the redness and cerumen buildup, combined with your report of muffled hearing, warrant further investigation with the hearing test. Before we schedule that, let’s go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh dear. That's a long time ago now. Let me think… My husband, bless his soul, kept all the records. He was very organized. After he passed… well, things got a bit muddled. I had… I think I had high blood pressure once, a long time ago. They gave me some pills for it, but I stopped taking them after a while. Didn't seem to make much difference. And… I had my gallbladder removed, years and years ago. Apart from that… nothing much, I don't think. A few aches and pains, but who doesn't have those at my age? Is that enough? Or do you need more details? I'm really terrible with dates and specifics, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lytisha. You’ve given me a good starting point. High blood pressure in the past and gallbladder removal – thank you. We can always access more detailed records if needed, but this is helpful for now. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I used to get a bit of a rash when I was a child, from poison ivy, I think. But that was ages ago. And I’m a bit sensitive to… strong perfumes, sometimes. They give me a headache. But nothing serious. No reactions to any medications that I can recall. I really wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be, you know? My husband always said I had the memory of a goldfish.
DOCTOR: You’re doing wonderfully, Lytisha. Don’t worry about it at all. No known medication allergies and sensitivity to strong perfumes – that’s good to know. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Let me see… Oh, I take… this one. For my arthritis. Just when it flares up. And… sometimes I take a vitamin D supplement, during the winter. Because I don’t get much sun. And… oh, yes! I take a little something for my cholesterol. The doctor prescribed it a few years ago. Let me find it… Yes, this one. Simvastatin. That’s it, I think. Is that enough? I try to keep track, but it’s hard sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, vitamin D during the winter, and simvastatin for cholesterol. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband smoked for a while, years ago, but I always made him go outside. It smelled dreadful, and I didn't want it near the house. He eventually gave it up, thankfully. No, never smoked. Not even a puff. Is that alright? I hope you don’t mind me talking so much. I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Lytisha. You're not rambling at all. I appreciate you sharing this information with me. It's all very helpful. And that’s wonderful to hear about your husband quitting smoking. Now, how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… Well, I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. A small glass, nothing excessive. But since my husband passed… I haven't really had much appetite for it. It just doesn't taste the same without him, you know? I might have a sip on special occasions, like Christmas or my birthday, but that's about it. Maybe once or twice a year. Definitely not a regular thing. So, no. Not a drinker, really. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lytisha. Occasional social drinking is fine. One last question about your lifestyle before we move on. How would you describe your physical activity level?
PATIENT: Physical activity… Oh dear. Not very high, I’m afraid. I used to enjoy gardening, but my arthritis makes it difficult now. I mostly just… take it easy. I do a little walking around the house, and I go to the grocery store sometimes. But that’s about it. I try to stay active, but it’s hard when everything aches and pains. I mostly just sit and knit. It’s a good way to keep my hands busy, and it keeps me calm. But it’s not exactly a workout, is it? So, not very active, I’m afraid. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lytisha. It's understandable. We'll work with what you're able to do. Now, before we schedule your hearing test, let's quickly discuss your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. That's a good question. My mother had… I think she had diabetes, yes. And her mother had… something with her heart, I believe. But it was a long time ago, and I don't remember the details very well. My father was healthy as a horse, though. Never sick a day in his life. And my husband’s side… I don’t know much about their medical history, to be honest. They weren’t very forthcoming. So, diabetes and some heart trouble on my mother’s side, I think. But nothing major. Is that enough? I'm really sorry I can’t be more specific. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Lytisha. You’ve given me a good starting point. Diabetes and some heart trouble on your mother’s side – thank you. Okay, based on everything you’ve told me, I recommend scheduling a hearing test to assess your hearing loss. We also should address your arthritis and work with a physical therapist to improve your mobility and comfort. Given your cholesterol medication and family history, we’ll also want to monitor your cholesterol levels regularly. Does that sound like a reasonable plan to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Very sensible. A hearing test, and something for my arthritis… and checking my cholesterol. Yes, that all makes sense. I’m glad we talked, Doctor. I feel like we’ve got a plan now. It’s… reassuring. When can I schedule the hearing test? And… what about the arthritis? Do I need a referral?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad you feel reassured. We'll get you scheduled for the hearing test with our audiologist, Sarah Miller, and I’ll write a referral for you to see a physical therapist, Michael Chen. He’s excellent. Let me just type up the referral and get you an appointment with Sarah. It will take me just a moment. Okay, I’ve scheduled you for a hearing test with Sarah Miller on August 9th at 10:00 AM. And I'm printing the referral for Michael Chen now. Here you are. He’ll give you a call to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: August 9th… that sounds good. And Michael Chen… yes. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. Um… I don’t think so. I think you’ve answered all my questions. Unless… oh! Yes. Will the hearing test… will it hurt? I’m a bit worried about that.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. No, the hearing test won’t hurt at all. It's a completely painless procedure. Sarah will simply place small headphones over your ears and play a series of tones at different frequencies and volumes. You’ll just indicate when you can hear them. It’s similar to getting your vision checked, but for your ears. There is no discomfort involved at all. Sarah and her team are very gentle and will explain everything to you before they begin. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. No hurt… that’s good. Thank you, Doctor Kimm. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and… well, everything. I think I’ll just… be on my way, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lytisha. It was my pleasure. Remember, if you have any questions or concerns at all, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. And please, take care of yourself. Have a wonderful day!
