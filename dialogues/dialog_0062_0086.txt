DOCTOR: Hi Kahrin, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Right, hi Doctor. Just here for the results, as we talked about. I’m pretty busy, so if we can just get straight to it, that’d be great.
DOCTOR: Okay, absolutely. I understand wanting to be efficient. Let me pull up your results here... So, we sent off some blood work and a urine sample on July 19th, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. July 19th. I remember exactly – had a really long meeting beforehand, so I was a bit stressed getting it done. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Stress can definitely affect things, so that's helpful information. So, the results came back and show slightly elevated levels of protein in your urine, and a mild decrease in your kidney function, based on your creatinine levels. It's not drastically off, but it's enough for us to look into it a little further. Do you have any history of kidney problems, or has a doctor ever mentioned anything about your kidney health before?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing at all. No one’s ever said anything about my kidneys. I usually feel pretty good, honestly. Is it…serious? I just want to know, straight up.
DOCTOR: I understand wanting a straight answer, and it’s good you’re asking. It could be serious, but it also might not be. Elevated protein and slightly reduced kidney function can be caused by a lot of things – from something as simple as dehydration or a strenuous workout, to something that needs a bit more attention. Because you're generally healthy and haven't had prior issues, I'd like to start with some more tests to get a clearer picture. Specifically, I'd like to repeat the urine protein test – sometimes a single result can be a fluke – and do a 24-hour urine collection to get a more accurate measure of protein excretion. We can also check your blood pressure, just to rule that out as a factor. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A 24-hour collection? Ugh. Okay, fine. But can we schedule everything close together? I really don’t want to come back multiple times if possible. What’s the point of all this, exactly? What are we looking for? I just…I don’t want to be sick.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation about the 24-hour collection, and I'll absolutely try to schedule everything as efficiently as possible. We can do the repeat urine test today, and start the 24-hour collection tomorrow – that would give us enough data, and hopefully minimize repeat visits. What we’re looking for is to understand the cause of the protein in your urine and the slight change in your kidney function. It could be something relatively minor, like a temporary infection or even a result of the stress you mentioned. But it could also be an early sign of kidney disease, like glomerulonephritis, or even a sign of diabetes if it's related to glucose in your urine. Catching things early is always best, which is why we're being thorough. Before we schedule, do you have any current medications or supplements you're taking?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don’t really take anything. Just…try to eat healthy. And drink a lot of water. Is the 24-hour collection…hard? Like, is it a pain to do? I’m just picturing carrying around a jug all day.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about no medications. It makes things simpler. And you're right to ask about the 24-hour collection – it’s not fun, but it’s manageable. We’ll provide you with a special container, and detailed instructions. Basically, you collect all your urine for 24 hours – starting with the first one in the morning, and ending with the last one the next morning. It does mean remembering to collect every sample, and keeping it refrigerated, but it’s not carrying around a jug! The container is a fairly normal size, and we’ll give you a cooler bag to help keep it cool. It's more about being consistent than it is about physical difficulty. We have detailed handouts, and the lab technicians are also happy to answer any questions you have. Would you like me to schedule the repeat urine test for today, and then go over the 24-hour collection process and schedule that for tomorrow?
PATIENT: Okay, fine. Let’s just get it done. Repeat urine today, and then whatever this 24-hour thing is for tomorrow. The faster we rule things out, the better. I have a meeting at 2:00 PM today, so earlier is better. And…is there any cost for all this? I don't have insurance, as you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s get you scheduled. I’m looking at availability… how does 10:00 AM today work for the repeat urine test?
PATIENT: 10:00 AM is fine. Just…make it quick. And tell me the cost now, please. Before I agree to anything else.
DOCTOR: Perfect, 10:00 AM it is. Okay, let's talk cost. Because you are uninsured, the repeat urine test will be $35, and the 24-hour urine collection is $75, plus a $20 lab processing fee for each. So, that's a total of $130. We do offer a 10% discount if you pay in cash today. Would you like me to proceed with scheduling, and confirm those costs?
PATIENT: Ugh. Okay, fine. $130…cash discount sounds good. Just get it over with. Schedule it. And…where do I go for the 24-hour collection? Is it here?
DOCTOR: Excellent. So that will be $117 total with the cash discount. Okay, everything is scheduled! You’re all set for the repeat urine test today at 10:00 AM. And for the 24-hour collection, you'll go to the lab located just across the street - 123 Main Street, Suite 200. They are open 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday. You'll need to bring the collection container and the instruction sheet we’ll give you today. They'll explain everything to you there as well. Do you have any questions about the scheduling or the location of the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just…123 Main Street. Got it. Honestly, I’m just hoping it’s nothing. I really don't have time for this. Thanks. I guess. Can I go now? I have a lot to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand. We're hoping it’s nothing as well, and we’ll get to the bottom of it quickly. Here's the confirmation slip for your appointments, and the handout with instructions for the 24-hour collection. The lab technicians and I are here to help, so please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions at all. You can head on back now, and we’ll see you at 10:00 AM. Have a good rest of your morning, and try not to stress too much.
