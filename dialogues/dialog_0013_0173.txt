DOCTOR: Hi Jailenne, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Morenomartinez, nice to meet you too! Well, I’ve been getting chills lately. It's a bit strange, honestly. Not a fever, just…cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills – that’s good information. And you said it’s been going on for a bit?
PATIENT: Yeah, maybe a week or so? It comes and goes. Some days I barely notice it, other days I feel really cold, even when it's warm out. It's just… annoying, you know? Not serious, I don’t think, but it's definitely not normal for me.
DOCTOR: Right, comes and goes over the last week. And you don't feel sick other than the chills?
PATIENT: No, not really. No cough, no sore throat, no aches… just cold. I’ve been a little tired, maybe, but I mean, who isn’t these days? It's hard to say if that's connected. I eat pretty normally and I’ve been drinking water, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other symptoms – that's helpful. And the tiredness could be a lot of things. Let's talk about some other things, just to get a full picture. Have you noticed anything else at all, even something small?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Actually, yeah, now that you mention it, my skin feels a little dry. And my hands sometimes feel…tingly? Not painful, just…weird. It’s not constant, though. It comes and goes like the chills.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry skin and tingling hands, that's good to know. Do you remember when the dry skin and tingling started – around the same time as the chills, or more recently?
PATIENT: I think…around the same time, yeah. Maybe a couple of days after the chills started, I noticed my skin was a bit flaky. And the tingling hands were probably a day or two after that. Everything kind of happened close together, so it feels linked. Is that…bad? Sorry, I always worry I'm making things up!
DOCTOR: No, you’re not making things up at all! It's good you remember the order things happened. Okay, chills, dry skin, tingling hands, all starting around the same time. Before we go further, have you had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve had colds, obviously, and the flu a couple of times, but nothing like this. Just the chills, dry skin and tingling... it's a new thing, definitely. I’m a bit worried because my aunt, she had something with her thyroid a few years back, and she got cold a lot. Is it possible it could be something like that?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know about your aunt. Thyroid issues can sometimes cause similar symptoms, so it's good you brought that up. We won't jump to conclusions, but it's definitely something to keep in mind. Just to cover all our bases, let’s talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my gallbladder out when I was younger, but that was years ago and I haven’t had any problems since. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, I think. I don’t take any regular medication, just the occasional painkiller for a headache. Oh, and I’m divorced, if that matters? It feels weird listing personal stuff!
DOCTOR: Divorce doesn't directly matter medically, but it can contribute to stress, so it's good you mentioned it. No other medical conditions, gallbladder out a while ago, occasional painkiller – okay, that's helpful. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I’ve had all sorts of shots growing up, and I’ve never had a reaction. I eat pretty much anything, too. My mum always said I had a cast iron stomach! I do sometimes get heartburn if I eat spicy food, but that’s just… heartburn.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, cast iron stomach – good! So, no medications, no allergies, no other medical issues. And we've talked about the chills, dry skin, tingling hands. One last thing before we do a quick exam - any major changes in your life recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, the divorce was pretty recent, about six months ago. And I started a new job maybe three months ago? It’s a bit more stressful than my last one, definitely. But I like the work, so it’s not a bad stress, you know? Mostly just busier. Does that sound silly? I feel like I’m rambling now.
DOCTOR: No, not silly at all. Major life changes can definitely contribute to how you're feeling. Divorce and a new, busier job – that's a lot to adjust to. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline, then we can talk about possible causes and what we might want to do next. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Absolutely. Anything to figure out what's going on! I'm ready when you are. I hope it’s nothing serious!
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid, and just feel around a bit. I'll also take your temperature and check your blood pressure. It’s a pretty standard exam, shouldn’t take long. Can you just sit up on the exam table and relax your arms at your sides?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. I always get a bit nervous at the doctor’s, but you seem really nice, so it’s a bit easier this time! Is the thyroid check going to be… awkward? I always worry about people touching my neck!
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable! It shouldn't be awkward at all. I'm just feeling for the size and texture of your thyroid gland. It's a quick and gentle check, and I’ll explain what I’m doing as I go. I will be very mindful of your comfort. Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, just relaxing your neck… Your thyroid feels…slightly enlarged, and a little bit tender to the touch. Not dramatically so, but enough to note. Your blood pressure is 128/76, and your temperature is 98.4 – normal. I’m also going to check your reflexes and your skin's moisture levels.
PATIENT: Okay, slightly enlarged and tender... that sounds worrying! Is that definitely something bad? The reflexes and skin check are fine, go ahead. I just feel a bit… anxious now, to be honest. Is it something I should be really worried about? Maybe it’s just stress? I really hope it's just stress!
DOCTOR: It's understandable you're feeling anxious. An enlarged thyroid can be caused by a lot of things, some more serious than others, but it's important not to jump to conclusions. It could be related to stress, as you said, but we need to do a little more investigation to rule out other possibilities. Based on what we’ve talked about – the chills, dry skin, tingling hands, slightly enlarged and tender thyroid, recent life changes – the most likely possibilities right now are stress-related thyroiditis or early stages of hypothyroidism. But we need blood tests to confirm. I want to order a thyroid panel – TSH, T4, and T3 – to get a clearer picture of your thyroid function. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests are okay. Better to know, right? TSH, T4 and T3, got it. How long will those take to come back? And if it is something wrong with my thyroid, what happens next? Do I need… medication? I hate taking pills! But I also don’t want to feel like this forever.
DOCTOR: Exactly, better to know. The results should be back in about 3-5 business days. I’ll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as they come in. If it turns out you have hypothyroidism, meaning your thyroid is underactive, medication is usually the first line of treatment. It's a synthetic thyroid hormone, and it’s very effective at restoring normal function. The dosage is usually quite small, and many people feel significantly better once they start treatment. We would start with a low dose and monitor your levels closely to make sure we’re getting it right. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We need the blood tests first. In the meantime, I recommend trying to manage your stress levels. Things like regular exercise, deep breathing exercises, and getting enough sleep can make a big difference. Do you have any questions about the blood tests, or anything else we’ve talked about?
PATIENT: Okay, 3-5 days, blood tests, manage stress… I think I can do that. Regular exercise… I do a bit of yoga, so that helps. And I’ll try to get more sleep. I’m a bit of a worrier, so that’s hard, but I’ll try! Um… how much does the blood test cost? My insurance should cover it, right? I have private insurance, but I always worry about unexpected bills. And do I need to fast before the test? I always forget those things!
DOCTOR: Let me just check that for you… Okay, with your insurance, the estimated out-of-pocket cost for the thyroid panel is about $75. But it’s always best to check with your insurance provider directly to confirm the exact amount. You can find their contact information on your insurance card. And yes, you do need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the test. That means no food or drinks – except water – during that time. I'll give you a lab requisition with clear instructions on how to prepare for the test. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. $75, 8-12 hours fasting… I can manage that. You've been really helpful, Dr. Morenomartinez, thank you. I feel a bit better just knowing what's going on, and what to expect. Hopefully, it's just stress!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jailenne. I’m glad I could help. Remember, try not to stress too much – easier said than done, I know! But please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your blood test results come back. Here’s the lab requisition and some information on stress management techniques. Take care, and I’ll talk to you soon.
