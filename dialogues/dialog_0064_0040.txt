DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s this pain in my side, you see. It comes and goes, mostly on my right side, but sometimes on both. And I seem to be getting urinary tract infections quite often these days. It’s getting… bothersome, to be honest. They told me at the hospital it has something to do with my kidneys. Polycystic, they called it.
DOCTOR: Right, polycystic kidney disease. Yes, I see that noted in your records from the hospital. It’s good you brought that to my attention. And this pain… can you describe it for me?
PATIENT: It’s a… a dull ache, mostly. Not sharp, not really excruciating, but it’s always there, you know? Sometimes it feels like a pressure, like something’s full. And when it gets worse, it can be quite uncomfortable. It doesn't really come on suddenly, it builds up slowly over a day or so. It’s hard to explain properly.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like a persistent discomfort rather than a sudden, intense pain. That’s helpful to know. And you mentioned it's been accompanied by more frequent urinary tract infections. About how often are you experiencing those infections these days?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It used to be maybe once a year, or even less. But in the last six months, I’ve had… three, I believe. Perhaps four. It’s a bit of a blur, to be honest. Each time, I see my regular doctor, and they give me some medicine, and it clears up, but then it just comes back again. It's quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: Three or four infections in six months is definitely a change, and concerning. It’s good you're keeping track of it, even if it is a bit of a blur. Okay, let’s try to get a clearer picture of things. Besides the pain and the UTIs, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I’ve been feeling a bit tired lately, more tired than usual. And sometimes, my ankles… they swell up a bit, especially at the end of the day. Nothing drastic, just… puffy. Oh, and I’ve been going to the toilet more often, particularly at night. Not a huge amount each time, but just needing to go more frequently. I don’t know if that’s connected, but it seemed worth mentioning.
DOCTOR: That is worth mentioning, thank you. Fatigue, ankle swelling, and increased urination… those could all be related. We'll need to investigate further. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in my urine… well, sometimes it’s a bit darker than usual. Not bright red, mind you, just… not the pale yellow it normally is. And I’ve noticed a bit of foaminess sometimes, which I didn’t think much of. It’s been happening for a while now, I suppose. Oh, and occasionally there's a bit of… sediment at the bottom, I think that’s the word.
DOCTOR: Okay, darker urine, foaminess, and sediment… those are all things we need to look into. We’re gathering a good amount of information now. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of besides the polycystic kidney disease?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been well controlled with medication for years now. Apart from that, just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Nothing serious. I used to be quite active, but I’ve slowed down a bit in recent years. I try to eat a healthy diet, but it’s not always easy.
DOCTOR: Good to know about the blood pressure being well-managed. And slowing down is perfectly understandable. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… yes, actually. Years ago, I had my appendix removed when I was a young man. And I had a hernia operation about fifteen years ago. Other than that, nothing. Just the usual minor things, like vaccinations, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and hernia repair. Thank you. Now, thinking about your family… is there a history of kidney problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother, she had high blood pressure, quite bad, towards the end of her life. And my brother, he has diabetes, type 2, I think. As for kidney problems… I don't recall anyone specifically, but my family isn't very good at talking about these things, you know? It’s always been a bit of a taboo subject.
DOCTOR: That’s quite common. Knowing what we can is helpful, even if it's incomplete. Alright, and finally, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication. I take a tablet for my blood pressure, as I mentioned, and I’ve taken antibiotics for these UTIs, and I haven't had any problems with those. I’m not a fan of taking pills, so I try to avoid them when I can.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Mr. Espinueva. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and take your blood pressure. It'll just be a quick check to get a better understanding of what's going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if there’s anything uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 88. It’s not alarmingly high, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let’s check your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some tenderness in the right flank area. No masses detected. Your kidneys aren't noticeably enlarged on palpation, but it is difficult to tell definitively.
PATIENT: Right flank area… that’s where I feel the pain, mostly. It doesn't surprise me that you feel some tenderness there. It’s good you’ve confirmed it, at least. So, what does all this mean, Doctor? Are my kidneys getting worse?
DOCTOR: It's difficult to say definitively at this stage, Mr. Espinueva, but your symptoms—the flank pain, frequent UTIs, fatigue, swelling, and the sediment in your urine—along with the family history and the physical exam findings, certainly raise concern for a progression of your polycystic kidney disease. The elevated blood pressure isn't helping either. However, we need further testing to get a clearer picture. I'd like to order a urine analysis, a blood test to check your kidney function , and an ultrasound of your kidneys. The ultrasound will allow us to visualize the size and structure of your kidneys and identify any cysts or other abnormalities. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. If that’s what you think is necessary, then please go ahead. I just want to know what’s going on and what can be done about it. I don't mind the tests, as long as they’ll help. So, how long will it take to get the results? And will I need to come back again?
DOCTOR: Good. I’m glad you agree. The lab work should be back within a few days, typically 2-3 business days. The ultrasound appointment will likely be within a week, depending on availability. The clinic staff will contact you to schedule that. Once I have the results, we'll schedule another appointment to discuss them in detail and formulate a treatment plan. Depending on the results, that plan might involve medication to control your blood pressure, manage any infections, and slow the progression of kidney disease. We may also need to discuss dietary changes and lifestyle modifications. In the meantime, if you experience a fever, severe pain, or any difficulty breathing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand perfectly, Doctor. Two to three days for the blood work, a week for the ultrasound, and another appointment after that. And if I get a fever or feel really unwell, I should go to the hospital. I think I’ve got it. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease a little bit, knowing what’s going on and what the next steps are.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m glad I could help. We’ll take things one step at a time, and we’ll do everything we can to manage your condition. The clinic staff will be in touch shortly to schedule those tests. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve covered everything so thoroughly. I appreciate your time and your patience. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and we’ll be in touch soon.
