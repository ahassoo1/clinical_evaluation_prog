DOCTOR: Good morning, Claudene. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Asami. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning to you too, Doctor Asami. Well, it’s… it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I keep getting… trouble. Down there. It hurts when I… you know. And I have to go to the little girls’ room so often. It’s been happening for a while now, on and off. I don’t really… remember exactly when it started. It just… does.
DOCTOR: Okay, Claudene, that's perfectly alright. It's not embarrassing at all to talk about these things – that's what I'm here for. It’s good you’re bringing it up. “Trouble down there” and frequent urination… that gives us a starting point. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Pain? It’s… a burning feeling, mostly. Sometimes a little ache. Not sharp, you understand. Just… uncomfortable. It feels worse when I try to… empty myself. And it doesn’t always feel like I’ve emptied myself completely, if you know what I mean. It’s just… irritating. I don’t remember if it hurts before I go, or just… during and after. Everything is a bit muddled.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning and aching, mostly during and potentially after urination, and a feeling of incomplete emptying… I understand. It is alright that things are a bit muddled, we’ll try to sort it out. And is there anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Better…? Well… drinking lots of water sometimes helps a little. It… dilutes it, I suppose. And… lying down. Just resting. Nothing really makes it go away completely, you know? It just… comes and goes. It’s been like this for… oh, goodness. A long time. I really wish I could remember more details for you, Doctor. It’s dreadful having a bad memory.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly fine, Claudene. We'll work with what you do remember. Drinking water providing some relief is good to know. Now, to get a clearer picture, let's talk about your overall health. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Hmm… I’ve been rather tired lately. Just… more tired than usual. And… oh dear. I’ve had a bit of a backache. Lower back, mostly. But I’m an old woman, Doctor. Old women have backaches! I don’t know if that’s related… And… no, I don’t think so. That’s all I can recall. I really am a bother, aren’t I? Forgetting everything.
DOCTOR: You’re not a bother at all, Claudene. It’s helpful to have all of this information, even if it seems small. Tiredness and lower back pain… those could be relevant. Now, have you had any problems with your health in the past?
PATIENT: Past health…? Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. I was married for a very long time, you know. And… well, things happen when you’re married for a long time. I had a… a surgery, many years ago. Something with my… insides. But I don't recall what it was for. And… I had the usual things. Colds, flu. Nothing serious, I don’t think. I really don’t have a good memory for dates or specifics, Doctor. It’s a curse, truly. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Claudene. We’ll do our best with what we have. You had a surgery many years ago involving your insides… that’s helpful to know. Do you recall approximately when that surgery was?
PATIENT: Approximately…? Oh dear… Let me see… my husband… Arthur… he passed away… fifteen years ago, perhaps? No, more than that. Twenty, maybe? The surgery was… before he passed away, definitely. A long time before. I was… younger, of course. It was at… a hospital. A big hospital. I really wish I could be more precise! Everything is just a blur of dates and places. It’s very frustrating. Perhaps it wasn’t even important? I’m probably just rambling now.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Claudene, you’re not rambling. Knowing it was before Arthur’s passing, so more than twenty years ago, is a good starting point. We can look into hospital records if you're comfortable with that. Now, thinking about your family… has anyone else in your family had similar problems – frequent urination, pain, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family…? Oh… my mother… she had problems with her water. She always had to go to the little girls’ room, even when she didn’t need to. And… she complained of burning. But she never went to the doctor. Old fashioned woman, my mother. Thought doctors were a waste of money. My sister… she had a bad back, always complaining of it. But that’s all I can recall. I really don’t know if it's related, Doctor. Families are large, and everyone has their own problems, don’t they? It's hard to keep track. I apologize again for being so unhelpful.
DOCTOR: You’re not being unhelpful at all, Claudene. Knowing your mother had frequent urination and burning, and your sister had back pain, is useful information. Now, let’s talk a little about your current lifestyle. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications…? Oh no. No medications. I try to avoid them if I can. They always have such nasty side effects. I take a little… vitamin C, sometimes. Just when I feel a cold coming on. But that’s it. Nothing regular. I try to eat a healthy diet. Lots of fruits and vegetables. And I drink plenty of water, as we’ve discussed. I don't like taking pills, Doctor. They make me feel… unwell.
DOCTOR: Okay, just Vitamin C occasionally, and generally try to stay healthy. That’s good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm… Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to be stung by a bee when I was a child, but that didn’t bother me much. Just a little swelling. Nothing serious. I don’t think I have any allergies, Doctor. I’m a fairly robust woman, all things considered. Although… my skin gets rather dry in the winter. But that’s not really an allergy, is it? I'm just… getting old. It's a curse, really. I wish I could remember more details, but everything is so… muddled.
DOCTOR: No allergies that you’re aware of, just dry skin in the winter. That’s perfectly fine. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. I'll need to listen to your abdomen, and possibly do a gentle pelvic exam, if you agree. This will involve me looking at the external area and doing a quick internal examination with a speculum. Let me know if you're not comfortable with any part of the exam, and we can stop at any time.
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Oh dear. That sounds… invasive. A pelvic exam? I haven't had one of those in… oh, goodness, decades! I… I don't know, Doctor. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that. I'm an old woman, you know. Everything is… delicate. And I’m not used to being… examined. Is it absolutely necessary? Perhaps we could just… try some medication first? I really don’t like the sound of it, Doctor. It makes me feel… anxious. I apologize for being difficult. I truly do. But I’m just… a bit nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness completely, Claudene. It's perfectly alright to feel that way. A pelvic exam can feel intrusive, and it's absolutely your decision whether or not to proceed. However, to get a clear understanding of what’s causing your symptoms – the burning, the frequent urination, the feeling of incomplete emptying – a quick exam would be very helpful. It allows me to physically assess the area and rule out any obvious causes. We can certainly discuss medication as an option, but without a proper exam, it's difficult to know what the best course of action would be. We can take it very slowly, and I will explain everything I'm doing before I do it. You can stop me at any time if you're uncomfortable. If you still prefer to skip the exam, we can discuss other options, but it might mean we have to rely more on trial and error. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh dear, Doctor… this is so difficult. Trial and error… that doesn’t sound very good. But… an exam… I just… I don’t know. Is it going to hurt? Will it be… embarrassing? I haven’t been… touched… down there… in a very long time. And I’m afraid of what you might find. Old women are… delicate, as I said. Everything is… worn out. I just… I really don’t know what to do. Perhaps… perhaps if you promise to be very gentle? And to explain everything beforehand? And if I can stop you at any time? I… I suppose I could try. But I’m very nervous. And I apologize again for being such a bother. I really am a terrible patient. But everything is just so… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Claudene, you are not a terrible patient. You are a very brave patient for even considering this, given your anxieties. And I promise, I will be as gentle as possible. I will explain everything before I do it, and you can absolutely stop me at any time – no questions asked. We can take it very slowly, and I'll focus on making you feel as comfortable as possible. I understand you're nervous, and I'll respect your boundaries completely. We'll start with a simple external examination, and only proceed to the internal exam if you’re comfortable. If at any point you feel overwhelmed, we can stop immediately. Before we start, I want to explain what I'll be doing step-by-step, so you know exactly what to expect. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Yes… please, Doctor. Explain everything. That… that would make me feel a little better. A little. Just… take it very slowly. And be very gentle. Old women… we bruise easily, you know. And… I just want it to be over quickly. If that's possible. And if you find anything… anything bad… please, just tell me. Don’t try to sugarcoat it. I’m an old woman. I've lived a long life. I can handle the truth. But… please, be gentle. And explain everything beforehand. That’s all I ask. It’s just… unsettling. Very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Claudene. I completely understand. We'll go as slow as you need, and I promise to explain every step before I do it. I'll also be very mindful of your comfort and any potential bruising. And I will be honest with you about anything I find – no sugarcoating, as you said. Okay, so first, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. This will help me check for any abnormalities. Then, I'll do a quick external examination of the pelvic area. I'll be looking for any signs of irritation or infection. If you’re comfortable with that, we can then discuss the possibility of a pelvic exam. That involves using a speculum to gently open the vaginal canal so I can visualize the cervix. I’ll also do a gentle internal examination with my fingers to check the size and shape of your uterus and ovaries. We can stop at any point during any of these steps. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: A speculum…? That sounds… uncomfortable. Will it hurt? And… what if you find something… bad? Something serious? I really don’t want to know if I’m… dying. I’ve lived a long life, as I said. But I still don’t want to… I just… I don't know. Perhaps we should just skip the speculum part? I don't want to be… violated. That sounds… dreadful. Just listening to my abdomen… and the quick external examination… would that be enough? I really don’t want anything… inside. It’s just… too unsettling. Too frightening. And I apologize again for being so difficult. But I’m just… an old woman. And I’m afraid. Very afraid.
DOCTOR: Claudene, you are absolutely entitled to feel afraid, and you are absolutely in control of what happens here. We will only do what you are comfortable with. If you prefer to skip the speculum part, we will absolutely skip the speculum part. We can start with just listening to your abdomen and doing a quick external examination. That will give me some information, and we can see if that’s enough to make a preliminary assessment. We can always revisit the idea of a speculum exam later, if you change your mind. There is absolutely no pressure, and your comfort is my top priority. So, let’s start with listening to your abdomen, if you’re comfortable with that. You can lie back on the table, and I’ll listen with my stethoscope. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, just let me know, and we’ll stop immediately. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Listening to my abdomen… yes. That sounds… less frightening. Just… be gentle, Doctor. And don’t find anything too terrible. I’m an old woman. Old women… we have all sorts of things wrong with us. Just… be gentle. And tell me if it’s going to be cold. I hate cold instruments. Very cold instruments are… unsettling. And please, just… be gentle. That’s all I ask.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Claudene. I’ll be very gentle, and I promise to warm the stethoscope before I use it. No cold instruments, I promise. Okay, just relaxing and breathing normally. I’m listening for any unusual sounds. Okay, everything sounds normal so far. Your bowel sounds are present, and I don’t hear any unusual murmurs or bruits. It doesn’t indicate any immediate concerns. Now, I’m just going to do a quick external examination of your pelvic area. I’m looking for any signs of irritation, swelling, or tenderness. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… I suppose. Just… be quick, Doctor. And be gentle. I really don't want to be touched… down there… for too long. It's… unsettling. And please, tell me what you're doing before you do it. I need to know what's happening. I'm an old woman. Old women… we get anxious easily. Just… be quick, and be gentle. And tell me what you're doing. That's all I ask. And please, don't find anything terrible. I really don't want to know. Just tell me if everything is alright. That's all I need to know. Everything is alright. That's all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Claudene. I will explain everything before I do it, I'll be as quick as possible, and I promise to be very gentle. I’ll also let you know as soon as I’m finished. Okay, I’m just gently palpating your lower abdomen and pelvic area. I’m feeling for any areas of tenderness or swelling. I don’t feel any significant swelling or tenderness. There is some mild discomfort when I press here , but that’s not uncommon. It could be due to muscle tension. Okay, I’m finished. Everything seems normal on the external examination. I didn’t find any significant abnormalities. So, to summarize, your bowel sounds are normal, and the external examination didn’t reveal any concerning findings. Now, based on what you’ve told me – the burning, the frequent urination, the feeling of incomplete emptying – and the findings of the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of a urinary tract infection or possibly some irritation of the bladder. However, to confirm this, and to rule out other potential causes, I would recommend a urine test. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A urine test…? Yes… that sounds… less frightening than… everything else. Just… it won't hurt, will it? I'm an old woman. Old women… we have delicate bladders. And will I have to… undress? I really don't want to undress. It's… unsettling. And will it take long? I really don't want to be here for too long. It's… unsettling. And will you tell me the results right away? I really need to know if everything is alright. That's all I need to know. Everything is alright. That's all. And will it hurt? Just tell me if it will hurt. That's all I ask. Everything is alright. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Claudene. A urine test is very straightforward and shouldn't hurt at all. You won’t need to undress – just a simple urine sample is all we need. We’ll provide you with a private bathroom and a sterile cup. You’ll simply collect a small sample of urine in the cup, and then I’ll send it to the lab for analysis. It shouldn't take long at all – just a few minutes to collect the sample. And we should have the results back within a few hours. I’ll let you know the results as soon as they’re available, and we can discuss them together. And yes, I’ll tell you right away if everything is alright. That’s my priority. Would you like me to show you to the bathroom now?
PATIENT: Yes… please. That sounds… manageable. Just… a quick, simple sample. And you promise it won’t hurt? Old women… we bruise easily. And you promise to tell me the results right away? If everything is alright? That’s all I need to know. Everything is alright. That’s all. And show me the bathroom, please. A quick, simple sample… and then I can go home. That’s all I want. To go home.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Claudene. I promise it won't hurt. Just a quick, simple sample, and then we can discuss the results and get you home. I’ll be right here when you’re finished. Here’s the bathroom. There’s a clean cup on the counter. Just collect a small sample in the cup and bring it back to me. Take your time, and let me know if you have any questions. I’ll be right here.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: A few minutes later, Claudene emerges from the bathroom, looking relieved, holding a small specimen cup. Welcome back, Claudene. Thank you. I'll send this off to the lab right away. It should take a couple of hours to get the results. In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you?
