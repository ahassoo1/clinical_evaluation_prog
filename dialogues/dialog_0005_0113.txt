DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello, Doctor. It’s this… this going to the bathroom thing. Seems like I’m always needing to go. It’s… bothersome. Not terrible, mind you, just… frequent. More than it used to be, certainly. I can’t rightly say when it started, though. Old age, I suppose. It comes with the territory.
DOCTOR: “Old age,” right. Well, frequent urination can be a normal part of aging, but we still need to figure out why. Just to be thorough, you understand. Now, when you say “frequent,” can you give me a little more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? Hmm… well, let me see. I’d say… maybe every couple of hours during the day? Sometimes less. And… oh, a couple times a night too. Waking me up. It’s not a flood, you know. Just… gotta go. My wife keeps telling me I drink too much tea, but I like my tea. Always have. Is that what it is? The tea? Seems silly to think a nice cup of tea could cause all this trouble.
DOCTOR: Tea, huh?
PATIENT: Well, yes. Black tea, mostly. With a little sugar. Not much, mind you. I've been drinking it for… oh, goodness, seventy years or more! Since I was a boy in Ukraine, actually. It’s… comforting. But if it’s causing this… well, I suppose I could cut back. Though I don’t want to. Is it really the tea, Doctor? Seems… unlikely. My father drank tea his whole life and he didn’t have this problem. Or… did he? Now that’s a thought. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s not get lost in family history right now. It could be the tea, yes. Caffeine is a diuretic. But it's rarely the sole cause, especially after seventy years of drinking it. We need to rule out other things. Now, do you experience any burning or pain when you urinate?
PATIENT: Burning? No, no burning. Not at all. Just… the urge. A strong urge, sometimes. And it's not like I can't go, you understand. It just… feels like I need to more often. Pain, no. Never any pain. Though my back aches a bit these days… but that’s just old age again, I reckon. Everything aches these days. Is that what you’re asking about? The ache? Not in my waterworks, no. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Right, no burning. Okay. And… any fever?
PATIENT: Fever? Hmm… let me think. Not that I’ve noticed. My wife takes my temperature sometimes, when she thinks I’m looking a bit flushed… but it's always normal. I haven’t felt hot or shivery or anything like that. Just… tired, mostly. But I’m always tired these days. It’s… well, it’s being 74, I suppose. Everything takes a bit more effort. A fever... no, no fever that I'm aware of.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes? What do you mean, changes? It looks… yellow, I suppose. Like it usually does. Maybe a little darker sometimes, if I haven't had enough to drink. But nothing… dramatic. No blood, no foam, no… I don’t know… bits floating in it. Nothing like that. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one to spend a lot of time looking at my… well, you know. Just goes down the drain.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Well, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam and order some lab work. Just to be thorough, as I said. We need to rule out a urinary tract infection, diabetes, and possibly check your prostate. It’s standard procedure. Now, can you step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Prostate? Is that… serious? My wife mentioned something about that once, but I didn’t pay much attention. It sounded… unpleasant. Lab work… Oh, dear. I don’t much care for needles. But alright, if you think it’s necessary. A scale, you say? Yes, alright. Though I doubt it will be good news. I’ve put on a bit of weight since retiring, I confess. Not much of an appetite these days… but I do enjoy my pastries.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, if you could just follow me into the exam room, we’ll get this over with quickly. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen and do a brief digital rectal exam to check your prostate. It won’t be comfortable, but it’s essential.
PATIENT: Digital… rectal exam? Oh, dear. Is that… absolutely necessary? It sounds… invasive. I always thought those sorts of things were for… younger people. Well… alright. If you insist. But please be quick, Doctor. And gentle, if you wouldn’t mind. My wife will be wanting me back soon to help with the garden. Tomatoes need staking, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lie on your left side with your knees drawn up. I’ll explain as I go. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. This is… undignified. I haven’t been examined like this since… well, I don’t even remember. My wife always handled things like this, back when I was younger. She had a knack for… well, everything. Just… get it over with, Doctor. Please. And try not to poke too hard. My back is rather sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. Prostate feels… enlarged, but no acutely tender nodules. It’s not severely enlarged, but it's definitely contributing to your symptoms. Now, I’m going to order a urinalysis and a blood test to check your blood sugar and kidney function. I also want to do a PSA test – that’s a blood test to check for prostate-specific antigen, which can be elevated with prostate issues. The lab results should be back in a few days. In the meantime, try to limit your caffeine intake – cut back on the tea a bit, and drink plenty of water.
PATIENT: Limit the tea? Oh, dear. That's a sacrifice. But alright, if you think it’s best. Water, yes, I can do water. I suppose it’s better than… whatever this other thing is. A PSA test… Is that serious? Will it hurt? And how long will I have to wait for the results? A few days… That seems like an eternity when you’re worried. My wife will be asking questions, you know. She always does. She’s a practical woman. She'll want to know everything.
DOCTOR: The PSA test is just a blood draw, it won’t hurt. As for the results, a few days is standard. If anything is significantly abnormal, we’ll discuss it. Right now, it’s likely just an enlarged prostate, which is common at your age. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. We'll see what the labs say. And frankly, I don't need to discuss your wife’s questions with you. Just follow the instructions on the order, and we’ll take it from there. Now, do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Well… no, I suppose not. Just… this whole thing is rather unsettling. And the thought of less tea… that’s a difficult one. I suppose I'll try to drink more water, as you suggested. And I'll try not to worry too much. Though that’s easier said than done. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… time. And your… bluntness. It’s… reassuring, in a way. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I have some tomatoes that need staking.
DOCTOR: Alright. You’re dismissed. Stop by the front desk to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. And try to relax.
PATIENT: .
