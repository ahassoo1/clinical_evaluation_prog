DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s about… starting a family, I think. My… someone I care about and I… we’re thinking about having a baby. But I’m… older, you see. And I want to make sure everything is… okay. Before we start, if that makes sense. I don’t really… remember much about what needs to be done, honestly. It's been a long time.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s… sensible, I suppose. Though, at your age, “sensible” should have been considered a long time ago. Still. We can certainly assess things. So, you’re wanting a fertility check-up, essentially. Let’s start with a bit of background. Have you and this… partner been actively trying for a baby yet?
PATIENT: No, not yet. That’s why I’m here! We… haven’t started trying trying. We just… talked about it. I wanted to get checked first. Make sure I… I’m able to, you know. And… that everything is alright. I don’t want to… cause any problems. Is that… okay? I feel silly explaining all this. It’s… a lot to think about.
DOCTOR: It's not silly, Mr. Verrall, though it would have been far more efficient to come in before discussing this. Procrastination rarely improves things. Alright. Let’s get some information down. First, any previous children?
PATIENT: No. Never had any children. I… I never really… had the chance, I suppose. Or… maybe I just didn’t meet the right person until now. It’s… complicated. Does that matter? Is it… bad that I haven't? I don't understand why that would be important, but… you're the doctor.
DOCTOR: It can be relevant, Mr. Verrall. While not inherently 'bad', a history of prior attempts, even unsuccessful ones, can give us insight. But, no, it’s not a problem you haven’t had children. Let’s move on. Any significant medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had… the usual colds and flu, I guess. And… a bad back a few years ago. But nothing serious. I don't think so. I had some trouble with… my stomach once, but that was ages ago. And… I get tired easily. But everyone gets tired, right? I’m not really sure what counts as… significant. I've never really been sick sick. Is… high blood pressure something I should worry about? My brother had that, I think.
DOCTOR: Right. “Usual colds and flu” isn’t particularly helpful, Mr. Verrall. And a bad back and tiredness are… commonplace. We’ll need to investigate the fatigue, though. Your brother’s hypertension is relevant, yes. We’ll need to check your blood pressure. Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never been in the hospital. Not even when I was a kid! Just… doctor’s visits for check-ups and… the usual. I broke my arm once, when I was young, but that didn't need… a hospital, just a cast. I don’t… really remember much else. I’m sorry. I’m not very good at this. Is there a list I could have, of things to remember? It feels like I’m forgetting everything.
DOCTOR: A list, Mr. Verrall, would be… impractical. We need your history, not a prompted recitation. But… alright. Let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache, if it’s really bad. But it’s just… paracetamol, I think. Or ibuprofen. One of those. Nothing regularly. I… I used to take something for my back, years ago, but I stopped. I don’t even remember what it was called. Does that matter? Being off medication now?
DOCTOR: It matters that you are currently not taking anything regularly. Paracetamol and ibuprofen occasionally are… irrelevant. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. Not that I know of. I eat… everything, usually. I haven’t had any… reactions to anything. I remember being stung by a bee once, when I was a child, and my arm swelled up a bit, but that wasn't an allergy, just… a sting. Does a sting count? I’m really trying to remember everything, but it’s… difficult. I used to be better at this.
DOCTOR: A bee sting is not an allergy, Mr. Verrall. We are establishing medical sensitivities, not recounting childhood incidents. Now, let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No. Never smoked. I… I don’t like it. It smells terrible. My father smoked, and it… it wasn’t good for him. I avoid it. Does that answer your question? I’ve never even tried a cigarette. It’s… a bad habit, I think. My brother smokes, but I tell him to stop.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s… sensible. Alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Just… sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Or a beer if I’m watching the football. Not very often. I don't… drink a lot. I don’t get drunk, usually. I wouldn’t say I drink, really. It’s just… a social thing, sometimes. Does that make sense? I don't need it. I just… enjoy the company.
DOCTOR: Moderate alcohol consumption. Acceptable. Now, finally, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother… she had… arthritis, I think. And my father… he had heart problems, like I said. And my brother… he has high blood pressure, and… he’s a bit overweight. That's about all I can remember. They're not all… healthy, my family. It's… a bit worrying, isn't it? Does that matter? Having family that’s not well? I don’t want to… pass anything on.
DOCTOR: It matters, Mr. Verrall. It provides a risk assessment. Alright. Now, I'm going to need to perform a physical examination. It’s… standard procedure. I’ll need you to undress down to your waist and I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your abdomen. I'll also need a urine sample. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: No, no objections. That’s… fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. It’s just… a bit embarrassing, isn’t it? Being… examined. But I understand it’s necessary. Where… where should I go to change? And… how much of a sample do you need? I hope I can… find the bathroom. I sometimes forget where things are. .
DOCTOR: The changing room is just there. There's a specimen cup in there. A standard sample will suffice. And Mr. Verrall… try to relax. We’ll get through this. I'll be back in a few moments.
