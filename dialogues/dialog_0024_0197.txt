DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sciarotta. My name is Dr. Mutnick. I understand you’re here today. Please, tell me in your own words what brings you in. Try to be concise, if you would. I have several patients scheduled this morning.
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, concise is good. I need a card… a medical card for driving, I believe? To drive for a ride-share service. Or a taxi, maybe. Something like that. I’m getting back into it, after… well, a long time. It’s just for the paperwork, you see. They require this card.
DOCTOR: A medical card for commercial driving, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Commercial… ride-share. It all feels the same to me, honestly. Is there a difference? I just need to be legal to drive people around for money. That’s all. I’m seventy, you know, and things change so quickly.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is a difference, Mrs. Sciarotta. A standard driver’s license is one thing, but transporting passengers for compensation requires a more comprehensive medical evaluation. It’s… a matter of public safety. Now, your record indicates you haven't had a full physical in several years. And I see a note about… previous dizziness. Is that still an issue?
PATIENT: Oh, the dizziness. Yes, well, that was a long time ago. It was after… my divorce, actually. A lot of stress, you see. It only happened a few times. It hasn’t bothered me for years, honestly. I don’t even remember the last time. But I can tell you exactly what the doctor said then, if you’d like. It was… inner ear, I think. Benign positional vertigo, maybe? Something like that. I had to do some exercises. It's all a bit blurry, but I’ll recall it if you need specifics.
DOCTOR: Benign positional vertigo… yes, I see the note from Dr. Ito, from 2018. While it’s good it hasn’t recurred, we still need to assess your overall health. For commercial driving, we require a thorough neurological exam, cardiac evaluation—an EKG, at minimum—and a vision screening. It’s quite a process, I’m afraid. Do you have any current cardiac issues?
PATIENT: Cardiac issues? No, none that I know of. My blood pressure runs a little high sometimes, but nothing a little walking doesn't fix. My regular doctor, Dr. Nakamura, checks it every year. He says I’m… “robust for my age.” I don’t smoke, and I try to eat healthy. Well, mostly healthy. Are you saying I have to go to several doctors for this? That sounds… complicated.
DOCTOR: “Robust” is… subjective, Mrs. Sciarotta. And while Dr. Nakamura’s assessment is noted, these are specific requirements for commercial driving certification. Yes, it does necessitate several tests. We need to rule out any underlying conditions that could compromise your ability to safely operate a vehicle. An EKG is standard, and we'll need to review your vision. I’m also going to listen to your heart and lungs. And I will perform a basic neurological exam—reflexes, balance, coordination. This isn’t a matter of opinion; it’s a matter of compliance.
PATIENT: Compliance. Of course. It’s always compliance. Very well. EKG, vision, heart, lungs… balance. I suppose I can do all that. Is the vision test here, or do I need to go somewhere else? And… how long will this all take? I have a friend relying on me to pick her up from the airport next week. I’d hoped to be driving by then.
DOCTOR: The vision test is here. It’s a simple chart test, nothing invasive. I’ll perform the heart and lung auscultation now, then the neurological exam. The EKG will require a brief wait while I analyze the results. As for the timeline… it’s difficult to say precisely. We’ll need to see the results of each test before proceeding. I cannot guarantee you'll be cleared to drive by next week, Mrs. Sciarotta. Please, sit back and relax while I begin the examination.
PATIENT: Relax is… difficult. But alright. Vision first, then the listening and… the reflexes. Do I need to remove my shoes for this? And is there somewhere I can put my purse? It's quite heavy. Honestly, all this for driving people. It’s a bit much, don’t you think? But alright. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: You may leave your shoes on for the vision test. Please place your purse on the hook over there. And yes, I understand your frustration, Mrs. Sciarotta. However, these regulations are in place for a reason. Please, stand approximately ten feet from the chart and read the lowest line you can clearly discern, one eye at a time. Begin when you are ready. I’ll be taking notes.
PATIENT: Ten feet… alright. Let’s see… um… F… P… T… Oh, and L… Is that right? I'm not sure that last one. Now… F… P… T… L… Yes, definitely L. And maybe… D? It's getting a bit blurry at the bottom. I used to have perfect vision. It's all going downhill. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Your visual acuity is 20/30 in your right eye and 20/25 in your left. That’s… acceptable, but not optimal. Now, please sit on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please, try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: Twenty-thirty… that’s not terrible, is it? I used to read tiny print without glasses. Breathing normally… Yes, I can do that. My heart is a little fast sometimes, when I’m nervous. And I had a cough last winter, but it’s completely gone now. Just listening, you say? That's good. Just listening.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is slightly elevated, 88 beats per minute, and rhythm is regular. Auscultation reveals mild… diminished breath sounds bilaterally, but no wheezes or crackles. No murmurs detected. Now, I'm going to test your reflexes. Please relax your legs. I will gently tap the area just below your kneecap.
PATIENT: Eighty-eight… is that bad? My doctor never mentioned anything about my heart. Diminished sounds… what does that mean? Tapping the knee… alright. I haven't had this done since… well, I don't remember. Gently, you said?
DOCTOR: Response is… present, but slightly diminished bilaterally. Now, I will test your ankle reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. This will be similar to the knee test. Just a quick tap.
PATIENT: Present, but diminished… that doesn't sound good, does it? Oh! That's a little sensitive. And now the other one? I really don't like this part. It makes me nervous.
DOCTOR: Response is similar—present, but diminished. Now, I would like you to stand up and walk a few steps. This will allow me to assess your gait and balance. Please, walk at a normal pace.
PATIENT: Walking… alright. Normal pace… it's hard to tell what's normal anymore. My balance isn't what it used to be. Is this okay? Am I walking too fast?
DOCTOR: Your gait is slightly unsteady, and balance appears mildly compromised. Now, please sit back down. Based on this preliminary examination, there are a few areas of concern. We need to run some further tests to determine if you are medically fit to operate a commercial vehicle. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an EKG. We'll also need to schedule a vision exam with an ophthalmologist. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Blood count… metabolic panel… another vision test? And the heart thing again? This is getting more complicated by the minute. Will these tests take long? And will they tell me… if I can’t drive? Because if I can’t drive, I don't know what I’ll do. My friend is relying on me, you see. And I need the money. What are the chances… what are the chances I won’t pass?
DOCTOR: The tests will take a few days to process. As for the likelihood of passing… it’s impossible to say definitively at this stage. The results will determine if any underlying conditions are present that would preclude you from safely operating a commercial vehicle. I understand your concerns, Mrs. Sciarotta. However, my priority is ensuring public safety. I will provide you with the lab order and a referral to Dr. Ito, the ophthalmologist. You will need to schedule appointments with both. I will review the results as soon as they are available and contact you to discuss them. Do you have any allergies or current medications I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. Medications… just a little something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Ten milligrams, every day. Do you think… do you think the blood pressure medication will cause a problem? I've been taking it for years, and my regular doctor says it’s fine. But maybe it looks different on these… these special tests. .
DOCTOR: Lisinopril… that's noted. It could potentially affect blood pressure readings, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it will preclude you from driving. It's one factor we'll consider. I understand this is a lot to process, Mrs. Sciarotta. I will contact you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, please refrain from operating any vehicle until we have a definitive assessment. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
