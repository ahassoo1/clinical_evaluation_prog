DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. It's nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Hmm… what brings me in? Let me think… My belly feels… big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. It’s just… not feeling right. I don't remember exactly when it started, though. Things… slip my mind these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila, that’s perfectly alright. It's common for things to be a bit less clear as time goes on. “Belly feels big and not wanting to eat much anymore.” That gives me a starting point. Can you tell me a little more about this feeling of being “big”?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not painful, not really. Just… full. Like I ate a very big dinner, but I haven’t. And it feels… hard, sometimes. Not always, but often. It’s… uncomfortable, mostly. I just feel… bloated, I think is the word? Is that right? I haven’t felt like myself lately.
DOCTOR: Bloated is a good word, yes. And you said it’s been happening for a while… even if you don’t recall exactly when it started. Has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Changed? Oh dear… let me see. My granddaughter, she visited last month, that was nice. And… I started a new tea, maybe? A herbal one, for sleeping. It tasted like… flowers. But everything feels a bit… blurry, you know? I can’t quite put my finger on anything specific. I used to be so good at remembering details… I was a sociologist, you see! We needed to remember things. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Soila. It sounds like you've had a lot on your mind. A new tea could certainly be a factor, though it’s hard to say without more information. You mentioned you haven’t been feeling like yourself. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the bloating and loss of appetite?
PATIENT: Oh… symptoms… let me think. I feel… tired. Very tired, even after a nap. And… sometimes my stomach makes noises. Funny noises! Like… rumbling. Is that a symptom? And… I go to the bathroom… less often. Yes, that’s it. Less often. It’s all a bit… slow, everything feels slow these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila. Tiredness, rumbling noises, and less frequent bowel movements. Thank you for sharing that. Now, have you noticed any changes in your stool?
PATIENT: Changes in… my stool? Oh dear. I… I don’t really like talking about that, Doctor. Is it important? It's… just a private thing, you know? I suppose it’s… harder to go, when I do go. And… it’s not the same color as usual, maybe? Darker, I think. But I don’t pay much attention, honestly. I just know it's not… normal.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Soila, and you’re right to feel that way. It’s perfectly alright to be hesitant talking about this. Knowing these details is important to help figure out what’s going on. Darker stool and difficulty going… that gives me a bit more to work with. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any unintended weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. My clothes feel a little… looser, maybe? But I haven't been weighing myself. I used to, when I was younger, but… not anymore. I just haven't bothered. I eat less, yes, but I’m not sure if I’ve actually lost weight. It’s hard to say, Doctor. Everything feels… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Soila. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your abdomen, and gently press on it to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. It won’t be uncomfortable, I promise. Just let me know if anything does bother you. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh… an exam. Yes, alright. That sounds… sensible. I trust you, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please. And… tell me if you find anything wrong, won’t you? I like to know what’s happening, even if it’s not good news.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. I will be very gentle, and I will explain everything I’m doing as I go. Okay, I’m listening to your abdomen now. I’m just feeling gently to see if there's any discomfort. I'm noticing your belly is a little full, but doesn't seem to be particularly painful. The sounds of your intestines are a bit slower than usual. I'm also checking your lymph nodes, and they feel normal. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a little strange. Not painful, just… different. And my reflexes… oh dear, I haven’t thought about my reflexes in years! I used to study the nervous system, you know. It’s all very… complicated. Are they… okay? Please tell me if something is wrong. I get so worried sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila, I understand your worry, and I'll be as thorough as possible. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age, and it doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious. Alright, Soila, I've finished the exam. Now, based on what you've told me and what I've found during the examination, I think we need to run some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’d like to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a stool test to check for any hidden bleeding and rule out any infections. We should also consider a CT scan of your abdomen to get a better look at your organs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… oh dear. So many tests. A CT scan… that sounds… serious. But… if you think it's necessary, then yes, alright. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just… I don't want anything too invasive, please. And… will I have to wait a long time for the results? I don’t like waiting. Everything feels so slow these days.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Soila. A CT scan isn't invasive – it's just an imaging test that uses X-rays to create pictures of your insides. We’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable. And I know waiting is difficult. We'll get the tests done as quickly as possible, and I'll personally call you as soon as the results are available, usually within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of fluids, and eating small, frequent meals if you can tolerate them. We'll also avoid any foods that seem to worsen your symptoms. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Small meals… yes, I can try that. And fluids, of course. But… what if it’s something serious, Doctor? I’ve lived a long life, but… I don’t want to end it feeling unwell. Will you tell me honestly what you think it could be? Even if it's not good news? I prefer to know, you see. I always did.
DOCTOR: Soila, it’s completely understandable to feel anxious, and I commend you for wanting to be informed. Based on your symptoms – the bloating, loss of appetite, changes in stool, and tiredness – there are several possibilities we need to rule out. It could be something relatively benign, like a slow-growing bowel obstruction, or a digestive issue. However, it’s also important to consider more serious possibilities, like colon cancer. That's why the tests are so important – to get an accurate diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. I want to emphasize that I’m not saying you have cancer. We simply need to investigate further to be sure. It's crucial to approach this systematically, and we will do that together. We’ll discuss all the findings and options thoroughly once we have the results. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves, or anything else that’s on your mind right now?
PATIENT: Colon cancer… oh dear. That’s… frightening. But you're right, you have to know. It’s better to know, even if it’s bad news. The tests… will they be painful? And… how long will they take? And… who will explain the results to me? I don’t want to be alone when I hear them. I appreciate you being honest with me, Doctor. It makes me feel… a little less scared.
DOCTOR: That’s very kind of you to say, Soila. I’m glad I can offer some reassurance. The blood test is just a simple needle prick, so it shouldn't be too painful. The stool test involves collecting a small sample, which can be done at home with a kit we’ll provide. The CT scan is painless as well; you’ll simply lie on a table while the machine takes pictures. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. I will personally explain the results to you, Soila. You won’t be alone. We’ll go through everything step by step, and I’ll answer any questions you have. You’re also welcome to bring a family member or friend with you for support, if you’d like. Before we finish, do you have any allergies or medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… no, not that I know of. I used to be allergic to cats, but that was a long time ago. And medications… let me see. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but I can’t remember the name. My granddaughter helps me with that. It’s a small white pill, I think. And… the tea, of course, the herbal tea for sleeping. That’s all, I think. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Soila. We can get the exact name of the blood pressure medication from your pharmacy records – I’ll have my nurse check that for you. And thank you for mentioning the herbal tea; that’s helpful information. Okay, to summarize, we’re ordering a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a stool test, and a CT scan of your abdomen. We’ll get the details of your blood pressure medication. I’ll call you as soon as the results are available, and we’ll discuss everything together. Do you have any questions before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. You’ve been very kind and patient with me. Thank you. I… I feel a little better, knowing we’re doing something. I suppose I should go now, then? I have a little nap waiting for me. And… thank you again, Doctor Annesley. You’re a good doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Soila. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your tests. My nurse will be in touch to schedule everything. And please, get some rest. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day, Soila.
