DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s about this tiredness. It’s just…getting worse. And it’s embarrassing to even say this, but I’ve been…eating dirt. Not a lot, mind you, just little bits. Don’t look at me like that, dear. It’s not…by choice, exactly. It just…happens. And it’s not helping the tiredness, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt…yes. Well, that is unusual. And the tiredness, you say, is worsening. Let's try to unpack this a bit. When did you first notice this tiredness starting?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It wasn’t sudden, you understand. It was…slow. Probably six months ago, maybe a little more? I used to be able to get everything done, you know? Garden, church, visiting…Now, I nap all the time. And even then, I’m still dragging. It’s ridiculous. I don’t have time for naps!
DOCTOR: Six months, gradually worsening…and affecting your usual activities. Do you find it’s worse at a particular time of day?
PATIENT: Well, mornings are the worst. It takes me ages to even get out of bed, and when I do, I feel like I’ve run a marathon. Evenings aren't much better, to be honest. I just…collapse. But mornings are…brutal. I used to be a morning person! Now…forget it.
DOCTOR: Mornings are particularly difficult, with significant fatigue upon waking. And this…dirt-eating, does that happen more at a certain time of day as well, or is it random?
PATIENT: Random, mostly. Though…now that you mention it, I think it's worse when I’m really tired. Like, if I haven’t slept well, or if I’ve been doing too much. It’s just…a craving, I guess. A weird, awful craving. Don’t make me talk about it anymore, dear. It's humiliating.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Humiliating or not, it is a relevant symptom, Ms. Hardenburgh. We need to understand everything. Have you noticed any other changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Honestly, I haven’t been paying much attention. Everything just tastes…bland. I used to love cooking, but now…what’s the point? I eat because I have to, not because I want to. Except for the dirt, of course. And that's a problem, isn't it? Look, are we getting anywhere with this? Because I have a luncheon scheduled and I really don’t want to be late.
DOCTOR: Bland taste…loss of appetite except for the…unusual craving. Yes, we are gathering information, Ms. Hardenburgh. It's a process. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness yes. My clothes are all loose. I haven’t weighed myself, don’t bother with scales, but I can feel it. I used to be a good weight, solid, but now…I’m just…skin and bones. It’s awful. People keep asking if I’m sick. Which, clearly, I am, if I’m craving dirt!
DOCTOR: Unintentional weight loss…significant enough to notice in clothing fit. Alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Really, dear? Do we have to go there? Look, I'm an old woman, not a medical textbook. It’s…normal, I suppose. Nothing drastic. I don’t want to spend the whole afternoon discussing this. Are you going to do something or just ask questions?
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, a complete medical history is essential. It allows me to determine the cause of your symptoms, and therefore, the appropriate treatment. But very well. No significant changes to bowel habits, you say?
PATIENT: No! Nothing…out of the ordinary. Look, I’m a pretty straightforward person. I eat, I sleep , I garden, I go to church. Now I eat dirt sometimes. I’m tired. That’s it. Are we done yet? I really must be going. This is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a physical examination, then. It will help me assess your overall condition. Please lie down on the examination table. We'll start with your vital signs, and then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. And I will need to check your abdomen. Please inform me if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Now I have to lie down? Really? This is ridiculous. I'm not comfortable with all this poking and prodding. But fine. Fine! Get it over with. Just be quick about it, please. I don’t want to be here all day.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 110/70. Pulse is 72, regular. Respiratory rate is 16. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. Please tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ouch! That’s…uncomfortable. Yes, right there. Just…below my ribs, on the left side. It’s not sharp pain, just…sore. Like I’ve been punched. And a little higher up, too, near my…breastbone. Stop poking, please. It's making me nervous.
DOCTOR: Tenderness to palpation in the left upper quadrant and midepigastric region. Alright. I’m going to listen to your abdomen now. Bowel sounds are present, but…hypoactive. And I’m going to check your extremities for edema. No significant edema present. Now, given your symptoms – fatigue, unintentional weight loss, dirt-eating, and tenderness in your abdomen – I suspect we need to run some tests.
PATIENT: Tests? Oh, for heaven’s sake. What kind of tests? Blood tests? I hate needles. And I don’t have insurance, you know. This is just getting worse and worse. I came here because I was tired, not to spend a fortune on…on things I don’t understand. What are you thinking? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I understand your concerns. However, we need to determine the cause of your symptoms. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool sample analysis. The stool sample is to rule out any underlying parasitic infection, which can sometimes cause unusual cravings. The blood tests will check for anemia, electrolyte imbalances, and liver and kidney function. Given your age and symptoms, we should also consider a CT scan of the abdomen to rule out any masses or other abnormalities. I am aware you do not have insurance. We can discuss payment options with the clinic's financial department. But postponing these tests will only delay a diagnosis and potentially worsen your condition.
PATIENT: A CT scan?! Now you’re just trying to scare me! I'm an old woman, not a science experiment. And I don't have any money! What’s the point of finding out what’s wrong if I can’t even do anything about it? I think I’ve had enough for today. I’m leaving. I’ll just…try to get some rest. And maybe avoid dirt.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, please. I am not trying to scare you. I am attempting to provide you with a thorough medical evaluation. I understand your financial concerns, and I will speak with the clinic's financial department to see what options are available. Look, at the very least, let's get the blood tests done. That's relatively inexpensive. And it will give us a starting point. We can discuss the other tests later. If you refuse all testing, I cannot provide any further treatment. I strongly advise against that. I’ll write you a lab requisition form. Please go to the lab downstairs. And I will have a member of our staff assist you with the financial paperwork. .
PATIENT: Fine! Fine, I’ll go get the blood tests. But don't expect me to be grateful. And if it turns out to be nothing, you owe me an apology. This whole thing is ridiculous. Dirt-eating... Honestly. .
