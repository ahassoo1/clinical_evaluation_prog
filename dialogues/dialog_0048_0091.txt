DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Zicarelli, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is me. Bianca Zicarelli. It's nice to meet you, Doctor… Sink, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, Sink. Doctor Sink. Now, let’s not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… I been feeling very thirsty lately. More than usual, you understand? And hungry too. I eat a good plate of food and feel hungry again soon after. It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so. It’s just… not right.
DOCTOR: A month, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Maybe a little longer. Hard to say exactly, you know? Time flies when you busy with the house and the garden. But definitely over three weeks, I think. It’s just… I drink and drink water, and still feel dry. And I does eat a good portion, but the hunger comes back quick. It worry me, you know?
DOCTOR: Have you noticed any changes in how much you're urinating?
PATIENT: Urinating? Hmm… now that you mention it… yes, I suppose I have been going to the bathroom more often. Especially at night. I have to get up sometimes, which is not good for old bones, you know? I didn't really think much of it, just thought it was the water I was drinking. Is that… a problem, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Increased thirst and increased urination… alright. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I does feel a little tired sometimes, but that’s just from working in the garden all day, you know? And maybe a little bit… blurry vision, now that I think about it. Not bad, but things don’t seem as sharp as they used to. I thought it was just my age catching up with me. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Blurry vision, increased thirst, increased urination… alright. Do you have any family history of… diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Hmm… my mother’s sister, Auntie Esme, she had something… the doctor said she had “sugar” problems. She had to take medicine for it, and watch what she eat. She passed away a few years back now. Does that mean anything, Doctor? I never really understood what was wrong with her, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your diet generally?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat good. A lot of vegetables from the garden, you know? Pumpkins, okra, callaloo… and fish, when my husband catches some. We does have some rice and roti sometimes, and I like a sweet drink with my meals, but not too much. I try not to eat too much sugar, but I can't live without a little treat now and then! Is that a problem, Doctor? I don't eat a lot of fast food or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a quick look at your blood pressure and do a simple blood sugar test, just to be certain. It's probably nothing, but we should rule things out. Please sit here.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. Anything to put my mind at ease. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, just a quick prick. It will sting for a moment.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I don’t mind a little prick. I always worry about needles, but if you say it’s quick, I trust you. I just want to know what’s going on, you know? It’s the not knowing that bother me the most.
DOCTOR: Your blood sugar is… elevated. Significantly. It appears you have diabetes. Type 2, most likely, given your history and lifestyle. We need to discuss treatment options.
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh dear. Auntie Esme… What does that… what does that mean for me, Doctor? Will I be sick? Will I have to take medicine for the rest of my life? And… will I have to change everything I eat? I just… I don't know where to start.
DOCTOR: It means your body isn't processing sugar properly, and it can lead to serious complications if left untreated. Yes, you’ll likely need medication, but it’s manageable. And yes, you’ll need to make changes to your diet. We’ll start with a prescription for Metformin. It helps lower your blood sugar. We also need to get you a referral to a dietician to help you plan meals. And, importantly, regular monitoring of your blood sugar is crucial. I’m also going to order some further tests—a HbA1c to get an average reading over the last few months, and some kidney function tests. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in one month. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Metformin… a dietician… So many things. Will I feel sick from the medicine? And… how often do I have to check my blood sugar? Will it be expensive? I don't have insurance, you know. And… what kind of changes will the dietician want me to make? I like my sweet drink with my meals… It’s just… a lot to take in all at once.
DOCTOR: Metformin can sometimes cause some mild stomach upset at first, but it usually subsides. We’ll start with a low dose. Blood sugar monitoring depends. Initially, perhaps twice a day, before and after meals. The cost… yes, that is a concern. I can give you a prescription for a basic glucose meter, and there are some community programs that may help with the cost of supplies. As for the dietician… they will help you reduce your carbohydrate intake, focus on whole foods, and find healthier alternatives to sugary drinks. It’s about balance, not deprivation. Here. This is the prescription for Metformin, and this list has information on local resources for diabetic supplies and support groups. We’ll discuss this further at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: A support group… that sounds… nice, I suppose. It’s just… I’m not used to asking for help. But thank you, Doctor. Will this… will this change my life completely? Will I not be able to enjoy anything anymore? I love to cook for my husband, and he loves my cooking… It’s just… I’m scared, you know?
DOCTOR: Look, it's a lifestyle change, yes. But it doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy food. It means being mindful of what you eat. Smaller portions, healthier choices. The dietician will work with you on this. And it’s crucial you follow their recommendations. As for your husband… involve him. Cook together, find healthy recipes. This isn’t something you have to do alone. Here is a referral to a dietician and the prescription. Schedule the dietician appointment as soon as possible. We’ll see you in one month. Any further questions, contact the clinic.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thank you. I will… I will try. Thank you for your time. .
