DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Voner. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hembrey, was it? Yes… well, it’s my joints. They get… stiff. Especially in the mornings. It's just… hard to get going, you know? It’s been happening for a little while now, I think. Not sure exactly how long, though. Things get a little fuzzy sometimes.
DOCTOR: Mm-hmm. “Fuzzy” is… not particularly helpful, Ms. Voner, but I understand recall can be difficult. Let’s try to be a little more specific. When you say “a little while,” are we talking weeks, months, or even longer?
PATIENT: Oh dear… months, I suppose. Yes, months. Maybe… six months? Or was it eight? It's hard to say. Everything feels… the same lately, a little bit. It's not painful, exactly, just… stuck. Like an old door that needs oiling. Does that make sense? I don't know about weeks... no, it's been longer than weeks, definitely.
DOCTOR: It’s… adequate, Ms. Voner, though precision is always preferable. Six to eight months of stiffness. And you’ve described it as “stuck,” not painful. Is this stiffness localized to certain joints, or is it more widespread?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, I think. My hands, mostly. Makes it hard to… button things, you know? And my knees… getting up from a chair is a bit of a struggle. And my shoulders… I don’t lift things as much as I used to. It's not a sharp pain, just… achy and tight. Like I’ve been doing too much gardening, but I haven’t been doing that much, honestly. Does that help? I'm sorry I can’t be more… precise.
DOCTOR: It’s… sufficient. So, widespread stiffness, primarily affecting your hands, knees, and shoulders. No sharp pain, just aching and tightness. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in these joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… no, not really. Redness, either. They just… feel old, I guess. Maybe a little warmer than usual sometimes, but I always feel a bit warm, if I’m honest. It's hot out, you know? It's hard to tell what's just… me, and what's the joints. I don’t think they’re swollen, though. No. Definitely no obvious swelling. I wish I could be more helpful. It just feels like getting old.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are there times of day when this stiffness is worse?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Definitely worse in the mornings. When I first wake up, it’s… awful. I have to really… work at it to get moving. It loosens up a little as the day goes on, but it never really goes away completely. It's just… less noticeable. Afternoon is usually better, but by evening… it's starting to creep back again. Does that make sense? I feel like a broken record!
DOCTOR: It does, Ms. Voner, though a clearer timeline would be beneficial. Morning stiffness that improves throughout the day… We’ll need to rule out several possibilities. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions, such as arthritis or autoimmune diseases?
PATIENT: Oh dear… well, my husband, God rest his soul, he had something with his joints. Rheumatoid… something. But I don’t think I have ever been diagnosed with anything. I’ve been to doctors, of course, over the years. For colds and… things. But no major diagnoses, if that makes sense. I don’t think so, anyway. It’s hard to remember… so long ago, those visits. I'm not sure what they told me, really. It was… a while.
DOCTOR: Very well. And have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. And… I think I had a hysterectomy. A long time ago. That was… necessary, the doctor said. But other than that… no, I don't think so. Nothing major. Just the tonsils and… that. Does that help? I’m sorry, I really wish I could be more clear. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tonsillectomy and hysterectomy. Now, family history. Was there anyone in your family—parents, siblings, grandparents—who suffered from arthritis or other joint problems?
PATIENT: Oh, my mother… she had terrible hands. They were always swollen and gnarled. She said it was arthritis. But she didn’t go to the doctor much. She just… suffered through it. And my aunt, on my father’s side… she had something with her knees. Couldn't walk very well when she got older. But other than that… no, not that I remember. It's hard to say for sure, though. Things were different back then. People didn't talk about these things as much.
DOCTOR: And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… just a little something for my blood pressure. The little white pill. I think it’s… amlodipine? Something like that. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for… headaches. But not very often. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me to, because I don’t get much sun. That’s it, I think. Nothing else. Just those few things. Do you need to know how much of each? I don’t really keep track.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Voner, dosage is relevant. However, we can obtain that information from your pharmacy records. Now, let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. If you'll please allow me to examine your joints. I’d like to assess your range of motion, look for any swelling, and palpate for tenderness. Please let me know if anything causes you discomfort. We will start with your hands.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. My hands… alright. They do ache a little, as I said. But I’ll try to be still. Just tell me what to do. I'm a bit worried about this, I must admit. Getting old isn't easy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Voner. I’m assessing your range of motion. Can you open and close your hands for me, as tightly as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: There… like that? It's a bit stiff, you know? Especially when I close them. It feels… crunchy, almost. Like sand between the joints. Does that sound strange? And yes, it does hurt a little, just a dull ache, really. But I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Voner. I'm palpating each joint now. Please let me know if any of this is particularly painful. And yes, the “crunching” sensation you describe is what we call crepitus, and it’s not uncommon. Now, if you'll allow me to examine your knees. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Crepitus… fancy word. Yes, my knees. They’re not as bad as my hands, I think. But getting up and down is… difficult. Alright, I’ll lie down.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Voner. I'm assessing your range of motion now. Can you bend and straighten your knees for me, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: There… like that? It’s… tight. Especially when I bend them. It feels like something is catching. Not painful, exactly, just… stuck. And yes, I can feel that crepitus you mentioned. It’s… unsettling. It’s harder than it looks, you know? I'm not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, I’m going to quickly examine your shoulders. Can you try to reach behind your back and touch your hands together?
PATIENT: Oh dear… it’s… difficult. I can’t quite reach. It’s tight. Especially on this side. And yes, it does hurt a little, just a dull ache. It’s… frustrating. I used to be able to do that easily. It's just… getting old, I suppose. It’s all… a little discouraging.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Voner. Thank you for your patience. Based on my examination and your medical history, it appears you are experiencing symptoms consistent with osteoarthritis. The stiffness, crepitus, and limited range of motion in your hands, knees, and shoulders are all indicative of this condition. It's a degenerative joint disease that’s common as we age. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I would like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and rheumatoid factor, to rule out inflammatory conditions. Additionally, I recommend an X-ray of your hands and knees to assess the extent of the joint damage. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh… osteoarthritis? That sounds… serious. Blood work and X-rays… alright. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t really understand all of this, though. Will the blood work and X-rays tell you what I need to do about it? Will I need… surgery? I’m a bit worried, Doctor. I just want to be able to… move without all this ache. What happens if it’s not osteoarthritis? What else could it be? And... are those tests expensive? I don't have insurance, you know. It's just a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Voner, let’s address your concerns one at a time. Osteoarthritis is a common condition, and while it’s chronic, it’s usually manageable. The blood work is to rule out other possibilities, such as rheumatoid arthritis, which is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation in the joints. The X-rays will show us the extent of the joint damage, which will help us determine the best course of treatment. Surgery is rarely the first line of treatment. We typically start with conservative measures, such as physical therapy, pain medication, and lifestyle modifications. If it’s not osteoarthritis, the blood work will help us identify the underlying cause. It could be something else entirely, but we need to gather more information first. As for the cost, I understand your concern about not having insurance. I will ask the billing department to provide you with an estimate of the costs before proceeding with the tests. We can also discuss options for financial assistance if needed. We can see if the lab has a cash price or payment plan available. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. We'll discuss the results and create a treatment plan tailored to your needs. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Alright… that sounds… better. Blood work and X-rays first, then talk about options. No surgery right away. And you'll help me with the cost… that’s very kind of you, Doctor. I appreciate that. Physical therapy… I've heard good things about that. It sounds… hard, though. But I’m willing to try. So, what do I need to do now? Where do I go for the blood work and X-rays? And… is there anything I can do right now to help with the ache? Something simple, you know? Just to get through the day? I just want to be able to… garden a little. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Voner. I'm printing the requisition forms for the blood work and X-rays now. You can have these tests done at any certified lab and radiology center. I recommend [Name of local lab and radiology center], they have several locations in the city and accept walk-ins. The forms also have the center's addresses and phone numbers listed. In the meantime, there are a few things you can do to help manage the ache. Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can provide temporary relief. Heat or cold packs applied to your joints can also be helpful. Gentle stretching and range of motion exercises can help maintain flexibility. And avoid activities that exacerbate your pain. As for gardening, it's not too much to ask at all. However, I recommend modifying your activities to avoid overstraining your joints. Use assistive devices, such as kneeling pads or ergonomic tools. Take frequent breaks and listen to your body. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the results of the tests and create a comprehensive treatment plan. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Alright… [Name of local lab and radiology center]… I think I know where that is. Acetaminophen, ibuprofen… heat and cold packs… gentle stretches… I can try that. I’ll try to be careful with the gardening. Two weeks… yes, that’s fine. I’ll mark it on my calendar. Oh, Doctor… thank you. You’ve been very patient with me. I really appreciate your help. It’s just… getting old is harder than I thought it would be. I think… I think that’s all for now. Unless you have any other questions for me? I don’t want to take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Voner. It’s my job to help. And please, don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. No, I believe that’s all for now. Just remember to take things slow, listen to your body, and we’ll work together to get you feeling better. Have a good day, and I'll see you in two weeks.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. You have a good day too. And I will… I will try to be patient.
