DOCTOR: Good morning, Deloris. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Latisia Finco. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s…fine, I suppose. I need a letter, that's what. About a pet. A building management thing, you know? They’re being difficult. Honestly, some people just don’t understand.
DOCTOR: A letter… regarding a pet. Yes, I see. And what sort of difficulty are you experiencing with the building management?
PATIENT: Ugh, don't even get me started. They're saying…something about restrictions. Weight limits, maybe? Or breeds? Honestly, it was all a lot of legal-sounding mumbo jumbo. I just want them to approve my dog. A perfectly lovely dog, I might add. A real sweetheart. They just don't want nice people to have nice things, you know? It’s a…a chihuahua, by the way. Small. Very small. And well-behaved. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Right, a chihuahua. A lovely breed. And they’re saying this has to do with weight or breed restrictions… I understand. So, to clarify, you need a letter from me stating…what exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s…that’s the problem, isn’t it? They didn’t say what they needed, just that they needed something official. From a doctor. Something about…emotional support, maybe? Or…therapy? I don’t even know! Honestly, I just need a piece of paper that will make them leave me alone. Is that so much to ask? It's for my wellbeing, you see. A lady needs her companion. A chihuahua is…very comforting.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, they've requested a letter from a medical professional related to your emotional wellbeing and your chihuahua. It sounds like they may be looking for documentation supporting an emotional support animal. Let me just pull up your record here... Deloris Wrye, born... August 14th, 1981?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. August 14th. Goodness, you remembered! Most people don’t even bother. And yes, emotional support...that sounds right. That's exactly what she is. A support. Look, I don't need a whole thing written, just something to show them I’m…serious. A nice, short letter. I don’t have time for all this fuss, you know. I have…things to do. A very busy social life.
DOCTOR: Alright, Deloris. I understand. It sounds like a simple letter stating your need for emotional support from your chihuahua would be sufficient. Just to be clear, and for documentation purposes, can you tell me a little more about how your chihuahua supports your wellbeing?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, where do I even begin? She's…she's a very calming presence, you know? A little furry friend who just understands. When I’m feeling stressed – and honestly, life is very stressful – she just sits with me. Very quietly. And she’s always happy to see me. Always. It’s…nice. And she’s a good listener. Doesn’t interrupt. Which is more than I can say for some people I know! It's just...comforting to have her around. She's a good girl. A very good girl.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Deloris. It's wonderful to have a companion like that. And it’s very common for people to find emotional support in their pets. Just so I can be as accurate as possible in the letter, have you been diagnosed with any conditions – anxiety, depression, anything like that – that your chihuahua helps manage?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, diagnoses… Honestly, I don’t really bother with all that doctor stuff. I’m perfectly fine. Mostly. Just a bit…overwhelmed sometimes, you know? Life is a lot. I don't need a label. I just know having her around makes things…better. I don't feel anxious, not exactly. It's just…nice to have someone. A little friend. Honestly, I think people just make too much fuss these days, always needing a name for everything. I just want them to approve my dog, is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand, Deloris. You feel that having your chihuahua provides comfort and support, and you don’t feel the need for a formal diagnosis. That's perfectly valid. However, to ensure the letter is as effective as possible, it may be helpful to include some general statements about the benefits of pet ownership for emotional wellbeing. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. General statements? As long as it doesn't make things…complicated. I don’t want any fancy doctor words. Just something…simple. And nice. Something that will get them to leave me alone. Look, I really don’t have time for this. I have a lunch date with…a friend. A very important friend. So, if you could just hurry, that would be lovely. Honestly, some people just don’t understand the importance of a good social life. And a good chihuahua.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Deloris. I understand. I'll keep it simple and focus on the general benefits of pet companionship. Here you go. This states that you benefit from the companionship of your chihuahua and that her presence contributes to your overall wellbeing. It doesn't mention any specific diagnosis, as you requested. Will this be sufficient for the building management?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That looks…nice. Very neat. Yes, hopefully that will do it. It certainly sounds…official. Yes, that should do it. Honestly, some people just need to see something in writing. It's ridiculous, really. Thank you, Doctor. You've been…helpful. Mostly. Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must be going. I have a lunch date, you see. A very important lunch date. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Deloris. You’re very welcome. Enjoy your lunch date. And please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything further. Have a lovely day.
