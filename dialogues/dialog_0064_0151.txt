DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this tingling… in my hands and feet, mostly. It’s been going on for a little while now, and honestly, it’s starting to bother me. I just want to get it checked out, if you don’t mind. I haven't really told anyone yet, just figured I'd see what you think.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Uzarski. That's a very good idea to get it checked out. Tingling in the hands and feet… okay. And when you say “a little while”, could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably… three, maybe four months now? It comes and goes, you know? Sometimes it’s just a little prickling, other times it feels… numb. Not completely, but like my fingers are asleep. It's worse at night, I think. Does that make sense? I don’t even know why it would be worse at night.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Worse at night is a common thing with these kinds of sensations. And is it both hands and both feet, or is it more focused on one side?
PATIENT: Both, Doctor. Both hands and both feet. It’s not equal, exactly. My right hand feels it a little more, and my left foot is the worst. But yeah, it’s on both sides. I try to ignore it, but it makes it hard to sleep sometimes, and I work… well, I deliver the mail, so you can imagine it's not ideal when my hands are tingling.
DOCTOR: I can certainly understand how that would make things difficult with your job, Ms. Uzarski. Delivering mail requires a lot of dexterity. Okay, so both hands and feet, a bit worse on the right hand and left foot… Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger it, or make it better?
PATIENT: Well… nothing specific, really. I haven't noticed anything that always makes it worse, or better. Sometimes if I’m really cold, it feels a bit more noticeable. But honestly, it just… happens. I haven’t changed anything in my life, haven't started any new hobbies or anything. I eat the same things… I wish I knew something that caused it! It’s just frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Uzarski. It's helpful to rule things out, even if there isn't a clear trigger. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any other health problems, like diabetes, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, not really. I had a bit of high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor put me on a little pill for it, and it's been fine ever since. Otherwise, pretty healthy, I think. I’ve always been active, you know? Walking all day with the mail… I don’t take much medication at all. My husband… well, he had some problems, but that was a long time ago. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. And just to clarify, you said you take a pill for high blood pressure… do you remember the name of it?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s a good question. I just ask the pharmacy to refill it every few months, you know? I don't really pay attention to the names. It’s a little white pill… does that help? I feel silly not knowing, I really do. I should probably write these things down. It’s just… after my husband passed, I kind of let things slip. It's a small pill, I take it every morning.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Ms. Uzarski. Many people don’t remember medication names. We can look it up in the pharmacy records, don't you worry. Now, any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any. I’ve been lucky, I think. Just a few broken bones when I was a little girl, but those healed up just fine. I’ve always tried to stay away from hospitals if I could help it. You know… bad memories. Mostly just the high blood pressure, that’s all. I just wish this tingling would go away. It's starting to worry me, to be honest. I don't want to lose my job.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Uzarski. It’s good you’re addressing it now. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My mother had arthritis in her hands when she got older, a lot of pain. My father was healthy as a horse, really. And my husband… he had heart trouble, like I said. Nothing much else, I don't think. We didn't really talk about health problems much, back then. It wasn't really the custom. Is that what you wanted to know? It’s a little hard to remember details, it’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Arthritis in your mother is good to know. Now, and this is just a routine question, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Never had any. I can eat anything, take any medication… well, as long as it’s not something weird. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I just wish this tingling would stop. I'm really starting to get worried. I feel like I’m getting old, you know? It's a bit scary. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Uzarski. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s causing this. I’m ready when you are. Hopefully it’s nothing serious. I need to get back to work, you know? I have a route to finish. But I’m glad I came in.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let’s start with your reflexes and some sensation testing. Please lie down on the examination table. I’m going to gently tap on your knees and ankles with this little hammer. It might be a bit uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t hurt. Then, I’ll ask you to close your eyes, and I’ll lightly touch different parts of your hands and feet. Just tell me when you feel the touch. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Just let me get up here… Whatever you need me to do, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. This is a bit awkward, but I'm happy to be getting it checked out. Hopefully it’s nothing too bad. Just… let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Uzarski. Just relax. I’m going to gently tap here. Okay, good reflexes there. Now, let's check your ankles. And that's good as well. Now, I’m going to test your sensation. Close your eyes, please. I’m going to lightly touch different parts of your hands and feet with this cotton ball, and tell me when you feel it. Just say "yes" when you feel the touch. Starting with your right hand… Okay, sensation seems a little diminished in the fingertips of both hands, but otherwise everything feels normal. Can you tell me if you feel this?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. Yes, that one too. Oh… that one feels a little fainter. And… yes, that one too, but not as strong. It's hard to explain, Doctor. Like… it feels there, but not as sharp. It's kind of numb, you know? Especially in my fingertips. I hope that makes sense. I just want to know what's going on. This tingling is really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Uzarski. Decreased sensation and a faintness in your fingertips… Okay. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now, just to get a complete picture. Everything sounds good there. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is well controlled. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing some peripheral neuropathy. Have you ever heard of that before?
PATIENT: Peripheral… what-now-pia? No, I haven't. Is that bad, Doctor? Is that why my hands are tingling? I've never had any problems with my hands before, just this tingling. Will I have to stop delivering the mail? I'm really worried, Doctor. Please tell me what that means. I just want to get back to normal. This is really scaring me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Uzarski, let’s take a deep breath. Peripheral neuropathy just means that there’s some damage to the nerves outside of your brain and spinal cord. It’s not uncommon, and there are many causes. The tingling, numbness, and decreased sensation you’re experiencing are common symptoms. It doesn't necessarily mean it's something serious, but we need to figure out the cause. Common causes include diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, certain medications, or even just age. Now, you said you haven’t been diagnosed with diabetes, and we’ll need to check your vitamin levels with a blood test. As for stopping delivering the mail… not necessarily. We’ll need to do some further testing to determine the severity and cause, and then we can discuss management options to help you continue your work safely. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… vitamin deficiencies? I eat pretty healthy, I think. Just sandwiches and… well, the usual. But I guess I could be lacking something. So, you're saying it's not definitely anything bad? And a blood test will tell you more? Will it be a lot of blood? I don't really like needles. I'm just worried about losing my job, Doctor. It's all I have, really. And it’s a good job, I like being outside. Will this take long? And is it expensive? I don't have much money, you know. I'm a widow, it's just me. I’m sorry, I’m probably asking too many questions.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too many questions at all, Ms. Uzarski. It’s perfectly normal to be concerned and want answers. Yes, a blood test will give us more information. We’ll check your vitamin levels, blood sugar, and some other things to rule out any underlying causes. It’s just a standard test, and it won’t take much blood – a few vials, that’s all. As for the cost… I understand you're on a fixed income. We can discuss payment options with the lab, and there may be some assistance programs available. We'll work with you to make sure it's affordable. And as for your job, let’s focus on getting a diagnosis first. Many people with peripheral neuropathy are able to continue working with proper management. We'll discuss options like medication, physical therapy, or lifestyle changes. We’ll take it one step at a time. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… one step at a time. That sounds… better. Yes, that sounds alright. I’m still worried, but… less so. So, the blood test first? And then we’ll see what it says? Will I have to come back for another visit? And… what if it is something bad? I’m sorry, I just can’t help but worry. It’s just me, you know? I don’t have anyone else to ask. I really appreciate you explaining everything, Doctor. You've been very kind. I guess… let’s do the blood test. When can I get it done?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Uzarski. It’s perfectly alright to worry, and I understand you’re going through this alone. Yes, the blood test first. We can draw it right here in the office, and it usually takes about 15-20 minutes. Then we'll get the results back in a few days, and we’ll schedule another visit to discuss them and make a plan. If the results show something concerning, we’ll refer you to a specialist – a neurologist – who can provide more specialized care. But let’s not jump to conclusions. We’ll take it one step at a time, as you said. I’ll have my nurse come in and draw your blood now. She’ll explain everything to you. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now. Just… thank you, Doctor. Really. You’ve made me feel a lot better. I’m still scared, but… less so. Okay, I’ll let your nurse draw my blood. And I'll try not to worry too much. It’s just… hard. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Uzarski. I’m glad I could help ease your mind a little. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your next visit. We’re here to support you. My nurse, Sarah, will be right with you. Just relax, and she'll take good care of you. .
