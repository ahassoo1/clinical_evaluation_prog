DOCTOR: Right, Kerriann Purtee. 49. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… embarrassing, really. But I’ve noticed a change in how I smell. My body odor, you know? It’s different than usual, and not in a good way.
DOCTOR: Different how?
PATIENT: It’s hard to explain… it’s not just more smell, it’s… sharper. Kind of like a metallic scent, sometimes. And it doesn't seem to go away with just a regular shower. I used to just use soap and water, and it was fine. Now, even after scrubbing, it lingers. It started maybe a month or so ago, I think.
DOCTOR: A month, you say. Hmm. And you’ve… changed anything?
PATIENT: Changed anything? Let me think… not really. Same deodorant, same soap… oh! Wait. I did start taking a new vitamin. It’s a multivitamin, specifically for energy. I thought I was getting tired all the time. It’s called… VitalBoost, I think? I started it around the same time I noticed the smell, now that you mention it.
DOCTOR: A vitamin. Right. Well, sometimes these things… alter your system. Let’s not jump to conclusions. Have you noticed this smell constantly, or just at certain times?
PATIENT: It seems to be pretty constant, but it's worse after I've been active, you know? Like, if I'm gardening or even just walking up the stairs, it gets stronger. And…this is weird, but I feel like it's more noticeable when I'm stressed. Like, if I'm worried about something, it's definitely worse.
DOCTOR: Stress can do a lot of things. Alright. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. No fever, no weight loss… I haven’t been feeling sick, just… aware of the smell. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but I just figured that’s why I started the vitamin. I do sweat a bit more than I used to, but again, maybe the vitamin? It’s hard to say. Oh! And my armpits sometimes feel a little itchy, but it's not constant. Like a little rash, maybe, but it goes away quickly.
DOCTOR: Itchy... rash. Okay. And have you changed any other products?
PATIENT: No, definitely not. Same laundry detergent, same lotion… everything's been the same for months. I really haven’t changed much, that’s why I’m so confused! It’s just this smell… and now the little bit of itchiness. It’s embarrassing to even talk about, honestly. I’ve always been pretty good about… personal hygiene, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let's have a look. If you’ll just undress from the waist up, and we'll take a quick look. Don’t worry, I’ve seen it all.
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Um… sure. I hope it’s not anything serious. It really came on so suddenly…
DOCTOR: Hmm. A little bit of irritation, nothing dramatic. Lymph nodes feel… normal. No swelling. Alright. It’s probably just a mild skin irritation, possibly related to the vitamin. But just to be safe, let’s do a quick blood test. Rule things out, you know?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. A blood test seems sensible. Is it something I should be worried about? I mean, what could it be, if it’s not the vitamin? I don't want to sound silly.
DOCTOR: Don't be ridiculous. It's likely nothing. But we have to rule things out. Sometimes, changes in body odor can be…a sign of something else, but usually it isn’t. We’ll check your thyroid levels, just in case. And a general metabolic panel. It’s standard procedure. I'll send the order to the lab now. They should be able to get you in today.
PATIENT: Okay. Thyroid… levels. I've heard of that. And metabolic… panel. Right. So, just to be clear, you're not expecting anything bad, it's just…covering all the bases? That makes me feel a little better. Do I need to fast before the blood test?
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll need to fast for at least eight hours. No food, just water. And try stopping the VitalBoost vitamin for a week or two, see if it makes a difference. Here’s the order. Take this to the lab, and they’ll take care of it. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Okay, eight hours, no food, stop the vitamin. I can do that. No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Dr. Osga. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and not just… brush it off. It’s embarrassing to talk about, but I feel better knowing we’re checking things out.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Try not to worry. It’s probably just the vitamin. And please, don’t hesitate to come back if things get worse. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Okay, I will. Thank you again. Have a good day, Dr. Osga.
