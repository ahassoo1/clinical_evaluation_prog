DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, it’s… paperwork, mostly. Some form or another requires I have a current… assessment, I believe. For my… practice. It’s rather inconvenient, but such is life. I suppose you need to poke and prod to ensure I haven’t completely lost my faculties?
DOCTOR: Yes, a general assessment is standard procedure for these requests. It’s… prudent. Though, I assure you, my examination isn’t merely “poking and prodding.” It's a thorough evaluation of your overall health. Let's start with the basics. Can you describe any current symptoms you’re experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Honestly, Doctor, at my age, there are always symptoms. A bit of stiffness in the mornings, perhaps. The usual aches and pains. Nothing… alarming. I wouldn't be here if it were alarming, would I? It's more a matter of satisfying… requirements, as I mentioned. I can't rightly recall anything specific that prompted this visit beyond the need for the certification. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: "A bit of stiffness" can be indicative of several things, Mr. Oriley. And dismissing it as simply “age” isn’t particularly helpful. We need to be specific. Where exactly is this stiffness located?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? Must we dissect every minor discomfort? Very well. It’s primarily in my… lower back, I suppose. And the hips. Though, to be perfectly frank, I’ve always had a touch of… trouble in those areas. Old sports injury, decades ago. Not a significant problem, mind you. I managed quite well for years. Is this truly necessary to document in such detail? It feels rather… intrusive.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Mr. Oriley. A complete medical history requires detail. Old injuries are relevant. Now, on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate this current discomfort in your lower back and hips?
PATIENT: A scale of one to ten? Honestly, Doctor, I find such subjective measures rather… imprecise. But very well. On a good day, perhaps a two. On a bad day… a four, I suppose. Though that’s rarely, and usually after… exertion. Gardening, mostly. A perfectly reasonable hobby, I assure you. I don't go around complaining about a little ache. It's part of life. Is this truly impacting my ability to… practice? That’s what they’ll want to know, won’t they?
DOCTOR: And what is your "practice," Mr. Oriley?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? Are you unfamiliar with healthcare practitioners? I am a… consultant. Specializing in… well, it’s rather complex to explain. Let’s just say I advise on… certain procedures. It’s a delicate field. I rather expected a degree of professional courtesy. It's... confidential work, you understand. Are you requiring a detailed explanation for the certification, or merely confirming I am, in fact, still capable of performing my duties?
DOCTOR: I simply ask for clarification, Mr. Oriley. It’s relevant to assess your overall physical demands. Now, let’s move on. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Numbness? No, not precisely. Perhaps a slight… heaviness sometimes. Especially in the evenings. But I attribute that to… circulation. I don’t sit still for long periods, you see. Constant movement, even when… consulting. It’s a demanding profession, as I've mentioned. Are you quite certain all of this is necessary? It feels… overly thorough. I’ve had certifications renewed for decades with far less scrutiny.
DOCTOR: “Slight heaviness” can also be indicative of nerve compression. We need to rule out any potential underlying issues. Now, have you had any recent changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: Really, Doctor? Are you attempting to ascertain my… personal habits? This is… quite inappropriate. I fail to see how such matters are relevant to my professional certification. I assure you, my personal life is entirely… functional. I find this line of questioning rather… intrusive and frankly, unprofessional. I must say, my patience is wearing thin. I came here for a simple assessment, not a… detailed interrogation. Are you prepared to simply confirm my continued competency, or must I seek another practitioner?
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, while I understand your frustration, a comprehensive medical evaluation requires asking potentially sensitive questions. It’s not about personal interest, it’s about ensuring a complete and accurate assessment. However, if you are unwilling to provide a complete history, I am unable to fulfill your request. I would suggest you find a practitioner who will simply provide the certification you desire without a thorough examination. Is that your preference?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. It appears a simple assessment is too much to ask. I find your… methods rather… aggressive, and your assumptions… insulting. I shall seek another practitioner, as you suggest. One who understands professional courtesy and respects patient… dignity. Good day, Doctor Versace. .
