DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. Please tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a check-up. For the insurance. Medicare wants me to have this done before they… allow things to continue. It seems a silly thing, really. I feel perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: A check-up dictated by insurance requirements. Yes, I’ve encountered that. Still, we must adhere to protocol. “Perfectly fine” is subjective, Mr. Barban. Let's begin with a thorough history. Do you have any current complaints at all?
PATIENT: Complaints? No. Nothing I would complain about. I work, I eat, I sleep. It is… sufficient. Is there a form I can fill out? This talking feels… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Very well. There is a form, though it rarely captures the detail I require. However, it will satisfy the basic requirements. After you complete that, we'll proceed with a brief physical examination. Don’t expect a lengthy process; I have other patients waiting. Please indicate if you have any allergies or are currently taking any medications before you begin the form.
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Spicy things, mostly. And no… medicine. I do not take medicine. It is for weak people. But thank you for asking.
DOCTOR: “Weak people,” you say. A rather… unconventional viewpoint. Nonetheless, your health is your own concern. Let me know when you’ve finished the form. I will review it while you complete it. And please, be accurate. I have no patience for ambiguity.
PATIENT: There. Done. It asked many… foolish questions. But it is finished. Now, can we proceed? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Indeed. Let’s not dwell on the “foolish questions.” Now, regarding your history… the form indicates you’ve not seen a physician in approximately five years. Any significant illnesses or injuries during that time?
PATIENT: Five years… perhaps. It is difficult to remember exactly. No. Nothing… serious. A small cut on my hand, once, from a knife. But I cleaned it myself. And a… stomach upset, after eating something bad. But those things happen. It is normal. I am a grown man. I do not need a doctor for every little thing.
DOCTOR: A “small cut” and a “stomach upset.” I see. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Family… My father… he lived a long life. Worked very hard. Had… some problems with his knees, I think. Old age. My mother… she was fine. Always very strong. No… illnesses, that I recall. They are both… gone now. Is this important? It feels… private.
DOCTOR: Everything is relevant, Mr. Barban. Family history can provide valuable insight. Were there any instances of heart disease, diabetes, or cancer in either parent or siblings?
PATIENT: Heart disease… my father worked with his hands. Very physical work. He was always… robust. Perhaps a little breathless sometimes. But that is to be expected. Cancer… no. No cancer, to my knowledge. My siblings are… distant. I do not speak to them. They are not… relevant either. Can we please get this over with? I am wasting time here.
DOCTOR: Very well. Social history then. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Absolutely not. It is a disgusting habit. I have never touched a cigarette in my life. It is… foolish. And unhealthy. I prefer… strong tea. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No, tea does not count. Alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Occasionally. A small glass of wine, with dinner. Perhaps once a week. It is… civilized. Not a large amount. I do not… indulge. I have responsibilities. This is becoming… intrusive.
DOCTOR: “Civilized.” I see. And your occupation?
PATIENT: I work in food processing. It is… honest work. I prepare… things. For the market. It is not glamorous, but it pays the bills. And keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let us proceed with a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I will attempt to be… expeditious. I trust you understand the importance of complying with basic medical procedures, despite your… reservations.
PATIENT: Reservations? I simply find this… unnecessary. But fine. Do not take too long.
DOCTOR: Breathe deeply, Mr. Barban. Heart sounds are… regular, though slightly rapid. Blood pressure is elevated: 145/90. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Very well. That concludes the physical. It was… adequate.
PATIENT: Adequate? What does that mean? Is something wrong? I told you I felt perfectly fine. Do not tell me I have some… ailment. This is ridiculous. What did you find? Be specific. And do not use… complicated words.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, Mr. Barban. And your heart rate is a little fast. Given your family history and social habits, and your reluctance to engage in preventative care, I suspect… a degree of stress. It is not an “ailment,” but it could develop into one if left unaddressed. We need to discuss lifestyle modifications. And I recommend a follow-up appointment in three months for re-evaluation.
PATIENT: Stress? I am a perfectly calm and collected individual. And lifestyle modifications? What does that even mean? Less tea? This is absurd. I do not need a lecture from you, Doctor. I work hard, I eat well, and I sleep soundly. I do not have time for… preventative care. I simply needed a form signed for the insurance. Is that possible, or are you going to insist on… further examinations and lectures?
DOCTOR: Very well. I will sign the necessary form. However, I must strongly advise against ignoring these… indicators. A signed form does not constitute a clean bill of health. I have documented my findings and recommendations in your chart. I expect you to consider them seriously. Here. Now, if you will excuse me, I have other patients waiting. .
