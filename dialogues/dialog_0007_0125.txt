DOCTOR: Hi Jacquille, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, to be frank, my wife and I decided it was probably a good idea to just… get checked. For everything, really. But specifically, I wanted to get an HIV test. Just to be sure, you know? It’s better to know, I always say. It’s just… responsible.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's very responsible of you, Jacquille. It's excellent you're thinking proactively about your health and your wife's. We can definitely do an HIV test. And I appreciate you mentioning wanting a general check-up as well – we can cover that too. I see you're 32 years old, and your insurance is Medicare. Do you have any current medical conditions, or are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Healthy as a yak, I like to say. My wife always rolls her eyes, but it's true. No medications, no conditions. Just… regular check-ups, like this one. Medicare covers everything, right? I mean, I assumed so. It’s good to be prepared for anything, that’s what I tell my wife. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear! "Healthy as a yak" – I'll have to remember that one. And yes, Medicare should cover preventative screenings and necessary tests. We'll double-check everything before we proceed, just to be sure. Let’s start with a little more detail about why you wanted the HIV test specifically. Have you had any recent changes in your sexual activity?
PATIENT: Changes? No, not really. We've been married for ten years, same… arrangement the whole time. It’s not like I’ve been… gallivanting around, if that's what you’re implying. Honestly, it's more my wife’s idea to get tested than mine. She’s always reading things online, gets worried about everything. I just want to get it over with, put her mind at ease, and then we can go back to normal. It's probably nothing, honestly. Just being cautious, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. It sounds like this is largely driven by your wife's concerns, and you're being a supportive partner by getting checked. That's great. Even with a long-term, monogamous relationship, routine testing is a reasonable precaution. To be thorough, and just to cover all our bases, have either you or your wife ever had any sexually transmitted infections, even in the past?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. We were… careful. Before we got married, we both got tested, and everything was clear. We've been very… exclusive since then. I find that question a little… insulting, to be honest. It implies… things. We're respectable people. But alright, for the record: no. Never.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that question came across as insensitive, Jacquille. It's standard procedure to ask about past STI history, regardless of relationship status, simply to ensure we have a complete picture of your health. It wasn’t meant to imply anything about you or your wife, truly. Let’s move on. Can you tell me a little about your general health habits?
PATIENT: Habits? What kind of habits are we talking about? I don't smoke. I drink, socially. A few beers with dinner sometimes. I eat… reasonably well. My wife cooks. Mostly Nepalese food, which is very healthy, I assure you. Lots of vegetables. I try to walk, when I can, but work keeps me busy. I sit at a desk all day, mostly. Compliance is not a very active profession. Do you need a detailed list of everything I eat and do? It seems a little… excessive.
DOCTOR: No, no detailed list needed. Just getting a general sense of your lifestyle. That's helpful to know. No smoking is excellent, and moderate alcohol consumption is usually fine. Desk work can be tough on the body, so we can discuss ways to stay active even with your job. Now, have you experienced any unusual symptoms lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. Nothing at all. That’s why I'm here, honestly. I feel perfectly fine. My wife just… worries. She read something online about early symptoms of… things, and insisted I get checked. She's a bit of a hypochondriac, if I'm being honest. Fatigue, fever… she rattled off a whole list. But I haven't had any of it. I feel completely normal. I’m wasting my time here, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: You're not wasting your time. It's always good to be proactive about your health, even if it's just to reassure your wife and put her mind at ease. And, truthfully, sometimes people don't feel sick even when something is going on. Alright, to be completely thorough, let’s do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your vitals, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I have things to do, you know. Compliance doesn’t just… happen. But yes, alright. Do your thing. I’m sure it will be perfectly normal. This is all a waste of time, but if it keeps my wife happy… Let's just be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as efficient as possible. If you could just sit up on the examination table, that would be great. Blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses or organomegaly palpated. Everything appears normal so far. Alright, everything checks out physically, which is good. Now, to get the HIV test done, I’ll just need to draw a small sample of blood. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I hate needles. But if you must. It’s all for my wife, anyway. She’ll be happy. Just… be quick, alright? And don’t poke me too much. I have important work to do. Compliance doesn’t tolerate incompetence. Especially from… blood drawers. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’m very experienced, and I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. We’ll get this done in a flash. Alright, all done. Just a little pressure here to stop the bleeding. We’ll send this off to the lab, and the results should be back in about a week. We'll call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: A week? A whole week? Honestly, that’s ridiculous. Can’t you speed it up? I have things to do. But alright, fine. A week. Just… make sure you call. Don't make me come back here. No, nothing else. Just the results. And tell your lab to hurry. Compliance waits for no one. And my wife will be asking questions, I assure you. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Jacquille. Unfortunately, the lab processing time is standard. I’ll make a note to prioritize the results and call you as soon as they're available. I’ll also give you a written copy of my notes and the lab request form to take with you. If you have any questions before then, don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day, and I’ll be in touch soon.
