DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Puder. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. My heart… it feels funny sometimes. Like it’s beating too fast, but not regular. It scares my wife a little. It’s why I came.
DOCTOR: "Funny" is a rather vague descriptor, Mr. Puder. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm... okay. It's like… a fast flapping, but not steady. Like a bird maybe? Not smooth, you know? Sometimes it lasts a few minutes, then goes away. Other times… it comes and goes all day. It doesn’t hurt, just… feels wrong.
DOCTOR: A "fast flapping"... I see. And when this happens, are you doing anything in particular?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. Sometimes I’m just sitting, watching TV. Other times I'm walking to the store. Doesn't seem to matter what I’m doing. It just… starts. Maybe a little more when I’m stressed, but even when I’m relaxed, it happens. I don't know for sure.
DOCTOR: And has this been going on for a long time, Mr. Puder, or is this a recent development?
PATIENT: Maybe... six months now? It started slow, just a few times. My wife said I should come, but I thought it was nothing. Then it started happening more and more often, so… here I am.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside this irregular heartbeat?
PATIENT: No, not really. Sometimes I feel a little tired, but I work long hours. And sometimes I get a little… dizzy, maybe. But I don’t think that's from the heart. I don't know. It's hard to say. Mostly just the fast beating. It worries me, you know?
DOCTOR: And do you have any history of heart problems in your family?
PATIENT: My father... he had high blood pressure, I think. Not sure about heart problems exactly. He passed away a long time ago. And my mother… she was always healthy. Not that I know of, no. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It can be. Alright, Mr. Puder. Let's get some basic information. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had any problems with medicine before. I only take something for my back sometimes, but that's it. Nothing for my heart.
DOCTOR: And what exactly do you take for your back?
PATIENT: Just ibuprofen, Doctor. The regular kind. When it hurts a lot. Not every day, just when I need it. The blue one in the box. Is that… okay to take? I always read the label, so I don’t take too much.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen is generally safe when used as directed. Now, let's proceed with a physical examination. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your pulse, and take your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you need. I want to know what’s wrong. I trust you. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I get nervous easily.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie back on the table. I'll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated – 142 over 90. Not alarmingly so, but something to monitor. Now, listening to your heart... I do detect a slightly irregular rhythm, as you described. It's not consistent, but it's present. Lungs sound clear. Pulse is 88 and also somewhat irregular. Now, I'm going to palpate your pulse and check for any signs of edema in your extremities. Pulses are within normal limits, and there’s no edema.
PATIENT: Okay... elevated blood pressure… that doesn’t sound good, right? Is that from the heart beating funny? I get worried when you talk about things like that. Should I… be scared?
DOCTOR: Mr. Puder, it's rarely helpful to jump to conclusions. Elevated blood pressure is common, and doesn't automatically signify a serious problem. It can be caused by stress, diet, and various other factors. As for the irregular heartbeat, it could be related, or it could be entirely separate. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order an electrocardiogram, or ECG, to record your heart's electrical activity. And a basic blood panel to check your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. Do you have insurance coverage for these tests?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have insurance. It costs too much. I work hard, but… it’s hard to pay for everything. Can we… not do them, then? Is it really important? What will it cost? I don’t want any big surprises.
DOCTOR: Mr. Puder, while I understand your financial constraints, these tests are important for determining the cause of your symptoms and ruling out serious conditions. An ECG is relatively inexpensive, perhaps around $150 to $200, depending on the facility. The blood panel will be another $100 to $150. Without them, I am left to speculate, and that is not good medical practice. I can suggest some lower-cost facilities, but I cannot provide adequate care without a proper work-up. Perhaps we can discuss a payment plan?
PATIENT: Okay... $300... that's a lot, Doctor. But… you're right. I don't want you just guessing. I want to know what’s wrong. Can you tell me about the lower-cost places? And… what if the tests show something bad? I get scared just thinking about it. My wife worries enough already.
DOCTOR: There's a clinic on Elm Street that offers discounted rates for uninsured patients. Let me pull up their information for you. Here. This facility generally charges around $120 for an ECG and $80 for the basic blood panel. It is a little further away, and the wait times may be longer, but it's more affordable. As for "something bad," Mr. Puder, it's best not to dwell on worst-case scenarios. The irregular heartbeat could be benign, such as an atrial fibrillation, but we need to rule out more serious conditions, such as structural heart disease. If something serious is detected, we will discuss appropriate treatment options, including referral to a cardiologist. Now, do you want me to write you a referral for the lab, or would you like to postpone further investigation for the time being?
PATIENT: Okay… Elm Street… I think I know where that is. My wife drives past there sometimes. $200… that's… better. Yes, Doctor, please write me the referral. I want to get it done. I don’t want to keep worrying. And… what does it mean, “atrial fib-ri-lay-shun”? Is that bad? You said something about a heart doctor, too? Is that because it is something serious? I just... I'm scared, Doctor. Really scared.
DOCTOR: Mr. Puder, “atrial fibrillation” is an irregular and often rapid heart rate. It’s not immediately life-threatening in most cases, but it can increase your risk of stroke and other complications. That’s why it's important to get it checked out. A cardiologist is a specialist in heart conditions. Referring you does not automatically mean you have a serious problem; it simply means I want a specialist to provide a second opinion and determine the best course of treatment. Here. Take this to the lab on Elm Street. They will schedule an appointment. Once you have the results, bring them back to me, and we will discuss them. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No… no, Doctor, I think that’s all. Thank you… for writing the referral. I… I appreciate it. And for explaining things, even though… I didn't understand everything. I hope everything is okay. I’ll go to the lab… as soon as I can. Thank you again, Doctor. Stop. I think… that’s all.
