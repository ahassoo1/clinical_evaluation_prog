DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well… it's my face. It gets… red. Like, flushing. Happens sometimes. Not always, you know? It’s a little embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand. Flushing, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… when I get warm. Or… sometimes when I’m talking to people. Not always, though. It just… happens. I don't know why it happens. Maybe it's nothing?
DOCTOR: It's good you're bringing this to my attention, Mr. Withycombe. Even if it seems minor, it's important to investigate. Could you describe where on your face the redness appears?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It's mostly my cheeks, I think. And… sometimes my neck. Not my forehead, usually. Just… the cheeks and neck. It’s hard to say exactly. It comes and goes so quickly. Like a wave, you know? Then it's gone.
DOCTOR: Cheeks and neck… appearing and disappearing quickly. And you mentioned it happens when you get warm, or when speaking with people. Has anything specific triggered these episodes recently?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. Nothing really specific. Last week, I was talking to the man at the grocery store… about the price of tomatoes. And my face got red. And yesterday, I was… gardening. It was hot. And it happened then too. Not always when gardening, though. Just… sometimes. It's not like I can point to something and say, "That did it!" You know?
DOCTOR: Tomatoes and gardening… interesting. Do you notice any other symptoms along with the flushing, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Sometimes… I feel a little warm, of course, with the red face. And… maybe a little bit shaky. Not much, though. Just… a little bit. Like my hands are… vibrating. But it doesn’t happen every time. Sometimes just the red face. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Withycombe. You’re explaining it very well. And the shakiness... is that in your hands specifically?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Mostly in my hands. And sometimes… a little bit in my legs. But not always. It’s… it’s not a big shake, you understand? Just… a little bit wobbly. Like when you’re very tired, maybe? Not as bad as that, though. Just… a feeling.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me. Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any existing health conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Health conditions… not really. I was a little sick with the flu a couple of years ago, but I got over it. And… my wife, she passed away last year. But… that wasn't a health condition, was it? I don’t have any problems with… you know, heart or anything. I don’t take any pills. Not usually.
DOCTOR: I understand. I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. And no existing health conditions, that's good to know. You mentioned not taking any pills usually... have you taken anything recently, even over-the-counter medications?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. I took something for a headache, maybe a week ago? Just… one of those pain pills. Acetaminophen, I think it was. Nothing else. And… sometimes I take something for my stomach. It’s… antacid. When I eat spicy food. But not very often. Just… when I need it. It’s not every day, you know?
DOCTOR: Acetaminophen and antacids as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I’ve eaten… lots of different things in my life. And I’ve never had a problem. I don’t break out in rashes or anything. My wife… she was the one with allergies. To pollen, mostly. But I’m okay. I think. Never had to worry about that.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, before we proceed, would you mind if I performed a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Uh… sure, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Is it… uncomfortable? I’m not good with… needles, you know. Just letting you know.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Withycombe. No needles involved today, I assure you. I'd just like to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your skin. It's a standard procedure. Would you please sit up and remove your shoes and socks?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… okay. No needles is good. Starts removing shoes and socks Just tell me if anything feels… strange. I’m a little worried about my blood pressure. I eat a lot of salt, you know. My wife, she used to tell me to cut back.
DOCTOR: We'll take a look and see. Now, just relax your arm for me. After a moment Your blood pressure is 145 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Listens to heart and lungs with stethoscope Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Examines skin, noting the cheeks Your skin appears normal, aside from some mild redness on your cheeks. No rashes or any other concerning marks. Do you feel lightheaded at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not lightheaded. Just… warm. Like usual, maybe. Is 145 over 90… bad? My wife, she always worried about numbers. I never really paid attention. Is that why my face gets red? The… the blood pressure? It makes me nervous just thinking about it. Maybe I should have cut back on the salt.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily "bad," Mr. Withycombe, but it is something we should address. Elevated blood pressure can contribute to flushing, but it's not always the cause. It’s often multifactorial. Given your symptoms – the flushing, shakiness, and elevated blood pressure – I suspect we may be dealing with something called rosacea, potentially with some components of anxiety contributing to the symptoms. However, we shouldn’t rule out other possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work to check your hormone levels and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Rosacea? I’ve never heard of that. And… anxiety? That sounds… serious. I’ve been a little sad since my wife passed, but I didn’t think it was… that. Blood work… yes, okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… how much blood do you need? And will it hurt? I always bruise easily, you know. My wife used to say I was a delicate flower.
DOCTOR: Rosacea is a common skin condition, Mr. Withycombe. It causes redness, flushing, and sometimes small bumps on the face. It's not serious, but it can be managed with treatment. And it’s important to remember that experiencing sadness after a loss is perfectly normal – it’s a natural part of grief. We're simply exploring all possibilities to ensure we get the right diagnosis and treatment plan for you. As for the blood work, it's just a standard vial or two – nothing excessive. And while there will be a small prick, it shouldn’t hurt for long. You might feel a slight pinch, but it's generally well-tolerated. We’ll take precautions to minimize any bruising. I'll order the tests now, and the lab technician will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once we have the results, we'll discuss them and create a treatment plan together. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… alright. A small prick is… manageable, I think. And… a treatment plan. That sounds good. I just want to feel… normal again. Like before. Do you think… do you think it will help? I'm worried about… spending money on tests and treatments. I don’t have a lot of savings, you know. My wife… she handled all the finances. I’m just a gardener. Looks down at hands
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Withycombe. It’s perfectly reasonable to be worried about finances, especially after such a loss. We will only order the tests that are absolutely necessary to get an accurate diagnosis, and I will explain the costs clearly before proceeding. I can also connect you with resources that may offer financial assistance if needed. And to answer your question – I am optimistic that we can find a treatment plan that will help you feel better. It may take some time and adjustments, but I believe we can manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. We’ll start with the blood work, and then we can discuss potential treatment options based on the results. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. A plan is good. Financial assistance… that would be helpful, maybe. I don’t want to be a burden. Just… feeling normal again. That's all I want. Okay. Let’s do the blood work. When should I schedule it? And… should I eat something beforehand? My wife, she always said I needed to eat before getting blood drawn. Smiles weakly
DOCTOR: You’re not a burden, Mr. Withycombe, not at all. We're here to help you. As for the blood work, you can schedule it at your convenience with the lab. They’re open Monday through Friday, 8 AM to 5 PM. And yes, your wife was right – it’s best to eat something beforehand. A light meal or snack will help keep your blood sugar stable and prevent you from feeling faint. You can drink plenty of water as well. I’ll write down the lab’s contact information and a brief note about the tests for you. Hands Mr. Withycombe a small piece of paper We'll review the results together as soon as they're available. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that's… everything. Thank you for being… patient with me. And for not laughing at my red face. Chuckles softly I appreciate it. Starts to gather belongings I’ll call the lab tomorrow. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. It was my pleasure. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
