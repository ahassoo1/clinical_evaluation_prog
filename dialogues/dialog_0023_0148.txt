DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepro. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh… it’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, honestly. It’s… pain. Down there. In… that area. It started a few days ago, I think. It’s difficult to recall exactly when. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: "Down there," you say. Yes, I understand it can be difficult to discuss these things. Let's try to be precise, shall we?
PATIENT: Precise… yes, of course. It’s… in my… well, in the area where… a man’s… parts are. I know that's not very… delicate, but I don’t… I don’t really know the correct terms, Doctor. It’s not my parts, obviously. It's just… the pain is there.
DOCTOR: Right. So, discomfort in the perineal region. And you said it began a few days ago. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Perineal… is that what you call it? Yes, that sounds… right. The pain… it’s not sharp, exactly. More of a… dull ache? And sometimes… a heavy feeling. Like something is… bruised, perhaps? It comes and goes. It’s not constant, thankfully. But when it’s there, it's… noticeable.
DOCTOR: A dull ache and a heavy feeling. Is it related to any particular activity?
PATIENT: Activity… Hmm… that’s a good question. I’ve been doing a lot of work with wood, as usual. Building things for people. It’s my trade, you see. I don't think it's related to that, specifically. It doesn't hurt while I’m working. It’s just… there afterwards, sometimes. Or just… randomly. I haven’t noticed a pattern, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: So, no direct correlation to physical exertion, but sometimes present afterward. Do you experience any pain with urination or bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… Oh dear. That's… a very personal question, Doctor. Let me see… No, not with them, exactly. Everything feels… normal during. But… sometimes afterwards, there’s a bit of… discomfort. A slight ache, maybe? It's not severe, but it's there. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Discomfort post-voiding and bowel movement, mild. Alright. And have you noticed any discharge, fever, chills, or any changes in your vaginal area?
PATIENT: Oh my… Discharge? No, no discharge. Definitely not. And no fever, no chills. No changes… down there. I… I haven’t really… examined myself closely, if you know what I mean. I’m not… that type. It's just this ache, Doctor. And the heaviness. It’s… worrying me, because it’s not normal for me.
DOCTOR: Understandable. Alright, Ms. Stepro, I think we need to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. It's important to rule out anything serious. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Oh dear. I… I wasn’t expecting that. Is it… necessary? It’s just… a bit embarrassing, you see. I’m not used to… this. But… if it’s important, then… yes, I suppose. But please… be gentle? And… explain everything first?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Stepro. I understand your hesitation completely. We will proceed with the utmost care and respect. I'll explain everything as we go, and you can stop me at any time if you're uncomfortable. We'll start with a visual inspection, and then I’ll need to do a gentle internal exam to assess the area. It’s standard procedure, and it will help us determine the cause of your discomfort. I’ll use a lubricated speculum and a gloved hand. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A… a speculum? And a gloved hand? Oh dear. It sounds… intrusive. But… alright. If you say it's necessary. Please… be as quick as possible, Doctor. And… explain each step, like you promised. I… I'm just very nervous. And… is there anything I should do to… prepare?
DOCTOR: It will be as quick and comfortable as possible, Ms. Stepro. You don’t need to do anything special to prepare. Just relax your muscles as much as you can. You'll lie on your back with your feet in stirrups. We will start by visually inspecting the external area for any signs of irritation or swelling. Then, I'll gently insert the speculum to examine the vaginal canal and cervix. I'll explain each step before I do it. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Stirrups? Oh. That sounds… undignified. And… will it hurt? I’m worried about pain. And… what are you looking for, exactly? If you could just tell me what you’re trying to find, it might make me feel… a little less anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Stepro. The stirrups are simply to allow for a better view. As for pain, it shouldn't be excruciating, but you may feel some pressure or discomfort. I will be as gentle as possible. We’re looking for any signs of infection – redness, swelling, discharge. We’ll also be checking for any abnormalities in the vaginal walls or cervix, like lesions or polyps. It’s a routine examination, but it’s important to rule out anything serious. Now, if you're ready, we can proceed. I will let you know each step before I do it. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Routine… yes, that helps. Polyps… that sounds… worrying. But… alright. If you promise to be gentle and explain everything. Yes. I… I suppose I’m ready. But please… go slowly? And tell me before you do anything.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Slowly and with explanation. I will position you on the table now. First, we'll get you lying comfortably on your back. Then, I’ll help you position your legs in the stirrups. I will explain each step before I do it. It might be a bit awkward at first, but just try to relax. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Awkward… yes, that’s putting it mildly. But… alright. Just… please be quick about it. I don’t… I don’t like feeling exposed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepro, just take a deep breath and relax. I’m just going to gently lift your legs and place them in the stirrups. It might feel a little strange, but it’s important for us to get a good view. I’ll let you know when I’m ready to begin the examination. Just breathe normally, and if you feel any discomfort, please let me know immediately. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Just… just hurry, please. I’m… I’m very uncomfortable. And… please, tell me what you’re doing, even if it seems obvious. It’s… it helps to know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepro. Your legs are now in position. I’m now going to gently drape a sheet over you to maintain your privacy. I'm going to use a light to visually inspect the external area for any signs of redness, swelling or lesions. Then, I’ll gently insert the speculum. I’ll apply lubricant to make it more comfortable. It may feel some pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. Just let me know if you feel anything concerning. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Sheet… yes, good. Privacy is… important. Pressure… okay. Just… please be careful. And… tell me what you see. If you see anything… concerning. Please, don’t hesitate. I want to know. Even if it’s… bad news.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepro. I'm now visually inspecting the external area. I see some mild redness around the opening of the vagina, but no visible lesions or swelling. I'm going to apply a small amount of lubricant to the speculum now. Then I will gently insert it into the vagina to get a better view of the cervix. Just take a deep breath and relax your muscles. It may feel some pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. Let me know if you feel any discomfort. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Lubricant… okay. Pressure… I’m… I’m trying to relax. It’s… difficult. Just… get it over with quickly, please. And… tell me what you see, Doctor. Please, tell me what you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepro. I’m gently inserting the speculum now. Just breathe normally, and relax your muscles as much as you can. It may feel some pressure. Okay… I have a view of the cervix now. It appears… slightly inflamed, and there’s some mucopurulent discharge present. No obvious lesions or polyps visible at this time. I’m going to take a swab to send to the lab for further analysis. Just a quick swab, it may be slightly uncomfortable. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Inflamed…? Mucopurulent…? What does that mean? Is it… bad? A swab…? Oh dear. A swab… is that… painful? Tell me, Doctor… is it something serious? Please… be honest with me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepro. I've removed the speculum now. Inflammation simply means there is some irritation or swelling. The mucopurulent discharge indicates there may be an infection present. I’ve taken a swab to determine the specific cause of the infection – bacterial, viral, or fungal. The swab itself shouldn't be very painful, just a slight discomfort. At this point, it's too early to say definitively how serious it is. We need the lab results to determine the best course of treatment. However, it's likely treatable with antibiotics or other medication. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Infection…? Antibiotics…? Oh dear, oh dear. Is it… is it sexually transmitted? I haven't… I haven’t been with anyone in years. It must be something else, mustn't it? What else could it be? Please, tell me it isn’t… that.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stepro, it’s understandable to be concerned. While sexually transmitted infections can cause inflammation and discharge, they are not the only cause. Other possibilities include bacterial vaginosis, a yeast infection, or even irritation from certain soaps or detergents. The swab we took will help us determine the exact cause. It's important to avoid jumping to conclusions until we have the results. We'll discuss all possible scenarios and treatment options once we have the lab findings. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: So… it could be something else? Not necessarily… that? A yeast infection… that sounds… less frightening. Detergents… yes, perhaps. I changed laundry soaps recently… that could be it, couldn't it? Please, tell me it’s just the laundry soap. It would be… a relief. When will we have the results? And… what do I do in the meantime?
DOCTOR: Yes, a change in laundry detergents is a plausible explanation, and it’s certainly a possibility we’ll explore. It’s good you mentioned that. As for the results, the lab usually takes 2-3 business days to provide the findings. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding douching, wearing loose-fitting cotton underwear, and continuing to use your regular hygiene practices. You can also try switching back to your previous laundry detergent to see if that helps alleviate the symptoms. If the symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to contact me. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: 2-3 days… yes. I can wait. Cotton underwear… I already do that, thankfully. And switching back to the old soap… yes, I’ll do that right away. If it worsens… I will call. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you for not… assuming the worst. It’s… a relief to talk to you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stepro. I understand your concerns, and it's my job to provide you with the best possible care and information. We’ll follow up once the lab results are available. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here’s a summary of our discussion and the instructions for the next few days. I'll see you then.
