DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kelder, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Billman, is it? Yes, well, it’s been my stomach, mostly. Feels… off. Not right. I get sick to my stomach a lot, even if I don’t eat much. Just a little bit will fill me up, and then… well, you know. It’s been going on for a bit now. I can’t rightly say how long, though. Time just… slips away.
DOCTOR: “A bit now,” huh?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s not new, certainly. It’s just… gotten more frequent, I suppose. And… more bothersome. Hard to enjoy anything when you’re worried about feeling sick, you know? I used to love baking… and now… not so much. It’s hard to explain. It just doesn’t feel good.
DOCTOR: Baking, okay. And when you say "doesn't feel good," is that just the nausea, or is there any pain involved?
PATIENT: Hmm… pain… not sharp pain, exactly. More of a… fullness. A heavy feeling, right under my ribs. And sometimes, just a general ache, kind of all over. It’s hard to tell if that’s the stomach or… something else. I get aches, you know, at my age. Everything aches, sometimes. It’s not constant, though. It comes and goes. Like the weather. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, fullness under the ribs, general aches… comes and goes. And you said it's been bothering you more recently. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Changes… well, let me think. My… my husband, bless his heart, he passed last year. That was a big change. Things aren’t the same without him, of course. We always did everything together. And… I’ve not been eating as much since then. Not much of an appetite, you see. It just doesn't taste the same, not without him. And I've been… well, a little more tired than usual, I suppose. But that could just be… everything.
DOCTOR: Right. Loss of appetite, tiredness… I see. And before your husband passed, were you eating normally?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes. We both loved our food. He was a wonderful cook, you know. Always experimenting with new recipes. We always had a big garden, too, so lots of fresh vegetables. I used to help him with the canning, making pickles and jams. We ate… well, we ate good. A regular appetite, for sure. Not like now. It’s just… small portions. And I don’t even want much, sometimes. It’s… strange.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any medications currently, Mrs. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see... just the usual, I think. For my blood pressure. A little white pill. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take something for that. But that’s it, I believe. Nothing else. I try to avoid taking too many pills, you know? They never seem to do much good anyway. I can’t rightly remember the names of them, though. I have a terrible memory these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll get the list from the pharmacy. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I don’t think so. Nothing I’ve ever noticed. I used to help my grandmother with her herbs, you know. Picking them, drying them… never had a reaction to any of those. I don’t recall ever having a bad reaction to anything, honestly. But… well, I can’t promise I remember everything. It’s been a long life. Do you need me to think harder? I could try… but it makes my head spin sometimes.
DOCTOR: No, no, that’s alright. We can look that up as well. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, that sounds… sensible. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I don’t like being poked and prodded much. But if you think it’s necessary… I trust your judgment, Doctor. Just… be gentle, alright? My old bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just get up on the table for me. I'll listen to your heart and lungs first, then feel your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable, okay?
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, I'm up. Be careful now, Doctor. And… yes, please do let me know if anything hurts. Though, like I said, it’s hard to tell sometimes what is hurting and what just… is. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, deep breath in… and out… good. Again… Heart sounds are… regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Let me know if anything is tender. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. That’s… a little tender. Not sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. It’s been feeling like that for a while now. Sort of a constant… pressure, really. It’s not terrible, but… I do notice it. Especially when you push like that. Yes, that’s where it hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about here?
PATIENT: Hmm… here, it’s not so bad. A little… full, maybe? But not painful. And over here… no, that’s alright. Just feels… normal. Like it should. It’s mostly on that right side, like you’re pressing on now. A sort of… heavy ache. It’s hard to explain. It's not like a stabbing pain, just… uncomfortable. And it seems to be getting worse lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how about your bowel movements, Mrs. Kelder?
PATIENT: Oh, my… well. They’re… irregular. Sometimes I go every day, sometimes not for a few days. And… they’re not as solid as they used to be. Sorry to be so… frank. It’s just… part of getting old, I suppose. I don’t eat as much fiber as I should, and… well, things just aren’t working like they used to. It’s a little embarrassing to talk about, but… that’s the truth of it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mrs. Kelder, based on what you've told me and the exam, it could be a number of things. Given your age, the tenderness in your right upper quadrant, and the changes in your bowel habits, it’s possible we're dealing with some gallbladder issues. It could also be something simpler, like constipation, but we need to rule things out. I’m going to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen. That will give us a better picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A CT scan… that sounds… serious. And blood work… I don’t like needles, you know. But… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then I suppose I trust your judgment. I just… I hope it’s nothing too bad. What does a CT scan show, exactly? And will it hurt? I get so nervous with these things… my heart just races. Is it something I need to prepare for? Will I have to… drink anything awful?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Kelder. The CT scan uses X-rays to create detailed pictures of the organs inside your abdomen. It doesn’t hurt, it’s like a quick X-ray, but more detailed. You’ll lie on a table, and a scanner will move around you. You will need to drink a contrast dye beforehand, which… tastes a bit like chalky water, but it’s necessary for us to see everything clearly. The pamphlet explains it in more detail. As for preparing, you don’t need to do anything special, just drink plenty of water beforehand. The blood work is just to check your liver function and look for signs of inflammation. It’s standard procedure. Look through this, and the nurse will explain everything again before the tests. We're just trying to rule things out and figure out what’s causing your discomfort. It doesn’t necessarily mean it's something serious. And frankly, at your age, it's best to be thorough. We'll get the results back in a few days, and then we can discuss the next steps. Does that sound… acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes… acceptable. I suppose. It just… all this sounds so frightening. My husband, he always took care of these things. I never had to worry about it before. But… if you think it’s best, then I’ll do it. The nurse will explain it again, you say? Good. I appreciate that. And… a few days, you said? That seems like a long time to wait, but… alright. Just… please, Doctor, if you find anything… anything bad… just be honest with me. I can handle it. I just… don’t want to be kept in the dark.
