DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s… family history, mostly. My mother’s side, specifically. A lot of heart trouble. And cancer, too. It’s just… unsettling, you know? I want to make sure I’m not headed that way. I’m probably fine, honestly, but it’s good to be sure, right?
DOCTOR: "Unsettling" is putting it mildly. Family history is important, I suppose. Though, honestly, everyone's got something these days. Still, it's better to be proactive, I’ll give you that. Now, let's get some specifics. When you say "heart trouble," what exactly are we talking about?
PATIENT: Well, my grandmother died of a heart attack, pretty suddenly. And my aunt… she had a valve thing. Needed surgery a few years back. I don’t really know the details, to be honest. My mom doesn’t like talking about it. She gets… emotional. And the cancer was… lung cancer, mostly. A couple of uncles. It’s just a lot, you know? I try not to worry about it, but… it’s hard. It feels inevitable sometimes.
DOCTOR: “Emotional” is understandable. Some things are difficult to discuss. A sudden heart attack and a valve issue… that’s concerning. And lung cancer… well, that's something we definitely need to keep in mind. Alright. So, you're feeling a bit anxious about your own risk, given this history. Are you experiencing any symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not really. I mean, I get tired sometimes, but who doesn't? And maybe a little… breathless when I’m running up the stairs, but I’m not exactly a marathon runner, you know? I guess I just… worry. I eat okay, I try to exercise, but it's hard to shake the feeling that it's just a matter of time. I feel perfectly healthy, to be honest. Which is probably why I feel silly even being here.
DOCTOR: "Silly?
PATIENT: No, no, it’s not silly at all. It’s responsible, really. I just… I don't want to waste your time if I'm perfectly fine. It's just that… well, my ex-wife always said I worry too much. Maybe she was right. But still, better safe than sorry, right? I just… I’d like to know what my chances are, if that makes sense. And maybe… what I can do about it. If anything.
DOCTOR: “Chances,” you say. Alright. Well, let's get a better picture. You mentioned eating okay and trying to exercise. Can you tell me a bit more about your diet?
PATIENT: Sure. I try to eat a lot of vegetables, you know? Salads, things like that. I cook most of my meals, which is good, I guess. Not a lot of fast food. I do have a bit of a sweet tooth, though. I like my desserts. And I drink coffee, probably too much. Black coffee, mostly. No sugar. I wouldn’t say I eat badly, but it’s not like I’m a health fanatic or anything. I have a weakness for Indian sweets, if I’m being honest. They're hard to resist.
DOCTOR: “Indian sweets,” yes. Well, everything in moderation, I suppose. And black coffee… that's not terrible. But let’s talk about exercise. How often do you exercise, and what do you typically do?
PATIENT: Okay, so… exercise. It’s… sporadic. I try to go to the gym a couple of times a week, but work gets busy, you know? And then… life happens. I used to run more, but my knee started bothering me. So, mostly I do weights. Some cardio, but not much. Honestly, it’s probably not enough. I really should do more, I know. I just… it’s hard to find the time and motivation sometimes. It feels like another chore.
DOCTOR: “Another chore,” you say. Yes, well, many things feel that way. Alright. And do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, absolutely not. Never have. My mother would kill me. And frankly, the smell is disgusting. I avoid people who smoke, if I can. It's just… unhealthy. Plain and simple. I don't understand why people do it. It's a terrible habit. My grandfather, on my mother's side, he smoked for years. He got emphysema. It wasn’t pretty. That pretty much sealed it for me.
DOCTOR: Good. That's very good. Now, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I haven't really taken much medication in my life, to be honest. Maybe some antibiotics when I was a kid, but nothing regularly. No reactions that I remember. My ex-wife was the one who always ended up with prescriptions. She had… anxiety. I never really needed anything. I get headaches sometimes, but I just take some ibuprofen. It works fine. I'm generally pretty healthy, honestly. I feel like I’m boring you.
DOCTOR: “Boring” is not a medical term, Mr. Theriot. Let’s move on. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, or a beer when I'm watching a game with friends. Nothing excessive, I assure you. I’m not a heavy drinker. It’s… social, mostly. A way to relax. I don’t need it, though. I could easily go without. It's not like I need a drink to have a good time. I usually have a glass or two on the weekends, but that’s about it. Probably not even that much, to be honest. I don't really see the appeal, if I’m being perfectly frank.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't believe in all that supplement nonsense, to be honest. Seems like a waste of money. And as I said, I don’t really take medication. I get by just fine on my own. Healthy diet, occasional exercise… that’s all I need. I tried a multivitamin once, but it just made my stomach upset. So, no. Nothing at all. I think that’s everything, isn’t it? Am I done? I feel like you’ve asked me a million questions.
DOCTOR: Almost. Now, Mr. Theriot, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. We'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Nothing major, just a routine check. Then we'll discuss some potential next steps. Please sit back and relax. First, let's check your blood pressure. Can you extend your arm, please?
PATIENT: Fine. Honestly, I'm probably perfectly healthy. But alright, let's get it over with. I have a meeting this afternoon. I hope this doesn't take too long. I already explained my family history, didn’t I? It’s just… anxiety, really. That’s probably all it is.
DOCTOR: 128/82. Not bad, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears are clear. Throat looks normal, no signs of infection. Alright, Mr. Theriot. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, you seem to be in generally good health. However, given your family history of heart disease and cancer, I do recommend some further testing, just to be safe. I want to get a baseline lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels and a complete blood count. We should also consider an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. And given your family history of lung cancer, even though you don't smoke, we may want to discuss a low-dose CT scan of your chest, depending on your risk factors. Would you be open to those tests?
PATIENT: Tests. Of course. I knew it. Honestly, I just wanted you to tell me I was fine and send me on my way. But alright. If you think it’s necessary… yes, I’ll do the tests. But honestly, I'm not a fan of unnecessary procedures. And a CT scan… that’s a lot of radiation, isn’t it? I really don’t want to expose myself to more radiation than I need to. But… alright. Do what you think is best. Just… try to keep it to a minimum, alright? I have a busy schedule. And a low-dose scan, if you insist. What’s involved? Will it take long? And how much will all this cost?
DOCTOR: “Unnecessary” is a matter of perspective, Mr. Theriot. Preventative care is rarely unnecessary. And I understand your concerns about radiation exposure. A low-dose CT scan uses significantly less radiation than a standard scan. The blood work and EKG will be quick – about 15-20 minutes total. The CT scan will take a bit longer, maybe 30-45 minutes, including preparation and the scan itself. As for cost, it will depend on your insurance coverage. I can have the billing department check for pre-authorization and provide you with an estimated cost. I’m going to order these tests for you now. I’ll also print out a lab requisition form and an order for the EKG. You can schedule the EKG at the front desk. As for the CT scan, I’ll give you a referral to the radiology center. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. Please bring these with you when you go for your tests. And don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll review the results once they’re available and discuss a plan based on those findings. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Just… try to get the results back quickly, alright? I don’t want to be waiting weeks for something that will probably just tell me what I already know – that I worry too much. And… I guess that’s it? Can I go now? I really need to get back to work. This has taken a lot longer than I expected. I appreciate your… thoroughness, I suppose. .
DOCTOR: Yes, you're free to go. We'll contact you as soon as the results are available. And Mr. Theriot?
