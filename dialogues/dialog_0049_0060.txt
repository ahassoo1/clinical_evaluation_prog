DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it’s… family history, mostly. My mother’s side, specifically. Lots of… problems. Heart stuff, mostly. And, honestly, I just want to be sure I’m not heading down the same path. It’s probably nothing, but better safe than sorry, you know? I’m an engineer, I like to plan things out.
DOCTOR: I understand. Proactive is… sensible. “Lots of problems” is rather vague, though. Can you be more specific about the “heart stuff” on your mother's side?
PATIENT: Vague is a fair criticism, I suppose. Okay, let's see… My grandmother, her mother, died of… well, they called it a heart attack back then, but I suspect it was more complicated. And my aunt… she had some blockage, needed a stent, I think. And my uncle, he had high blood pressure for years, ended up with… something with his heart rhythm. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. They weren’t big on talking about it, and I wasn’t really paying attention when I was younger. It's just… it feels like a lot of heart trouble, and I don't want to end up like them.
DOCTOR: Right. A family history of cardiac events… concerning, certainly. And you’re understandably anxious. Do you happen to know the ages at which these relatives experienced these issues?
PATIENT: Hmm. Ages… that’s difficult. My grandmother, she died in her late sixties, I think. Maybe sixty-eight? My aunt had the stent… I'd say around fifty-five, give or take a year. And my uncle… he was probably in his early seventies when they really started having problems with his blood pressure. He lived a bit longer after that, but… I’m just estimating, honestly. No one really kept track of things back then. They weren’t… health-conscious.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, onset of cardiac issues in the late fifties to seventies. That’s… helpful, though imperfect. And you mentioned you’re an engineer. That suggests a certain level of… analytical ability. Do you have any symptoms currently?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No, not really. That's why I said it's probably nothing. I mean, I get tired, but who doesn’t? And sometimes I feel a little… breathless when I climb stairs, but I’m a bit out of shape, to be frank. I sit at a desk all day. It's not like I'm having chest pain or anything dramatic. I just… I'd rather be sure than to suddenly find out something’s wrong. It's just… responsible, you know? Planning ahead.
DOCTOR: Yes, “responsible” is… commendable. A lack of acute symptoms is reassuring, of course. But fatigue and breathlessness are nonspecific. We'll need to investigate further. Have you ever had your cholesterol checked?
PATIENT: Cholesterol? Um… I think so, once. Years ago. When I was in college, maybe? For a sports physical. But I have no idea what the numbers were. They just told me it was “fine.” I don't really pay attention to those things, honestly. I'm an engineer, not a doctor. I deal with concrete problems, not… blood work.
DOCTOR: Right. “Fine” is… not particularly useful information. We’ll need to get a recent lipid panel. And I'd like to perform a physical exam, if you don't mind. Blood pressure, heart and lung sounds, just a basic assessment. Then we can discuss further testing, potentially an EKG.
PATIENT: An EKG… is that the thing with the stickers? Honestly, it all sounds a bit… unnecessary. I feel perfectly healthy. But… I suppose if that's what you recommend. I just… I don’t want to be poked and prodded if it's not going to tell you anything useful. Are you sure it’s worth it, given that I have no actual symptoms?
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, with your family history, a thorough evaluation is… prudent. An EKG is a quick, non-invasive test that can detect arrhythmias or evidence of previous cardiac events. It’s a baseline assessment. “Preventative” is the key here. Now, if you'll please lie down on the examination table. I'll listen to your heart and lungs first. Then we’ll proceed with the EKG.
PATIENT: Fine. But I’m telling you, you’re going to find nothing. Honestly, doctors these days… always wanting to run tests for everything. It's all about the bill, isn’t it? Still… Let's just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is a little elevated, actually. Regular rhythm, but somewhat fast. Lungs are clear to auscultation, no wheezes or crackles noted. Blood pressure is 135/85. A bit on the higher side, but not alarming. Now, let’s get you hooked up to the EKG machine. It’s just a few stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Elevated? Elevated how? Is that bad? Look, I told you, I was just walking up the stairs. I get a little winded easily, okay? And I had a large coffee this morning. That probably has something to do with it. Honestly, you’re making me anxious now. This is exactly why I didn’t want to do this. Are you sure you know what you’re doing?
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, please try to remain calm. A slightly elevated heart rate can be normal, particularly with exertion or caffeine intake. However, it warrants further investigation given your family history. The EKG will provide valuable information. Now, if you can just lie still for a moment… It will take about 30 seconds. Try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: Thirty seconds feels like an eternity. Honestly, I could be doing something productive right now. Designing a bridge, maybe. Instead, I’m lying here being subjected to… this. Are you seeing anything? Is it normal? You’re awfully quiet. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, the EKG shows… some nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities. Nothing definitive, but it's not entirely normal. Given your family history and slightly elevated blood pressure, I recommend further evaluation. We'll need a full lipid panel, a complete blood count, and I'm going to order a stress test to assess your heart's function under exertion. I understand you're anxious, but it's better to be thorough. We need to rule out any potential cardiac issues. I’m also going to schedule you a consultation with a cardiologist.
PATIENT: A cardiologist?! Are you serious? You're sending me to a specialist based on a few beeps and a slightly high blood pressure reading? This is… overreacting. I feel perfectly fine! I don’t need a specialist, I need a second opinion. This is… unnecessary and frankly, a little insulting. You’re making me worry over nothing! I think I'd like to… reconsider this whole thing. Perhaps I should just get a copy of my chart and… find another doctor. A doctor who doesn’t jump to conclusions.
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, I understand your frustration. However, I am obligated to provide you with the best possible care, and given your family history and these initial findings, a cardiology consultation is… prudent. It doesn't mean you have a problem, it means we are being proactive. You are, of course, entitled to a second opinion. I can certainly provide you with a copy of your chart and a list of cardiologists in the area. However, I strongly advise you not to delay seeking further evaluation. Ignoring potential cardiac issues can have serious consequences. Now, do you want me to proceed with ordering the blood work?
PATIENT: Fine. Do the blood work. But don't expect me to jump for joy over a cardiology appointment. Honestly, this is ridiculous. And… make sure the cardiologist is aware that I think this is all a bit… excessive. Just… get it over with. I have a bridge to design. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ve ordered the lipid panel and complete blood count. The results should be available in a few days. I’ll have my nurse schedule the cardiology appointment for you as soon as possible, and I’ll be sure to include a detailed summary of our consultation and your concerns. Please, Mr. Theriot, don’t delay scheduling the appointment. And if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, go to the emergency room immediately. .
