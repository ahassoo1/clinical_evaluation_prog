DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, it’s about… long-term care, I think? My… someone told me I needed to get checked out for it. My memory ain’t what it used to be, so I forget the details. It was my wife who… she handled most of that stuff.
DOCTOR: Long-term care, right. And it was your wife who scheduled this appointment, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. She… she passed a few months back. I’m just trying to… figure things out now. She was always good with paperwork and knowin’ what needed done. I’m kinda lost without her.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, I understand that must be incredibly difficult. It's perfectly alright to feel lost in these circumstances. Let’s focus on what you’re experiencing now. You mentioned your memory isn’t what it used to be. Can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Elaborate… hmm. It’s… little things, mostly. Forget where I put my keys, what I had for breakfast… sometimes I have trouble rememberin’ names. Not all the time, but it happens more and more. And… sometimes I feel a bit confused, like I’m not quite… present. It’s hard to explain. It don’t feel like… a big thing, usually, but it worries me.
DOCTOR: Right. So, mainly difficulties with recall – keys, meals, names – and occasional feelings of confusion. And you said it’s becoming more frequent. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to manage everyday tasks – things like paying bills, cooking, or driving?
PATIENT: Driving… that’s a good question. I… I mostly try to avoid it now, if I can. Not because I can’t, but… I just feel a little… uneasy. Like I’m not as sharp as I used to be. Bills… my daughter helps with those now. She set up somethin’ automatic. I used to do all that myself, no problem. Cookin’… I still cook, but simple stuff. I don't try anything fancy anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… like what kind of symptoms? I… I don't know. I sleep okay, I guess. Maybe I’m a little more tired than I used to be, but that could just be my age. No headaches, no… fallin’ or anything like that. Sometimes I just feel… down, you know? Sad. But that’s been happenin’ since… well, since my wife…
DOCTOR: Right. Fatigue, some low mood… understandable, given the circumstances. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got it under control with pills. And my knees… they bother me sometimes, arthritis, they said. Other than that… nothin’ major, I don't think. I see the doctor regular for check-ups, but I always forget what he tells me.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed with medication, and arthritis in the knees. And you mentioned difficulties remembering what your doctor tells you. Do you know what medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. That's a tough one. Let me think… There’s a little white pill for the blood pressure… and somethin' orange for my knees. I take 'em every mornin'. I… I really don't know the names. My daughter fills my pill box, and I just… take what she puts in there.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll need to get a proper list of your medications. And regarding your family history… are there any instances of dementia or Alzheimer's disease in your family?
PATIENT: Dementia… Alzheimer’s… hmm. My mother… she got kinda forgetful towards the end, but we just thought it was old age. She was pretty old. My grandmother… I don’t really remember her that well. I think she was okay. Nobody ever really said anything about it, if that makes sense. It wasn't somethin' people talked about much back then.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, some possible family history, but nothing definitive. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I’ll check your reflexes, your balance, and do a brief cognitive assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’m just hopin’ you can figure somethin’ out. I just want to know what’s goin’ on, and what I can do about it.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please follow me over to the examination table. First, I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go…
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 138/82. Pulse is 72 and regular. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, let’s do a short cognitive assessment. I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to test your memory and orientation. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… uh… It’s… August… the second, I think? 2025, right? I’m pretty sure it’s 2025.
DOCTOR: Correct. And can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Where we are… Uh… a doctor’s office? I’m at… Dr. Press’s office? Is that right? I don’t remember much about gettin’ here.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words. I will say them slowly, and then I will ask you to remember them. The words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat them back to me?
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. I think I got ‘em.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more questions. What year did World War II end?
PATIENT: World War II… Oh, geez. That’s… that’s a tough one. Was it… the forties? I’m really not good with dates. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll move on. Now, can you spell 'WORLD' backwards?
PATIENT: Backwards… uh… D-L-R-O-W? No… wait… is that right? I’m terrible at spelling.
DOCTOR: Right. Thank you, Mr. Rover. That will be sufficient for now. Based on this preliminary assessment, and your reported symptoms, there are some concerns regarding your cognitive function. However, it’s far too early to make any definitive diagnosis. I would like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these issues. I also recommend a brain scan – either an MRI or a CT scan – to get a more detailed look at your brain structure. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests? I… I don’t know. Are they expensive? I’m on a fixed income. And… is somethin’ really wrong?
DOCTOR: The tests are covered by your private insurance, Mr. Rover. The important thing is to gather information. We need to rule out other possibilities before we jump to any conclusions. I understand your concern, but delaying these tests will only make things worse. Now, as for whether something is "wrong"... it's too early to say. But it's always best to be proactive. Now, do you consent to the blood work and brain scan?
PATIENT: I… okay. If the insurance covers it… and you think it’s important… then yes. Yes, I’ll do the tests. But… what if it’s somethin’ bad?
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood work. You can get that done at any lab. As for the brain scan, I’ll refer you to the radiology department at City General Hospital. They’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. As for whether it’s “something bad”… we’ll discuss the results when they come back. It’s possible it’s nothing serious, but we need to be thorough. I’m also going to recommend that you bring your daughter to your next appointment. It would be helpful to have her input, and she can help you manage your medications and appointments. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: My daughter… yeah, that’s a good idea. She’s always been good at that stuff. The tests… and the daughter… okay. I’ll do it. Thank you, Doctor. I just want to know what’s goin’ on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s the requisition for the blood work. And I’ll have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, once the test results are available. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as confusion, weakness, or difficulty speaking – please contact my office immediately. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. I guess… I’ll see you in two weeks.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please let my nurse know if you have any difficulty scheduling your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Mr. Rover. .
PATIENT: .
