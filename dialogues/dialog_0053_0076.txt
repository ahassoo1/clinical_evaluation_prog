DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Aluia, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello, Doctor… Pitmon, right? Yes, yes. Well, it’s these bumps on my legs. On my shins, mostly. They’re red and… well, they hurt. Not all the time, but when I walk a lot, you know? It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I think. Maybe a month? It’s hard to keep track sometimes.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A month, okay. And they’re on your shins, you said, and they’re painful with walking. Can you describe the bumps to me a bit more?
PATIENT: Well… they're kinda hard. Not like a big lump, but you can feel 'em. And they're red, like I said. Not huge, maybe the size of a small bean? Smaller, even. Some are bigger than others, I guess. And they’re… raised. You know, not flat on my skin. I haven’t noticed any pus or anything like that, if that's what you’re thinking. Just red and bumpy and… annoying. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Small, raised, red bumps on your shins that are tender to the touch, especially with walking. And you said this has been going on for about a month now?
PATIENT: About a month, yes. Maybe a little longer. It started slow, just one or two little bumps. I didn't think much of it at first, figured I bumped into something. But then more kept showing up, and they started hurting more when I was at work. I do a lot of walking at the warehouse, you know? Moving things around. I haven’t been able to figure out what's causing it. Maybe my shoes? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: A warehouse, right. Lots of walking. And you haven't noticed any changes in your shoes recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I wear the same boots pretty much every day. They're work boots, good quality. I've had 'em for a while, maybe six months now? I try to take care of 'em, you know, clean 'em when they get dirty. But no new shoes, no changes. I was thinking maybe it's the heat? It's been really hot lately, hasn’t it? Makes your feet swell up and everything.
DOCTOR: The heat could certainly play a role, but let’s explore some other possibilities. Now, have you had any other symptoms alongside these bumps?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… let me think. Not really. No fever, no chills, no itching. Just the bumps and the pain when I walk. I haven’t felt sick or anything like that. My wife says I’ve been a little more tired lately, but I always am a little tired, you know? Old age catching up, I guess. But nothing specific that I can think of, just these bumps. They're the main problem.
DOCTOR: Right, no fever, chills, or itching. And just increased fatigue, which you attribute to age. Okay. Now, are you taking any medications currently, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me see… I take something for my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And a little pill for cholesterol. Atorvastatin, maybe? Something like that. I take ‘em every morning. That’s it, though. Nothing else. And I haven't started any new vitamins or anything like that recently. My doctor keeps telling me to eat better, but… well, that’s a different story.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril and Atorvastatin. Okay. And no allergies to any medications, as far as you know?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife always double-checks when the doctor prescribes something new, just in case. She's very careful. But no, no known allergies. I can breathe okay, no trouble with any medicines so far.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, let's take a look at these bumps. If you don’t mind, could you please roll up your pant legs so I can get a better look?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, no problem. There they are. You can see 'em pretty good now. They're a little redder when I've been walking, you know? And sore to the touch. Be gentle, okay? My legs aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see a cluster of erythematous papules on both tibias, mostly distal. Some appear slightly raised, and there’s tenderness to palpation, as you described. No signs of open ulceration or drainage. It doesn't appear to be anything overtly alarming, but given the location and your history, I suspect this might be stasis dermatitis, potentially with some secondary inflammation. But we’ll need to rule out other possibilities. I want to run some basic labs, just to be sure. Specifically, a CBC to check for infection, and a metabolic panel to assess your kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… stasis dermatitis? What’s that? Is that serious? And labs… that’s okay, I guess. If you think it’s necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on with my legs. They’re killing me when I walk. So, whatever you need to do, just let me know. CBC and… metabolic panel, right? I’ll try not to worry too much. But my wife is going to worry, I just know it. She always does.
DOCTOR: Stasis dermatitis is essentially inflammation of the skin caused by poor circulation. It’s not usually serious in and of itself, but it can be a sign of underlying vascular issues. That’s why we want to check those blood levels – to rule out anything more concerning. The CBC will look for signs of infection, and the metabolic panel will assess your kidney function, as poor circulation can sometimes affect that. Yes, CBC and metabolic panel. It's a routine check. And don't worry too much. We'll have results back within a few days, and we can discuss them then. In the meantime, try to elevate your legs whenever possible and avoid prolonged standing. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Elevate my legs… yes, I can do that. I sit a lot when I watch TV, so that shouldn't be too hard. And avoid standing… well, I'll try. It's a little hard at work, but I can take more breaks, I guess. So, just sit with my legs up and try not to stand so much. And wait for the results. A few days, you said? Okay. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look at this. I just hope it’s not anything too bad. My wife would be really upset if I had to miss work.
DOCTOR: Yes, a few days. And we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Try to rest and elevate your legs, and don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening of symptoms – increased pain, swelling, fever, or anything else that concerns you. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Alright, Mr. Aluia. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. Have a good day.
