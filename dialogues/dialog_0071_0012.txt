DOCTOR: Good morning, Velda. I’m Dr. Galena. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I’m here because I’m going on a cruise next month, and the cruise line needs some… information from a doctor. Just a general check, really, to make sure I’m fit to travel. They have a form I need filled out.
DOCTOR: Right, a pre-travel form. Perfectly understandable. A cruise is lovely! Alright, let's get some information down. Just to start, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, I've generally been quite alright, thank you. I’m 45 years old, and I don't really have any major complaints, if you understand me. My late husband, God rest his soul, always said I worried too much about silly things, but I haven’t been seriously ill in years. Just the usual little aches and pains, I suppose, for someone my age. I try to keep active, walking the dog most days.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. "Walking the dog" is excellent exercise! And it sounds like you're generally quite healthy, which is wonderful. Just to be thorough… have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. Not ever. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and such, but I’ve never been told I have anything. I’ve always been lucky in that regard, I suppose. My mother always said it was good Scottish blood! Though, I did have a bit of trouble with my gallbladder a few years back, but it resolved itself without needing surgery or anything. Just a lot of discomfort for a while.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder trouble that resolved on its own... good to know. And no current medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never any surgeries. Not a single one. I’ve always been very careful, you see. And, thankfully, I've never needed them. My husband… well, he wasn't so lucky, but I’ve managed to avoid the operating theatre, thank goodness. He had his appendix out when he was a boy, and then a knee operation later in life, but that’s neither here nor there. I’ve always been quite sturdy, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No surgeries at all. Now, just to cover all bases, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. Let me think… My mother had a touch of rheumatism in her later years, arthritis, I believe. And my father… he had high blood pressure, I think. He was a very stressed man, always working. My grandfather on my mother’s side… he had heart trouble, but that was a long time ago. And… oh, and my aunt, my mother’s sister, she had diabetes, but she wasn’t very careful with her diet, to be honest. So, a bit of everything, really. Nothing major that I’m aware of, though. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that gives me a good picture. Rheumatism, high blood pressure, heart trouble and diabetes in the family. Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescriptions or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. Not a single pill. I don’t like taking medication if I can avoid it. I believe in letting my body heal itself, if you understand me. A bit of rest and a good cup of tea usually does the trick! I keep a small tin of paracetamol in the house for headaches, but I rarely need it. Honestly, I’ve been very fortunate in that regard as well.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No regular medications, just occasional paracetamol for headaches. And you don't have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else, do you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, no allergies at all. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me, and I've never had a reaction. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach! I’ve been stung by a few bees in my time, naturally, being out in the garden, but nothing serious. Just a bit of swelling and discomfort, but nothing that required a trip to the doctor. So, no, thankfully, no allergies to report.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very good to hear. No allergies, no medications... sounds like you’re in remarkably good health. Just to finish up this part, do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor, not a drop of alcohol, and certainly no smoking! My late husband used to enjoy a wee dram now and then, but I always preferred a nice cup of tea. And I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother wouldn’t have allowed it! I believe in living a clean and healthy life, you see. It’s the best way to stay well, in my opinion. So, no, neither smoking nor drinking for me. Just plenty of fresh air and good food.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That all sounds very good, Velda. Just to be thorough, and to get this form filled out accurately, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That would be perfectly alright. Whatever you think is necessary. I wouldn’t want to cause any trouble, but if it’s required for the form, then please, go ahead. I’ve always been a bit nervous around doctors, to be honest, but I’m sure you’ll be very gentle. Just let me know what you’d like me to do.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Here you are. I always get a bit chilly in this clinic, even in August. I suppose it's the air conditioning. My late husband always said I felt the cold more than most people. But do carry on, Doctor. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. Pulse is 72 and regular. Not bad at all. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, if you don’t mind. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I don't hear any wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to take a look in your ears and throat. Open wide and say “Ahhh…” Your ears look clear, and your throat is normal as well. Now, just a quick check of your reflexes… Your reflexes are good and equal on both sides. Finally, just a quick palpation of your abdomen… Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Everything seems normal so far.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn't too bad at all, Doctor. Thank you for being so gentle. It's always a relief when everything is alright. My husband used to say I worried too much, and I suppose he was right. But one can never be too careful, can one? Especially when planning a cruise. Is everything alright, then? Do you need to do any further tests or anything? I’m happy to cooperate, of course, but I’m hoping everything is satisfactory.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything seems quite satisfactory, Velda. Based on this exam, there are no immediate concerns. Your vital signs are good, your heart and lungs sound clear, and your reflexes are normal. I don’t believe any further testing is necessary at this time. Just to be absolutely sure, and given you're going on a cruise, I would recommend that you consult with your general practitioner about getting a flu and pneumococcal vaccination, if you haven't already had them. It's always best to be protected, especially in a confined environment. Other than that, I think you’re fit to travel. I’ll just fill out this form for you now. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful news, Doctor. Thank you so much for putting my mind at ease. I hadn't really thought about the vaccinations, to be honest. That’s a very good suggestion, and I will certainly mention it to my general practitioner when I see her next week. She's a very sensible woman, and she'll advise me accordingly. No, I don't think I have any further questions at the moment. You've been very thorough and kind, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. Just filling out the form is perfect, thank you. I'm so looking forward to the cruise now, knowing everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Here you are. Everything is documented here, stating you're in good health and fit for travel. I've also noted my recommendation regarding the vaccinations. Enjoy your cruise, Velda! And if you experience any concerning symptoms while traveling, don't hesitate to seek medical attention. Do you have a copy of your medical history with you?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you very much, Doctor! That’s perfect. Yes, I always carry a small folder with all my medical information, just in case. It includes my blood type, any allergies, and a list of medications I’ve taken in the past, although, as you know, that list is rather short! It’s my late husband who insisted I keep it, he was always very organised. He said one should always be prepared for anything. Thank you again for everything, Doctor. You’ve been a great help. I think that’s all I need for today. I shall see you again next year for my routine check-up, I suppose.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Velda. It was a pleasure meeting you. And good for your husband for encouraging you to be prepared! Do take care, and enjoy your cruise. Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day!
PATIENT: .
