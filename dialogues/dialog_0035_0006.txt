DOCTOR: Good morning, Jeannemarie. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Well… I coughed up some blood. It scared me a lot. Not… a lot of blood, but enough to worry me. It happened a couple of times now.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. Coughing up blood is definitely something we need to investigate. A couple of times… when you say a couple, how many exactly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It happened once last week, and then again just yesterday morning. It wasn’t a huge amount either time, just… spots of red when I coughed. Sorry, it is difficult to explain. I am not good with… details like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, twice – once last week and yesterday morning – spots of red when you coughed. That's helpful. And you said it wasn’t a large amount. To clarify, was the blood bright red, or darker in color?
PATIENT: Oh… that is a good question. I think… bright red. Yes, definitely bright red. Not dark at all. It happened right when I first woke up, so maybe that is why I remember it being so… vivid? I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Bright red blood is useful information. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the coughing?
PATIENT: Let me see… other symptoms. I have been… a little tired, maybe? But I thought that was just because of the summer heat. And I’ve had a little cough for a while now, but nothing too bad. It usually goes away quickly. No fever, no chest pain. Just the tiredness and the cough… and the blood, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and a cough that comes and goes, along with the coughing up blood. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. That is a good question too. I haven't been weighing myself regularly. I think… maybe a little? My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t actually stepped on a scale to check. I usually eat okay, so I don’t think it’s a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any shortness of breath or wheezing with your cough?
PATIENT: No, no shortness of breath. And no wheezing either. I can breathe normally. The cough… it’s just a regular cough, really. Nothing fancy. It doesn't hurt to breathe. It just… worries me because of the blood.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had pneumonia when I was very young, a long time ago. But other than that… no, I don't think so. Nothing major. I see my dentist regularly, and I try to eat healthy. I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, except for check-ups. My husband… he always took care of things like that. It’s been a little difficult since he passed. I am sorry, I am rambling now.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not rambling at all. It's completely understandable. And I'm sorry for your loss. Pneumonia as a child is good to know. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any. Everything has always been… fairly straightforward with my health, thankfully. I’ve always been lucky, I suppose. It’s just… this blood is very unsettling. It makes me worry about everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had… diabetes, I think. Nothing too serious that I remember, really. My grandparents… they lived to be very old, actually. So, not much history of lung problems that I know of. It’s been a while since I thought about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I am not taking any medications right now. Just vitamins, occasionally. Nothing for any health problems. I try to stay healthy with food and exercise. But… this blood. It makes me think I should have been taking something, maybe? Preventative, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, thankfully. My husband always joked I had an iron stomach! No reactions to anything when I've taken medicine in the past. I do not remember ever having a bad reaction. It is good, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's good. Now, let me ask about your social history. Do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never smoked. My husband tried it once, a very long time ago, but he didn’t like it. I’ve always avoided it. I don't like being around it, either. It makes me cough.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little wine, sometimes. With dinner, perhaps once or twice a week. Not very much, though. Just a glass. Nothing excessive. I prefer tea, honestly. My husband liked beer, but I never really got into it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any pets at home?
PATIENT: Yes, I have a small cat. Her name is Hana. She's very sweet and fluffy. She mostly stays indoors, but she likes to look out the window. She’s a good companion, especially since… well, since my husband passed. She doesn’t cause any problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for all that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, and take a look at your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I am a little nervous, but I want to figure out what is happening. Listening to my lungs sounds good.
DOCTOR: Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. And again… deeper if you can… Alright. And now, I’ll listen to your heart. Okay. Your heart sounds regular. Open your mouth and say “ah”… Good. Your throat looks clear, no obvious signs of infection. I'm not hearing any wheezing or crackling in your lungs, which is good. Your oxygen saturation is 98% on room air, which is also good. Given your history and the physical exam, coughing up bright red blood, even a small amount, needs further investigation. It could be a number of things, but we need to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: That sounds… a little scary. What kind of things are we ruling out, Doctor? I hope it isn’t anything too bad. It is just… this blood. It has me very worried. Could it be something simple? A bad cough, perhaps?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried. It could be something relatively simple, like a severe, irritated cough, or a minor bronchial irritation. However, we need to rule out more serious possibilities, like pneumonia, bronchitis, or, less commonly, a more significant issue like a pulmonary embolism or, rarely, lung cancer. The bright red blood suggests the source is likely relatively close to the surface, which is somewhat reassuring, but we can’t assume anything. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count . The X-ray will help us visualize your lungs and see if there are any abnormalities. The CBC will check for signs of infection or anemia. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. An X-ray and a blood test… if that is what you think is best, Doctor, then yes, please. I want to know what is happening. I trust your judgment. Will the blood test be painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I am a little anxious about waiting.
DOCTOR: The blood test is just a quick prick of the finger, or a small draw from your arm. It’s usually over very quickly, and most people don’t find it very painful. As for the results, the blood test usually comes back within a few hours, and the X-ray results typically take a little longer – usually within 24-48 hours. We'll call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, if you cough up more blood, especially a significant amount, or develop a fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that is very clear, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so well. No more blood, fever, shortness of breath… I will remember that. I will try not to worry too much while I wait for the results. Do you think I should avoid strenuous activity in the meantime? Perhaps just rest? I do not want to make anything worse.
DOCTOR: That's a good question. Yes, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity for the next few days, until we have the results of the tests. Rest is good. Drink plenty of fluids, and get some good sleep. Avoid anything that might irritate your lungs, like smoke or strong fumes. If you feel any new symptoms developing, don't hesitate to call the office. I’m going to have my nurse come in and draw the blood now and schedule the X-ray for you. She will explain everything further. Do you have any other questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think that is everything. You have answered all of my questions. Thank you very much, Doctor Alzoubi. I feel much better knowing we are taking steps to find out what is happening. I appreciate your kindness and patience.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jeannemarie. I'm glad I could ease your mind a bit. We’ll get to the bottom of this. My nurse will be in shortly. In the meantime, feel free to relax and take a few deep breaths.
