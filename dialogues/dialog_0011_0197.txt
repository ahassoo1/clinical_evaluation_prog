DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Sciarrotta. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, I need to get a card so I can drive for… you know, one of those ride-sharing services. Or a taxi, whichever one requires a medical check. I’m San Sciarrotta, by the way. It’s nice to meet you too. Let’s just get this done, shall we? I have a lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Sciarrotta. You are correct; many ride-sharing and taxi services require a medical certification to ensure driver fitness. We can certainly complete that for you today. To do so, I will need to gather some information regarding your medical history, and perform a brief physical examination. First, let's start with a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any current medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… well, my knees aren’t what they used to be, from all the years working with the logging equipment. And I had a bit of a problem with high blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been managed with medication for a while now. Nothing else… not that I recall, anyway. Is that what you need to know? Just the big things?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mrs. Sciarrotta, thank you. Knowing about your knees and past blood pressure is important. When you say "managed," could you tell me which medication you are currently taking for your blood pressure, and how often?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it's a little white pill. Lisinopril, I think. Yes, Lisinopril. And I take one every morning with my breakfast. Has been for… oh, goodness, five years maybe? Six? Something like that. I always take it. Never forget.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril once daily for approximately five to six years. And you report consistently taking it?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Every single day. Like clockwork. I’m very good about my pills. It’s important to keep things… regular, you know? Makes life easier. Do we need to get into why I started taking it? It was just… high blood pressure, the doctor told me. Nothing dramatic. I didn't have any fancy symptoms or anything. Just a number being too high, apparently.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Knowing it was a matter of a high number is sufficient for now. We can always delve deeper if needed. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes. A hysterectomy, many years ago. Probably… forty years? More? And… I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that wasn’t a big deal. Just a little cut. That’s it, I think. Everything else is just… aches and pains from the job.
DOCTOR: Hysterectomy approximately forty years ago, and appendectomy in adolescence. Thank you. And you said aches and pains from your job - could you describe those a little more?
PATIENT: Well, it was logging equipment, you know? Lots of vibration. My back gets stiff sometimes, especially after a long day. And my knees, like I said, are just worn out. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache. It flares up with the weather. Cold weather makes it worse. I mostly ignore it. I've learned to live with it. It’s just part of getting older, isn’t it? Do you need me to list every little twinge?
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mrs. Sciarrotta. A general sense of the aches and pains is helpful. You’ve described it well. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history, if you don't mind. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother had… oh, what was it? Something with her heart, I think. She had a lot of trouble breathing toward the end. But that was a long time ago. My father… he was healthy as a horse, actually. Never sick a day in his life. My brother, he has… diabetes, I think. Yes, type 2. And his wife had cancer, unfortunately. That’s about all I can remember off the top of my head. We weren’t really a family that talked much about medical things.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Maternal history of heart trouble, a brother with type 2 diabetes, and a sister-in-law with cancer. That is helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. I’ve never had a reaction to any pills or anything. I'm not allergic to pollen, or dust, or animals… nothing. I've always been pretty lucky that way. I've never had to carry an EpiPen or anything.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, regarding your social history, do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no! Never smoked a day in my life. And I haven’t had a drink in… well, probably thirty years. Not my thing. And absolutely no recreational drugs, ever. I'm a very sensible woman, Doctor. Always have been.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your candor, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, is there anything else you feel I should know about your health or why you're seeking this certification?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. I just need this card so I can drive for the ride-sharing service. I like to keep busy, you see? And the money helps. Honestly, it’s getting harder and harder to make ends meet. It’s a good way to supplement my income. I’m a very safe driver, always have been. I just want to make sure I'm able to do it legally and safely. Let's just get this examination done, shall we?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Sciarrotta. I understand completely. We will perform a quick examination, primarily focusing on areas relevant to safe driving, such as your vision, reflexes, and range of motion. First, let’s check your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, let’s get on with it. The sooner this is done, the better. Just… please don’t take too long. I really do have that lunch appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is slightly elevated at 142 over 88, and your pulse is 72, which is within a normal range. We will monitor that. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths in and out. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Next, let’s check your reflexes. Please sit comfortably. Your reflexes are normal. Now, could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I can see it perfectly fine. Always have had good eyesight. Though it’s not quite what it used to be… needing reading glasses these days, you know. Is that good enough? Can we move on?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's excellent, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Your eye movements are normal. You mentioned needing reading glasses - do you wear them currently?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. For reading, and close work. Not when I’m driving, though. My distance vision is still perfectly fine. I keep a pair in my purse just in case, but I haven't needed them while driving for years. I'm very careful, Doctor. I wouldn't drive if I couldn't see properly. That would be foolish.
DOCTOR: I appreciate that, Mrs. Sciarrotta. Now, let’s quickly check your range of motion. Could you please gently rotate your head to the left and right, and then touch your chin to your chest and look up towards the ceiling?
PATIENT: There… like that? It’s a little creaky, you know, from the years of working with the equipment. But I can do it. No problem. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s fine, Mrs. Sciarrotta. A little stiffness is understandable. Last, could you please squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Like that? Strong enough to handle the steering wheel, you bet. I've been driving for over fifty years! Are we done now? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mrs. Sciarrotta, we are finished with the physical examination. Overall, your examination was within normal limits, with slight stiffness noted in your neck. Given your blood pressure reading of 142/88, I would recommend following up with your primary care physician to discuss potential management. However, for the purpose of obtaining the medical certification for driving, you are medically cleared. I will prepare the necessary documentation for you. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. You were very efficient. That’s all I ask for. I appreciate you not wasting my time. So, when can I expect the paperwork? I need to get this sorted out as soon as possible. I have a schedule to keep, you know.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mrs. Sciarrotta. The paperwork is being finalized now. It should only take a minute. In the meantime, I'll also provide you with a summary of our findings and the recommendation to follow up with your primary care physician regarding your blood pressure. Here you are. This includes the medical certification form and a summary of our consultation. Please let me know if you have any questions. Do you have a preferred method of contact in case I need to reach you?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Yes, that looks fine. My phone number is 555-123-4567. And my email is san.sciarrotta@email.com. But honestly, a phone call is preferable. I’m not very good with computers. Alright, then. I believe that's everything. Thank you again for your time, Doctor. I appreciate your help.
