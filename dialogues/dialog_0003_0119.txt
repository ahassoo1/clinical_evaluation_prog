DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wartick. I’m Dr. Yackey. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… a delicate matter. Really. I don’t usually discuss these things, you understand. It’s about… a problem. A rather unpleasant problem. It's concerning, to say the least, and frankly, it’s probably something he brought on himself.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, many things are unpleasant, Ms. Wartick. To assist you effectively, I need specifics. Could you please elaborate on this “problem”?
PATIENT: It’s… a discharge, Doctor. A… a leakage. From… down there. Not my down there, of course. It's from… a gentleman friend. And it’s not a polite one, if you catch my drift. It’s… well, it’s colored. And it smells. I wouldn't expect you to know, being a doctor and all, but it’s not a good smell. Honestly, it’s quite alarming. He's been rather… careless.
DOCTOR: I see. So, this is a concern regarding a male patient experiencing… a penile discharge. And you are here on his behalf, as he is… reluctant to seek medical attention himself?
PATIENT: Reluctant is putting it mildly, Doctor. He’s… a bit of a rogue, shall we say? Doesn’t believe in doctors, or hygiene, for that matter. I had to practically drag him to think about it, and even then, he insisted I do the talking. Men. Honestly. Yes, it’s his. A rather unsightly discharge. And I’m worried it’s… catching. Though he’d never admit to anything, of course.
DOCTOR: Very well. I understand. While I generally prefer to speak directly with the patient, I will do my best to gather the necessary information. Has he experienced any pain, burning, or difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. He’s not one to complain, you see. But… now that you mention it, he did grunt a bit the other day when he… went to the bathroom. And I believe he may have been going more frequently. Just a little, though. Very discreet, as always. It's hard to tell with him, honestly. He hides everything. Perhaps a slight redness as well... but he keeps everything covered. You’d think a man would take better care of himself.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination, possible discomfort, and a hint of redness… Alright. And has this discharge been ongoing for a specific period of time?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. It's not new, Doctor. It's been… well, weeks, at least. Maybe longer. He’s not very forthcoming with details, you understand. It seems to come and go, but lately, it's been… more consistent. And the smell… it’s frankly embarrassing. I’ve had to air out the entire guest room. Honestly, it's quite inconsiderate. Perhaps a month, at least? I’m trying to recall… it’s all rather unpleasant to think about.
DOCTOR: A month of persistent penile discharge. Ms. Wartick, while I appreciate you providing this information, I must strongly advise that your friend be seen directly. This could indicate a sexually transmitted infection, or another serious condition. It requires a physical examination and likely laboratory testing for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Do you have any information regarding his sexual history, or if he uses protection?
PATIENT: Sexual history?! Doctor, really! I am a respectable woman! I certainly haven't been privy to… those kinds of details! Honestly, the very idea! He’s… a bit of a wanderer, let's just say. Not the most faithful of companions. As for protection… well, he probably doesn’t. He's not one for… precautions. Honestly, I wouldn’t put it past him. It's all very irresponsible. You're asking entirely too much, Doctor. I'm just trying to help, and I shouldn't have to disclose… such personal information!
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wartick. I understand your discomfort. However, without a proper examination and testing, I can only offer limited guidance. Given the duration of the symptoms and his… lifestyle, I strongly recommend he be evaluated for potential STIs, including gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. I can provide you with a referral to a specialist, or you can encourage him to see his primary care physician. I will document the symptoms as reported, but without a direct examination, a definitive diagnosis is impossible. Do you understand?
