DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, things… haven't been the best lately. I get sick to my stomach a lot, even if I don’t eat much. Just a little bit of food and I feel full… too full. It's been going on for a bit now, I reckon. Honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be, so I can't say exactly how long. It just… feels like a while.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Kelder. It sounds quite bothersome. And it's perfectly alright if you're unsure of the exact timeframe – we’ll work through it together. So, this feeling of fullness and nausea… does it happen with all foods, or are there certain things that seem to trigger it more than others?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I don’t know if it's all foods, exactly. I mostly eat… well, I used to cook a lot more. Now it’s mostly soups and things that are easy on my stomach. I haven't really pushed myself to eat much of anything heavy lately, to be honest. I think it’s worse if I try to eat anything fried, but I haven't kept track. My daughter, bless her heart, brings me a lot of things, and I just… eat what she brings. I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Ms. Kelder. It's very common for appetite to change as we get older, and it's good you’re addressing this. So, soups are generally well-tolerated then?
PATIENT: Yes, soups are usually okay. Broth-based ones, mostly. And crackers. Simple things. Anything… strong-smelling seems to make it worse. Like, if my daughter makes a nice roast… the smell is lovely, but then my stomach gets upset just thinking about it. And sometimes it happens even without the smell, just randomly. It's confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand your confusion, Ms. Kelder. It sounds like there are a few different factors at play here. The aversion to strong smells is certainly relevant. Let's try to get a clearer picture. Besides the nausea and early fullness, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I've been… tired. A lot. More tired than usual, and I've always been a napper, so that's saying something. And… my stomach just feels… bloated, even when it's empty. Like there's a lot of air in there. Oh! And I haven't been… regular, if you know what I mean. It’s been difficult.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kelder. That’s helpful information. Tiredness, bloating, and changes in your bowel habits… these all contribute to a more complete picture. Now, have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Weight loss… Yes, I think so. My daughter keeps saying my clothes are getting looser. I haven’t weighed myself, honestly. It just… feels like I’m shrinking. Not a lot, but definitely some. I used to be quite proud of my cooking, kept a good figure, but… everything’s changed.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Kelder. It's good you’re aware of the weight loss. To get a better understanding, I’d like to ask about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… Years ago, a long time ago, I had my gallbladder taken out. And… I had some trouble with my blood pressure for a bit, but it was managed with medication. I don't take anything for it now, the doctor said it was fine. And… oh! I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back. That was nasty. As for anything else… I don't rightly recall. My memory is just… patchy, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kelder. We'll take things slowly. So, gallbladder removal, a history of managed high blood pressure, and pneumonia. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. My daughter always asks when she gets me medicine, and I always tell her no. She's very careful. I don’t think I’ve ever had a true allergy, though. Just a bit of a sensitive stomach sometimes.
DOCTOR: Good to know, Ms. Kelder. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or gastrointestinal problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a hard one. My mother… she had something with her stomach, I think. She was always sick. But I don’t remember what it was exactly. It was a long time ago, and we didn't talk about things like that much back then. And my father… he had heart trouble, I think. He didn’t take care of himself very well. My sister… she had diabetes, but she lived far away, so I didn’t see her much. That's about all I can remember, honestly. It’s all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Kelder. You’ve given me some helpful information. It sounds like there's some history of gastrointestinal issues and heart disease in the family. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never smoked a day in my life. My husband, bless his soul, tried it for a bit when he was younger, but he quit before we got married. I always hated the smell. And I always encouraged my daughter to stay away from it too. It's just a bad habit, you know?
DOCTOR: I agree completely. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little bit sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Nothing more. Not very often, though. I mostly drink water. My daughter brings me juice sometimes, but I prefer water. It’s better for me, she says.
DOCTOR: That sounds very reasonable, Ms. Kelder. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social situation?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I live alone now, since my husband passed. My daughter lives nearby, thankfully. She comes to visit often and helps me out with things. I have a few friends, but we don’t see each other as much anymore. Everyone’s getting older, you know? Mostly I just stay home and watch TV. I used to enjoy gardening, but it’s gotten too difficult. It's a quiet life, but it’s my life.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Kelder. That gives me a good picture of your situation. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, feeling your abdomen, and checking your reflexes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. I haven’t been feeling myself lately, so I'm happy to let you do whatever you think is best. Just be gentle, my bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Kelder. I will be as gentle as possible. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and exhale slowly. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit faint. And your lungs are clear, I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels tender or painful. Your abdomen is soft, but I notice some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. It’s not severe, but I want to make note of it. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, which is common with age. Overall, the exam is fairly unremarkable, but the tenderness in your upper right quadrant and the faint heart sounds are worth investigating further.
PATIENT: Oh my. That doesn't sound good, does it? What do you think it could be, Doctor? My daughter always worries about me, and I don't want to scare her. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Ms. Kelder. It’s good you’re aware of your body and speaking up about this. The tenderness in your upper right quadrant could indicate a number of things. It could be something relatively minor like muscle strain or indigestion, but it could also be related to your gallbladder, even though it was removed some time ago. Sometimes complications can arise. The faint heart sounds are also something we want to investigate, to rule out any underlying heart issues. It’s too early to say definitively what’s going on. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and some liver function tests. We may also want to consider an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your liver and gallbladder area. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood tests and an ultrasound. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better. And please, don't hesitate to tell me if it's something serious. I'd rather know, even if it’s not good news. My daughter… she’s very good at helping me, but I don’t want to worry her unnecessarily until we know for sure.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Kelder. That’s a very reasonable approach, and I commend you for being proactive about your health. I will be upfront and honest with you every step of the way. I’ll order the blood tests and an ultrasound today. The lab is just down the hall, and we can schedule the ultrasound for tomorrow morning. The results should be available in a few days. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat small, easily digestible meals and staying well-hydrated. If you experience any worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, fever, or vomiting – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… when you get the results, will you call me? I don't get out much, and I'm not very good with computers, so a phone call would be best. And… thank you. For listening, and for not dismissing my worries. It’s good to know someone is taking me seriously.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Kelder. I will personally call you as soon as the results are available. You don't need to worry about computers at all. And you're very welcome. It’s my job to listen, and I want you to feel comfortable and confident in your care. I’m glad I could help ease your concerns, even a little bit. If anything comes up before then, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Here’s a copy of the lab request and the appointment information for the ultrasound. We’ll get to the bottom of this. And remember, I'm here for you. Have a good day, Ms. Kelder. And please, take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Abady. You too. .
