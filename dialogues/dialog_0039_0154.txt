DOCTOR: Hello, Claudene. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Kamahele, is it? Yes, yes. Well, it’s… this trouble I’ve been having. With… going to the bathroom. It keeps happening again and again. It’s very… uncomfortable. I don’t really… remember exactly when it started, but it’s been a while. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Yes, Kamahele is correct. And please, call me Voula. Okay, Claudene, I understand. Frequent bathroom trips and discomfort… that's definitely not fun. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. When you say "trouble," could you tell me a little more specifically what's happening?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it… burns, mostly. When I go. And I feel like I have to go all the time, even when I just went. It’s… frustrating. I don’t know… is something broken? I don’t remember anything specific, truly. My daughter… she said I should come see someone. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: It sounds like it's quite bothersome, and I appreciate your daughter encouraging you to come in. Burning and feeling the urge to go frequently… those are important clues. “Something broken” is one possibility we need to rule out, but there are many things that can cause those symptoms. To help me understand better, could you describe what comes out when you go to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… a very personal question, isn’t it? Um… it looks normal, I think. The usual color… maybe a little darker sometimes? I honestly don't pay much attention. I really don't. Is it important? I just want it to stop hurting.
DOCTOR: It is personal, and I apologize if it made you uncomfortable. It’s important because it helps me narrow down what might be going on. A little darker sometimes is good to know. Do you experience any pain even when you aren’t trying to go to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Sometimes. A dull ache, low down. Not all the time, thankfully. It comes and goes. I thought it was just… old age, maybe? I'm not as young as I used to be, you know. Everything aches a little these days. It's nothing serious, is it?
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned that, Claudene. A dull ache can certainly be helpful information. And it’s true, aches and pains are more common as we get older, but we still want to figure out what's causing yours. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine, or in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… goodness. I… I don’t think so. I don't remember seeing any blood. I… I really don't look, Doctor. I just… go. And hope for the best. Is that bad? My daughter always tells me I should be more… attentive. But honestly, I just want this to be over with.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Claudene. It’s perfectly normal not to want to focus on those things. Your daughter sounds like a caring person. We’re going to try and figure this out together. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any health conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. Let me think. I… I had my gallbladder out, years ago. A long time ago. And my blood pressure… the doctor said it was a little high, once. But I don't take any pills for it. Not regularly, anyway. I… I mostly just try to avoid doctors, if I'm being honest. It all feels so… complicated.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a history of slightly high blood pressure. Thank you for telling me. It's understandable that you prefer to avoid doctors if you can. We'll try to keep things as simple as possible. Now, have you ever had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: Um… I don't think so. Maybe… a tonsillectomy when I was a child? But that was a very long time ago. I honestly don't remember much about it. My memory… it’s not what it used to be. Is this important? Can't we just give me something to make it stop hurting?
DOCTOR: Okay, a tonsillectomy as a child. That’s good to know. And yes, I understand your frustration, Claudene. I wish we could just give you something to make it stop hurting right away. But we need to find out why it’s hurting first, so we can give you the right treatment. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies. Um… I don't think so. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything. I like food! My daughter always worries about what I eat, but I'm a healthy eater. Mostly. I don't remember ever being allergic to anything. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… no. Not really. I have some… aspirin, for headaches. But I don't take it very often. And some… cream for my hands. They get dry, you know. But that's it. Nothing… regular. Honestly, I try to avoid taking pills as much as possible. They always have so many side effects.
DOCTOR: Okay, just aspirin for headaches and cream for dry hands. That's good to know. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh… my lifestyle? What do you mean? I… I live alone. I used to work, but I'm retired now. I like to watch television. And… I have a garden. Small garden. I grow tomatoes. Is that important? I don't do much… exciting, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It’s good to know you have hobbies, Claudene. Gardening and watching television sound lovely. I ask about lifestyle to get a better understanding of your daily routine and possible contributing factors. Now, have you experienced any recent changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh dear… now you're asking about… that? Look, Doctor, I really don't like talking about this. I just want to feel better. Is there anything you can give me to make it stop hurting? It's just… uncomfortable. And embarrassing. I don’t understand why I need to tell you all this.
DOCTOR: You’re right to feel that way, Claudene. It is personal, and I apologize for making you uncomfortable. But changes in bowel habits can give us important clues about what’s going on. We're not going to dwell on it, but even a general idea would be helpful. Has anything changed recently – how often you go, the consistency of what comes out, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh… well… it’s been… regular, I suppose. Nothing different. Maybe a little… harder to go sometimes? But that happens. I eat a lot of tomatoes, you know. Maybe that’s it? I honestly don't pay much attention. I just want this to stop. Is there anything you can do?
DOCTOR: Okay, generally regular, maybe a little harder sometimes. Tomatoes could contribute to that. I understand your frustration, Claudene. We're getting closer to understanding what's going on. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions about other parts of your body, just to make sure we're not missing anything. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh… no. No fever. No chills. And… no, I haven't lost any weight. If anything, I've gained a little weight. I like my food, you know? I really don't understand why this is happening. It just started… suddenly, a few weeks ago. Maybe it's just old age?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or weight loss. It sounds like it came on suddenly a few weeks ago. We'll keep that in mind. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just listen to your abdomen and do a gentle palpation. It won’t be uncomfortable, I promise. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Must I? I don’t really like being poked and prodded. I just want a pill! Is there no other way? I… I’m a bit sensitive, you know. Is it going to take long? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Claudene. It's perfectly alright to feel that way. A quick exam will help me rule out some possibilities and get closer to finding the right solution. It won’t take long – just a few minutes. I’ll be as gentle as possible, and I'll explain everything I’m doing as I go. If at any point you’re uncomfortable, just let me know, and we’ll stop. Would you like me to explain what I'll be checking for?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. But please be quick. And gentle, like you said. I really don't like being touched. Just… get it over with. What will you be… looking for, exactly? I suppose I should know, shouldn't I? But honestly, I just want this to stop.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope to check for any unusual sounds. Then, I’ll gently press on your abdomen to feel for any tenderness or masses. We’re just trying to see if there’s anything that might be causing your discomfort. It’s a routine part of the exam, and it shouldn’t hurt. Would you like to lie down on the exam table, or are you comfortable sitting up?
PATIENT: Oh… sitting up is fine. I don’t really like lying down. It makes me feel… dizzy. Just… be quick, please. And gentle. I really don’t want to be here all day.
DOCTOR: Of course. Sitting up is perfectly fine. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds, which is good. Now, I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels tender or painful. Anything here feel particularly sensitive?
PATIENT: Oh… um… yes. A little. Right… there. Not terribly painful, but… uncomfortable. It feels… tender. Like a bruise, maybe? But I don’t remember bumping into anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m feeling some mild tenderness in that area. It doesn't feel like anything acutely painful, but it's definitely sensitive to the touch. No masses or enlarged organs that I can feel at this time. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you could be experiencing a mild urinary tract infection, or possibly some inflammation of the bladder. However, to be sure, I'd like to order a urine test. That will help us rule out an infection and see if there’s any blood or other abnormalities in your urine. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A… urine test? Oh dear. Must I? Is it… difficult? I’m not very good at… things like that. I just want a pill to make it stop. But… if it’s the only way… I suppose I can try. But please be quick. And explain everything very clearly. I get flustered easily.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to feel hesitant, Claudene. It’s a very simple test. I'll give you a small cup, and you'll simply provide a urine sample in the privacy of the bathroom. I'll provide clear instructions, and there's a lid on the cup to prevent any spills. It won’t take long at all, and it’s a very important step in figuring out what’s going on. I’ll explain everything very clearly, and I'll be right here if you need any assistance. Does that sound a little better?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A small cup, you say? And… privacy? That’s good. I suppose I can manage a small cup. But please, no rushing. And… make sure it’s clean. I don’t like germs. Is there somewhere I can wash my hands afterwards? This is all very… stressful.
DOCTOR: Of course. Everything is sterile and clean. Here’s a cup, and these wipes are for cleaning your hands before you collect the sample. There’s a private bathroom just down the hall. And yes, there’s a sink with soap and water for washing your hands afterwards. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions or need any assistance. I'll be right here when you're finished. Would you like me to show you the way?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, please. Show me the way. I’m a bit… directionally challenged, you see. And I don't want to get lost. This is all very… upsetting.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Right this way. It's just down the hall, and it’s clearly marked. Don’t worry, it’s not far at all. Here we are. The instructions are on the counter inside. Just collect a small sample in the cup, and then bring it back to me. Take your time. I'll be right here waiting. And please, don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all.
