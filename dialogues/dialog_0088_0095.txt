DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. I’m Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t have time for this. But my niece insisted. Sudden deafness, apparently. And… something about my face feeling droopy. It started yesterday. It’s incredibly inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay. Sudden deafness and facial drooping... that is something we need to look into, even if it’s inconvenient. Yesterday, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, yesterday. Around… lunchtime, I think. I was having a sandwich. Ham and cheese. Doesn’t matter what I was eating, does it? It just… started. One ear went quiet, and then I noticed my mouth felt… odd. Like half of it wasn’t working properly. It’s all very unsettling.
DOCTOR: No, what you were eating doesn't matter. Just trying to get a clear timeline. Okay, so it started with the hearing loss, and then you noticed the facial weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Hearing gone, then the face thing. It's not like it happened all at once. And honestly, it's frightening. I’ve never experienced anything like this before. Do you have any idea what could possibly be causing it? Though, I doubt you'll know immediately.
DOCTOR: It’s good you came in, Stephane. Sudden onset like that is something we need to investigate quickly. There are a few possibilities, and it's too early to say for sure. Let's start with a quick exam, and then we can talk about next steps. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… try to be quick, please. I have a lot to do today. And please, don’t ask me a million questions about my medical history. I'm sure you have all that in your computer.
DOCTOR: Of course. I do have some information, but I’ll keep it brief. First, I'm going to check your ears, and then I'll need to assess your facial muscle strength. I'll also want to do a basic neurological exam. Just follow my instructions as best you can. Okay, open your mouth wide, please… Ah. The ear canals look clear. Now, I'm going to ask you to close your eyes tightly, and I'll gently touch your forehead, cheeks, and mouth. Just let me know if you feel any difference in strength on either side.
PATIENT: Honestly, this is rather undignified. Very well. Close my eyes… . Go ahead. But be gentle, I’m not as young as I used to be. And do hurry. This is all rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see a slight weakness on the left side of your face. And when I ask you to smile, it does appear a little uneven. Can you raise both eyebrows?
PATIENT: There. Do you see it? It's quite obvious. I told you. It's all on this side. . It's rather inconvenient, you know. I have a board meeting tomorrow. I can’t look like this.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do see it, Stephane. And I understand your concern about the board meeting. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, this is raising my concern for something called Bell’s palsy. It affects the facial nerve. It can resolve on its own, but we need to rule out other possibilities first. To do that, I’d like to order a blood test and possibly an MRI. An MRI will help us make sure there isn’t anything else causing this. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An MRI? Really? Is that absolutely necessary? I have a very busy schedule. And blood tests… honestly, I detest needles. Couldn't you just… prescribe something? Some sort of muscle relaxant? Surely that would help. . This is all rather… disruptive. And expensive, I presume?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the time and expense, Stephane. However, it's important to rule out other, more serious causes of sudden facial weakness, like a stroke or a tumor. The MRI and blood tests will help us do that. Skipping those steps could have serious consequences. As for a muscle relaxant, it wouldn’t address the underlying cause and could potentially mask symptoms, making diagnosis more difficult. I want to be thorough. Regarding cost, I can have the billing department contact you about potential costs and payment options. We can also discuss if there are any community resources available to help. But right now, the most important thing is to get a clear understanding of what's going on. Would you be willing to proceed with the tests?
PATIENT: Fine. But I expect this to be done as quickly as humanly possible. And I expect a full explanation of the results. No medical jargon, please. I don’t have time for riddles. And frankly, I’m still not convinced this is necessary. But… very well. Do your tests. Just… get it over with. And make sure someone explains the billing to me afterwards. I don’t want any surprises. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Stephane. I’ve ordered the blood tests and scheduled the MRI for tomorrow morning. The lab results should be back within 24-48 hours. I will personally review them and contact you as soon as I have the results. I'll ensure the explanation is clear and free of jargon. I'll also have the billing department contact you after the tests to discuss payment options. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a course of oral steroids. These can sometimes help reduce inflammation and improve recovery in cases of Bell’s palsy. Here’s a prescription. Start taking these as directed. And please, if you notice any worsening of symptoms – increased weakness, difficulty speaking, or vision changes – go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… make sure everything is expedited. And I expect clear communication. That’s all. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a very important meeting to prepare for. I trust this won’t take long. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Stephane. We’ll do our best to expedite everything. We'll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a… productive meeting. .
