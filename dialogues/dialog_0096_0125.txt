DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, it's... well, my wife thought it would be a good idea. She's a bit of a worrier, always reading things online. She wants me to get tested for... you know, the HIV thing. I don't feel sick, so honestly, I think it's a waste of time, but here I am.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, your wife's concern is… understandable. Even if you're not experiencing symptoms, getting tested is a sensible precaution, especially if you’ve had any… activities that could put you at risk. Now, let’s not get into specifics unless you want to. But can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Look, I keep pretty good health, alright? I eat normal food, I don't smoke, maybe a few beers on the weekend. Work keeps me busy enough. I don't go around doing… risky things. Honestly, I think she's just overreacting because she saw something on the internet. It’s always something with her and those websites. I have Medicare, so figured I should just get it over with to keep her happy. Is that enough "overall health" for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… adequate. But “adequate” isn’t always enough, Mr. Belan. We need a bit more detail to be thorough. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Never. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, whatever. But I haven't been sick sick. Look, I work as a Compliance Officer, right? I deal with paperwork and rules all day. Not exactly a job that exposes me to plagues. I'm a pretty careful person, if that matters. Is this going to take long? Because I have a report due tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is going to take a few minutes, Mr. Belan. And frankly, your occupation is irrelevant. We need to cover some basics. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No! Never had anything operated on. Not even my tonsils. I'm a perfectly healthy man, alright? This is just… ridiculous. I'm starting to think my wife is trying to get me to spend money on unnecessary tests. Is this something Medicare even covers, by the way? I don’t want a huge bill.
DOCTOR: Medicare does cover HIV testing, thankfully. Now, let’s move on. What about your family?
PATIENT: My family? What about them? They’re fine, thank you. My parents are both… well, they’re older. They live in Nepal. They’re healthy enough for their age, I guess. I haven’t seen them in a while. They don’t really have… medical problems. Not that I know of. They’re not the type to talk about that sort of thing. Look, is this really necessary? I feel perfectly fine. I'm wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Mr. Belan, while you feel fine, that doesn't rule anything out. We are simply gathering information. Have any of your family members – parents, siblings, anyone – ever been diagnosed with HIV, or any other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. No one. It’s not something people talk about back home. They don't really go to doctors unless they're practically on their deathbed. It’s… different. They'd probably just use some traditional remedies or something. I really don’t know. Look, I’m telling you, this is a complete waste of time. I have work to do. Can we just get this over with? I’m starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s discuss your social history, then. Do you use intravenous drugs?
PATIENT: Are you serious? Intravenous drugs? Do I look like the kind of person who would use intravenous drugs? I work in compliance! I ensure other people follow the rules, I don’t break them! That’s… frankly offensive. My wife is going to hear about this. She's clearly sent you on a wild goose chase with her internet searches. This is ridiculous. I'm leaving.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. Clearly, you are not forthcoming with information. However, for the record, I must ask: have you ever had any sexual contact with someone who has tested positive for HIV, or whose HIV status is unknown?
PATIENT: That’s… that’s completely inappropriate! Are you trying to embarrass me? I came here to appease my wife, not to be interrogated about my personal life! This is a complete invasion of privacy! I’m not answering that question. And frankly, I’m leaving now. I’ve wasted enough of my time here. You can tell my wife I came, and that you asked a lot of… very rude questions. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Belan. Since you are unwilling to provide a complete medical history, I cannot, in good conscience, perform a test based on insufficient information. I strongly advise you to reconsider and return when you are willing to cooperate. .
