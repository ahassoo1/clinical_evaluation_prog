DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I requested a general wellness check, a lab panel, you see. Just wanting to get a good overview of how things are holding up, if you understand. At my age, one likes to be… proactive.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Proactive is very wise, Mr. Mombrun. A general wellness check and lab panel is an excellent idea. It's good you're thinking ahead. Before we get started, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I'm 74 years of age, as you know. I’ve been quite fortunate, actually. I’ve always been a… a worker, you see. Construction, mostly. It keeps a man moving. My wife, bless her heart, she worries, of course, but I feel strong enough still. No major illnesses to speak of. A few aches and pains, naturally – the usual wear and tear – but nothing that has kept me from my work. I have private insurance, which is good. And I try to eat reasonably well, though my wife is the better cook, and she likes her arepas!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Mombrun. Staying active is key, and it sounds like you’ve done a good job of that. And arepas are delicious – a very good source of energy! You mentioned a few aches and pains. Could you tell me more about those?
PATIENT: Yes, well, mostly it’s my knees, you see. They creak a bit in the mornings, especially if it’s been a colder night. And my lower back will sometimes stiffen up after a long day on the job. Nothing debilitating, Doctor. I can still get around, still climb ladders – though not as quickly as I once could! I just… I want to make sure it doesn’t become something worse, you understand? I’d like to keep working for as long as I can.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Mombrun. It's good to address these things proactively. Stiffness and creaking in the knees and lower back are common, especially with a physically demanding job like construction. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not formally diagnosed with anything like that. I’ve had the usual check-ups over the years, and the doctors always said I was… robust, they used to say. Blood pressure, they've checked it occasionally, and it was usually… within the normal range, I believe. My wife handles most of the paperwork, you see, and she always said everything was alright. I don't recall ever being told I had diabetes, nor have I ever been told I have arthritis, though my knees certainly feel arthritic some days!
DOCTOR: “Feels arthritic” is a very good way to put it. It's good to hear you've had regular check-ups and that your blood pressure has been generally okay. It sounds like you've been fortunate. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a single one. I’ve managed to avoid them, thankfully. A few broken bones here and there when I was younger – a wrist, a rib, clumsy things – but they all healed well enough on their own, or with a good cast. Nothing requiring a… a proper operation. My wife always said I was too stubborn to let the doctors near me!
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Mombrun. Avoiding surgery is always a good thing. Now, could you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Ah, that’s… a bit complicated, Doctor. My family is large, mostly still in Venezuela. Communication isn’t always easy, you see. My father lived to be a good age, eighty-five, but he had some heart trouble towards the end. My mother, she passed away younger, in her sixties, from… well, I believe it was pneumonia, though it was a long time ago. As for siblings, my brother had high blood pressure, I recall, and my sister… she had some issues with her stomach, but I don't have the details. It’s not a history filled with… dramatic illnesses, if that makes sense. Mostly just the usual things that come with age.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Mombrun. It sounds like there may be a bit of a family tendency towards heart issues and high blood pressure. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none that I am aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything put in front of me, thankfully! My wife teases me about it, says I have a cast iron stomach. I’ve never been stung by a bee or anything like that either. No hives, no swelling, no trouble breathing – nothing at all.
DOCTOR: That's excellent news, Mr. Mombrun. No known allergies is always good to hear. And finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. I prefer to avoid them if I can. I take a multivitamin every morning, just to be on the safe side, but that’s it. I’ve always believed in letting my body do its own work, if you understand. I might take an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that’s about it. My wife keeps a small stock of pain relievers, just in case, but I rarely need them.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Mombrun. No regular medications is excellent. Okay, Mr. Mombrun, now that I have a better understanding of your overall health history, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I'm happy to cooperate in any way I can. I understand it’s all part of making sure this old body is still functioning properly.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. If you could just sit up on the examination table for me, that would be great. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, a slight murmur is present, likely benign given your age and history. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles noted. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140/90. Slightly elevated. We'll want to monitor that. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. No masses palpated. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. Alright, Mr. Mombrun, that concludes the physical exam. Everything seems generally good, though your blood pressure is a bit higher than we’d like. Now, to get a more complete picture, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a lipid panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. A complete picture is always best, as you say. I trust your judgement entirely. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a lipid panel… yes, that sounds just right. I don’t mind the tests at all. When can I expect the results? And will I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Excellent. Yes, we will need you to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw, so no food or drinks except water. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Our lab will contact you directly to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they're available. In the meantime, I'll also schedule a quick follow-up with you for about a week from today just to check in and see how you’re feeling. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That’s very thoughtful, Doctor, scheduling both a lab contact and a follow-up appointment. Twelve hours fasting is no problem at all. I can certainly manage that. Actually, yes, I do have a question. You mentioned my blood pressure being slightly elevated. Is that something I should be immediately concerned about? Should I be making any changes to my diet or lifestyle right away? And is there anything… anything at all I can do to help lower it in the meantime?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Mombrun, and it’s wise to ask. While your blood pressure is slightly elevated, it’s not necessarily an immediate emergency. However, it's something we want to address proactively. In the meantime, I would recommend making a few simple lifestyle changes. First, try to reduce your sodium intake – avoid processed foods, fast food, and excessive salt. Second, aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week – walking, swimming, or anything that gets your heart rate up. And third, try to manage stress – relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation can be helpful. We’ll have a clearer picture once we get the results of your blood work, and we can discuss further treatment options if needed. For now, these simple changes can make a big difference. Do you have any difficulty making these changes, or are there barriers that would make them difficult?
PATIENT: That's very helpful, Doctor, thank you. Reducing salt and getting more exercise… those are things I can certainly work on. My wife is an excellent cook, but she does enjoy her seasoning! I will have a talk with her about reducing the salt a bit. As for exercise, I still do quite a bit of work, but perhaps I need to be more focused on dedicated exercise, rather than just the physical demands of my job. No, I don’t anticipate any difficulties making those changes. I’m quite motivated to stay healthy, and I appreciate your guidance. I suppose stress isn’t much of an issue for me. I generally enjoy life, and I have a supportive wife and family. I think that answers my question. Thank you again for your time and your thorough examination, Doctor. I feel much better knowing what steps I can take.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Mr. Mombrun. You sound like a very proactive and healthy individual, and I’m confident you’ll be able to make these changes. We'll get those labs ordered right away, and we'll be in touch to schedule your follow-up. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning symptoms – such as severe headache, chest pain, or shortness of breath – please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very patient and informative, and I appreciate your kindness. I feel much more at ease now, knowing what to expect. Thank you again for everything. I look forward to hearing from the lab, and I’ll see you next week.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Mombrun. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please, take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a wonderful day. .
