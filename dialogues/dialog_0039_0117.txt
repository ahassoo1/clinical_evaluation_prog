DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Reyno. It's good to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello. Just... a cough. Been coughin’ a bit. And… there was some blood in it. Not much, but it scared me. I smoke, you know. Been smokin’ a long time. I don't... I don't really remember much else about it right now. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough with some blood... that can be concerning, yes, but let's not jump to conclusions. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. You mentioned you smoke – how much and for how long, roughly?
PATIENT: Roughly…? Man, that’s a hard one. A long time. Started when I was… young. Maybe 18, 19? And… a pack a day, mostly. Sometimes more when things were… stressful. I don't keep track of that stuff, really. It’s just… a habit. Does it matter how long exactly?
DOCTOR: It does help to have a better idea, but we can work with "a long time" for now. And yes, a pack a day for many years is… significant. Okay. Besides the blood, what does the cough feel like?
PATIENT: Uh… dry, mostly. Like… scratchy. Hurts a little when I take a deep breath. It's… been getting worse, I think. Hard to say for sure. Things kinda… blur together, you know? I just wanna get this figured out and… go home. Is that alright? I don’t mean to be rude.
DOCTOR: No, not rude at all, Mr. Reyno. I understand wanting answers quickly. "Blur together"… okay. So a dry, scratchy cough that's been worsening. Any fever, chills, or night sweats with this?
PATIENT: Fever…? Not that I noticed. I don’t usually check my temperature or anything. Chills… maybe sometimes, but that's probably just the AC. Night sweats… I sleep pretty hot, always have. I don't really pay attention to that kind of thing, honestly. I just take some aspirin if I feel bad. Is that… helpful? I feel kinda silly.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to not check those things, Mr. Reyno. Many people don’t. And aspirin is good for general discomfort. Okay. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any other health conditions?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. I’ve got… the usual old man stuff. Back hurts, knees ache. The doctor told me years ago I had… high blood pressure, maybe? I took some pills for a while, but… I stopped. Couldn't remember to take ‘em every day. Honestly, I don’t remember much about it. Medicare pays for some stuff, I think. Does that help? I’m sorry I’m not being very… clear.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Reyno. It's common for things to be a little hazy. High blood pressure is good to know, even if you stopped the medication. And Medicare is helpful for many things. Okay. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything besides your knees?
PATIENT: Knees… yeah, both knees. A long time ago. Didn't help much, though. Besides that… uh… I broke my arm when I was a kid, I think. Fell out of a tree. That's… about it, I reckon. Nothing major. I don't… I don't go to the hospital unless I really have to. Makes me nervous. I'm getting a little tired now, if you don’t mind. Can we just… get this sorted?
DOCTOR: Okay, knees and a broken arm when you were younger. No major hospital stays besides that. I understand you’re feeling tired and wanting this resolved. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your lungs and check a few things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: …Fine. Just… make it quick, please? I got things to do. And… it might hurt a little if you touch my back, it’s kinda sensitive. I just… want to know what’s wrong. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Reyno. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. I’ll be careful with your back. Okay, your lungs are a little wheezy, and your back is tender to the touch, as you mentioned. I'm hearing some diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes, and your pulse is a bit elevated. I also notice a slight cough. Now, I want to order a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of what's going on in your lungs. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: X-ray…? Is it… dangerous? I don't like… machines, really. And radiation and all that. Is it something that… absolutely has to be done? I just… I feel kinda trapped in here, if you don't mind me saying. I just wanna get this over with and go home. Is there anything else we can do?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the X-ray, Mr. Reyno. It does involve a small amount of radiation, but it's a very low dose, comparable to what you receive from natural background radiation over a few days. It’s the best way to get a clear view of your lungs and help determine the cause of your cough and the blood you’ve been coughing up. We want to rule out anything serious. Given your smoking history and the blood in your cough, we really need to investigate this further. We could consider a CT scan instead, which provides even more detailed images but involves a slightly higher radiation dose. Or, we can start with the X-ray and, if it's inconclusive, discuss the CT scan then. Would you prefer to start with the X-ray?
PATIENT: …Ugh. Fine. Just… get it over with. The X-ray. But… if it doesn’t show anything, don't make me do any more of these… machine things. I just… I don't feel good being poked and prodded and… scanned. Is there someone I can call? I'm getting kinda lightheaded. Can we hurry it up, please? This is making me anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Reyno. We’ll start with the X-ray and take it from there. I understand your anxiety and will ensure the process is as quick and comfortable as possible. I can absolutely have a nurse come in and take your blood pressure to check that lightheadedness and see if you need to sit for a bit before we proceed. Nurse, could you please come in and check Mr. Reyno's blood pressure?
PATIENT: …Thank you. That’d be good. My head is kinda swimmin’ now. I… I don’t like feelin’ like this. Just… get it done. And then I can go home, right? That's all I want. To go home. And maybe… maybe call my nephew. He lives nearby. He can… he can drive me. I think I need a ride. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Reyno. Let's get the nurse in here. After the X-ray, we'll talk about your nephew, and I'll arrange for someone to call him. We’ll take things one step at a time. You're not alone in this. We'll figure this out together. Now, let’s get your blood pressure checked.
