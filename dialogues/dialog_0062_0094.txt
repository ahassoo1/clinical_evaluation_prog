DOCTOR: Hi Airam, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. Thanks for coming in today. So, to start, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Hi. Yes. My husband… he said I should come. Something about… learning things? I work with metal, you see. It’s… hard work. Not that I need learning. I know metal.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good you're here. It sounds like your husband is looking out for you. Working with metal is hard work. And it's smart to get things checked out. When you say “learning things,” are you experiencing any specific symptoms or changes that prompted him to suggest a visit?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Changes? I… don’t know. He just said my hands were… not good. Always tired, he says. And I… sometimes feel funny. Like… the room is spinning. But that happens sometimes anyway. I don't know what he wants me to learn about. Is this going to take long? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like your husband is concerned about your fatigue and these episodes of dizziness. We'll take things at your pace, and I'll try to be as efficient as possible. It’s good he’s paying attention to these things. So, the dizziness… how often would you say that happens?
PATIENT: Often? Hmm… not every day. Maybe… a few times a week? When I stand up too fast, sometimes. Or when I’m… working. It’s hot in the shop, you know? And loud. Everything gets… wobbly. It goes away if I sit down. But it’s annoying. My husband says it’s “serious.” He always says things are serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to be triggered by standing up quickly and also when you’re working in the shop – especially with the heat and noise. That’s helpful to know. And I understand your husband is concerned. Besides the dizziness and fatigue, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… My hands… they shake sometimes. Not all the time. Just when I’m… really tired. And… I can’t smell things very well anymore. I used to be able to smell the metal when it got hot. Now… nothing. My husband said my cooking doesn’t smell good either. He’s always complaining.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've noticed some shaking in your hands, especially when tired, and a decreased sense of smell. That’s good information to have. It’s definitely worth looking into. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Work? I… cut metal. And bend it. And… put it together. It’s… strong work. I use big machines. And… tools. I’ve been doing it for… a long time. Since I was very young. My father taught me. It’s… important work. We make things for buildings. Big things. Loud things.
DOCTOR: That sounds like very physically demanding work, and it’s admirable that you’ve been doing it for so long. Are you exposed to any dust, fumes, or chemicals in the shop?
PATIENT: Dust? Yes. Lots of dust. From the metal. And… fumes. When we weld. It smells… bad. Chemicals? I don’t know. Maybe. We use… liquids to clean the metal. And… paints. Different things. My husband always tells me to wear a mask. I do, sometimes. It’s… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so exposure to dust, fumes, and chemicals is definitely a factor. And you mentioned wearing a mask sometimes. How often would you say you consistently wear a mask while working?
PATIENT: Consistently? Ugh. Not… always. When it’s very dusty, yes. Or when we’re welding. But… it gets hot, you know? And hard to breathe. And… it makes my glasses fog up. I have to take it off to see. My husband gets mad. He says I should wear it all the time. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like it's a trade-off between protection and being able to see and breathe comfortably. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Hmm… I don’t think so. I went to the doctor when I was little. For… shots. And… when I broke my arm. But… not anything serious. I’m… strong. I don't get sick. My husband… he takes me sometimes. But they just… tell me to rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. Hospital? Only when I had the baby. That was… a long time ago. Everything was… fine. They just… gave me medicine. I don't like hospitals. Too many smells. And… noises.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? My… parents? They are both… gone now. Old age. My mother… she was always tired. And… she shook sometimes. My father… he was strong, like me. But he… couldn't smell very well when he got old. That's all I remember. We didn't… talk much about things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don't like taking pills. Vitamins? Sometimes. My husband buys them. He says I need them. But… I forget to take them. They are… small. And… I don't feel different when I take them.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That’s helpful. So, to summarize, you're experiencing fatigue, dizziness, shaking hands, and decreased sense of smell. You work with metal, exposed to dust, fumes, and chemicals, and you wear a mask inconsistently. You have no known medical conditions or surgeries, and your mother experienced fatigue and shaking, and your father had a decreased sense of smell in his later years. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh. Fine. Whatever. Just… don’t take too long. I have things to do. And… please don’t make me smell anything. I can’t smell anything anyway.
DOCTOR: Of course. We won't be doing anything that requires a strong sense of smell. It will be a basic exam – checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and a quick neurological assessment. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please take a seat on the examination table?
PATIENT: Fine. Hurry up. This is… uncomfortable. It’s cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relaxing your arm for me. I’m just going to inflate this cuff and listen with my stethoscope. It might feel a little tight for a moment. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, reading at 140 over 90. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: It's… hard to breathe. This room smells funny. Like… medicine. And… something else. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening to your heart and lungs now. I hear a slight crackling sound in your lungs, which could indicate some fluid buildup. It's subtle, but we'll want to investigate further. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Can you just relax your legs for me?
PATIENT: Reflexes? What for? I work with metal, you know. My hands are strong. I have reflexes. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, just checking your knee reflexes. They seem a little diminished, which means they're not as quick as they should be. Finally, I'm going to do a quick neurological assessment. I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and then touch your nose with your finger. Could you please follow my finger?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to focus. Everything is… blurry. Are you almost done? This is… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Your coordination is a little off, and I noticed a slight tremor when you touched your nose. Okay, that completes the physical exam. To summarize, your blood pressure is elevated, I heard some crackling in your lungs, your reflexes are diminished, and I observed slight nystagmus and a tremor in your hands. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I would like to order some blood tests and a chest X-ray to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just… tell me when it’s over. And… don't make me come back too often. I have things to do. Metal doesn’t bend itself, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll try to keep things as efficient as possible. I’ll write you an order for the blood tests and the chest X-ray. You can get those done at the lab across the street. They should take about an hour. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a blood pressure medication to help lower your blood pressure. It’s important to start this medication as soon as possible. I’ll also give you some instructions on how to manage your symptoms and some resources about occupational safety and protective gear for metal workers. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Medication? More pills? Ugh. Fine. But… what if it makes me tired? I need to be strong for work. And… what about the metal? Will I still be able to work? Just… get it over with. And… don’t make me come back too often.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. The medication I’m prescribing has a relatively low risk of causing significant drowsiness, but we’ll monitor you closely. And yes, you should still be able to work. The goal is to manage your blood pressure and protect your health so you can continue working safely. We'll discuss strategies to minimize any potential side effects and ensure you can continue your job. Let me write these prescriptions and give you the instructions and resources. It’s important to wear a mask consistently while working, especially when exposed to dust and fumes. We’ll also talk about proper ventilation and other safety measures. Here are the prescriptions for your blood pressure medication. Here’s a sheet with instructions on how to take it and what side effects to look out for. And here are some resources about occupational safety and protective gear for metal workers. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results of your blood tests and chest X-ray. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: One week? Fine. Whatever. Just… don’t keep me waiting. I have things to do. And… make it quick. I don't like hospitals. Or… doctors. Just… get it over with. Okay. I'm going now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Airam. Thank you for coming in today. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, it’s important to take care of your health so you can continue doing the work you enjoy. Take care, and I’ll see you next week. .
