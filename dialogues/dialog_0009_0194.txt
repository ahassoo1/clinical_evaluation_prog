DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been… acting up. And, honestly, my daughter, Lani, she was the one who made the appointment. She worries about me. I… I forget things easily, you see. It comes and goes, this hearing thing, and then I get dizzy sometimes. It’s… a bit unsettling. My husband, he… he had something similar, I think. But it was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like you’re experiencing some trouble with your ears – hearing changes and dizziness. And you mentioned it comes and goes, and your husband had something similar at some point. That’s helpful information. To get a better understanding, can you describe what the hearing changes are like?
PATIENT: Oh… what are they like? That's a good question. It’s… hard to explain. Sometimes it just… goes muffled, like there’s cotton in my ears. And other times, it's like everything is too loud, even normal sounds. It doesn’t last long, usually. Just… moments. Then it’s back to normal… or almost normal. I don’t know. It’s all a bit fuzzy, honestly. I try not to dwell on it. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Mayhugh. It sounds frustrating when sounds are fluctuating like that. Muffled hearing and increased sensitivity – both are things we can investigate. And you mentioned dizziness. Can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, the dizziness… right. It’s not constant, thank goodness. It’s like… the room spins, sometimes. Or, not the room, I spin. It's hard to explain. Like being on a boat, but I’m just… standing. It usually happens when I stand up quickly, I think, but not always. And it doesn’t last long, just a few seconds. I have to hold onto something, you know? It’s a bit scary when it happens. I try not to move too fast after that, just in case. I don't know if that helps…
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Mayhugh. Diziness with standing – that gives me some ideas of what might be going on. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any nausea or vomiting along with the dizziness?
PATIENT: Nausea… vomiting… Um… not really. No, I don’t think so. Maybe a little queasy sometimes, after the dizziness, but not proper vomiting. It’s mostly just the spinning feeling and the needing to hold onto something. And then it goes away. I haven't had a bad bout of it in a while, thankfully. My daughter keeps asking if I'm seeing spots, or getting headaches, but no, nothing like that. Just the spinning. Does that make sense? I'm sorry, I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining perfectly well, Ms. Mayhugh. It's common to have trouble describing these sensations. No nausea or vomiting, no spots or headaches - that's good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh… medical history… hmm. Well, I have Medicare, if that counts. And the doctor, Dr. Sharma, he checks my blood pressure regularly. It’s usually a little high, he says, but he’s got it under control with pills. I take those every day. Other than that… not much, I don’t think. I had a bit of arthritis in my hands, but it’s not too bad. Lani keeps telling me I should see a specialist about it, but I don’t like going to too many doctors. It just feels like… a lot. Do you need a list of the pills I’m taking? I can probably get one from the pharmacy.
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know about the high blood pressure and the arthritis. It's perfectly fine if you can get a list of your medications from the pharmacy, that would be wonderful. And that's completely understandable about not wanting to see too many specialists. We'll try to figure things out together. Now, just to get a complete picture, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Oh, surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Yes! I had my gallbladder out, years ago. That must have been… oh, goodness, thirty years ago? Maybe more. And I was in the hospital when I broke my wrist a few years back. Fell in the garden, silly thing. It healed okay, but it was a bit painful for a while. Other than that… I don’t think so. Nothing major. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered. Does that help? I’m trying to remember, but it was a long time ago. I'm starting to get a little tired, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Mayhugh. Gallbladder removal and a wrist fracture – good to know. And it's perfectly okay to be tired; we're covering a lot. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like hearing loss, dizziness, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh… family history… my husband, he had a lot of problems with his heart, towards the end. He was a strong man, but it just gave out, you know? And… like I said before, he had something with his ears, too. Dizziness, I think. But it was a long time ago, and I don't remember the details. My mother, she had arthritis, bad arthritis in her hands. And… my sister, she had trouble with her balance when she got older. Kept falling, poor thing. That’s about all I can think of, honestly. My memory isn't what it used to be. Is that enough information? I’m really starting to feel a bit out of it now.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Mayhugh. Heart problems in your husband, dizziness, arthritis in your mother, and balance issues in your sister – that gives us a good picture. And please don't worry about your memory; we can take things at your pace. One last few questions about your lifestyle, if you don't mind. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh goodness, no! No smoking, never have. And I hardly ever drink. Just a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes, very occasionally. My husband used to enjoy a beer, but I never really got into it. I prefer tea, you know? Nice, strong Fijian tea. I don't do a lot of traveling anymore either, mostly just stay around home with Lani. Is that enough? I really think I'm done now, if you don't mind. This has been… a lot.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly fine, Ms. Mayhugh. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. You've given me a very good understanding of what's been going on. Now, I would like to do a quick physical examination, if you're up for it. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your ears, and do a few simple balance tests. It won't take long, and it will help me get a better sense of what might be causing your symptoms. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh… an examination? Hmm. I suppose so. If you think it's necessary. But please be gentle, alright? My old bones aren't what they used to be. And try to be quick, if you can. I'm starting to feel a bit faint, to be honest. Just… take your time, and let me know if anything hurts. I trust you, Doctor. But please, be gentle. I really don't want to make a fuss. Is there somewhere I can sit down for this?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Mayhugh. We'll take things very slowly and gently. And yes, please sit down in this chair—it reclines, which will make it more comfortable. I will explain everything as I go, and please tell me immediately if anything feels uncomfortable or hurts. We can stop at any time. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No unusual sounds there. Now, I’m going to take a look in your ears. I see some wax buildup in both ears, but nothing concerning. It could be contributing to some of the muffled hearing you’ve experienced. Now, I will check your balance. Could you stand up for me, if you feel comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh alright. Wax, you say? That doesn’t surprise me. I never could keep things clean, not properly. Okay, I’m standing. But be careful, Doctor. I’m a bit wobbly. This is… a bit scary, to be honest. Just… take it easy, alright? And let me know if I look like I'm about to fall. I don't want to make a mess. What do I do now? Just stand here? It’s… starting to spin a bit, actually. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Mayhugh, that’s perfectly alright. Let’s sit back down. It’s more important that you’re comfortable. No need to worry about the balance test. We’ve gathered enough information for now. I think the wax buildup in your ears is likely contributing to the muffled hearing, and the dizziness could be related to a variety of things. Given your history and the symptoms you’ve described, I recommend a few things. First, we can gently remove the wax buildup in your ears. Second, I'd like to order a hearing test to get a more precise assessment of your hearing loss. And third, I want to rule out any other potential causes of the dizziness. I’ll order a blood test to check your vitamin levels and thyroid function, and I’ll also refer you to a specialist – an otolaryngologist – for a more comprehensive evaluation. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. That’s… a lot. Tests and specialists… I don’t know. It sounds like… a lot of fuss. But… alright. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor. I trust your judgement. Gentle wax removal sounds… alright. As long as it doesn’t hurt. And… I suppose tests are okay. As long as they don't take too long. And the specialist… is that someone I need to see right away? I really don't want to make a mess of things. It's just… a bit overwhelming, you know? Lani always wants me to get everything checked, but it's just… tiring. I suppose I should listen to her. But please, Doctor, just… take it easy on me. And try to explain everything slowly. I don’t want to get confused. Is there somewhere I can sit for a while after all this? I feel a bit… faint.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Mayhugh. We will take everything one step at a time, and I will explain everything slowly and clearly. No need to rush. The wax removal is a simple procedure – we use a gentle irrigation technique, and it shouldn’t be painful. The hearing test is non-invasive and will just involve listening to different tones through headphones. And the specialist – the otolaryngologist – is just for a more comprehensive evaluation to rule out any other potential causes of your dizziness. We don’t need to rush to see them right away – we’ll schedule the appointment for a time that works for you. And yes, please stay here and rest for a few minutes. I’ll have the nurse bring you a glass of water and a blanket. I’ll also write down all the instructions and appointment information for you. We will get to the bottom of this, Ms. Mayhugh. And I will be here to support you every step of the way. Don’t worry, we’ve got this.
