DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s this bruising, really. Seems to come out of nowhere, you know? I’m on that… blood thinner, the one the last doctor prescribed after my wife… well, never mind that now. But I bump into things normally, like anyone, and it’s like I’ve got tissue paper skin. It's getting ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Alright. So you're noticing increased bruising with minimal trauma, even on a medication for blood thinning, is that correct?
PATIENT: “Increased” is putting it mildly, Doctor. It’s not just a little more, it's… substantial. And yes, I am on the blood thinner. I assumed that’s what caused it, but it seems… worse than it should be, doesn’t it? I mean, I’m not exactly fragile, you know? Used to be quite the athlete.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long have you been noticing this increased bruising?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. It’s been… probably a good three months now, maybe a bit longer. It started gradually, just a little more color than usual after a knock, but it's definitely gotten worse in the last month or so. I initially thought it was just my imagination, or getting older, but now it's… concerning. You know? I don't want to end up in the hospital because I stubbed my toe.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are the bruises appearing after very minor bumps, or even without any recollection of trauma at all?
PATIENT: Well, that's the frustrating part, Doctor. Sometimes it’s a definite bump – I knock my shin on the coffee table, that sort of thing. But other times… honestly, I’ll wake up and there it is. A lovely purple patch on my arm, and I have absolutely no idea how it got there. It's like they just… appear. Frankly, it’s a little unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you describe the bruises themselves?
PATIENT: They’re… well, they’re bruises, Doctor. Purple, obviously. They start small, then get bigger. And they seem to last… longer than they used to. Normally a bump fades after a week or so, but these… they hang around. And some of them are quite large, really. Like the size of my palm, easy. I haven’t got… a particularly delicate constitution, you understand. It’s just… not normal.
DOCTOR: I see. Let me just pull up your medication list here. You said the last doctor prescribed the blood thinner… do you know the name of it, or perhaps the dosage?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the faintest. I just take the little pills. My wife always handled all the medication details. After she… well, it all got a bit muddled, if I’m being honest. It’s a white pill, I think. Small, round. I get it sent to the house automatically, from… I don’t even remember the pharmacy’s name. I just tell them how many and they send them. It's embarrassing, I know, but I just… didn't want to bother anyone with the details.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we'll need to get that sorted. It’s important to know exactly what you’re taking and the dosage. We'll have to call the pharmacy to confirm. In the meantime, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll check your skin for any unusual bruising and look for any other potential signs. Could you please lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Fine. I suppose that's reasonable. Honestly, I just want to get to the bottom of this. It’s rather… disruptive. Just let me know if you need me to move anything. Old joints, you know. Don't want to pull something.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to gently press on your skin to see if anything feels particularly tender or shows bruising easily. I do see some bruising on your forearms, and some on your shins, as you mentioned. It does seem… more extensive than I'd expect for minor trauma, even with a blood thinner. And I note some smaller, pinpoint bruises—petechiae—on your lower legs. Any pain with this pressure, Mr. Farson?
PATIENT: A little, yes. It’s not sharp pain, more like… a dull ache, really. Especially on my shins. And… now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit more tired lately. Just general fatigue, you know? I thought it was just getting older. What exactly are you looking for, Doctor? Is it something serious? Because honestly, after my wife… I really don’t need another worry.
DOCTOR: Well, the combination of the easy bruising, the petechiae, and the fatigue is concerning. It could be a number of things, and frankly, it’s impossible to say definitively without some further investigation. We need to rule out any underlying causes. It’s unlikely to be directly life-threatening at this moment, but ignoring it wouldn't be wise. We'll need to order some blood tests - a complete blood count, a coagulation panel to check your blood's ability to clot, and perhaps some other tests depending on the results of those. I’m going to write you a requisition form for the lab. Do you have any known allergies to latex or other materials?
PATIENT: Latex… hmm. Not that I’m aware of. My wife used to handle all that, too, if you can believe it. I think I might have gotten a rash once, years ago, from a rubber band, but honestly, I can’t be certain. It was a long time ago. Just... no known allergies, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t involve… needles, if you get my meaning. I’m not exactly fond of them. Are these tests going to be… painful?
DOCTOR: They will involve a blood draw, yes. Unfortunately, that's unavoidable. We'll use the smallest needle possible, and the phlebotomist is very good at minimizing discomfort. It's a quick pinch, and then it's over. I understand your apprehension, but these tests are essential to figure out what’s going on. The lab is just down the hall. Once we get the results back – usually a couple of days – we can discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any strenuous activity and try to protect yourself from bumps and bruises. Here’s the form. You can take this to the lab. They’ll take it from there. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: A couple of days… Well, I suppose there’s no avoiding it. Avoid strenuous activity… that narrows down my options considerably. No, I don’t think so. Just… get this over with as quickly as possible. And please, Doctor, when you get the results… tell me plainly what's going on. None of this… beating around the bush. I've had enough of that in the last year. Thank you, Doctor. I think that’s all. .
