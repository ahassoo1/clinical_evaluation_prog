DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Teretha. Well, it's this tingling... in my hands and feet, mostly. It's been going on for a little while now, and it's starting to bother me. Not terribly, but enough that I thought I should get it checked out. I don't want it getting worse, you know?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Teretha. It’s good to meet you as well. Tingling in the hands and feet… that’s something we should definitely investigate. Could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It comes and goes, it's not constant. Sometimes it feels like pins and needles, other times just… numb. It's worse in the evenings, I think. And when I’ve been on my feet all day. I'm a mail carrier, you see, so I do a lot of walking. Not as much as I used to, getting older, but still. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Teretha. Being on your feet all day as a mail carrier certainly gives me a better idea of what could be going on. So, it's intermittent, feels like pins and needles or numbness, and is worse in the evenings and after being on your feet. Now, has this tingling been accompanied by any pain?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. It’s… uncomfortable, definitely. And sometimes a little bit weak feeling, like I might drop something. But no sharp pain, no burning, nothing like that. Just… odd. It's hard to explain. It’s not bad bad, just… worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand, Teretha. It's good that you're paying attention to it and wanting to get it checked out. "Odd" and "uncomfortable" are perfectly valid ways to describe it. The weakness feeling is something we'll want to explore a bit more. Could you tell me if this tingling affects both hands and both feet equally, or is it more pronounced on one side?
PATIENT: It's… hmm. I think it's worse in my feet, both of them, but maybe the left one a little more? And my hands… sometimes my right hand feels a bit numb, but not as often as my feet. It’s funny, I noticed it more after I started using that new sorting machine at the post office. But I don’t know if that’s connected. It all feels a bit mixed up, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Teretha. So, more prominent in both feet, possibly worse on the left, and intermittent in the right hand. And you’ve noticed a possible connection with the new sorting machine at the post office. That’s good that you're keeping track of things. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to ask a few more general questions about your health. Have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had my gallbladder out, oh, must be twenty years ago now. And I had a bad flu a few years back, but nothing… serious. My blood pressure's been a little high sometimes, the doctor at home told me to watch my salt, but I don't take anything for it regularly. Mostly just try to eat healthy. Oh, and my hip… it gets a bit achy sometimes, old age, I guess. But that's not new.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gallbladder removal twenty years ago, a bout of the flu a few years back, and you've been advised to monitor your blood pressure. And some hip discomfort. Thank you for sharing that, Teretha. Have you ever had any surgeries besides your gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. Nothing else. I’ve broken a bone or two as a kid, but that was a long time ago! And I’ve had all my vaccinations, of course. I’m a sensible woman, I take care of myself. Mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Teretha. No other surgeries. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives have any medical conditions, like diabetes, arthritis, or nerve problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, she had arthritis bad in her hands, right at the end of her life. And my brother, he had some kind of trouble with his legs, nerve damage I think, but he lived out west, so I didn't really know much about it. My father was healthy as a horse, never sick a day in his life. It’s hard to remember everything, you know? It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Teretha. Arthritis in your mother and some nerve trouble in your brother – that's helpful information. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. I try to avoid pills if I can. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, that’s it. And sometimes I take something for a headache, but that's very rare. I really don’t like taking anything unless I absolutely have to. I prefer a cup of tea, if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Teretha. Vitamin D in the winter, and occasional headache relief – thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with allergies. I eat everything, I don't fuss about food. My babushka always said a good appetite was a sign of good health. Although, I suppose times have changed.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Teretha. No known allergies. Now, to get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. My parents were very strict about that. And I’ve always been around fresh air, working outside. It’s a good life, being a mail carrier, hard work but good for the soul. Although, my feet are telling me something different these days.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Teretha. And I understand, being on your feet all day can take its toll. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little wine with dinner sometimes. A small glass. Nothing fancy, just whatever's on sale at the store. Not every night, mind you. Maybe once or twice a week. It helps me relax after a long day. But I don't go overboard, I promise.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Teretha. A small glass of wine occasionally. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about what your typical day is like?
PATIENT: Well, I wake up early, of course. Gotta get ready for my route. I have a little breakfast, usually just toast and coffee. Then I head to the post office, sort the mail, and start my deliveries. It’s a lot of walking, up and down streets, carrying that heavy bag. I try to take breaks when I can, but you know how it is… gotta get the mail delivered! Then I come home, make dinner, and try to relax. It's a simple life, but it keeps me busy. And now, with this tingling… well, it makes me a little tired, if I’m honest. I'm hoping you can figure out what's going on, Doctor. I don't want to have to slow down.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that information, Teretha. It gives me a very good understanding of your overall health and lifestyle. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your hands and feet. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I suppose that's what doctors are for, isn't it? Just… be gentle, please. My feet are already feeling a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Teretha. I'm going to gently check the sensation in your feet first. Please tell me if you can feel this when I lightly touch you with this. Can you feel that?
PATIENT: Yes, I can feel that. A little bit… strange, actually. Not painful, just… a little prickly. Like pins and needles, almost. Oh, that spot, right there… yes, that’s where it feels the most.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. Now I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs, and I'll gently tap your knees with this little hammer. Your reflexes are a bit diminished on both sides, but not significantly. Now, I'm going to check the strength in your feet and hands. Could you please push your foot against my hand like you're pressing the gas pedal?
PATIENT: Alright. It feels… a little weak, I think. Not terrible, but not as strong as it used to be. My left foot feels weaker than my right. I don't know if that's just getting older, or something else.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Teretha. Now, let's check your hands. Can you squeeze my fingers as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that okay? It feels… alright. Not the strongest grip, I suppose. I used to be able to open jars with no trouble, but now… sometimes I need to ask someone for help. It’s the little things, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Teretha. Alright, that completes the brief physical exam. Based on what you've told me and what I've observed during the exam – diminished reflexes, decreased strength, and altered sensation, particularly in your left foot, along with the tingling you've been experiencing – it sounds like you may have some peripheral neuropathy. However, it's important to determine the cause of the neuropathy. There are many potential causes, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, and other medical conditions. We’ll need to run some tests to get a clearer picture.
PATIENT: Neuropathy? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. What kind of tests? And what does it mean? Is it something I should be really worried about? I just want to know what's going on, and if there's something I can do to fix it. I really don’t want to have to stop working.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Teretha, and I want to assure you that we’ll get to the bottom of this together. Peripheral neuropathy simply means that there is some damage to the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. It’s not necessarily a death sentence, and many cases can be managed effectively. To determine the cause, I’d like to order a few blood tests. These will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, a vitamin B12 level, and a test for blood sugar – to rule out diabetes. We’ll also check your thyroid levels. Depending on the results, we might also consider a nerve conduction study, which measures how quickly electrical signals travel through your nerves, and an electromyography – or EMG – which assesses the electrical activity of your muscles. For now, let's focus on getting these blood tests done. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds like… a lot of tests. I don’t mind getting the blood drawn, it’s just… everything else. Nerve conduction study? EMG? What exactly do those do? And diabetes… I don’t have diabetes, do I? My mother had it, but I always thought I was safe. I try to eat healthy, you know? Is it going to hurt? I just want to know what's going on, and if there's something I can do to fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Teretha. It does seem like a lot, and I apologize for that. Let me explain a little more. A nerve conduction study involves placing small electrodes on your skin and sending mild electrical impulses to measure how quickly the signals travel along your nerves. It can be a little uncomfortable, like a brief tingling sensation, but it's generally not painful. An EMG involves inserting a small needle into your muscles to measure their electrical activity. It can be a bit more uncomfortable, like a muscle cramp, but it only lasts for a few seconds. Both tests are relatively safe and provide valuable information. As for diabetes, it's possible to have diabetes and not know it, especially in the early stages. That’s why we’re running the blood sugar test – to rule it out or confirm it. We need to have the test results before we can say anything definitive. For now, I’m going to order those blood tests. I’ll also give you a requisition form for the nerve conduction study and EMG, just in case we need them. We can discuss those further after we get the blood test results. I'll also provide you with written instructions. Does that sound alright?
