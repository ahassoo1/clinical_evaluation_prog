DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Heindel. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Demondre is fine. Well, to be honest, I ain't really sick sick. Just... curious, I guess. Thought I should get a check-up, see how things are going. Haven't been to a doctor in a while, and figured it couldn't hurt, right?
DOCTOR: “Curious” isn’t usually a chief complaint, Mr. Heindel. While preventative care is… acceptable, it's more efficient when there's a specific concern. Nevertheless. To make this worthwhile, let’s be a bit more focused. Are you experiencing any symptoms – even mild ones?
PATIENT: Hmm. Symptoms… not really. I mean, sometimes my back gets a little sore after work. Being on the ships, you know? Lots of lifting and bending. But that's just… work. Not a big deal. I sleep okay, eat okay… feel okay, mostly. It's just… I worry sometimes, you know? About things I can't see. Is that a symptom?
DOCTOR: “Worry” is a state of mind, Mr. Heindel, not a medical symptom. And “feeling okay” is rather vague. Let’s try this systematically. You mentioned back soreness after work. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Sorry, Doctor. I ain't good at this doctor talk. The back… it's like a dull ache, mostly. Starts lower down, kinda where your belt is, and sometimes goes up a bit. It ain't sharp, it's just… there. Gets worse if I try to lift something heavy, or twist wrong. Feels better when I lay down. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That’s marginally more helpful. “Dull ache, lower back, exacerbated by lifting, relieved by rest.” We need to rule out anything structural. Do you have any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Nothing like that. Legs feel fine. Feet feel fine. Can walk and stand normal. No problems with… balance or anything. Honestly, it's just the ache. It doesn't stop me from doing things, just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any recent changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on now. You askin' about… goin' to the bathroom? I mean… no. Everything's pretty normal there. Why you askin' about that? Is that… is that what back pain does?
DOCTOR: It's a standard part of a neurological assessment, Mr. Heindel. Back pain can sometimes be associated with nerve compression affecting bowel and bladder function. It’s important to be thorough. Now, to continue… have you had any fever, chills, or unexplained weight loss recently?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. And no, I haven't lost any weight. If anything, I think I gained a little, being on the ship with all the food. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you being thorough, but is this back pain something serious? I just wanted a check-up, not… a whole investigation.
DOCTOR: “Just a check-up” is rarely sufficient when a patient presents with subjective complaints, Mr. Heindel. While I doubt it's anything catastrophic, we need to establish a baseline. Now, let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Never been diagnosed with nothin'. I've been pretty lucky, health-wise. Had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles – but that's it. My mama always said I was a strong kid. I'm on Medicare, if that matters. That's how I get seen when I need it, mostly for work check-ups.
DOCTOR: Medicare is noted. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Not even my tonsils. I've been pretty careful, I guess. Lots of lifting at work, but I try to do it right. Don't want to mess up my back.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. Family history… my mama, she had high blood pressure, I think. And her mama, she had arthritis, real bad. She couldn't hardly walk towards the end. My daddy… he was healthy as a horse, worked construction his whole life. That's about all I know, really. Nobody really talked about health stuff much. It was more about getting things done, you know?
DOCTOR: And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Don't smoke. Don't drink much – maybe a beer with the guys sometimes, but not often. And definitely no drugs. Never been my thing. I work hard, and I like to stay clear-headed. Is this getting somewhere? I'm starting to wonder if I should've just stayed on the ship.
DOCTOR: We are establishing a baseline, Mr. Heindel. While your history is relatively unremarkable, we still need to perform a physical examination to assess your back pain. Please lie down on the examination table. I'll need to palpate your spine and assess your range of motion.
PATIENT: Okay… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Palpate… that mean you’re gonna poke around? Just tell me if it’s gonna hurt. I ain’t used to this fancy doctor stuff.
DOCTOR: It may be slightly uncomfortable, but I will proceed gently. I need to feel for any areas of tenderness or muscle spasm. Please lie face down, and I will begin. Now, can you tell me exactly where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: Okay… face down. It hurts… right here. Like a dull ache, all over this area. But it gets worse when I bend over or twist. And if you press on it… yeah, that's a little sore. Be gentle, Doctor, please.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm palpating the spinous processes and paraspinal muscles. There is tenderness to palpation at the L4-L5 level. No step-off deformity is noted. Paraspinal muscles are mildly tense bilaterally. Now, I’m going to ask you to bend forward, backward, and side to side. Tell me if you experience any pain with these movements.
PATIENT: Okay… bending. Ooh, yeah, that's where it hurts. Not sharp, just… a pullin' ache. And backward… That's not as bad, but still a little sore. Side to side… This side feels tighter than that side. Does that make sense? It feels like somethin's stuck.
DOCTOR: Range of motion is moderately limited in all directions, with pain reported upon flexion and rotation. Straight leg raise is negative bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric in both lower extremities. Sensation is intact to light touch. Alright. Based on my examination, it appears you have a musculoskeletal strain of the lower back. There are no neurological deficits detected. However, given the limitation in range of motion, I recommend an X-ray to rule out any underlying fracture or other structural abnormality. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: An X-ray? Is it serious? I mean, I just thought it was a pulled muscle. I don't wanna go gettin' all… radiated. What are you lookin' for exactly? And how much is it gonna cost? I ain’t got a lot of extra money just lyin' around. Maybe I should've just stayed on the ship after all…
DOCTOR: It's a standard precaution, Mr. Heindel. The radiation exposure from a single X-ray is minimal. We're looking to rule out any fracture, dislocation, or significant degenerative changes. While it's likely a simple strain, it's best to be thorough. As for the cost… I will have the billing department contact you with an estimate. Medicare should cover a significant portion of the expense. But to answer your question directly, it’s not likely serious. We just need to get this confirmed with imaging. Do you consent to an X-ray of your lumbar spine?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, fine. If you think it’s necessary, and it's not gonna cost me an arm and a leg… alright. Do it. But you gotta promise me it's just a precaution. And I want that billing department to call me before they do anything, understand? I ain’t lookin’ for any surprises. I guess I'm stuck with this doctor stuff after all.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will have the radiology department contact you to schedule the X-ray. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter ibuprofen or naproxen for pain relief. Avoid heavy lifting, twisting, and prolonged sitting. If your pain worsens or you develop any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet, return immediately. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Ibuprofen, no liftin', call if it gets worse… I can remember that. Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you takin' the time to look at me, even if it means gettin' X-rayed. I just hope it’s nothin’ serious. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Please follow up with me once you've had the X-ray. And remember, don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any changes in your condition. Have a good day.
