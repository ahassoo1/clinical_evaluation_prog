DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good morning. I… uh… travel, right? For travel. My wife… she liked travel. Now I go. Need… shots, I think? Something like that. It’s… for a trip. I don’t remember where, exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, travel vaccinations. That’s perfectly reasonable. It sounds like you’re planning a trip, or have a trip planned, and want to ensure you’re up-to-date on your immunizations. To help me determine which vaccinations you might need, could you tell me a little more about where you’re travelling to, if you remember?
PATIENT: Like I said… I don’t really remember. Somewhere… warm, maybe? She always liked warm places. Beaches… lots of sun. Not… cold. Definitely not cold. Does that… help? It was a long flight. I think. Everything is… blurry now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It sounds like recalling the specifics is difficult right now. We can still work with that. Even knowing it’s a warm climate is helpful. To get a better idea of what vaccinations would be appropriate, could you tell me when you are planning to travel?
PATIENT: Soon… I think. A few weeks? Maybe a month? I booked it… after. After everything. The travel agent… she handled it. I just… showed up. I don't pay attention to dates much anymore. It doesn't… matter.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few weeks to a month. We’ll want to get this sorted out as soon as possible, as some vaccinations require a series of doses. To help me create a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: My… history? What for? I was… healthy. Always healthy. She… she took care of all that. Doctors and… and pills. I just… did what she said. I don’t know about… history. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time. Since... well.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. We can work with that. It’s common for people to not have detailed medical histories readily available. It’s just helpful if you recall anything significant – any serious illnesses you’ve had, surgeries, or hospitalizations. If that doesn’t come to mind, that’s okay too. Have you had any vaccinations previously, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Shots… when I was little, I guess. School things. But… she always made sure I was up to date. Every year, she checked. Yellow card? Did I have a yellow card? I don’t know… I haven't looked for it. Everything is… in boxes now. Lots of boxes. She liked organizing things. I don’t… bother.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you relied on your wife to manage those details, which is very common. We can certainly check for a vaccination record, but if we don't find one, we may need to repeat some vaccinations to be safe. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No… not that I know of. She always asked before I ate anything. Made sure everything was… safe. I ate what she gave me. Never had a problem. I don't… go out to eat much. Too much risk, she said. Now… it doesn’t matter, I guess. Just… nothing, no allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. She… she had a whole cabinet full of things. Pills and powders and… creams. For everything. But I didn't take any. She gave me things when I was sick, but… now I don't… need anything. Just… nothing. Empty cabinet now. Too many reminders.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. Thank you for letting me know. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your family history, if that’s alright. Has anyone in your family – your parents, siblings, or close relatives – had any serious medical conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family… I haven't spoken to them in years. Not since… she met them. They didn't… approve. Always judging. They lived… far away. Nepal. I don't know anything about their… conditions. Never asked. She said it was… best not to bother. Best to just forget. So I did. I just want to… travel. That’s all. I don’t know about… family.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s perfectly alright. We don’t need to delve into that if you’re not comfortable. Now, just to finish up with some general questions, could you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What does that mean? I… I work. I assemble things. Planes, mostly. It’s… a job. I eat… sometimes. Sleep… when I can. It's… quiet now. Just work and… and remembering. Not much to tell. It’s a… simple lifestyle. Very simple. I don’t… do things. Not anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay. A quiet and simple lifestyle. Thank you for sharing that. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. Just to get a baseline and make sure everything looks alright. We'll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a quick look at your general appearance. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. If you need to… look. Just… get it over with. I don’t… care much. As long as it doesn't take long. I have… things to do later. Boxes to sort through. Remembering things is… tiring. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to check your blood pressure now. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. That’s a little elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Throat looks clear, ears are normal. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits, but the slightly elevated blood pressure is something we'll keep an eye on. I recommend we monitor that during future visits.
PATIENT: Elevated? What does that mean? Is something… wrong? I don’t… understand. I just want to… go on the trip. Is this going to… stop me? I paid the travel agent… a lot of money. She said it would be… relaxing. Is everything okay? Is it… serious?
DOCTOR: It's alright. Elevated blood pressure simply means it's a little higher than the ideal range. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, and it can often be managed with lifestyle changes. It’s not uncommon, and many people experience it. It shouldn’t stop you from going on your trip, but it’s something we need to be aware of and monitor. I would like to recommend a few simple changes, and potentially a repeat blood pressure check after your trip, just to make sure it’s stable. To help me determine the best course of action, could you tell me a little about your diet and exercise habits?
PATIENT: Diet? Exercise? I… eat when I’m hungry. Mostly… noodles. And rice. Sometimes… canned soup. I don't really… exercise. I walk to work. That’s it. It's… not a long walk. And I'm always… tired. I don’t have… energy. I used to… go hiking with her. But… now. Now I just… sit. And remember. That's all I do. It's… not a very good diet, I guess. And not much exercise. I know. But what can I do? I don't… have the energy.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for being honest with me. It sounds like there's room for some small improvements, but we can start slowly. Even small changes can make a difference. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure, and your current diet and exercise habits, I recommend a few things. First, let’s try to increase your intake of fruits and vegetables. Even adding one serving of vegetables to your dinner each night would be a good start. Secondly, I recommend trying to walk for at least 30 minutes most days of the week, if you’re able. It doesn’t have to be strenuous, just a brisk walk. To address the potential for vitamin deficiencies, I'd also like to recommend a multivitamin. Do you think you’d be able to incorporate these changes into your routine?
PATIENT: Vegetables… I don’t really… like vegetables. And 30 minutes? I’m tired just… thinking about it. A multivitamin… another pill? I used to have so many pills. She always made sure I took them. Now… I don’t want pills. It's… too much. But… I want to go on the trip. So… I guess. I guess I can try. But I don’t promise anything. It's… hard. Everything is just… hard now. What about the shots? Are the shots going to be… painful?
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it's been a difficult time, and it's perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. We'll start small, and we'll take things one step at a time. As for the vaccinations, I’ll need to know where you’re travelling to, even a general region, to determine which ones are recommended. Once we know that, I can discuss the potential side effects and what to expect. Most vaccinations cause only mild discomfort, such as soreness at the injection site, but I can certainly take steps to minimize any pain or discomfort. Do you have any idea at all where you booked the trip to?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I just… told the travel agent I needed a vacation. Somewhere warm. I signed some papers. Paid the money. She said she would handle everything. I think… I think the name of the agency was “Sun Paradise”? Or… something like that. I don't remember the destination. She said it was… a surprise. A relaxing surprise. I don't even have a ticket. Just… a confirmation number. I can… find it. But it won't tell me where I'm going. It's just… numbers. I don’t know. I really don’t know. I just want to… go. That's all. Is it possible to just… go? Without knowing? Is that safe?
DOCTOR: Okay. "Sun Paradise." We can certainly try to contact them and find out where your trip is booked. It's unusual to travel without knowing the destination, but it's not impossible. However, it's very important to know where you're going so we can ensure you have the appropriate vaccinations and necessary precautions. Traveling to certain regions requires specific vaccinations to protect you from potentially serious diseases. It would be irresponsible of me to allow you to travel without that information. I'll contact "Sun Paradise" and try to get the details. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any travel until we have that information. Would you like me to give you their contact number, so you can follow up as well?
PATIENT: Fine. Yes. The number. Give me the number. I’ll call them. But… I don’t like talking on the phone. It makes me… anxious. But… I want to go on the trip. So I’ll call. What if they… don’t answer? Or they say I have to pay more money? She said it was all… included. Everything. This is… too much. Just… give me the number. And… and tell me what to say. I don't know what to ask. I just want to… go.
DOCTOR: Here you go. The number for "Sun Paradise" is 555-123-4567. And here's a simple script you can use: “Hello, my name is Odell Tayar. I booked a trip with your agency, and I’m trying to find out the destination. My confirmation number is [pause – ask him for the number]. Could you please tell me where I’m travelling to?
PATIENT: [Pause]... 789-ABC-123. That’s the number. 789-ABC-123. This is… complicated. ABC? What does that mean? Numbers and letters? I just want to… relax. I used to… just tell her everything. She handled everything. Now… I have to do this myself. I don’t know what to say. I… I think I need to sit down. This is… too much.
DOCTOR: Please, sit down. Take your time. And if you feel overwhelmed, just let me know. We can do this together, one step at a time. I'll also print out some information about common travel vaccinations, just so you have something to look at while you wait. Remember, it’s perfectly alright to take things slowly. .
