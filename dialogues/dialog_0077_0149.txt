DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, dear. Lovely clinic you have here. Honestly, I don't even remember making an appointment. My daughter, bless her heart, probably dragged me in. Something about… not wanting me to do something? It's all a bit of a blur, you see. I keep telling her I know my own body. It’s been perfectly fine for eighty-three years, hasn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly fine for eighty-three years is quite a testament. It's not uncommon to feel a little confused about appointments, especially as we get older. Your daughter is simply concerned, which is very kind of her. Let’s just take things slowly. Perhaps we can start with what’s been bothering you lately, if anything at all?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Well, now… that’s a loaded question. Everything bothers me these days! My feet, mostly. They ache, of course. What feet don't ache at my age? But it’s not a serious ache. Just… old. And I read things, you know? On the internet. About doctors… doing things they shouldn’t. Cutting things… sticking things in you. I'm perfectly capable of managing myself, thank you very much. I just don’t want anyone poking around unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Wynell. It's wise to be cautious and ask questions. We certainly wouldn’t do anything without a thorough discussion and your full consent. Let’s focus on your feet for now. You mentioned they ache. Can you describe the ache?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not one ache, dear. It’s… a general discomfort. Like they've been carrying me around for eighty-three years! Sometimes it’s in the heel, sometimes in the arch. It’s worse when I’ve been on them all day, which isn’t often, thank goodness. My daughter makes me wear those… slippers. Fuzzy ones. Dreadful things, really. They make my feet sweat. And then the ache is worse! It’s a vicious cycle, I tell you. Honestly, I just want to be left alone to manage things myself. I've gotten by this long, haven't I?
DOCTOR: A vicious cycle indeed. Fuzzy slippers can certainly contribute to discomfort. It sounds like you're very independent, Wynell, and that's admirable. To help me understand a little better, has the aching gotten worse recently, or has it been fairly constant?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that’s a good question. Honestly, I can’t rightly say. Things… blend together after a while, you know? I suppose it might be a little worse lately. My daughter keeps saying I’m shuffling when I walk. Shuffling! As if I haven't noticed! It’s just… gravity, dear. Gravity and age. It’s not something you can fix with… poking and prodding, is it? I just want to know if you think it’s something serious. That’s all. Not some fancy treatment, just… reassurance. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Wynell. Reassurance is a perfectly reasonable request. And we can definitely start there. To rule out anything serious, I’d like to do a quick examination of your feet and check your circulation. It's a simple process, just a visual look and feeling your pulses. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Examination? You mean… touch my feet? With your hands? Honestly, dear, I don't know… It feels a bit… intrusive. I've always been very particular about who touches my feet. My late husband, bless his soul, used to give the best foot rubs, but that was… different. This feels like… a doctor doing a doctor thing. Are you absolutely sure it's necessary? I'm telling you, it's just old age. It’s not something you can fix.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Wynell. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel that way. Let me explain why I ask. Checking your circulation and the condition of your feet helps us rule out things like peripheral artery disease or nerve damage, which can cause foot pain and changes in sensation. It's a quick assessment, and I will explain everything I’m doing as I go. If you’re still uncomfortable, we can certainly discuss other options. Perhaps we can start with a detailed discussion of your medical history and see if that provides us with enough information. Would that be preferable?
PATIENT: Medical history… that’s just a list of complaints and disappointments, isn’t it? But… alright. I suppose talking can’t hurt. Though I doubt it will tell you anything you don’t already know. I’ve always been perfectly healthy, despite everything. No major illnesses, no broken bones… just the usual aches and pains of getting old. My daughter will probably contradict me if she were here. She thinks I’m made of glass. But honestly, dear, I’ve lived a long life. I just want to be comfortable and left alone. What do you need to know? And please, don’t ask about my weight. That’s just rude.
DOCTOR: I understand, Wynell. We can skip the weight if you prefer. And you're right, a long life is a testament to good health. Let's start with any medications you are currently taking. Even over-the-counter medications or vitamins are helpful to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Oh, there’s something for my blood pressure. A little white pill. Can’t remember the name, honestly. My daughter handles all that. And sometimes I take something for… the aches. Ibuprofen, I think? When they’re particularly bad. And I used to take something for my arthritis, but I stopped. It didn’t seem to do much good. As for surgeries… oh, goodness. I had my tonsils out when I was a child. A long time ago. And… oh! I had a bunion removed on my left foot, maybe twenty years ago? It didn't really help, honestly. Just caused more pain. My daughter will probably say it was a disaster. She remembers all these things. I wish I had her memory.
DOCTOR: Alright, so blood pressure medication, ibuprofen as needed for aches, and a history of tonsillectomy and bunion removal on the left foot. Thank you. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… oh, my family. That’s a long story. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had something with his heart. It wasn’t good, I remember that. He died when I was young. And my sister… she had diabetes, I believe. But honestly, dear, we weren't very close. My mother didn't talk much about these things. And my sister… well, she was always a bit of a drama queen. Everything was a disaster with her. So, I’m not entirely sure what runs in the family, honestly. Just… old age, I suppose. That’s what runs in my family. And a bit of bad luck. But mostly, old age.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a family history of high blood pressure, heart problems, and diabetes. That’s helpful to know. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What lifestyle? I'm eighty-three years old! My lifestyle consists of trying to stay warm and avoid falling. I mostly sit and read. Or watch television. My daughter makes me go for short walks, but I don't enjoy them. Too much effort. I used to be very active, you know. I loved to dance. But that was a long time ago. Now, my knees ache and my feet hurt. So, I mostly sit. And read. And try to stay warm. Honestly, dear, it's a very boring lifestyle. But it's all I can manage at this point. And I don’t need anyone telling me to get more exercise. I've lived a long life, and I’ve earned my rest.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Wynell. You’ve certainly earned your rest. Now, one last thing before we perhaps do a quick exam. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see. Not that I know of. I've never had any serious reactions to anything. Though I do get a bit of a rash sometimes when I eat shellfish. But that's just a mild irritation. Nothing serious. And I don't take many medications, so there's not much opportunity for an allergic reaction, is there? Honestly, dear, I’m a very simple person. I don’t have many allergies or medical problems. Just… old age. And a bit of bad luck. But mostly, old age. I think that covers everything, doesn’t it? Now, can we just agree that I don't need any poking and prodding?
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell. No allergies, and we've covered your medical history quite thoroughly. I understand your reluctance, and I won’t push you into anything you’re not comfortable with. However, just to be thorough and rule out anything concerning, would you mind if I briefly take a look at your feet?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Must we? It really is a bother, you know. I’m perfectly capable of managing my own feet. I’ve been doing it for eighty-three years. But… alright. If you insist. But be quick about it, and be gentle. And please, don't tell me anything I don't want to hear. I don't need to be told my feet are old and achy. I already know that. Just… get it over with. And please, wash your hands first.
DOCTOR: Of course, Wynell. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible, and I promise not to tell you anything you don’t want to hear. Let’s start by just looking at your feet while you’re seated. Can you remove your slippers and shoes for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? Honestly, they’re not a pretty sight. Years of carrying me around, you know. I always said I should have been a dancer. But my father… he said it was a foolish dream. And now look at me. Old and achy and… well, you can see for yourself. Don't stare, dear. It's rude.
DOCTOR: I see. No need to apologize, Wynell. They’ve certainly seen a lot of life. I’m just noting some mild swelling and a few calluses, which are very common at your age. Now, if you'll permit, I’ll gently feel your pulses to check the circulation. Just a quick touch, alright?
PATIENT: Oh, be careful now. Don’t poke around too much. It’s sensitive, you know. And don’t tell me anything’s wrong. I don’t want to hear it. Just… get it over with. And hurry up. I have a good book waiting for me. Honestly, this is such a bother. It’s just… old age, isn’t it? Everything’s just… old age.
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell. Just feeling your pulses now… they're a little bit weaker than I’d like, but still present. Not a major concern at this point, but something we should keep an eye on. Is there any pain when I gently touch here?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's a bit tender, yes. Not a sharp pain, just… a discomfort. It's always been a bit sensitive there. I think I may have sprained it years ago, dancing, you know. My daughter said it wasn't a proper sprain, just a twist. She always says I exaggerate. But it’s been a bit tender ever since. Honestly, dear, I think it's just old age. Everything aches, doesn’t it? Now, can we be done? I’m getting impatient.
DOCTOR: Alright. A bit of tenderness, no visible swelling or deformity. I suspect a mild chronic strain, as you mentioned. Now, one last thing. Can you wiggle your toes for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It's not easy, you know. My arthritis is acting up. Or maybe it's just old age. Honestly, I don’t know anymore. Everything hurts. Can we be done now? I'm starting to feel faint. It's all this poking and prodding. I just want to go home and read my book. And leave my feet alone. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell. That’s all I needed to take a look at. You’ve been very patient. Based on what I’ve seen, your feet show some expected signs of aging – mild swelling, calluses, slightly diminished pulses, and tenderness in the ankle. There doesn't appear to be anything acutely concerning, but it’s good we took a look. I recommend continuing to wear comfortable, supportive shoes, and avoiding prolonged standing. We should also keep an eye on the pulses. I want to order a simple ankle x-ray just to rule out any underlying bony issues, and I’ll refer you to a podiatrist for a proper assessment of the calluses and to advise on footwear. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: X-ray? Another poking and prodding? Honestly, dear, it never ends, does it? And another doctor? I just want to be left alone. I don’t want to see any more doctors. I just want to go home and read my book. Fine. Do whatever you think is necessary. But I’m warning you, I don’t want to hear anything bad. And I don’t want any fancy treatments. Just tell me everything is normal and leave me alone. Is that too much to ask? Honestly, I think I’m starting to get a headache. It's all this… fuss.
DOCTOR: I understand, Wynell. We’ll take it slowly, and I promise to keep everything as simple as possible. The x-ray is just a precaution, and the podiatrist can offer advice on simple things to help keep your feet comfortable. I’ll write the referrals now, and the front desk will schedule those for you. In the meantime, please try to elevate your feet whenever possible, and avoid wearing shoes that are too tight. We’ll discuss the results of the x-ray at your next appointment. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… tell me when I can go home. And please, don't make me come back if you don't have to. I just want to be left alone to manage my own feet. Honestly, I think I've had enough doctors for one lifetime. And all this fuss… it's just… exhausting. Can we just be done?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Wynell. We're all done. Here are the referrals for the x-ray and the podiatrist. The front desk will schedule those for you. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you experience any sudden pain or changes in your feet. I wish you a lovely afternoon and a pleasant read. Try to relax and take care of yourself. And remember, it’s perfectly alright to ask for help when you need it. .
PATIENT: .
