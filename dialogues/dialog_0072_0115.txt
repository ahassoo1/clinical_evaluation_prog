DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s…it’s my liver, I believe. Or something with my liver. It’s been…yellowing. My skin, you see. It’s quite bothersome, and frankly, I’d like to get to the bottom of it quickly, if you don’t mind. I haven’t been feeling myself lately.
DOCTOR: I see. Yellowing of the skin… that's called jaundice, Ms. Durig. And you’ve noticed this recently?
PATIENT: Yes, recently. It’s…hard to say exactly when it started, you understand. Things aren’t as clear as they used to be. Perhaps a month? Maybe a little longer? It’s definitely been getting worse, though. It's… unsettling.
DOCTOR: A month or so…and has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh dear… symptoms. Let me see… I’ve been…tired, very tired. And my appetite…it’s not what it once was. Not much interest in food, I’m afraid. And perhaps…a little discomfort in my stomach, but it comes and goes. Is that…relevant? I truly don’t recall anything specific beyond that.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, decreased appetite, and intermittent abdominal discomfort. Alright. Now, Ms. Durig, I need to ask a few more detailed questions. Have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool color?
PATIENT: Oh my… stool color? That’s… a rather personal question, isn't it? I… honestly, Doctor, I don’t pay much attention to such things. It all looks…the same to me, I suppose. And my urine… I haven't noticed anything different. I really can’t say. Is this important? Perhaps we can skip that one?
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Durig, as it can help determine the cause of the jaundice. But if you're uncomfortable, we can move on for now. Let's talk about your medical history then. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, well, there’s been… a bit of this and that over the years. I was diagnosed with hepatitis… quite a long time ago. Decades, I believe. And… something with my gallbladder, I think. They removed it, years and years ago. But beyond that… I honestly can’t recall specifics. It was all so long ago. Do you have a record of it somewhere? Perhaps that would be helpful.
DOCTOR: Let me see… Yes, I see here you were diagnosed with Hepatitis B in 1988, and a cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – in 1995. Do you recall if the Hepatitis B was ever treated?
PATIENT: Treated? Oh dear… that was so long ago. I really don't remember specifics. I think… I think I took some pills for a while. But whether it was treated… I truly couldn't say. I mostly remember just trying to take it easy. It was a different time, you see. They didn’t have all the advancements they have now. Is it… common to not remember these things? I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: It's not uncommon, Ms. Durig, given the timeframe. But it’s important information. Now, have you ever received any blood transfusions?
PATIENT: Blood transfusions… Oh… I think so. When I was younger, after the gallbladder removal, I was quite weak. I believe I needed a transfusion then. But honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. I remember the hospital, and being very tired… but the details… It’s hard to say for certain. Is it important? Perhaps we could focus on something else? I feel rather… overwhelmed with all these questions.
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Durig, as it can indicate potential causes for your jaundice. We're just trying to gather all the necessary information. Now, do you have any family history of liver disease, hepatitis, or jaundice?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family history… That’s a difficult one. My family… well, they came from a very different place, you see. Kurdistan. We didn’t have much in the way of medical records back then. I believe my mother… she was always a bit unwell, but I don’t know what with. And my brother… he passed away when he was young, but I don’t recall the cause. I’m afraid I can’t be much help with that question. It was a long time ago, and things were very different. I wish I could be more informative.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to your social history. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh my, no. Never. Absolutely not. I’ve never been one for alcohol. It’s never agreed with me, and frankly, I don’t care for it. It’s… not part of my culture, you see. It was a different upbringing. No, Doctor, I assure you, alcohol is not a factor. I hope that’s reassuring. Perhaps we could move on to the next question? I'm starting to feel quite weary.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you use any illicit drugs?
PATIENT: Oh my goodness! Doctor, I am a respectable woman! How dare you ask me such a thing? That is a most inappropriate question! I am offended! I think I'd like to stop this interview right now. This is simply… unacceptable. I came here for help with my liver, not… this! .
