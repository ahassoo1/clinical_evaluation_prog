DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Sucich, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Billman. It's these hiccups, see. Been going on for… goodness, must be nearly a week now. Not constant, mind you, but they pop up at the strangest times. It’s a bit embarrassing, really, especially when I’m visiting with friends.
DOCTOR: A week, huh?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. Started right after I had a lovely lunch with Beatrice. We were having fish and chips, down by the water. Perfectly good fish, I must say. Though, now that I think about it… I did drink a rather large glass of iced tea with it. Maybe that’s got something to do with it? I don’t usually drink much iced tea.
DOCTOR: Iced tea, fish and chips… right. Well, sometimes the simplest things can be the culprit. But a week is a bit long for just iced tea. Tell me, are the hiccups interfering with anything?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness yes. Trying to have a proper conversation is tricky! They just… blurt out. And I was trying to do a little gardening yesterday, and nearly scared the poor robins half to death. It’s not painful, thankfully, just… disruptive. And a little tiring, honestly, bracing myself for the next one. Do you think it could be something… serious? I don’t want to be a bother, but I am getting on in years, you know.
DOCTOR: Serious… well, Mrs. Sucich, most hiccups are benign – just an annoying spasm. But a week is a bit prolonged. We need to rule out anything more concerning. Now, have you noticed if anything specifically triggers them?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. I’ve tried drinking water, like they say on the television, holding my breath… even getting someone to scare me! None of it seems to make a difference, really. They just come and go as they please. It’s terribly frustrating. I do find myself getting a little anxious about them, though. Wondering when the next one will strike. Could anxiety be making it worse, do you think?
DOCTOR: Anxiety can certainly exacerbate things, yes. It’s a vicious cycle. Now, let's go through some other things. Do you have any trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: No, no trouble swallowing at all. I enjoy a good meal, Doctor! I haven’t noticed anything different there, thankfully. Everything goes down just fine. I do sometimes get a little bit of heartburn, especially if I’ve had spicy food, but that's nothing new. Been having that on and off for years, really. Is heartburn connected to the hiccups, do you think? I always thought it was just my age.
DOCTOR: Heartburn can sometimes contribute, but it doesn’t usually cause hiccups to last this long. Alright, Mrs. Sucich, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to be thorough. And then I’d like to take a quick look at your throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, perfectly alright. Do whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgement completely. Been a few years since I’ve had a good check-up, so it's probably a good thing anyway. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Throat looks… normal. No obvious inflammation or anything concerning. Now, have you been taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... Yes, just my usual blood pressure tablets, Doctor. Lisinopril, I believe it's called. I've been on them for years, and everything's always been stable. And a little vitamin D in the winter months, the doctor recommended it. Other than that, nothing at all. I try to keep things simple, you know? Do you think it could be the blood pressure medication, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril… it’s possible it could be a side effect, though uncommon. But it’s been years, and if it were the medication, we’d likely have seen this before. Now, let's talk about allergies. Any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies at all. Not even to bee stings or poison ivy, thankfully. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. She lived to be ninety-five, you know, and she could eat anything. I’ve always been the same, really. Never had any trouble with food or anything like that. I do sometimes get a bit of a stuffy nose during the rainy season, but that's just the humidity, I think. It’s so strange, isn’t it? These hiccups just came out of nowhere.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no allergies, no recent changes in medications… and we’ve ruled out anything obvious physically. It could be something as simple as a lingering irritation to the phrenic nerve – the nerve that controls the diaphragm. But a week is still a bit long. I’m going to order a chest X-ray just to be absolutely sure there's nothing else going on. And a basic blood panel, just to check your electrolyte levels. It’s probably nothing, but it’s better to be safe. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A chest X-ray… well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes, of course. I wouldn't want to be a bother, but I do appreciate you being thorough. And a blood panel, too? Alright then. It’s a bit of a fuss, isn’t it, for a few hiccups? But I understand. Better safe than sorry, as they say. When do I need to go for the tests? And will I need to do anything special beforehand?
DOCTOR: Alright. Here's the order for the X-ray and blood work. You can go to the lab across the street anytime tomorrow. No special preparation needed for the blood work, but for the X-ray, they’ll ask if you’re pregnant – just a standard question. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. It should be nothing, Mrs. Sucich, but we’ll get it checked out. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and avoid anything overly spicy or acidic. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor Billman. That’s very kind of you. No, I don’t think so. Just… getting to the bottom of these hiccups would be wonderful. Staying hydrated and avoiding spice… I can certainly manage that. Alright then. I appreciate your time and your help. I'll see you when the results are back. And thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Alright. You have a good day, Mrs. Sucich. We'll see what the tests show. .
