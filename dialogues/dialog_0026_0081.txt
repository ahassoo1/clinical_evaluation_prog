DOCTOR: Good morning, Jailia. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… adequate to meet you as well. I am here because I am… dissatisfied with my current physique, frankly. And I have been experiencing… a rather unpleasant level of exhaustion lately, despite adequate rest. Also, night sweats. It's quite bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Dissatisfaction with your physique and exhaustion, along with night sweats… that's helpful to know. Let’s try to get a better picture of what's going on. When you say dissatisfied with your physique, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it is… quite obvious, isn’t it? I am exceedingly tall – one hundred and ninety-six centimetres, precisely – and, shall we say, lacking in… substance. A mere one hundred and five kilograms. It simply doesn't suit me. I maintain a perfectly reasonable diet, I assure you, and engage in… sufficient physical activity. It’s a matter of proportionality, you see. And, of course, the fatigue makes it exceedingly difficult to… improve the situation.
DOCTOR: Right. So, you’re 196 centimeters and 105 kilograms. And you feel that’s disproportionate, despite a reasonable diet and activity level, and the fatigue is hindering your ability to… build muscle, I assume?
PATIENT: Precisely. “Build muscle” is… a simplistic way to put it, but yes. It is… frustrating, to say the least. One would think, with my stature, maintaining a… more substantial build would be effortless. And the night sweats… they are simply unacceptable. They disrupt my sleep, and one cannot possibly make progress on insufficient rest. Do you… understand the importance of a good sleep cycle, Doctor? It’s quite fundamental, really.
DOCTOR: Oh, absolutely, Jailia. Sleep is incredibly important – fundamental, as you say. We'll definitely get to the bottom of those night sweats. Let’s talk a bit more about this fatigue. When did you first start noticing it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see… It began, I believe, approximately three months ago. Initially, it was… a mild inconvenience. A slight lack of enthusiasm, perhaps. But it has progressively worsened, to the point where even… simple tasks require a considerable amount of effort. I find myself… quite drained by the end of the day. It is… interfering with my work, naturally. Graphic design requires a certain level of… focus, you see. And one cannot focus when one is constantly battling exhaustion.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been about three months, starting with mild fatigue that’s progressively worsened. Graphic design… that does require a lot of concentration. Besides the fatigue and night sweats, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I have been experiencing a… diminished appetite. Not a complete loss, mind you, but certainly less enthusiasm for meals than usual. And, occasionally, I have felt a slight… warmth, a flushing sensation, during the day. It’s not feverish, certainly, but… noticeable. And my husband has commented on my… irritability. Though, frankly, he should understand I am simply… striving for perfection. It’s a stressful endeavor.
DOCTOR: Okay, diminished appetite, occasional flushing, and some irritability noted. That’s helpful. Have you had any weight loss associated with the decreased appetite?
PATIENT: That is… a pertinent question, Doctor. Yes, actually. Approximately… five kilograms, I believe. Over the past three months, coinciding with the onset of the fatigue and… other inconveniences. It's… hardly a dramatic loss, but noticeable. Especially given my… already slender frame. It's quite frustrating, really. One attempts to maintain a certain… aesthetic, and one's body simply refuses to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Five kilograms of weight loss over three months is significant, especially with the fatigue and night sweats. Let’s go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I assure you, my medical history is… remarkably unremarkable. I have always been… exceptionally healthy, despite my… proportions. I do take a multivitamin, naturally, as a preventative measure. And my husband insists I get regular check-ups, though I find them… largely unnecessary. I have never been diagnosed with anything, never had any serious illnesses, never even broken a bone. A remarkably pristine record, really. Though, perhaps this… current situation will change that.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No prior medical conditions, and you take a multivitamin. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I have never subjected myself to such… invasive procedures. I maintain a… holistic lifestyle, you see. I believe in… natural remedies and preventative care, not… cutting into one's body. My husband suggested I consider a minor cosmetic procedure some years ago, but I… firmly declined. It simply isn't… necessary. I prefer to maintain my… natural form. And besides, I have a… rather low tolerance for pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have never experienced an allergic reaction to… anything. I have a… rather robust constitution, you see. My husband occasionally attempts to introduce me to… exotic cuisines, but I find most of them… unappetizing. He does not have the same… refined palate as I do. But allergies… no. Absolutely none. I have never even experienced a mild rash. A remarkably… unfettered existence, really. Though, this… current situation is rather disrupting that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No allergies. Now, what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. My family history is… somewhat unremarkable, honestly. My parents are… perfectly healthy, though they are, admittedly, rather elderly. My mother has… mild arthritis, I believe, but that is hardly significant. My father… enjoys his gardening. Neither of them has ever experienced any… serious illnesses. No history of cancer, heart disease, diabetes… nothing of that nature. A rather… pedestrian lineage, really. Though, my grandmother… she did have a fondness for… spicy food. But I fail to see what relevance that has.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant family history of serious illnesses. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. The very notion is… repulsive. Smoking is… detrimental to one’s health, you see. And I maintain a… certain aesthetic standard. Smoking would… quite ruin that. It's quite… uncouth, really. And my husband… he would be most displeased. He is a… staunch advocate for healthy living. We both… prioritize our wellbeing. So, no. Absolutely not. Never have, never will.
DOCTOR: And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally, Doctor. Very occasionally. A small glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. A… delicate Pinot Grigio. It's… a social formality, you see. And it aids digestion, I believe. But certainly not… excessive amounts. I would never… impair my faculties. And my husband… he limits my intake, naturally. He is… quite protective of my wellbeing. So, no. Not regularly, and certainly not to excess. A… responsible indulgence, if you will.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright. Just to check your heart, lungs, abdomen, and look for any obvious signs of what might be going on. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… adequate. Though, I assure you, you will find nothing amiss. I maintain a… rigorous self-care routine. But, very well. Proceed, if you must. Though, I do request you be… gentle. I have… sensitive skin. And please, refrain from any… unnecessary probing. I find such things… undignified. But, yes. Proceed. I shall endeavor to remain… composed.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jailia. I will be as gentle as possible. Let’s start with listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Your breathing sounds clear, but I do hear a slightly… rapid heartbeat. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any tenderness. I'm also going to check your temperature, pulse, and blood pressure. Your temperature is normal. Your pulse is a bit elevated, and your blood pressure is slightly low.
PATIENT: Elevated pulse and low blood pressure? That is… concerning, isn't it? I do occasionally experience… palpitations, but I attributed them to stress. Graphic design is a… demanding profession, you see. And the fatigue… it is quite debilitating. So, elevated pulse… not entirely unexpected. But low blood pressure… that is… rather unsettling. Is that… serious, Doctor? Should I be… alarmed? My husband will be most displeased if I… require hospitalization. He has… arrangements, you see.
DOCTOR: It's good you're noticing these things. An elevated pulse and slightly low blood pressure can be caused by stress and fatigue, but we need to investigate further to rule out other possibilities. It's not necessarily cause for immediate alarm, but it warrants some investigation. I would like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, complete blood count, electrolytes, and vitamin levels. That will give us a better picture of what's going on. Do you consent to those tests?
PATIENT: Blood work? Very well. Though, I must confess, I have… a slight aversion to needles. It is… rather undignified, don’t you agree? However, if it is… necessary for a proper diagnosis, I shall endure it. Do you… anticipate it will be a substantial amount of blood? And will it… interfere with my work schedule? I have… deadlines, you see. Yes. Proceed, if you must. But please, be… swift. And discreet. My husband… he doesn't approve of excessive medical intervention. And, I suppose, if you must draw blood, please ensure the phlebotomist is… competent. I would prefer not to be subjected to… repeated punctures.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Jailia. We'll take it as quickly and gently as possible. It's only a standard amount of blood - a few vials. And we'll be as efficient as we can to minimize any disruption to your schedule. I will personally ensure the phlebotomist is experienced and competent. They are very skilled. And to reassure you, we'll send the samples to a reputable lab for swift analysis. Do you have any preference for where we send the results?
PATIENT: Reputable lab… yes. That is… paramount. I prefer… Westlake Diagnostics, if possible. They have… a rather distinguished reputation, and my husband… he has used their services before. He maintains a… comprehensive medical file, you see. He prefers to keep everything… organized. Yes. Westlake Diagnostics, if it is… convenient. And please, ensure the results are… confidential. I do not… relish the idea of my medical information being… disseminated. Yes. Confidentiality is… crucial. And, if you could… expedite the process, I would be most grateful. Time is… precious, you see. Deadlines, you understand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jailia. Westlake Diagnostics it is. I've just put in the order, and I will make a note to prioritize the results. I assure you, your medical information will remain completely confidential. We adhere to strict privacy regulations. I’ll also include a request for expedited processing. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, are there any other symptoms you've noticed, even if they seem minor?
PATIENT: Hmm. Now that you mention it… my vision has been… slightly blurred at times. Not constant, mind you, but… fleeting moments of indistinctness. And I have… a mild sensitivity to light, I believe. It’s… hardly significant, but noticeable. And, occasionally, I experience… a slight tremor in my hands. It’s… more pronounced when I’m fatigued, naturally. I attribute it to… stress and overwork. But, yes. Blurred vision, light sensitivity, and a mild tremor. Hardly… debilitating, but present. I find it… rather inconvenient, frankly. Especially given the… precision required in my profession. Graphic design, you understand. It requires… unwavering focus.
DOCTOR: Blurred vision, light sensitivity, and tremors… Those are important details to note, especially in conjunction with the other symptoms you've described. While they could be related to stress and fatigue, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm starting to lean towards investigating a possible thyroid issue or vitamin deficiency, but we'll let the blood work guide us. Before we wrap up, do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Thyroid issue? That is… concerning, isn't it? My grandmother… she had a rather… unpredictable temperament. Could it be… hereditary? And vitamin deficiency… I do take a multivitamin, as I mentioned. Is it possible the dosage is… insufficient? I must confess, I have… a rather discerning palate. I do not consume… a wide variety of foods. And, frankly, I am rather… busy. I do not have time for… elaborate meal preparation. I rely on… convenience foods, primarily. Is that… detrimental? And, one last question, Doctor: Will these tests… interfere with my upcoming social engagements? My husband has… made reservations, you see. I would prefer not to… cancel them.
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking these questions, Jailia. Your grandmother's temperament could be a factor, yes. Thyroid issues can be hereditary. As for the multivitamin, sometimes the dosage isn't sufficient, or the body doesn't absorb the nutrients effectively, especially if your diet is limited. Relying on convenience foods can lead to deficiencies, even with a multivitamin. As for interfering with your engagements, no, the blood work shouldn't interfere at all. It’s a quick procedure, and the only potential side effect is a slight soreness at the injection site. To summarize, we're going to rule out any underlying medical causes for your symptoms, starting with a thorough blood work panel. I've ordered it to Westlake Diagnostics and requested expedited processing. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are back to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as possible, and if you can, try to incorporate some slightly more nutrient-rich foods into your diet. Do you have any other concerns I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is… adequate for the moment. I appreciate your… thoroughness. And your… patience. It is… refreshing. I shall endeavor to follow your… recommendations, as much as is… convenient. And I shall… inform my husband of the… upcoming tests. He will be… relieved, I suspect. He is… quite meticulous about my wellbeing. Very well. I believe I have… exhausted my list of concerns. Thank you, Doctor Finco. I shall await your… summons. And please, do ensure the phlebotomist is… competent. It is… paramount.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailia. It was a pleasure meeting you. I understand your concerns, and I assure you, I will personally ensure the phlebotomist is highly skilled. We'll get to the bottom of this. I’ll have my assistant contact you as soon as the results are available. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
