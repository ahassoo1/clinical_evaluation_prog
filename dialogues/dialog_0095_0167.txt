DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'm Dr. Vanochten. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, my foot… it’s been bothering me. A sore, you see. A painful sore. On the bottom of my foot. It won't seem to get better.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on the bottom of your foot that isn’t healing. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes. It started… maybe a month ago? Small at first. I didn't think much of it, just a little scrape, maybe. But it got bigger. And red. Now it hurts to walk, even with shoes. It's on… here, let me show you.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. Let me take a look. If you could sit here for me, that would be helpful. We'll get a better look at it.
PATIENT: Okay, yes. It hurts when I put weight on it, you know. Especially the heel part. It feels… deep. Not just a surface scratch.
DOCTOR: Alright, I see it. It does look a bit deeper than a simple scratch. There's some redness around the edges, and it appears there may be some inflammation. Does this feel tender to the touch here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Very tender. Right there… that’s where it hurts the most. Feels… warm too, if that makes sense. Not cold, but not cool. Warm.
DOCTOR: Okay, warm to the touch is good to know. I’m checking your pulses and the overall circulation in your foot. Everything seems alright there. Have you noticed any drainage or pus coming from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? Let me think… sometimes, when I change the bandage… a little bit of… wetness. Not a lot. But not… clear wetness, if you know what I mean. A little bit yellowish. Just a little. I try to keep it clean, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish drainage is important information. And you said it started about a month ago?
PATIENT: Yes, about a month. Maybe a little longer. It started small, like I said. I didn't think much of it at first. I just put a bandage on it, but it… didn’t get better. It just stayed there, and then got worse. It’s been worrying me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any fever, chills, or felt generally unwell recently?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. I haven't been feeling sick, exactly. Just tired, maybe. Old age, you know? But no chills or anything like a cold. Just… tired. And this foot, of course. It makes walking tiring.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, have you had any problems with diabetes or poor circulation in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Diabetes. The doctor told me many years ago. I try to watch my sugar, you know? Take my pills. But sometimes it’s hard. And my legs… they used to feel numb sometimes. Not so much lately, but years ago, yes. A little bit of numbness.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s important information. Given your history of diabetes and the appearance of the sore, it’s possible this could be a diabetic foot ulcer. The poor circulation associated with diabetes can make it harder for these sores to heal, and they can be prone to infection. I’d like to get a quick blood sugar check to see where you’re at right now. And I think we should order some tests to rule out an infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests? Yes, alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Blood sugar… yes, that sounds good. I haven't checked it myself in a while, to be honest. It’s good to know where I stand. So, what do we need to do?
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m just going to draw a small amount of blood to check your blood sugar, and we’ll also send some to the lab to see if there’s any sign of infection. It’ll be a quick prick. Okay, that’s a blood sugar of 210. That’s a little elevated. Now, I’m going to write an order for a wound culture and a complete blood count. The culture will tell us if there are any bacteria in the sore, and the CBC will give us a better idea of your overall health and if your body is fighting off an infection.
PATIENT: 210? That’s… high, isn’t it? I try to eat right, but sometimes… a little bit of sweet tea, you know? It’s hard to resist. So, a wound culture… and a blood count? How long will that take? And will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Yes, 210 is a bit higher than we’d like to see. And I understand about the sweet tea – it's tough to resist! The wound culture is quick. A technician will gently swab the sore to collect a sample. It shouldn't hurt, maybe just a little bit of pressure. The blood draw will take a few minutes, and you might feel a brief pinch. The results usually take 24-48 hours to come back. In the meantime, it's important to keep the wound clean and dry. I’m going to give you a prescription for some special bandages and an antibiotic ointment. And I'll refer you to a podiatrist who can help with ongoing wound care. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A podiatrist? What is a podiatrist? Is that… a foot doctor? I've never seen one of those before. And special bandages… and ointment… Yes, alright. Whatever you think is best. Keeping it clean… yes, I can do that. I always try to keep it clean. So, a podiatrist will contact me?
DOCTOR: Yes, a podiatrist is a foot doctor. They specialize in the care of the feet and ankles. They can help with things like wound care, infections, and preventing future problems. I’ll send a referral to one nearby, and they should contact you to schedule an appointment. Here’s the prescription for the bandages and ointment. And here’s the referral to the podiatrist. I'm also going to give you some written instructions on how to care for your wound at home. In the meantime, if you notice any increased pain, redness, swelling, or pus coming from the wound, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Increased pain… redness… pus… Yes, I’ll watch for those. Thank you, Doctor. This is a lot to remember, but I'll do my best. So, I need to get the bandages… see the foot doctor… and watch for badness. No, I don’t think so. Not right now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. It is a lot, but you've got this. Just remember to keep the wound clean and dry, and don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns at all. We'll get those lab results back in a couple of days and go from there. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Thank you, Doctor. I will try my best. Thank you for your help. Bye bye to you too.
