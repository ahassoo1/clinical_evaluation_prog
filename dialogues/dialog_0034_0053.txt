DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Yadao. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… my waterworks, really. I’m having a bit of trouble, you see. It’s hard to… get things going, if you know what I mean. It takes me a while, and sometimes it doesn't feel like I empty everything.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Yadao. Difficulty with urination—taking a long time to start, feeling like you don’t completely empty your bladder… That certainly sounds concerning. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it didn’t happen all at once, you know? It’s been creeping up on me, maybe… three or four months now? At first it was just a little bit slower, I didn’t really pay much attention. Thought it was just getting older, honestly. But it's gotten worse lately. I’d say the last month or so has been the most noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been a gradual onset over the past three to four months, with a noticeable worsening in the last month. That's helpful to know. Besides the difficulty starting and the feeling of incomplete emptying, have you noticed any other changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Now that you mention it… I do have to get up at night, more than I used to. Maybe two or three times. I used to sleep right through, but now… not so much. And sometimes, when I think I'm finished, I’ll be walking and… well, a little bit leaks out. Not a flood, but enough to be embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Yadao. Frequent urination at night – what we call nocturia – and some leakage with activity… This is all important information. Are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not burning, not stinging, nothing like that. It's just… difficult. And annoying, if I'm being honest! It’s a bit of a struggle, really. Sometimes I have to wait a while and try again, and again, before anything happens.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain or burning with urination, just difficulty initiating and a sensation of incomplete emptying, with nocturia and some leakage. To help me get a fuller picture, have you noticed any changes in the strength of your stream when you are able to urinate?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! That’s a good question. It's not as strong as it used to be, definitely. It's more like… a trickle. Not a powerful flow, like it once was. It takes a bit of… pushing, I suppose, to get it going and keep it going.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased stream strength requiring some effort to initiate and maintain. Now, shifting gears a bit, have you had any recent illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… No surgeries, not for a very long time. Just the usual colds, you know? Nothing major. Last winter I had a nasty flu, but that was months ago now. And I had a bit of a bladder infection maybe five years back, but it cleared up with antibiotics.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent surgeries, a past bladder infection five years ago that resolved with antibiotics, and just the usual colds. Now, do you have any medical conditions that you're currently being treated for, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I have high blood pressure, and I take medicine for it. Been taking it for… oh, about ten years now, maybe more. And I had a bit of trouble with cholesterol a few years back, but that's under control now with pills too. Otherwise, I'm pretty healthy for my age, I think!
DOCTOR: Okay, hypertension managed with medication and a history of hypercholesterolemia now controlled with medication. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure and cholesterol?
PATIENT: Let me see… for my blood pressure, I take Lisinopril. And for cholesterol, it’s Atorvastatin. I take both every morning, with my breakfast. I have them in a little pill organizer, so I don't forget!
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril and Atorvastatin daily. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat pretty much everything. And I don't wear any fancy perfumes or lotions, so no allergies there either.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, just a few more questions about your history. Have either of your parents had any similar problems with their bladder or urination?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. My mother… she always complained of needing to go to the bathroom a lot when she got older. Always, always. And I think my father… he had some trouble emptying his bladder towards the end, but nobody ever really talked about it much. It was just… something old people get, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, maternal history of frequent urination and paternal history of difficulty emptying the bladder. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. Never smoked a day in my life. My mother always told me it was a terrible habit, and I listened! Always been very careful about my health, I think.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. And how much alcohol do you typically consume in a week?
PATIENT: Oh, not much at all. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a week. Nothing heavy, just a small glass. I’m not a big drinker, never have been.
DOCTOR: Alright, light alcohol consumption. Now, one last question about your lifestyle. What is your typical daily fluid intake?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a hard one to say exactly. I drink a lot of tea, you know? Lithuanian tea, it's lovely. Maybe four or five cups a day. And I drink water with my meals. I try to stay hydrated. I wouldn't say I drink excessively, but I certainly don’t go out of my way to restrict myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, moderate fluid intake, primarily tea. Thank you, Ms. Yadao, that gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam to help me understand what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you wouldn’t mind, please lie down on the examination table. I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen and then I'll perform a neurological exam, focusing on your reflexes. Afterwards, I’d like to do a quick digital rectal exam to assess your prostate and check for any abnormalities. I’ll explain everything as I go, and please let me know if you feel any discomfort. First, let's start with listening to your abdomen. Could you lie flat on your back, please?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. Flat on my back. Go ahead, take your time. It’s a bit chilly in here, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It is a bit cool, you're right. We'll adjust the temperature shortly. I'm listening for any unusual sounds. Your abdomen sounds normal – no masses or bruits detected. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please bend your knees and let your legs dangle freely. I'm going to tap just below your kneecap with this small hammer. Your reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Now, for the final part of the exam, I'd like to perform a digital rectal exam. This will allow me to assess the size and consistency of your prostate and check for any tenderness or abnormalities. I understand this can be uncomfortable, so please let me know if you experience any pain. I will use lubrication and be as gentle as possible. Is that agreeable with you?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. Yes, I suppose so. I’ve heard about that part. As long as you’re gentle, Doctor. And quick, if you wouldn't mind. It's not my favorite thing, to be honest. But if it helps, I guess. Just let me know before you… begin.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Yadao. I completely understand. I'll explain each step as I go, and we’ll take it slow. I'm now applying the lubrication. This will help make it more comfortable. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. Now, just relax, and take deep breaths. Alright, Ms. Yadao, that’s all done. The prostate feels slightly enlarged, but there are no concerning nodules or tenderness. Your rectal vault is clear. It’s consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia, which is common at your age. Now, let’s discuss what we’ve found and the next steps. Would you like to sit up now?
PATIENT: Yes, please, I’d like to sit up. That wasn't pleasant, not at all. Benign… what was it? And what does that mean? Is it serious? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, is a common condition in men as they get older. It simply means the prostate gland has enlarged, which can sometimes cause difficulty with urination – the symptoms you've been experiencing. It’s not cancer, and it’s usually not a serious threat to your health, but it can be quite bothersome. Based on your history and the exam findings, I believe your symptoms are likely due to BPH. However, to rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a few tests: a urine analysis to check for infection or blood, and a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, blood test to further assess your prostate. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a relief, it’s not… something worse. So, just an enlarged prostate, then? I suppose that’s not so bad. Yes, I’d like to have those tests, if it will help to be sure. A urine analysis and… that other test. What does that test involve, exactly? Is it painful?
DOCTOR: That's right, just an enlarged prostate, likely causing the issues we’ve discussed. The PSA test is a simple blood draw, just like the ones you have done regularly for your blood pressure. It measures the level of prostate-specific antigen in your blood. The level can be elevated in cases of BPH, but also in other conditions, so it helps us to get a clearer picture. It's not painful at all, just a quick pinch. Once we have the results, we can discuss treatment options. For mild symptoms like yours, we can often start with lifestyle modifications, such as limiting fluids before bedtime and scheduling regular bathroom visits. There are also medications that can help to relax the muscles in the prostate and improve urine flow. We can discuss those options in more detail once we have the test results. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable. Lifestyle changes and maybe some pills, if needed. That doesn't sound too awful. Limiting fluids before bed, I can do that. And regular bathroom visits… I’ll try. So, when will I get the results of the tests? And where do I go to get the blood drawn?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We'll schedule the blood draw at the lab right next door - I'll have the order ready for you as you leave. Typically, the results take about 3-5 business days to come back. Our office will call you as soon as they’re available to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I'd like to give you a handout with information about BPH and some helpful tips for managing your symptoms. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you. That's very helpful. Hmm… let me think. I guess… is it something that will get worse over time? And is there anything I should avoid eating or drinking to make things better? Other than fluids before bed, of course.
DOCTOR: That's a good question. BPH can progress over time in some individuals, but not everyone experiences significant worsening. Regular monitoring and appropriate treatment can help to manage symptoms and prevent complications. As for diet, there’s no specific food or drink that definitively worsens BPH. However, some individuals find that caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods can irritate the bladder. Limiting those may be helpful, but it's very individual. Maintaining a healthy diet and staying hydrated is generally recommended. It's also important to be aware of potential complications, such as urinary retention and infections. If you experience a sudden inability to urinate, fever, chills, or severe pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other concerns I can address today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a bit better now, knowing what's going on. I'll go get the blood drawn next door and wait for the results. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Yadao. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Please don’t hesitate to call our office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Here's the lab order, and I'll have the nurse print out a summary of today’s visit for your records. Wishing you all the best, and please take care.
PATIENT: .
