DOCTOR: Good morning, Jimmi. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… something down there. A little leak, you know? Not good. It’s been… a little while. I don’t really… keep track of these things. It's embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be embarrassing to talk about these things, and you’ve come to the right place. We’ll figure it out together, and I assure you, I’ve heard it all before. When you say “a little while,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough… hmm. Maybe… a month? Or two? I don’t know, honestly. I mostly just notice when my clothes get damp. It’s not… constant, you know? Just… happens sometimes. I mostly just wear dark pants now, to hide it. It's a nuisance, really. Why is everything falling apart when you get old?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright; an estimate is helpful. So, it’s been happening for roughly a month or two, and it’s intermittent – not constant. You've also noticed it more when wearing lighter clothing. It is frustrating when things change as we get older, and it sounds like it's impacting your daily life, which is why you're right to come in. To understand what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Eh, when… well, not when I’m sleeping, thankfully. And not… usually when I’m walking. Mostly… when I laugh. Or… sometimes when I cough. Big coughs, you know? And… if I try to… go really bad, it sometimes leaks a little bit before I get to the bathroom. It's annoying. Is this something serious? I don’t want to end up in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it happens with laughing, coughing, and sometimes with urgency – when you feel like you really need to go. That's very helpful information. It sounds like it’s related to increased pressure in your abdomen. It’s good that you’re thinking about this now. It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s serious, but we want to figure out the cause. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the leakage?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No… no pain. Not really. Just… the wetness, you know? And… sometimes I feel a little bit itchy down there. But I always thought that was just… old age. Everything itches when you get old. I don't know. Is that a symptom? Everything feels loose, too. Like... not firm anymore. But is that something to worry about?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain, but you’ve noticed some itching and a feeling of looseness. Itching can be related, and the feeling of looseness is important information as well. It’s good you’re bringing all of this up. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Eh, what do you want to know? I’ve had the usual old lady things. Arthritis, mostly. Hurts in the knees. And… I think I had the flu a couple of times. Nothing serious. I don’t go to the doctor much. They just tell you you’re getting old, anyway. I don't remember much about surgeries. Maybe… gallbladder? A long time ago. I don’t know. I don't take much medicine. Just a little something for the knees when it rains.
DOCTOR: Okay, so arthritis in the knees, some flu illnesses, and possibly a gallbladder surgery in the past. And you take something for your knee pain as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. I ate everything when I was younger. Shellfish, peanuts, you name it. Never had a reaction. Maybe… a little bit of a rash once from a perfume, but that was a long time ago. I don’t use perfume anymore. I mostly just smell like… old lady now. Honestly, I don't remember anything specific. I don't think I have any bad allergies, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known significant allergies. That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh boy. Lots of people. My mother… she had… something with her heart, I think. Died when I was young. My father… he smoked a lot. Lung problems, of course. And… my sister… she had diabetes. She lost her leg. That was sad. Everyone got sick eventually, you know? It's just part of being alive. I don't think anything specific runs in the family. Just… sickness, generally. Does that help? Everything is blurry when you get old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart problems in your mother, lung problems in your father due to smoking, and diabetes in your sister. That is helpful information, even if it feels blurry. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… eh. Not much to tell. I never married. Too busy taking care of my family. I used to work… making flower leis. Beautiful leis. Then… I just stopped. Now I mostly just stay home. Read books. Watch TV. I don't drink much. Maybe a little bit of wine sometimes, with dinner. Never smoked. Always thought it was a bad habit. I live alone. That's about it. Quiet life. I’m mostly just… old, now. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you never married, you used to make flower leis, you don't smoke, and you drink a little wine occasionally. You live alone and enjoy reading and watching TV. That gives me a good sense of your lifestyle. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam if you’re comfortable with that. This will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. It will involve checking your abdomen, and a brief pelvic exam. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Pelvic exam… Oh, no. No, thank you. I don’t like people poking around down there. I’m too old for that. Just… is it something serious? Can you tell me just from talking to me? I’d really rather not have anyone… look at anything. It's embarrassing. I don’t want any poking around. Please. Can't you just give me something for it? Some kind of cream or… something?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Jimmi. Your comfort is my priority. A pelvic exam would help me to be more certain, but I absolutely respect your wishes. We can proceed without one. Based on what you’ve told me – the leakage with laughing, coughing, and urgency, the feeling of looseness, and no pain – it sounds most likely like you are experiencing stress incontinence and possibly some pelvic floor weakness. This is common, especially with age and after childbirth, although you haven’t had children, it can still occur. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. We can try some initial treatment options, but if things don’t improve, or if you develop any new symptoms – pain, blood in your urine, fever – it’s very important to let me know. Would you be open to trying some pelvic floor exercises, also known as Kegel exercises?
PATIENT: Pelvic floor exercises… eh. Sounds… complicated. I’m not very good at exercises. My knees hurt too much to do much standing around. Can't you just give me a pill? Something easy? I don’t want to do anything… complicated. Just something to make it stop. I'm too old to be squeezing things. Is there something else? A cream, maybe? Or… a special pad? I just want it to be… quiet down there. It's annoying me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Pills can sometimes have side effects, and there aren’t any specifically for stress incontinence. There are some medications that can help with bladder control, but they don't always work and can have unwanted effects. A cream won't likely help with the leakage itself. Special pads are a good option for managing the symptoms, and we can certainly talk about that. We can start with the pads. They come in different absorbencies, and we can find one that’s comfortable for you. Would you like me to show you some options?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Show me the pads. That sounds… easy enough. I just want to be able to go out without worrying about… things. Dark pants are nice, but it gets hot here. I want to wear lighter colors sometimes. Show me the pads, please. And… are they expensive? I’m not insured, you know. I don’t have a lot of money.
DOCTOR: Of course. Here are some different types of pads designed for incontinence. These come in different absorbencies – light, moderate, and heavy – and different styles, including ones that stick to your underwear and ones that look more like regular panty liners. We can start with a lighter absorbency and see how that works for you. As you mentioned, you’re not insured, so cost is important. These brands are generally more affordable, and I have some coupons here you can use. We can also look at some options at a local pharmacy. There are often sales and discounts available. Let's start with these light absorbency pads and see how they work for you. If they're not enough, we can try a different type or absorbency. Do you have any questions about using them?
PATIENT: That looks… manageable. Thank you. The coupons are nice. I don’t want to spend a lot of money on this. No questions, I think. It’s just… embarrassing, you know? Having to worry about this. But the pads sound… better than poking around. I guess… that’s all for now? I hope these work. Can I just come back if they don’t? If it gets worse? I don’t want to bother you if it’s nothing.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jimmi. It is understandable to feel embarrassed, and you're not alone in this. And absolutely, please come back if the pads don't help, or if anything changes or gets worse. That's what I'm here for, and you're not bothering me at all. We’ll check in and see how you’re doing. Here's a written summary of our discussion and the coupon for the pads. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. Have a good day, and please remember to take things one step at a time.
