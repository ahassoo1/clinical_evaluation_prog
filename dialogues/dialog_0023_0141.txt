DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's this itching, really. Everywhere, it seems. It's been going on for… oh, let me think… about three weeks now, maybe a little longer. It’s just… annoying, constantly having to scratch. Not painful, just… itchy.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, alright. And you say everywhere… could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Well, my arms, legs… back, mostly. It's even on my chest a bit, and… ugh, even my scalp. It's not red red, just… a little pinkish sometimes after I scratch, you know? It’s hard to describe. It doesn’t seem to be getting worse, just… persistent. I tried some lotion, but it doesn't really help much.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, generalized itching for approximately three weeks, not associated with significant redness unless you scratch, and lotion hasn't provided relief. Have you noticed it at any particular time of day, or is it fairly constant?
PATIENT: It's pretty constant, I'd say. Maybe a little worse at night, when I'm trying to sleep. That’s probably just because I notice it more when it's quiet, though. I don’t really feel it more at night, if that makes sense. It's just… there. All the time. And it doesn't seem to be connected to anything I eat, or anything like that. I haven’t changed soaps or anything recently, either.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No recent changes in soaps, detergents, or diet. Itching is constant, perhaps slightly more noticeable at night. Do you have any known allergies—to medications, foods, insect stings, anything like that?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. Never been stung by anything serious, no food allergies… I take a little something for my blood pressure, but that's been the same for years. Lisinopril, I think it's called. And I had a tetanus shot last year, but no reaction to that. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a pretty healthy guy for my age. This itching is just… strange. I haven't been anywhere new or done anything different.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lisinopril for blood pressure, and a tetanus shot last year with no reaction. Let's get a better look. Could you please undress down to your underwear so I can examine your skin?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, of course. I haven't had to undress for a doctor in… well, a long time. It's just this itching, isn't it? It doesn't look like anything, does it? I mean, I know you need to check, but… it's just a lot of itch, not a lot of… sight, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mr. Ferneding. I simply need to visually assess the skin to rule out any obvious causes. It’s good you’re explaining what you’re experiencing, it helps me understand. You can sit there, and we’ll take a look. Don’t hesitate to point out any areas that are particularly bothersome.
PATIENT: Alright. Well, here. That’s where it’s particularly bad, I think. And just… everywhere, really. It’s hard to pinpoint. It's not raised or anything, just… irritated. And my legs, especially the backs of them. It just… feels dry, even when it isn’t. Is this going to take long, Doctor? I have a little appointment this afternoon. Nothing important, but…
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some very mild excoriations—that’s just the scratching, really—and the skin does appear slightly dry. No significant rash or wheals. The distribution is fairly widespread, as you said. Not consistent with a localized allergic reaction, which is good. Yes, the legs are similarly affected. The skin feels normal in terms of temperature and texture…though slightly dry. Given the widespread nature and lack of obvious visual findings, it's unlikely to be something simple like a contact dermatitis. Now, have you experienced any fatigue, weight loss, or fever recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever at all. And I haven’t lost any weight, if anything I’ve been eating a little more, trying to feel better. Fatigue… well, I’m a little tired, but I’m 53! I work every day, dispatching, you know? It’s a stressful job, always has been. So, a little tired is normal for me. I thought maybe it was just the stress, honestly. But it’s been three weeks now, and it’s just… persistent, like I said. It's not getting worse, but it’s not going away either. It’s just… there. It’s very frustrating. I’m starting to lose sleep over it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, no weight loss, fatigue likely related to occupation. Itching persistent for three weeks, not worsening, but not improving. Given your history, and the lack of objective findings, we need to consider some systemic causes. It could be something as simple as dry skin exacerbated by stress, or it could be related to an underlying medical condition. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out some possibilities. Specifically, I want to check your complete blood count, liver function, kidney function, thyroid function, and a basic metabolic panel. We’ll also check for inflammatory markers, just to be safe. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, alright. Sounds… thorough, which is good. I appreciate you taking it seriously. I don't mind the needle, I’ve had plenty of those in my life. Three weeks of itching is enough to make a man do anything, honestly. So, yes, let's do the blood work. Will I need to fast beforehand? And how long before I get the results? I have another appointment next week, and I’d like to know something before then, if possible. It’s with the lawyer… about the… estate. It's a little complicated, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, we’ll need a 12-hour fast for the blood work. No food or sugary drinks after midnight tonight. Water is fine. We can draw the blood first thing tomorrow morning. The lab usually takes 24-48 hours to get the results back to us, so I should have them by Friday at the latest. I’ll have my nurse call you with the results as soon as I’ve reviewed them. In the meantime, I recommend using a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer several times a day, especially after bathing. Avoid hot showers and harsh soaps. And try to manage your stress levels as much as possible, easier said than done, I know. Is there anything else you’d like to discuss before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor. The moisturizer is a good idea, I’ll try that. And I'll remember about the fasting. I appreciate you listening, and taking it seriously. It’s… nice to have someone look at it and try to figure it out. It's just been… nagging at me. A lawyer appointment and this… it’s a lot. You know, my wife… she always knew what to do. She’d have probably told me to stop worrying so much. But… thank you again, Doctor. I'll see you… or, I’ll hear from you, on Friday. .
DOCTOR: You're welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I understand. I’ll be in touch on Friday. Don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any new symptoms or if the itching becomes significantly worse before then. .
