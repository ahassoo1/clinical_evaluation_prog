DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… it’s about my coloring, I suppose. My skin and eyes… they’ve become quite yellow. A friend suggested I come see someone. I believe it has something to do with my liver, but honestly, my memory isn't what it used to be. It’s rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Durig. Yellowing of the skin and eyes – what we call jaundice – can certainly be unsettling. It's good you came in to get it checked out. You're right to think it could be related to your liver, but it's important to figure out the exact cause. You mentioned your memory isn’t what it used to be. Has this change been gradual, or has it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… gradual, I think. It's… difficult to pinpoint. Years, certainly. Not something that happened overnight. I just… forget things now. Important things, sometimes. And yes, the coloring… it’s been getting worse lately, I believe. It's all a bit muddled. I apologize for being so vague. Is this… serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Durig. It's perfectly understandable to be vague when you're concerned and experiencing memory difficulties. We'll take our time and sort things out. Gradual onset is helpful information. Jaundice can be caused by a number of things, some more serious than others, so it's important to investigate. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask you a few more questions. First, have you noticed any changes in your urine or stool color?
PATIENT: Urine… and stool… … Honestly, Doctor, I can’t say I’ve paid much attention. I live alone, you see, and… well, one doesn’t always notice such things when one is… on their own. Is that a foolish answer? I think my stool has been… paler than usual, perhaps? But I truly couldn’t say with any certainty. And the urine… I don't recall. I apologize. This is all very… upsetting.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Durig, that is not a foolish answer at all. It's completely understandable, especially living alone. Don't worry about apologizing; we'll gather as much information as we can. Okay. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the yellowing?
PATIENT: … Now that you mention it… yes. I’ve been terribly fatigued lately. Just… exhausted all the time. And a bit of an ache, right here, under my ribs, on the right side. Not a sharp pain, just… discomfort. And… a loss of appetite. Food doesn’t taste the same anymore. It’s all rather unpleasant. I used to enjoy cooking, you know. Now… it's just a chore.
DOCTOR: I see. Fatigue, discomfort under your right ribs, and loss of appetite… those are all important pieces of the puzzle. Have you had any itching recently?
PATIENT: … Itching… hmm. … Now that you ask, yes, a little. Not terribly bad, but… my skin feels rather dry and… sensitive. I thought it was just the winter air, but perhaps it’s related? I’ve been using lotion, but it doesn't seem to help much. It’s more of a general… discomfort than a severe itch, if that makes sense. Is this… concerning, Doctor?
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Ms. Durig, and yes, it’s helpful information. Itching along with the jaundice, fatigue, right-sided discomfort, and loss of appetite certainly raises our concern for a possible liver issue, but we need to investigate further to determine the cause. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as hepatitis or gallbladder problems?
PATIENT: … Hepatitis… gallbladder… Oh dear. It was so long ago. I think… yes. A doctor mentioned something about hepatitis many years ago, when I was traveling. Something about a… a shot, and being careful. It was a very brief visit, and I don't recall the details. As for gallbladder… no, I don't believe so. I’ve never had any surgery. I truly apologize for being so vague. It feels like my memories are… slipping away. This is very frustrating.
DOCTOR: Ms. Durig, you’re not being vague at all. It’s perfectly understandable, and you’re doing your best, and that’s what matters. Knowing about the possible hepatitis is very helpful. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t. I try to avoid medications if possible. I believe in… natural remedies, if you will. Mostly just… tea and rest. I haven’t needed anything regularly for quite some time. I used to take something for my blood pressure, many years ago, but the doctor took me off of it. That was… oh, goodness, decades ago. I truly don't take anything currently. Just tea. A lot of tea. Is that… alright?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Durig. Just tea is fine. Now, to get a clearer picture of what's going on, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll gently feel your abdomen to check for any tenderness or enlargement, especially in the liver area. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That… that sounds sensible. Though I confess, I dislike being touched… it reminds me of… things I'd rather not remember. But if it will help, then yes, please. Just… be gentle, if you would. And perhaps tell me what you’re doing as you go? It… it helps me feel more at ease. I apologize for being so… difficult.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Durig. I will be very gentle, and I will explain everything as I go. I completely understand your hesitation, and I will respect your boundaries. I'm just listening to your heart and lungs now, to make sure everything sounds normal. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… very good. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I'm gently feeling your abdomen. I'm starting here… is there any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. There… right there. It's not a sharp pain, but it’s… uncomfortable. A dull ache, really. It feels… swollen, almost. Is that… bad? It’s been like this for a while now, but I didn’t think much of it. I assumed it was just… old age. I apologize for being so… unhelpful. I’m probably just making things worse by being so vague.
DOCTOR: You’re not being unhelpful at all, Ms. Durig. You’re providing valuable information. It's important that you mentioned the tenderness. I'm feeling a slight enlargement and some tenderness in your right upper quadrant, where your liver is located. It could indicate some inflammation or congestion of the liver, but we need further testing to confirm that. I’m also noting some mild skin dryness. Overall, your findings suggest a possible liver issue, as we discussed, but we need to run some blood tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would you be willing to have some blood drawn today?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, I suppose so. If it will help… If it will tell us what’s wrong. I dislike needles, terribly, but I understand it’s necessary. Just… please be quick? And gentle? I apologize for being such a… bother. It’s just… this is all very unsettling. I’ve never been one for hospitals or doctors, you see. I prefer to be left alone, with my tea. But I understand this is important. Just… please be quick.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Durig. I understand your anxiety, and I will do everything I can to make the process as quick and comfortable as possible. Our phlebotomist is very skilled and gentle. We'll just need a few vials of blood. We'll run a complete liver panel, which will assess your liver function, as well as some tests to check for inflammation and any possible viral infections. We'll also run a complete blood count to check for any other abnormalities. Once the results are back, we can discuss them and develop a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds… alright. A liver panel, a blood count… It all sounds very… complicated. But if it will tell us what’s wrong, then yes. Please. Just… let me know when it’s done? And… what the results mean? I apologize for asking so many questions. I’m probably just making things worse. But I truly don’t understand all the medical terms. Just… please take care of me, Doctor. I feel very… vulnerable.
DOCTOR: You're not making things worse at all, Ms. Durig. It's perfectly okay to ask questions, and I'm happy to explain everything in plain language. That's my job. I will personally review the results with you and explain everything in a way that you understand. We'll discuss all your options and develop a plan that’s right for you. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. It will only take a few minutes. Once that’s done, you can rest in the waiting area for a bit, and then you're free to go. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just… thank you. Thank you for being so patient with me. And for explaining everything so clearly. I truly appreciate it. Just… please be quick with the needle? And… gentle? I apologize for repeating myself. I truly dislike needles.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Durig. And absolutely, I will make sure the phlebotomist is as quick and gentle as possible. I understand your anxiety, and we'll take it slow. "Sarah, could you please come in and draw Ms. Durig’s blood?
