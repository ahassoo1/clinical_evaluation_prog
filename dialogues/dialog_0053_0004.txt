DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just here for my shots, like the nurse said. Routine stuff, I guess. It’s good to meet you, by the way.
DOCTOR: Right. “Shots.” Yes. Well, it's good you’re here. Let’s not just rely on the nurse's assessment, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, no offense meant to the nurse, she’s a sweet girl! I just… well, I don’t always remember what they said exactly, you know? Things go in one ear and out the other these days. Just figured I’d get everything updated while I was here. What do you need to know?
DOCTOR: Of course. It's perfectly alright to not recall everything. Still, we need a proper history. Let's start with your general health. Any major illnesses or surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Nothing major, not that I can recall. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, ages and ages ago. And… oh! I broke my wrist a few years back, fishing. Needed a cast for a bit, but that was about it. Otherwise, I’ve been pretty lucky, knock on wood.
DOCTOR: Tonsils, a broken wrist… hardly constitutes a “medical history,” Ms. Fornes. But alright. Any serious illnesses in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family… that’s a long story. My mom had… well, she had some heart trouble when she got older, ended up needing a pacemaker. And my uncle, on my dad's side, had diabetes. He wasn't very good about taking care of himself, sadly. Does that help? It’s hard to keep track of everything when you get older, you know. There's a lot of folks in my family.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s… noted. Heart trouble and diabetes. So, you have a family predisposition to, shall we say, lifestyle-related conditions. Let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never touched a cigarette in my life. My mom smoked when I was a kid, and it smelled awful, so that pretty much ruined it for me. I do enjoy a little wine with dinner sometimes, though. Nothing crazy, just a glass or two.
DOCTOR: Alright. Moderate alcohol consumption. And what about exercise?
PATIENT: Well, I try to stay active. I do a lot of walking, especially when the weather’s nice. And I help my husband out with things around the house, you know? Gardening, little repairs... it all adds up, I guess. Not like I’m running marathons or anything, but I’m not a complete couch potato, if that makes sense. I used to go fishing more, but my wrist still bothers me a bit sometimes.
DOCTOR: "Adds up." Right. It’s good you’re…mobile. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Not really. Just some ibuprofen now and then for aches and pains, like when my wrist acts up. And a little allergy medicine in the springtime, when the pollen gets bad. But nothing regularly, no. I try to avoid taking pills if I can help it. My grandma always said they were more trouble than they were worth.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen and allergy medication, as needed. Alright. Now, before we proceed with these… routine shots, I'd like to quickly examine you. Just a basic check. Blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your wrist. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Sounds good. I figured you’d want to do that. Just let me know if anything feels… weird. I get a little nervous when folks poke around, but I'm usually alright.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. Blood pressure is… slightly elevated, 142 over 88. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit rapid. Lungs are clear, but you do have a slightly diminished breath sound on the lower left side. Now, let’s take a look at your wrist. There's some residual tenderness and a slight limitation in range of motion. Old injury, clearly. Do you experience any pain with specific movements?
PATIENT: Hmm… yeah, that doesn’t surprise me. It does bother me sometimes, especially when it’s cold or damp. And if I try to lift something heavy with it. Not a sharp pain, just a dull ache, mostly. It's been like that for a while. I mostly just ignore it, to be honest. I don’t want to go through the hassle of physical therapy or anything like that. It’s not too bad. Really.
DOCTOR: "Ignore it." Yes, well, that rarely solves anything. It appears you have some mild chronic discomfort from the previous wrist fracture. However, we need to determine if these shots are appropriate given your slightly elevated blood pressure. Have you ever been diagnosed with hypertension?
PATIENT: No, never. Not that I know of. I've never really been to the doctor much, to be honest. I usually just deal with things on my own. My blood pressure's never been mentioned before, not until today, anyway. Is it something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: It’s… concerning that you haven’t had a proper checkup. Slightly elevated blood pressure requires further investigation. We’ll need to repeat the reading later today to confirm. Given your history and the elevated reading, I'm not comfortable administering any injections at this time. It’s possible there's an underlying issue that needs to be addressed first. I’ll order some basic blood work and suggest a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, that’s not what I was expecting. No shots at all? But I came all this way… I guess it's better to be safe than sorry. Blood work and a cardiologist… sounds serious. Okay. Yes, that’s acceptable. What do I need to do about the blood work? And… will I need a referral for the cardiologist? I don't even know where to start with something like that.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s prudent to be thorough. I'll print out a requisition for a basic metabolic panel and a lipid panel. You can have these done at the lab across the hall. They'll need a fasting sample, so nothing to eat or drink for at least eight hours beforehand. As for the cardiologist, I'll have my staff prepare a referral for Dr. Elena Ramirez. She’s excellent. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. Given your family history, it’s important to rule out any cardiac issues. I understand this isn't ideal, but it's necessary. Do you have any questions about this?
PATIENT: Oh, okay, eight hours fasting. That’s good to know. And Dr. Ramirez, alright. Thank you. Hmm… Will the insurance cover all of this? I, uh, don't have insurance right now. It's a long story. Is that going to be a problem?
DOCTOR: That… complicates matters. Unfortunately, without insurance, you will be responsible for the full cost of the blood work and the cardiologist visit. I can have my staff provide you with the estimated costs. We do have a limited financial assistance program available, and they can also explore options for a payment plan. However, availability is limited. I strongly advise you to discuss this with them. I cannot proceed with the referral until you acknowledge that you understand the associated costs. It’s simply impractical otherwise.
PATIENT: Oh. Well, that’s… not good. I was hoping it would be covered. A payment plan might be alright, I guess. I’ll have to talk to my husband. It’s just… unexpected. So, the staff can tell me how much it’s going to be? Before I commit to anything? It's a bit much to take in all at once.
DOCTOR: Yes, my staff will provide you with a detailed cost estimate for both the blood work and the cardiologist consultation. They can also explain the payment options available. Please understand, I’m recommending these tests to ensure your health and well-being. It’s better to address potential issues now rather than later. They’re located at the front desk. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you for… explaining everything, even if it wasn’t what I wanted to hear. It's a lot to think about, but I’ll talk to my husband and figure things out. I appreciate your time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Fornes. And please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions. .
