DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, lately I been drinkin’ a lot of water, more than usual. And I feel hungry all the time, even after I eat a good plate of food. It just… don’t seem right.
DOCTOR: I understand. Increased thirst and increased appetite, even after eating… those are certainly things we need to investigate. Can you tell me approximately how much water you’re drinking in a typical day, compared to what you used to drink?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Before, I used to maybe have two or three glasses of water a day. Just with meals, you know? Now… I’m fillin’ up a big pitcher, almost a gallon, and I still feel thirsty. It’s kinda strange. My husband even askin’ if I been waterin’ the garden with it!
DOCTOR: A gallon of water… that is quite a significant increase. And you mentioned feeling hungry even after eating a full meal. Has your weight changed recently – either gained or lost?
PATIENT: I don't think so, Doctor. Maybe a little… but not much. Old age catchin’ up, you know? I haven’t been weighin’ myself regular, to be honest. My husband, he says I look the same. But I feel different, with this thirst and hunger all the time. It’s worryin’ me a bit.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Zicarelli. Feeling different is always worth investigating. Now, let’s talk a little more broadly. Have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, I been havin’ to go to the bathroom more often, you know? Especially at night. It wake me up sometimes, which is no fun. And I feel a little tired, but I thought that was just from bein’ my age. I ain't sure if that’s connected or not.
DOCTOR: Increased frequency of urination, particularly at night, and fatigue… those are both relevant symptoms, Ms. Zicarelli. Are you experiencing any blurry vision?
PATIENT: Blurry vision? No, Doctor, not really. My eyesight ain’t the best, but it always been like that. I have glasses for readin', but that’s it. Everything seems…normal, in that way. Is that somethin' I should be lookin' out for?
DOCTOR: It is a potential symptom, but don't be alarmed. Just wanted to ask. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. Doctor told me a few years back, but I takein’ pills for it, regular. That’s why I see Dr. Ramkissoon every few months. Other than that… no, nothin’ else. I've always been pretty healthy, all my life. Until this thirst and hunger started, that is.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Zicarelli. And what about surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Years ago, I had my tonsils taken out when I was a child. And I had a C-section with my son. Other than that, no. No other surgeries I can think of.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, thinking about your family – are there any health conditions that run in your family, such as diabetes, heart disease, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother, she had diabetes, towards the end of her life. And my father, he had a bad heart. That runnin’ in the family, yes. My sister, she got high blood pressure too, like me. Seems like we all get somethin'.
DOCTOR: I see. And currently, are you taking any medications besides the ones for your high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just the blood pressure pills. Two of them every mornin'. I try to take them at the same time, every day, like I'm supposed to. I'm a good patient, I promise.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Zicarelli. It's important to be diligent with medications. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin', thankfully. My husband always tease me, say I can eat anythin’ and nothin’ happen. I think he just likes seein' me eat.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. It'll involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick abdominal exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That sounds alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I trust you. I been comin' to doctors for years, you know. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Zicarelli. Just relax your arm for me. 150 over 92… a bit elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Again… and out… Your breathing sounds clear, but I do detect a slight murmur. Not concerning at this point, but worth noting. Now, I’ll just gently palpate your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really. It feels…normal, I guess. A little tender sometimes, after I eat a big meal, but that's normal, right? It's just my stomach, you know, after all the food.
DOCTOR: Yes, some tenderness after a meal is not uncommon. However, I do note some slight fullness in your abdomen. It's subtle, but present. Now, I’m going to ask you to urinate into a sample cup in the restroom when we finish this examination. This will help us to assess your kidney function and rule out any infection. I'd also like to order some blood work to check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and electrolytes. This will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds fine, Doctor. Urine sample and blood work, yes. Whatever you think is best. I just want to find out what’s causin' this thirst and hunger. It’s worryin' me, you know? And I want to be able to enjoy my food again. It don't taste the same no more.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Zicarelli. It’s good we are investigating this. The changes in your appetite and taste are concerning. Based on your symptoms and the initial examination, the increased thirst and frequent urination, along with the family history of diabetes, make diabetes a strong possibility. However, we need the blood work and urine analysis to confirm this. I'm going to write an order for a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a hemoglobin A1C, and a urinalysis. Please go to the lab after our consultation and they will take care of it. Once the results are back, we will discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Um… the blood work, it's gonna take long? And… if it is diabetes, what does that mean? Is it serious? My mother, she was sick for a long time before… Is it something I can fix?
DOCTOR: Those are very valid questions, Ms. Zicarelli. The blood work typically takes 24-48 hours to come back. The lab will contact me when the results are available, and I will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Regarding diabetes… it is a serious condition, but it is manageable. There are different types of diabetes, and the treatment depends on the type and severity. Many people live long, healthy lives with diabetes through lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, and medication if necessary. If you are diagnosed with diabetes, we will work together to create a treatment plan tailored to your needs. We’ll discuss dietary changes, exercise recommendations, and any medications that may be necessary. It’s important to monitor your blood sugar levels regularly and follow your treatment plan closely. We will address this step-by-step, Ms. Zicarelli. First, let's get the test results. Then, we can make an informed decision about the best course of action. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this moment?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all for now. Thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. I’m just a little worried, that's all. I’ll go to the lab right away. Hopefully, it ain’t nothin’ too serious. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Zicarelli. It’s perfectly understandable to be worried, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Take care, and have a safe trip to the lab. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
