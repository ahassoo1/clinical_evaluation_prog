DOCTOR: Alright, good morning. I'm Dr. Galena. So, Marquie, tell me – what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it's… breathing. It's been kinda hard lately. Like, I get really short of breath, even when I'm not doing much. It's… worrying me, you know? I don't really remember when it started, exactly. Just… gradually got worse, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing difficulties… gradually worsening. Right. And you said even with minimal exertion?
PATIENT: Yeah, exactly. Like, walking up the stairs… even just talking sometimes feels like a lot. My wife keeps telling me I sound winded. I work… well, I work with water treatment plants, so there's a bit of walking involved, but it's not that much usually. It’s just… different now. I don't know if that makes sense. I really don't remember a specific moment it started, sorry.
DOCTOR: No, no, that makes perfect sense. It’s often gradual. And it's good you're noticing it. We'll figure it out. Hmm… any chest pain with the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Not really… not like a sharp pain, anyway. Sometimes it feels… tight? Like a pressure, maybe? But it doesn’t come with the breathing trouble every time. It’s hard to explain. It’s just… uncomfortable. I haven't really thought too much about why it's happening, just that it is. Sorry if I'm not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: No, no, you're perfectly fine. It's good you're describing what you feel, even if it's hard to pinpoint. Tightness…okay. And is this tightness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, definitely. It’s not… always there. Some days are better than others, you know? Like today, it's not bad right now, but I was feeling it more yesterday when I was… doing some stuff around the house. I just… I don’t know. It’s just weird. Honestly, I haven’t been sleeping great either, if that matters? I get kinda… restless. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent tightness, better some days than others, and some trouble sleeping. Restlessness… yes, that can certainly be related. Let's see... have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling…? Hmm. I… honestly, I haven’t really looked. My wife usually notices those things. I don’t think so, though? I mean, I haven’t noticed anything. I'm pretty bad at remembering to check things like that. I work a lot, and I just… get tired. Sorry. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It can be. Swelling can sometimes indicate fluid buildup, which could be related to… well, a few things. Alright. Do you have any cough?
PATIENT: Cough…? Yeah, sometimes. It’s not a bad cough, really. More like… a tickle in my throat? I don’t cough much, but when I do, it’s usually… dry. Not much comes up. It's been going on for… a while, I guess. Like everything else, just kinda… gradually happening. I don’t really pay attention to it unless it’s bothering me, sorry. Is it bad that I don’t remember details very well?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It’s common to not remember every little detail. We’ll piece things together. A dry cough… okay. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: Uh, let me think… I don’t think so. Not that I remember, anyway. I haven’t really been to the doctor much. I usually just try to tough things out. My wife keeps telling me I should go more often. I don’t think I've ever been diagnosed with anything lung-related. I did have pneumonia once, a long time ago, when I was a kid, but that was in Venezuela. I'm not even sure if they really diagnosed it, it was just… a bad sickness. Sorry, I’m probably not being much help.
DOCTOR: Alright, childhood pneumonia in Venezuela… We'll make a note of that. And no other lung diagnoses as far as you know. Okay. Any history of heart problems in your family?
PATIENT: Heart problems…? Uh… my grandfather, on my mother’s side, he… he had something. I don’t remember exactly what, but my mom always said it was his heart. He passed away when I was young. And… I think my uncle had high blood pressure. That’s all I can really remember, sorry. It wasn't really talked about much. I really don't know much about it. Is that helpful? I feel bad not remembering more.
DOCTOR: It is helpful. Every little bit helps. Okay. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, sir. Nothing at all. I don't really like taking pills if I can avoid it. I haven't needed to, really. Just… try to rest when I need to. I don’t like feeling… medicated, if that makes sense? I know it sounds silly, but I prefer to just deal with things. Is that… bad? I really don’t know what I’m doing here. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright. Many people feel that way. No medications currently. Now, do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Uh… not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I mean, I get mosquito bites like everyone else, but nothing serious. My wife always asks me that, and I always tell her no. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Is that… useful? I’m sorry I'm not being very specific. I'm just trying to remember what she asks me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs and heart, if that's okay. I’m also going to check your oxygen levels with a little clip on your finger. Then we can discuss what might be going on and potential next steps. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… good. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just… try to be quick, if that’s okay? I have… things to get back to. But yeah, go ahead. Just let me know if it’s going to hurt. I’m not good with… pain. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Of course. It won’t hurt at all. Just a quick listen.
PATIENT: Okay… Just… try to be gentle, please? I get a little… nervous. And sorry if I fidget. It's just… a weird feeling.
DOCTOR: Of course. Completely understandable. Just relax. Alright, take a nice, deep breath in… and out… again… good. Hmm… Okay, I'm hearing some… wheezing. Not terribly pronounced, but it's there. And your oxygen saturation is… 94%. That’s within normal limits, thankfully, but not optimal. Heart sounds are… regular. No murmurs that I detect. Okay. So, the wheezing suggests some airway narrowing. The tightness you're feeling, along with the dry cough and your history… It could be a number of things. We need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Investigate…? What does that… mean? Like… tests? I really don’t like tests. I get… anxious. And I don’t have insurance, so… I don’t know if I can afford a lot of tests. Sorry. Is it… bad? What’s going on? I'm getting really worried now.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. It's perfectly normal to be anxious about tests and costs. Let's not jump to conclusions. "Investigate" just means figuring out why you’re feeling this way. The most likely possibilities, based on what you’ve told me, are asthma, bronchitis, or even something like allergies. To narrow it down, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to rule out anything serious. And I’d like to do a spirometry test – that’s just a breathing test to see how well your lungs are functioning. As for the cost… I’m aware you’re uninsured. Let me see what options we have. We may be able to find a facility with a lower cash price for the X-ray. And sometimes there are assistance programs available. I’ll have my nurse look into that for you. We can also discuss a potential trial of an inhaler to see if that helps alleviate your symptoms. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An inhaler…? That… doesn’t sound so bad. A trial… I guess. And you'll help me with the cost? That would be… amazing. I really appreciate that. I don’t know what I’d do without help. The X-ray… it’s just… I don’t like being stuck in those machines. And the breathing test… does it hurt? Is it… scary? Sorry. I’m probably being a pain. I just… get really worked up.
DOCTOR: You're not being a pain at all. It's perfectly okay to be anxious. The inhaler is just a puff of medication to open up your airways. It's very safe. As for the X-ray, it's quick. You'll just stand still for a few seconds while the machine takes a picture. It doesn't hurt at all. And the breathing test, spirometry… you just breathe into a tube. It’s a little tiring, but it doesn't hurt either. My nurse will explain everything in detail before we do anything, and you can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. Let me write up the orders for the X-ray and spirometry, and I'll have my nurse, Maria, come in and discuss the costs and schedule everything for you. She’s very good at explaining things. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Maria… okay. That sounds… good. If she’s good at explaining things, that would be… amazing. I really appreciate you not making fun of me for being scared. And for helping with the costs. I don't know what I'd do without… okay. Yes. That sounds… okay. Just… please tell Maria I get really nervous easily. And… maybe if she explains it slowly? Thank you, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marquie. We'll take things at your pace. Maria is excellent, and I'll make sure she knows to explain everything slowly and to address any concerns you have. I'll go ahead and put in the orders for the tests. She'll be in shortly. In the meantime, try to relax. Deep breaths. And if you start feeling particularly anxious, just let Maria or me know. We're here to help.
PATIENT: Okay… Thank you, Doctor. I… I think I can do that. Just… slow and steady, right? Thank you.
DOCTOR: Exactly. Slow and steady. .
