DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Aslan. My name is Dr. Kalinski, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Jailenne. Well, I've been getting these chills, and it's a bit annoying, honestly. It's not like a fever chill, just… cold. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Jailenne. It’s good to meet you as well. I understand you've been experiencing chills that come and go – not associated with a fever, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. No fever at all. Just…brrr, suddenly cold, then okay again. It's been happening for maybe…a week now? It's hard to say exactly, I haven’t really kept track. But definitely over a week.
DOCTOR: Okay, over a week of intermittent chills. And are these chills accompanied by any other symptoms – perhaps sweating, muscle aches, fatigue, a cough, or anything else you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. No sweating, and my muscles don't ache. I have been a little tired, now that you mention it, but honestly, who isn’t tired these days? I haven’t coughed, no. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose a couple of days ago, but it’s gone now. Nothing major, really. It's mostly just the chills.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, intermittent chills, a little fatigue, and a brief episode of nasal congestion, but no fever, muscle aches, or cough. Have you noticed if anything seems to trigger these chills – a certain time of day, being in a specific location, or after doing a particular activity?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I don't think so… not that I’ve noticed, anyway. It doesn’t seem to be worse at any particular time. It happens inside, outside… I was gardening yesterday and felt one then, so being warm definitely doesn't stop it. I honestly can't see a pattern. It just…happens. Is that helpful? I feel like I'm not being very good at explaining this.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Jailenne. It’s often difficult to pinpoint the cause. The fact that you haven't been able to identify a specific trigger is helpful information. Now, to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. Um… I don’t have any major health problems, I don’t think. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, and I broke my wrist once, but that’s about it. I see a gynecologist regularly, and my last check-up was good. I was divorced a few years ago, and that was stressful, but I'm doing okay now. I have private insurance, so I go when I need to. I haven’t been hospitalized or anything like that. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is very helpful, Jailenne. No significant medical history, tonsillectomy in childhood, a broken wrist, and routine gynecological care – all good to know. And you’ve mentioned a past stressful life event. Are you currently experiencing significant stress in your life?
PATIENT: Not like that stress anymore, thankfully. The divorce was rough, but things have calmed down a lot. Work can be a little busy sometimes, you know, health education… always trying to get people to listen! But it’s nothing major, it’s not keeping me up at night or anything. Just… regular life stress, I guess. I eat pretty healthy, and I try to get some exercise when I can. Nothing intense, mostly walking.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy lifestyle with some regular life stress. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes I take ibuprofen if I have a headache, but that's it, really. No prescriptions or anything regular. I try to avoid taking too much medication if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just a daily multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, touched everything… I’m pretty sure I'm not allergic to anything. No hives, no breathing problems, nothing. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. Is that a relief for you? I know allergies can be serious.
DOCTOR: It is a relief, Jailenne, thank you for letting me know. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, autoimmune disorders, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… My mom has high blood pressure, and she takes medication for it. My dad had some issues with his knees when he got older, arthritis I think, but nothing serious. My grandmother on my mom's side had diabetes, I think type 2. And my uncle on my dad's side… he had cancer a few years ago, but he’s doing okay now, he’s in remission. Nothing else really stands out, honestly. We're a pretty healthy bunch, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of high blood pressure, arthritis, diabetes, and cancer. That’s helpful to know. Now, Jailenne, I would like to perform a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Sounds good. What will you be doing? Just so I know what to expect.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll start by checking your vital signs – your temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. I’ll also take a look in your ears, nose, and throat, and feel your lymph nodes. Finally, I'll do a quick neurological assessment, checking your reflexes and balance. It should only take a few minutes. Let’s begin with your temperature.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… thorough! Sounds good. Go ahead. I'm ready. Hopefully, I don't have a fever, haha.
DOCTOR: Your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, which is within the normal range. Blood pressure is 122/78, pulse is 72 beats per minute, and your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. All within normal limits. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears appear normal, no signs of infection. Nasal passages are clear. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Lymph nodes are not enlarged. Reflexes are normal, and your balance appears stable. Based on my examination, there are no obvious signs of infection or other acute illness. However, these intermittent chills, even without other symptoms, are concerning. It’s difficult to pinpoint the cause without further investigation.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s… good to know, I guess? No obvious signs of anything wrong is always a relief. So, what do we do now? What could be causing the chills if everything seems normal? I'm just worried it could be something serious. Is it maybe a vitamin deficiency? Or… something else? I really don't want to be sick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Jailenne. It's good that the physical exam didn't reveal anything immediately alarming, but that doesn’t mean we dismiss your symptoms. Intermittent chills can be caused by a variety of factors. While a vitamin deficiency is a possibility, so are other things. Some possibilities include a mild viral infection that isn’t fully manifesting with other symptoms yet, fluctuations in hormone levels, or even stress affecting your body’s temperature regulation. Less commonly, they could be a sign of a more underlying condition, though given your otherwise normal examination, that’s less likely. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood work. A complete blood count will help rule out infection or anemia. We'll also check your thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and electrolytes. This should give us a better understanding of what’s going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood work is probably a good idea. I'd rather know what's going on, even if it's something simple. Thyroid… is that serious if it's off? I keep hearing about thyroid problems. Where will I go to get the blood drawn? And how long will it take to get the results? I hope it doesn't take too long, I don't like being in limbo.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable concern, Jailenne. Thyroid problems can range from mild to more significant, but they are usually very manageable with medication if needed. We're checking to rule it out as a cause for your chills, and if anything is off, we will discuss treatment options thoroughly. You can have the blood drawn at the lab located just across the parking lot here at the clinic. They’re open until 5 PM today, and you don’t need an appointment. I’ll send the order electronically to them now. The results typically come back within 2 to 3 business days. I will have the nurse contact you as soon as they are available. We can then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and create a plan of action. In the meantime, continue to monitor your symptoms. If you develop a fever, severe fatigue, muscle aches, or any other concerning symptoms, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions about these next steps?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds good. Two to three business days… I can manage that. And just across the parking lot, perfect. I will go do that after this. And I’ll keep an eye out for any new symptoms, definitely. No, I think that covers it. Thank you, Doctor Kalinski. You've been very helpful and reassuring. I feel a little better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood draw? Like, should I fast or anything?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jailenne. I'm glad I could ease your concerns. Yes, good question. For this particular blood work, it's best to fast for 8 to 12 hours beforehand. This means no food or caloric beverages. You can drink water. So, if you're able, try to avoid eating anything after about 8 PM tonight. That will ensure the most accurate results. The lab technician will give you specific instructions as well, but it's good to be prepared. Do you have a copy of the lab order?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s good to know. I'll definitely fast. No problem. I can do that. And yes, please, a copy of the lab order would be great, just so I have it with me. Thank you again for everything, Doctor. I think that's all for now. I’ll go get the blood work done tomorrow morning, then.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here you are. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I hope everything goes smoothly with the blood draw, and I look forward to discussing the results with you. Have a good rest of your day, Jailenne.
