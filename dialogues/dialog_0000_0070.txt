DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Yes. New here, you see. Just… checking. Doctor, yes? Pinky, you said? Small town, this is. Not like Moscow, not at all. I do makeup, for… plays. And things. Just want to make sure everything is… okay. Old age, you know? Everything gets… loose.
DOCTOR: "Loose," alright. Well, that's… vague. I'm Dr. Batara, yes. And while I appreciate a good play, we need to be a bit more specific than "everything gets loose" if I’m going to help you. Are you experiencing any particular symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… a cold? No cold. Just… things. My back, maybe. A little ache. And… sometimes I forget things. Not important things, mostly. Like… what I had for breakfast. Or… names. Not your name, of course. You told me. Pinky. A good name. Very… round. Is that a symptom? Forgetting?
DOCTOR: Right. So, back pain and some memory lapses. And you’re concerned about whether forgetting breakfast is a symptom. It can be, Mr. Szmyd, but we need to figure out what's causing it. Let’s start with the back pain. Where exactly is it aching?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… here. Lower part. Not high up. Mostly when I bend. You know, to… apply the glitter. For the ballerinas. They like a lot of glitter. Makes them shine. It’s… work, you see? Bending and… twisting. Old age, again. Is glitter bad for the back?
DOCTOR: Glitter isn't generally bad for the back, Mr. Szmyd. It’s the bending and twisting that’s the concern. And how long have you been having this pain?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Years, maybe? Hard to say. I’ve always bent. Always twisted. It comes and goes. Sometimes it's just a little… nudge. Other times… …a bit more. But I can still work. I need to work. Ballerinas need glitter!
DOCTOR: Alright. And does the pain radiate anywhere?
PATIENT: Radiate? Like… sunshine? No, not sunshine. It stays… here. Sometimes a little down the leg, maybe. But not always. Mostly just… here. It's a dull ache, you see? Not sharp. Not like when I cut myself with the… scissors. That’s a sharp pain.
DOCTOR: Right. Dull ache in the lower back, occasionally radiating down the leg. No sharp pain unless you injure yourself. And you said you’ve been experiencing this for years?
PATIENT: Years, yes. Many years. Before… before the divorce. She didn’t understand the glitter. Said it got everywhere. A mess, she said. But the ballerinas loved it. Women. They don’t understand the important things. But the back… the back is just old. Everything gets… tired.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, with all due respect, your… personal life isn't relevant to your medical concerns. We need to focus on the pain. Now, regarding your memory lapses, you mentioned forgetting things like breakfast or names. Has this been getting worse lately?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm. Maybe. Hard to say. I always forget things. It's not new. Just… more things, perhaps. Like where I put my glasses. Or… what day it is. Is today Tuesday? No, Wednesday? You said August… the second? Everything is a bit… blurry, you see?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just do a few quick tests, okay?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh. Yes. Fine. Whatever you need. I used to be very good at tests. In school. A long time ago. Everything is… different now. Not so sharp. But I can still hold a brush. Very steady hands for applying… you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but not significantly. Your gait is…stable, but a bit slow. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions. Can you tell me the year?
PATIENT: The year? Oh. Let me think… Is it… 2022? No, no. That was… the trouble with the cat. Is it still the same year? Everything feels… mixed up. Is today your birthday?
DOCTOR: No, today is not my birthday, Mr. Szmyd. It's August 2nd, 2025. And you’re unsure of the year?
PATIENT: 2025? Oh. Yes. That’s right. 2025. It’s… hard to keep track. So many things happening. The ballerinas, the glitter, the… divorce. And now… this. Everything feels… far away. Like a dream.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam I’ve conducted, I’m concerned about possible cognitive impairment. This could be due to a number of factors, and we need to investigate further. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And I'd like you to undergo a more comprehensive cognitive assessment, perhaps with a neurologist. It’s important to get a clear picture of what’s going on. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Neurologist? Blood work… more tests? Oh. Yes. Fine. Whatever you think is best. But… what does this mean? Am I… sick? Will I still be able to do the makeup? The ballerinas… they need me. They love the glitter.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, I understand your concern. We’re not jumping to any conclusions. These tests are simply to help us determine the cause of your memory problems. It could be something relatively minor, or it could be something that requires treatment. As for the makeup and the ballerinas, we’ll address that once we have a better understanding of what’s going on. But right now, the most important thing is to get you the right diagnosis. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood, and I'll send a referral to Dr. Anya Petrova, a neurologist. She's very good. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Dr. Petrova… is she… Russian? It’s easier to explain things to someone who understands… things. The way we do things. And… will the tests take long? I have a performance on Friday. The Sugar Plum Fairy… she insists on extra glitter this year. It's very important.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Petrova is Russian. She’s fluent in both languages, so communication shouldn’t be a problem. As for the tests, the initial blood work will only take a few minutes. The cognitive assessment with Dr. Petrova will likely take an hour or so. We can schedule it as soon as possible, and I'll write a note explaining your performance on Friday so they can accommodate that if possible. But Mr. Szmyd, we need to prioritize getting this checked out, regardless of the schedule. Do you consent to the blood work and the referral to Dr. Petrova?
PATIENT: Consent? Oh. Yes. Yes, of course. Whatever you say. Blood work… tests… Russian doctor… It’s all a bit… much. But… if it means I can still do the makeup… still see the ballerinas… then yes. Yes, I consent. Just… please be quick. The Sugar Plum Fairy is very demanding.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly to draw your blood. And I’ll have the referral to Dr. Petrova’s office faxed over immediately. She’ll contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, please try not to worry. We’ll figure this out. And Mr. Szmyd, try to get some rest. It’s important. .
PATIENT: .
