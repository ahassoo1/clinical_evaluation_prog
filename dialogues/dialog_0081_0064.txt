DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. I'm Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor Paulino. It’s nice to meet you. Well, my chest… it’s been hurting. Not all the time, you understand? But enough to worry me, so my husband, Ricardo, he made me come. It feels… tight, like someone is squeezing it.
DOCTOR: Tightness, alright. And how long has this been going on, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe two weeks ago? It comes and goes. Some days I don't feel anything, and other days… it’s there, especially when I walk up the stairs to my apartment. Three flights, you know? Not easy anymore!
DOCTOR: Three flights. And would you describe this pain as radiating anywhere – down your arm, to your jaw, perhaps your back?
PATIENT: No, no, it stays right here. Right in the middle. Not down my arm, not in my jaw, not my back. Just… here. It’s a funny feeling, like a heavy weight. It doesn't go away fast, either. Takes a little bit to feel better.
DOCTOR: Alright. And on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst pain imaginable, what number would you give this chest tightness when it’s at its worst?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Ten… that sounds awful! Hmm… I’d say maybe a six? It’s not unbearable, but it makes me stop what I’m doing. I have to sit down and catch my breath. It scares me a little, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A six. And has anything specific brought on these episodes?
PATIENT: Like I said, the stairs. Definitely the stairs. But sometimes… even when I’m just washing the dishes. Or after I eat a big meal. Not always, but those things seem to make it worse. It’s strange. I don’t eat anything bad, really. Mostly rice and beans, some chicken… you know, Colombian food!
DOCTOR: Colombian food… Right. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this chest tightness?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… sometimes I feel a little… breathless. Not always, but when the chest hurts, yes. And maybe a little bit of… sweatiness? Just a little. Nothing major. Oh! And sometimes my stomach feels… upset. Not sick, exactly, just… not right. Like indigestion, maybe. Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Breathlessness, some diaphoresis, and indigestion… We’ll get to the bottom of it, Ms. Chelberg. Now, let’s go over some of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Well, let me think. The doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high, so I take a little pill for that. Just one a day. And… oh! My knees, they bother me sometimes. Arthritis, he said. But that’s it, really. Nothing else that I know of. I haven't been to the hospital for anything serious in a long, long time.
DOCTOR: Hypertension… alright. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the pill for your blood pressure, Ms. Chelberg?
PATIENT: No, sir. Just the one. A little white pill. Ricardo helps me remember to take it every morning. He’s very good that way. I don't like taking too many pills, you know? They make me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I eat everything! Well, almost everything. I don't like cilantro, but that’s a taste thing, not an allergy. Ricardo laughs at me because I pick it out of all the food. But no, nothing I’m allergic to. I’ve never had a reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Chelberg, before we proceed, I need to ask about your family history. Are there any instances of heart disease, stroke, or other serious medical conditions in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My father… he had a bad heart. He was very sick when he was older. He had to go to the hospital a lot. And… my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had a stroke, I think. Years ago. It was very sad. But that’s all I really know. My family… we don’t talk about these things much. It makes people sad, you know?
DOCTOR: History of heart disease and stroke… Alright. Now, Ms. Chelberg, let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, no! I don’t smoke. Never have. And I don't drink alcohol either. It makes me feel dizzy. And no… definitely no drugs. I’m a good Colombian woman! I drink a lot of water, though. And I love to dance! But not so much lately, with this chest pain…
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Chelberg, it sounds like you’ve had this chest tightness for about two weeks, exacerbated by exertion and sometimes after meals. We’ve covered your medical history, allergies, family history, and social habits. Now, I’m going to need to perform a physical examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I just want to know what’s wrong. It worries me, you know? This chest pain… it’s not normal, is it?
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a seat here. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your extremities. Please remove your shirt and bra for the examination.
PATIENT: Oh. All of it? Even… up here? It feels a little… strange. But… if you need to, Doctor, I will. Just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Chelberg, I need a complete examination to assess your condition properly. It's necessary. I will attempt to be as quick and thorough as possible.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I am ready. But please… be gentle. It feels… vulnerable.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Chelberg. I’m hearing a slight murmur. It’s not particularly loud, but it’s present. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… Good. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles detected. Blood pressure is elevated – 148 over 92. Pulse is regular but slightly rapid – 88 beats per minute. No edema noted, capillary refill is normal. I'm also noting some mild tenderness to palpation in your chest, but no obvious masses or abnormalities. Alright, Ms. Chelberg. Now I'd like to order some additional tests.
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds… serious. A murmur? What does that mean, Doctor? And my blood pressure… is that very bad? Tests? What kind of tests? Will they hurt? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chelberg, please try to remain calm. A murmur simply indicates an abnormal sound during your heartbeat. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it requires further investigation. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which can be managed with medication and lifestyle changes. As for the tests, I'm ordering a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, an EKG to assess your heart's electrical activity, and a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying lung issues. The blood tests will involve a small needle prick, but it's usually quick and relatively painless. The EKG is non-invasive – we’ll simply attach some electrodes to your chest. The chest X-ray is also non-invasive – you’ll simply stand in front of a machine. They are standard procedures, Ms. Chelberg. It’s all quite routine.
PATIENT: Okay… okay. Blood tests… electrodes… X-ray… It sounds like a lot. But… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, I will do them. I just… I get nervous. Needles… and machines… When will I get the results? And… will they tell me what’s wrong? Will I need… surgery?
DOCTOR: Ms. Chelberg, please. You are being unnecessarily anxious. The results will typically take 24 to 48 hours. I will review them thoroughly and discuss them with you in detail. As for surgery, it is far too early to even consider that possibility. We need to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms before discussing any invasive procedures. The purpose of these tests is to gather more information, not to immediately jump to conclusions. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule the EKG and chest X-ray. I’ll see you again in a few days to discuss the results. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Just… when the nurse comes… could you… could you be here? Just… while they do the blood test? I don’t like needles. It would… make me feel better. Thank you, Doctor. For… trying to help.
DOCTOR: I have several other patients waiting, Ms. Chelberg. However… I can spare a moment to be present during the blood draw. It's a simple procedure, and I assure you, the nurse is very skilled. But please, try to remain calm. The more anxious you are, the more difficult it will be. I will be right outside. I expect you to cooperate with the nurse. I'll see you shortly.
PATIENT: Okay… okay. I can do this. .
