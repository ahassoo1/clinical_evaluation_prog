DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lorana Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, well, I’ve been getting…flushed. My face gets very red, and sometimes my neck too. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, I think. Maybe a month? It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Withycombe. A month of intermittent flushing – that’s helpful to know. Could you describe what triggers this flushing, if anything?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. I don’t know if anything triggers it, exactly. It just…happens. Sometimes after I eat, maybe? But not always the same food. And sometimes when I’m talking to people, I notice. Not always, though. I’m a counselor, so I talk to people all the time. It’s strange. I really don’t know what causes it. It doesn’t hurt, just…feels warm, and looks red, I guess. My daughter, she says it looks bad.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite bothersome, especially when it occurs unpredictably. And it's good you've noticed it doesn't seem to be consistently linked to food or even speaking. To get a clearer picture, let’s delve a little deeper. Besides the redness and warmth, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the flushing?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the red face. No…sweating, or dizziness, or anything like that. Just red. And warm. Sometimes my heart feels a little…fast, but I don't know if that's from being nervous about the red face, you know? I don't get headaches or anything. It’s just…embarrassing. My wife…she passed away last year, and she always said I blushed easily. But this feels…different. More than a blush.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about the loss of your wife, Mr. Withycombe. Grief can certainly manifest in unexpected ways, and it's understandable that you’re finding this new experience unsettling, especially if it feels different from a simple blush. To help me differentiate potential causes, could you tell me a little more about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I don't really have much of a medical history. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life. I had the chickenpox when I was a kid, and I broke my arm once, but that's about it. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, nothing like that. I go to the dentist twice a year, and get a check-up…when I remember. My daughter keeps telling me to go more often. I don’t take any medicine, regularly. Just…sometimes for a headache, if it’s bad. Nothing special.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Withycombe. A relatively clean medical history is helpful. And thank you for mentioning the occasional headache medication; do you recall what you take for those headaches?
PATIENT: Um…let me think. It’s…I think it’s ibuprofen? The white pills. You can get them at the store, you know, like Advil or something. I don't take them very often, maybe once or twice a month if I have a bad headache. Just the regular kind, not the extra strength. I don't usually take more than two at a time.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the broken arm you mentioned?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Just the arm when I was a boy. They put a cast on it, and that was that. Never been in the hospital for anything else. I’ve always been lucky, I guess. I try to eat healthy, and I walk every day. Not much else, though. I mostly just…talk to people. For my job. Is this flushing…serious, Doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It’s good to hear you prioritize a healthy lifestyle, Mr. Withycombe. And it's perfectly reasonable to be concerned when experiencing a new symptom. It’s unlikely to be anything immediately life-threatening, but we do need to investigate to determine the cause and ensure appropriate management. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – perhaps heart problems, high blood pressure, skin conditions, or anything else that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a tricky one. My family…they’re mostly in India. I haven’t seen them in many years. My father…he had some kind of heart trouble, I think. He was older, though. And my mother…she had high blood pressure, I remember my daughter telling me that. And my sister…she has skin problems. Always getting rashes, and things like that. But I don’t know the details. We don’t talk much about health, you know? It's not really a custom. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Withycombe. Knowing about the heart trouble and high blood pressure in your father, and the skin issues in your sister gives me some valuable information. To complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean, exactly? I…I work as a counselor, like I said. I talk to people all day. I don’t really…go out much. Mostly just stay home, read, and watch TV. I used to go fishing with my wife, but…not anymore. I don’t drink alcohol, and I don't smoke. Never have. I don’t use any…illegal drugs, if that’s what you mean. I’m a pretty quiet person, mostly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Withycombe. That gives me a good understanding of your lifestyle. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine. I’m pretty lucky, I think. I remember my daughter asking me that once, and I told her the same thing. She worries a lot. Is this all you need to know, Doctor? Are you going to…test me? Or something? I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: It’s good to know you don't have any known allergies, Mr. Withycombe. And I understand your apprehension about needles; many people share that feeling. Now, to help determine the cause of your flushing, I would like to perform a brief physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a closer look at your skin. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds…okay. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And…as long as you don’t poke me too much. My blood pressure…is that what makes me flush? Is it high? My daughter keeps telling me I need to watch my salt intake. I do like pickles.
DOCTOR: We'll take things slowly, Mr. Withycombe. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Checking your blood pressure is a routine part of the exam, and it will help us rule out some potential causes. It’s possible the flushing is related to blood pressure, but it’s also could be several other things. Let’s start with your blood pressure, and then we’ll move on to a quick listen to your heart and lungs. Your blood pressure is 148/92. That's a little elevated. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. I’m also going to take a closer look at the areas where you experience the flushing. I notice some mild redness on your cheeks and neck. There are no visible rashes or other skin abnormalities. Your skin feels warm to the touch in those areas.
PATIENT: Okay. What does that mean, Doctor? Is my blood pressure the problem? Should I be taking medicine? My daughter…she’s going to be so worried. Is this serious? I just want to feel normal again. I don't like feeling red all the time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Withycombe. It’s natural to feel anxious when experiencing new symptoms and facing uncertainty. Your blood pressure is somewhat elevated, and that could be contributing to your flushing, but it’s not the only possibility. Given your symptoms – the intermittent flushing, the elevated blood pressure, and the family history of hypertension – there are a few potential causes we need to consider. These include essential hypertension, rosacea, and less commonly, certain hormonal imbalances or medication side effects. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some basic blood tests. These will help us assess your overall health, rule out any underlying medical conditions, and check for any potential imbalances. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh. I don’t like needles. But…if it will help, I guess. What kind of tests? Will they take a lot of blood? I get faint sometimes. My daughter…she always makes me go with her when she gets blood work done. She says I need someone to hold my hand. Will I need to fast before the tests? What if I forget?
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension about needles, Mr. Withycombe, and we’ll take every precaution to make the process as comfortable as possible. The blood draw will be relatively quick, and we’ll only need a small amount of blood. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will make sure you’re comfortable throughout the process. It’s perfectly alright to bring your daughter along for support; that’s a wonderful idea. The tests will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel – which checks your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar – and a thyroid stimulating hormone level to rule out any thyroid issues. You do need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw, meaning no food or sugary drinks. Water is fine. And if you happen to accidentally eat something before the test, please let the phlebotomist know. We may need to reschedule it. Here's a requisition form with detailed instructions. Do you have any questions about the tests or the fasting requirements?
PATIENT: Eight hours…that's a long time. I usually have a biscuit with my tea in the morning. And sometimes a little jam. And what if I wake up in the middle of the night and get hungry? My daughter…she’ll be so upset if I mess this up. And what will the tests show? Will they show something bad? Will I need to take pills for the rest of my life? I just want to feel normal again, Doctor. I really do.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to feel anxious, Mr. Withycombe. Many people find fasting challenging, and it’s understandable to worry about the results. Let’s take things one step at a time. You can have water, as I mentioned, and if you wake up hungry, try drinking a glass of water – that can sometimes help. The tests will give us valuable information about your overall health and help us identify the underlying cause of your flushing. It’s possible the tests will reveal something that requires medication, but that’s not necessarily the case. We’ll discuss the results thoroughly, and I’ll explain all your options – including lifestyle modifications, if appropriate – before making any decisions. We are simply gathering information at this point. Here's the contact information for the lab. They can answer any questions you have about the blood draw process. And please, don't hesitate to call my office if you’re feeling overwhelmed or have any concerns. We are here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No…I think that’s all. I just…I hope it’s not something bad. My daughter…she worries so much. She's always telling me to take better care of myself. I’ll try to remember to fast. Eight hours…it’s a long time. I guess I’ll call the lab and ask about…how long it will take. And I’ll try not to eat anything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I’m glad I could offer some reassurance. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day, and try to relax. .
