DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, Doc, I don’t have a lot of time for this. I just… I’m tired. Really tired. And I’ve been… eating dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I just… crave it. It’s weird, okay? I don’t know why I’m doing it. It started a few weeks ago, maybe a month. It’s just… happening.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re feeling fatigued and experiencing unusual cravings, specifically for dirt. While I appreciate your directness, Ms. Cantoran, it’s important to gather a bit more information to understand what’s going on. “Tired” is quite broad. Could you describe how tired you are?
PATIENT: How tired? What do you mean how tired? I mean… I sleep, and it doesn’t do anything. Like, I could sleep for ten hours and still feel like I ran a marathon. And it’s not just after a long day, it’s… always. Everything feels like… pushing through mud. I just don’t have the energy for anything. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: I see. Persistent fatigue despite adequate sleep is certainly concerning. And you mentioned this feeling of constantly “pushing through mud.” Is this fatigue accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… Let me think. My stomach… it’s been a little off. Not like, sick, just… unsettled. And I get headaches, but everyone gets headaches. Nothing major. Oh! And I've been… shorter-tempered, I guess. My neighbor's dog barks, and I just… want to yell. Which is stupid, I know.
DOCTOR: Unsettled stomach, headaches, and increased irritability… these are all potentially relevant. Now, regarding the dirt cravings – pica, as it’s clinically known – can you tell me what kind of dirt you’ve been consuming?
PATIENT: Ugh, “clinically known?” Look, it’s dirt, okay? Like, from the garden. Red clay mostly. It just… tastes good. I know it's weird. Don't judge me. It's… earthy. I mostly find it when I'm working in the yard. I don't go searching for it, it just… ends up in my mouth. I’ve been trying to stop, but it’s hard.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Cantoran, I am not here to judge. It’s my job to understand what is happening. Red clay from the garden… alright. Now, let’s move on to some more general questions. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, aside from this unusual craving?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat… when I remember. I don’t really feel hungry. Sometimes I’ll force myself to eat something, just because I know I should. But it doesn't really make a difference. Everything tastes… bland. Like cardboard. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Loss of appetite and a diminished sense of taste… these are further indicators. Ms. Cantoran, do you have any history of medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Not that I remember. I had… the usual kid stuff. Chickenpox, maybe? Nothing serious. My husband… he had high blood pressure, but that’s it. I haven’t been to a doctor in… years, honestly. I figured I was fine. Just… getting old, I guess.
DOCTOR: It’s important to have regular check-ups, Ms. Cantoran, regardless of how you’re feeling. Alright. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I don’t like taking pills. Never have. My husband tried to get me to take something for my nerves once, but I threw it out. I don’t trust that stuff. Just gives you more problems, in my opinion. No, nothing. I get by just fine on my own.
DOCTOR: No medications. Very well. Now, Ms. Cantoran, I'm going to need to perform a brief physical examination. This will help me assess your overall health and potentially identify any underlying causes for your symptoms. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Get it over with. Honestly, I’ve got things to do. But… hurry it up, okay? I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cantoran. Please have a seat. I’ll start by checking your vital signs. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 142 over 90. Not dramatically so, but something we will need to monitor. Pulse is 78, regular. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing sounds are clear bilaterally, though I do detect a slight murmur. Not alarming, but worth noting. Your abdomen is soft, but there's some tenderness in the lower quadrants. Are you experiencing any pain or discomfort at this moment?
PATIENT: Tenderness? Maybe a little. Like a dull ache. It comes and goes. I figured it was just… gas. Or something I ate. Honestly, I don't pay it much attention. It's not like it's sharp pain. More like… a pressure. I just ignore it.
DOCTOR: A dull ache… alright. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are diminished, but present. I also notice some pallor in your nail beds and a slight brittleness to your nails. Have you noticed any changes in your skin or hair recently?
PATIENT: Pallor? Brittleness? Look, I work with my hands. I’m a CNC programmer, okay? I’m always using tools and stuff. My hands are going to be rough. And I don’t really pay attention to my nails. I just… cut them when they get long. I haven’t noticed anything different about my skin, no. I mean, I’m getting older, it’s probably just… wrinkles.
DOCTOR: Very well. Based on the information you’ve provided and the findings of this brief examination – the fatigue, pica, loss of appetite, diminished taste, pallor, brittle nails, elevated blood pressure and diminished reflexes – I suspect you may be experiencing iron deficiency anemia. The pica, specifically craving dirt, is a classic symptom. However, we need to confirm this with some laboratory tests. I'll order a complete blood count, iron studies, and a basic metabolic panel. We should also consider a Vitamin D level and possibly a thyroid panel. Do you have any allergies to medications or contrast dyes?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I told you, I don’t take medications. Never have. And what’s a contrast dye? Look, I just want to know if I’m going to feel better, okay? Is this iron thing… serious? And how long is this going to take? I really don’t have time for a lot of tests.
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, I understand your concerns and your limited time. However, accurate diagnosis is paramount. Iron deficiency anemia, if left untreated, can be serious, leading to complications such as heart problems and impaired immune function. The tests are relatively straightforward – a simple blood draw. It will take a few days to receive the results. In the meantime, I recommend we start you on an iron supplement. I will prescribe ferrous sulfate, 325mg, twice daily. Take it with orange juice to enhance absorption. And, while I understand your reluctance, I also recommend increasing your dietary intake of iron-rich foods - lean meats, leafy green vegetables, fortified cereals. Are you able to tolerate iron supplements?
PATIENT: Ugh, pills. Really? Okay, fine. But if they make me sick, I'm stopping. And I don’t eat a lot of meat. Never have. Too… heavy. I mostly eat… toast. And sometimes soup. And I don't like orange juice. Too sweet. Look, Doc, this is already a lot. Can’t I just… try to eat more toast?
DOCTOR: Ms. Cantoran, while I appreciate your willingness to try, toast alone will not be sufficient to address a potential iron deficiency. Ferrous sulfate can sometimes cause gastrointestinal upset – nausea, constipation – but these side effects can often be mitigated by starting with a lower dose and gradually increasing it. We can also explore alternative formulations, such as liquid iron, if the pills are poorly tolerated. I'm going to prescribe a lower dose of ferrous sulfate initially, 162mg twice daily, and we will monitor your response. I will also order a stool test to rule out any underlying causes of iron loss. I strongly advise you to follow these recommendations. If your symptoms worsen or if you experience any severe side effects from the iron supplement, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? Look, I just want to feel normal again. Is this going to work? And how long before I stop craving dirt? Honestly, that’s the part I’m most embarrassed about. It’s… undignified. I’ve got a granddaughter coming to visit next month. I don’t want her to see me… eating dirt.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Cantoran. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel embarrassed, and I assure you, this is a treatable condition. The duration of treatment will vary depending on the severity of your deficiency. It typically takes several months to replenish iron stores and alleviate symptoms. As your iron levels improve, the cravings should subside. In the meantime, I will schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks to review your lab results and assess your response to treatment. Here are the lab orders and the prescription for the ferrous sulfate. I've also included a handout with information about iron deficiency anemia and dietary recommendations. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No. I think that's it. Just… please, don't tell anyone about the dirt. That’s all I ask. Thank you, Doc. I hope this works. And… I’ll try the pills.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cantoran. Your privacy is paramount. Everything discussed here is confidential. I am optimistic that we can get you feeling better. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment.
