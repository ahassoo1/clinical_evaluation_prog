DOCTOR: Good morning, Kandy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. IUZZOLINO. It’s… good to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my waterworks, really. I've been having trouble… going. It’s just not as easy as it used to be, you know? Takes me a while and… it feels like I don’t quite empty everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Trouble with urination… it takes longer, and a sense of incomplete emptying. Hmm. Okay. And how long has this been going on, Kandy?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started, I’d say, maybe six or seven months ago? It was gradual at first, just a little bit harder each time. But the last month or so, it’s gotten noticeably worse. I remember because the lilac bushes were just blooming when I first noticed it was a bit… slower. I always pay attention to the lilacs. They’re my favorite.
DOCTOR: Lilacs are lovely. Six to seven months… gradual onset, worsening recently. Okay. And when you're trying to urinate, do you feel any pain or burning?
PATIENT: No, no burning at all, thank goodness. It’s not painful, exactly. Just… weak. Like the stream isn't very strong. It’s more effort than it used to be, if that makes sense? And sometimes, I have to go back a few times before I feel… relieved. Does that sound silly?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t sound silly at all, Kandy. A weak stream, increased effort, and needing to return to empty completely… those are all important details. Do you notice any dribbling after you finish urinating?
PATIENT: Yes, actually, now that you mention it. A little bit. Not a flood, mind you, just a few drops. Enough to… well, enough to bother me. I have to blot a bit when I finish. It’s not constant, but it happens more often now. I used to never have that problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, dribbling after urination. Good to know. And are you experiencing any difficulty starting the stream, or is it just the weakness and incomplete emptying once you get going?
PATIENT: Hmm… Starting isn’t usually a problem, no. It’s more… keeping it going steadily, and then, like I said, emptying everything. There's no real hesitation at the beginning, thankfully. It just feels… strained, you know? Like I have to push a little. Not a lot, but enough to notice.
DOCTOR: Alright, Kandy. So, we've got a weak stream, a sense of incomplete emptying, dribbling afterwards, and some strain. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: No, the color seems normal. And no blood, thankfully. It smells… well, it smells like urine, I suppose! Nothing unusual there. I haven’t noticed any foam or anything like that either. It's just the process that’s troublesome, not the liquid itself. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Kandy. Good. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any health problems that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago, but that healed up just fine. And I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, which is just part of getting older, I suppose. But nothing major, really. Oh, and I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for about ten years now. I take Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Kandy. Gallbladder removal, arthritis, and controlled high blood pressure with Lisinopril. Thank you. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just a daily vitamin, a multivitamin. And sometimes, when my knees are particularly bad, I take ibuprofen. Just over the counter, nothing special. But that’s it, really. Just the vitamin and the ibuprofen when I need it. And the Lisinopril, of course. I try to remember to take everything regularly. My daughter helps me with that sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, a daily multivitamin, and ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Never had one in my life. I can eat anything, take anything… well, almost anything! I have been lucky that way, I think. No reactions to any medications I’ve ever taken. It’s one less thing to worry about, really. I remember my cousin Elina was terribly allergic to penicillin… made her swell up like a balloon! I’ve always been thankful I didn’t have that problem.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Kandy. No known allergies. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… My father had diabetes, type 2, I believe. And my mother had high blood pressure, like me. My brother, he’s fine, as far as I know. No major illnesses on either side, really. Nothing about prostate problems, because, of course, that only affects the men! I remember my aunt Ona had some trouble with her kidneys when she was very old, but that was decades ago. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful, Kandy. Diabetes in your father, high blood pressure in your mother… Okay. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle… Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never smoked a day in my life! My mother always said it was terrible for your health, and she was right. I did, though, live with my husband for a number of years who smoked, so I’ve had plenty of secondhand smoke. But I never touched a cigarette myself. It always smelled so awful to me. And my daughter never smoked either, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Good, good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, I have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just red wine, a small glass. Maybe four or five times a week. It helps me relax. Nothing excessive, I assure you. I don't drink to excess, never have. Just a small glass with my food. My husband liked a good beer, but I always preferred wine. It’s a little treat for myself. Nothing more.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of wine a few times a week. And finally, about bowel movements. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh my. Well, now… Everything is pretty regular, if you must know. A bit… constipated sometimes, if I don't eat enough fiber. But nothing terrible. I try to eat my fruits and vegetables, you know? But it can be a little… slow sometimes. Nothing drastic, thankfully. It’s just… getting older, I suppose. Does that answer your question? I do use a little prune juice sometimes when needed! That helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional constipation, use of prune juice as needed. Thank you, Kandy. Alright. With your permission, I’d like to do a quick physical exam now. Just to listen to your abdomen, and I’ll need to do a brief neurological check, and then a digital rectal exam. This will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. It's standard practice in cases like this. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Well, goodness. A rectal exam, you say? Oh dear. I haven’t had one of those in… a very long time. I suppose if it’s necessary… I’ve always disliked those. But if you think it's important, then yes, I suppose. Just… please be gentle? And maybe tell me what you’re looking for? I do like to know what's happening. It just feels… invasive, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kandy. I understand your hesitation. It is a little unpleasant, and I apologize for that. And I will be as gentle as possible, I promise. I’m checking for any tenderness, masses, or anything unusual. It’s important to rule out other possibilities. It will only take a few moments. First, let me listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. And I’ll explain everything as I go along. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be good. Explaining things helps. Oh dear, getting old is not for the faint of heart! Just… take your time, please. And tell me what you’re listening for, like you said. It's always better to know, I think.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Kandy. I’m listening for any unusual sounds - any gurgling or blockage, and I’m feeling your abdomen gently for any tenderness or masses. Hmm… Everything feels relatively soft. I don’t feel any major tenderness here, which is good. And I hear normal bowel sounds. How about here?
PATIENT: No pain there, either. Just a little… uncomfortable, because I haven’t been lying down in a while. My arthritis flares up sometimes, you know? I think I’m getting old. Oh! That's a little sensitive, actually. Right… there. About two inches below my belly button. Not terribly painful, just… noticeable. It's not a constant pain, just when you press on it. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense, Kandy. Tenderness about two inches below your belly button. Thank you for letting me know. Now, I will perform a quick neurological check. Just to assess your reflexes and sensation. And then we will move on to the rectal exam, if you’re still comfortable. Everything appears normal so far. Your reflexes are good, and your sensation is intact. Now, for the last part of the exam… Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… not right now, I suppose. Just… hurry up, if you could? I really dislike this part. I always feel so… vulnerable. Is there anything I can do to make it easier? I should have worn my good underwear. Oh dear. It's just… awkward, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Kandy. I will be as quick and gentle as possible, I promise. You are not alone in feeling this way. The most important thing is to relax, if you can. Take some deep breaths. I’ll explain everything as I go, and let you know when I'm finished. And I will use plenty of lubricant. Okay. If you could just lie on your left side with your knees bent… and I’ll be right back. I want to make sure you are as comfortable as possible. I’ll be quick.
