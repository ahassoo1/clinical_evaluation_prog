DOCTOR: Hi Maribeth, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. Vanderwiele is the name. It’s… trouble breathing when I lie down, mostly. It’s been happening for… well, a few weeks now, I suppose. I’d like to get it sorted if we could. I don’t have a lot of time, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, Maribeth. A few weeks of trouble breathing when lying down… that’s good information to start with. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It feels… like something is pressing on my chest, mostly. Not pain, exactly. Just… heavy. And I have to… sort of prop myself up with pillows to get enough air. Three pillows, usually. It doesn’t bother me when I’m sitting or standing, only when I’m trying to sleep, or even just lie and rest. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Heavy chest, needing three pillows to breathe comfortably when lying down… okay. And has this been getting worse gradually, or did it start suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It started with just one pillow. Then two. Now three. It wasn't a sudden thing, no. More… a slow increase. I noticed it first around the middle of July, I believe. I remember because the petunias were blooming particularly well then.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset around mid-July, starting with one pillow and progressing to three… good detail, thank you. And besides the breathing trouble and the pillows, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Well, my ankles have been a little swollen lately. Not terribly, but… noticeable. And I've been a little more tired than usual, but at my age, who isn't? I don't know if that’s related. And… I have to get up once during the night to use the restroom. That’s newish, too. Perhaps a month or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, ankles swelling, increased fatigue, and getting up to urinate at night… those are all helpful things to know. Now, have you had any cough, wheezing, or chest pain at all with this breathing trouble?
PATIENT: No cough. No wheezing. And as I said, it's not pain. Just… a heaviness. A pressure. It feels… like there’s a weight on my chest. Not sharp, not burning, just… uncomfortable. It doesn't radiate anywhere. I do get a little breathless when I climb stairs, but I've always been a bit winded doing that.
DOCTOR: Alright. No cough, no wheezing, no radiating pain. Just heaviness and pressure, and some usual breathlessness with stairs. Let's move on to some general health questions. Do you have any known medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. Diagnosed about fifteen years ago. I take a pill for it. Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. Otherwise, no. No diabetes. My heart… the doctor said it was fine at my last check-up. That was… two years ago, I suppose. And I take Vitamin D, but that’s all. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with Lisinopril, and Vitamin D. Last check-up two years ago with a normal heart assessment. That's helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my gallbladder removed… oh, thirty years ago, at least. And I was in the hospital once when I broke my wrist. That was… a fall in the garden. But that was a long time ago. Nothing else. No other surgeries, no other hospital stays. I’m fairly healthy, considering.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal thirty years ago, wrist fracture. Nothing significant recently. Now, thinking about your family – are there any heart problems, lung problems, or other serious illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: My mother had high blood pressure, like me. And her brother… he had something with his heart. Congestive… something. He was a smoker, terribly so. My father was fine, as far as I know. No lung problems. And I don't recall any other serious illnesses in the family, to be honest. It wasn't something we talked about much.
DOCTOR: Okay. Family history of high blood pressure and a relative with heart problems, likely related to smoking. And lastly, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I'm aware of, anyway. I eat everything. I take my pills without trouble. I haven't been stung by a bee in years. I think I'm quite fortunate, really. Is that all the questions? I'd like to know if we can start figuring out what’s going on now.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay, that's a lot of good information, Maribeth. Thank you for being so thorough. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and examine your ankles to see if there’s any swelling. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have an appointment later this afternoon. Just… be gentle, please. My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths in and out for me. Okay… I hear some slightly diminished breath sounds in the lower lobes of both lungs. And I detect a very faint crackling sound when you exhale. Your heart rate is a little elevated, and I do hear a slight murmur, though you mentioned it was previously noted. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 150/90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let me take a look at your ankles. I do notice some mild swelling in both ankles, primarily around the inner side. It's not pitting edema, but it is present. Okay, Maribeth. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam – the trouble breathing when lying down, the three pillows, the ankle swelling, the fatigue, and what I’ve heard with the stethoscope – it sounds like you may be experiencing heart failure. However, we need to do some further testing to confirm this.
PATIENT: Heart… failure? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Is there anything we can do? I don't feel… terribly ill, just tired and a little breathless. What sort of testing? And how long will that take? I really must be going soon. I hope it's nothing too complicated.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Maribeth. It is serious, but it’s also very manageable, especially when caught early. And to be clear, we haven’t confirmed anything yet – these are just initial suspicions. The testing will involve a few things. First, I'd like to order a chest X-ray to look at your lungs and heart size. Then, we’ll need a blood test called a BNP – that stands for B-type natriuretic peptide – which can help us assess how stressed your heart is. And finally, an electrocardiogram, or ECG, to check the electrical activity of your heart. The X-ray and ECG can be done right here in the clinic, and should only take about 20-30 minutes. The blood test will need to be sent to the lab, and the results usually come back within a few days. Would you be comfortable with that plan?
PATIENT: Twenty minutes? A few days for the blood test? That's… acceptable. I suppose. As long as it doesn't involve anything painful or… intrusive. And will the results tell us what to do? If it is this… heart failure, what happens then? I do worry about taking more pills. I take enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No pain involved, and nothing intrusive at all. Just a quick X-ray and a simple blood draw. If the tests do confirm heart failure, the treatment usually involves medication to help your heart pump more efficiently, reduce fluid buildup, and manage your blood pressure. We’ll start with a low dose and monitor you closely to minimize any side effects. There are several different medications we could use, and we'll find the one that works best for you. Lifestyle changes – like reducing salt intake and getting regular exercise – are also very important. And yes, it might involve adding another pill or two, but it’s about improving your quality of life and preventing things from getting worse. We'll also discuss dietary modifications and activity levels once we have a clearer picture. I’ll get the orders for the X-ray and blood test sent to the lab right away. The technician will come in shortly to get the blood draw, and then we’ll do the X-ray. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… try not to give me too many pills, please. And I do try to watch my salt. I don’t add any to my food, and I’m careful about what I eat. But… I do enjoy my gardening. Will I be able to continue with that? It's my only real pleasure these days.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. We’ll certainly try to keep the number of medications to a minimum. And as for your gardening, that’s excellent exercise, and it’s good for your mental health, which is very important. We may need to adjust the intensity of it, but I don’t foresee you having to give it up entirely. We'll discuss appropriate activity levels once we have the test results and a clearer understanding of your condition. We’ll work with you to maintain your quality of life, not restrict it. Let's get these tests done, and then we can discuss everything in more detail. I’ll have the technician come in now for the blood draw. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes… that’s fine. Just… be quick, if you would. And try not to poke me too much. I bruise easily, you know. Goodness. This is all rather… unsettling. I just want to get back to my garden.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll let the technician know to be as gentle as possible. And I completely understand your apprehension. It is unsettling, but we'll take it one step at a time. I'll be right here to explain everything and answer any questions you have along the way. "Could we please have a phlebotomist to room three for a blood draw, please?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. I suppose I just need to… wait now, then. And try not to worry too much. Although that’s easier said than done, isn’t it? I do wish this hadn’t happened. It was so much simpler before. Still. I suppose these things happen. A person gets old, and things start to… fail. It’s the natural order of things.
DOCTOR: It’s completely natural to feel worried, Maribeth. And you’re right, things do change as we get older. But that doesn’t mean we can’t continue to live full and enjoyable lives. And remember, we haven’t even confirmed anything yet. We’re just gathering information at this point. In the meantime, is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm alright. Just… sitting. Thinking. I suppose. Thank you for the chair. And for… not rushing me, Doctor. Some doctors are so… abrupt. You've been very patient. I do appreciate that. I haven’t been to the doctor much in recent years. I try to avoid it, if I can. It’s never good news, is it?
DOCTOR: I’m glad I could make you feel a little more comfortable, Maribeth. It’s important to me that my patients feel heard and understood. And you’re right, doctor’s visits aren’t always pleasant. But sometimes, a little information and early intervention can make all the difference. We’ll take things slowly, and I’ll explain everything clearly, every step of the way. And if you ever feel rushed or confused, please don't hesitate to speak up. My goal is to help you feel empowered and in control of your health. Here comes the phlebotomist now. They're very skilled and gentle. Just relax, and let them do their job. And remember, I'm right here if you need anything.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose I’m as ready as I’ll ever be. It’s just… needles. I’ve never liked them. But I trust you. And I want to know what’s going on. Just… tell them to be quick, will you? And perhaps don’t look at me while they’re doing it. I get rather faint, you see. Goodness. This is… a bother. But I suppose it has to be done.
DOCTOR: “Hi Sarah, this is Maribeth. She's a little nervous about needles, so if you could be as quick and gentle as possible, that would be great. And Maribeth tends to get a little faint, so maybe try not to look directly at her while you're drawing the blood?
