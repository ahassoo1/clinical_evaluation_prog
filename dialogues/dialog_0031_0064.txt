DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chelberg. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor! It’s nice to meet you too. My chest… it’s been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me, you know? Like a… a tight squeezing. It started maybe three days ago.
DOCTOR: I see. A tight squeezing in your chest that started about three days ago. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Okay. Well, it’s not a sharp pain, more like… someone is hugging my chest really hard. And it comes and goes. When I’m just sitting, it’s okay. But if I walk, or even climb the stairs to get to my apartment… it gets worse. It goes away if I rest. Does that make sense? I hope I’m explaining it right.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Chelberg. A squeezing sensation that’s brought on by exertion and relieved by rest. That's very helpful information. To get a better understanding, can you tell me where exactly in your chest you feel this sensation?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s… right here. Not on the side, not in my back… right here. Sometimes it feels like it goes up a little, into my throat almost. But mostly right here. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is important. Feeling it centrally, and potentially radiating up towards your throat… that helps us narrow down the possibilities. And on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being no pain at all and 10 being the worst pain you've ever experienced, what number would you give this pain at its worst?
PATIENT: Oh, a number… okay. Hmm. It’s not terrible terrible, you know? Like, I’m not falling over. But it’s enough to make me stop and catch my breath. I would say… maybe a 6? When it’s really bad, a 6. Usually it’s more like a 3 or 4. Does that make sense? I don't like numbers much.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine, Ms. Chelberg. A 6 at its worst, and usually a 3 or 4… that's very helpful. And it’s good you're able to describe it even without relying on numbers. Now, have you noticed anything that specifically triggers this pain besides exertion, like walking or stairs?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not really… but maybe when I get upset. Like, if my grandson calls and tells me he's in trouble… that makes it worse. It feels like… my chest gets tight and I get short of breath. It’s like the worry makes it worse. And… sometimes after I eat a big meal, maybe? But I’m not sure about that. It could just be because I’m full!
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially triggered by emotional stress, like upsetting news, and possibly after a large meal. We'll keep those possibilities in mind. Now, I'd like to ask about some other symptoms. Have you been experiencing any shortness of breath even when you're not exerting yourself?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. Not all the time, but… especially at night. I wake up feeling like I can't get a good breath. I have to sit up in bed. It doesn't last long, just a few minutes, but it’s scary. It’s happened… maybe three times in the last week? I thought it was just the heat, you know? It’s been so warm.
DOCTOR: I understand. Shortness of breath, particularly at night and requiring you to sit up, is important to note. And you attributed it to the heat, which is reasonable. Now, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, a little. My daughter keeps telling me I should put my feet up. She says they look puffy. It’s worse at the end of the day, after I’ve been on them all day. I don’t think much of it, to be honest. Old age, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s good you mentioned that, Ms. Chelberg. Swelling in the ankles, especially at the end of the day, is also a helpful piece of information. Now, before we move on to some medical history questions, I want to ask about any other symptoms you may be experiencing, even if they don’t seem related to your chest pain. Any nausea, dizziness, sweating, or palpitations—feeling like your heart is racing or fluttering?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes I feel a little dizzy when I stand up too fast, but I always thought that was just from getting old. And… I do get a little sweaty sometimes, especially when it’s warm. But nothing terrible. No nausea, and my heart feels… normal, I think. It beats like it always has.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional dizziness when standing and some sweating, but no nausea or palpitations. That’s helpful. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or any heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. The doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high, so he gave me a pill for it. I take it every day. And… he said my cholesterol was a little high too, but he said not to worry about it too much. He didn’t give me anything for that. And no diabetes, thank goodness. My mother had that, it was not a good thing. No heart problems that I know of… I’ve never had any tests for my heart before.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've been diagnosed with high blood pressure and have elevated cholesterol. You are currently taking medication for the blood pressure. And no known diabetes, and no prior heart tests. Now, what medications are you currently taking, and what dosages?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have it right here. This one is for my blood pressure, it’s called… Lisinopril? And I take 20 milligrams every morning. That’s all! Just the one. And I take a vitamin D pill sometimes, but not every day. I try to get sunshine when I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20 milligrams daily for your blood pressure, and occasional Vitamin D. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything! My daughter always worries about me trying new things, but I haven't had any allergic reactions. No problems with any medicines either. The doctor always asks, and I always say no.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Chelberg. No known allergies. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, maybe 30 years ago? And I was in the hospital when I broke my wrist a few years back, but that was just for a couple of days. Nothing serious! Mostly just old age things.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal many years ago and a brief hospitalization for a broken wrist. Now, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family… let me see. My mother had diabetes, like I said. And my father… he had a heart attack when he was in his 60s. It was not good. And my brother, he has high blood pressure too, just like me. And my sister, she has arthritis, but that's about it. Mostly just old age things, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of diabetes in your mother, heart attack in your father, and high blood pressure in your brother. That's helpful information. Finally, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, lifestyle… well, I live in an apartment with my husband. He’s good, but he gets tired easily. I mostly take care of things around the house. I don’t smoke, never have. I drink a little wine with dinner sometimes, maybe one glass. And I try to walk when the weather is nice, but it’s been so hot lately! I like to cook, and I love to spend time with my family, especially my grandson. He keeps me busy!
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Chelberg. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just be gentle, my bones aren’t what they used to be!
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Chelberg. Take some nice, deep breaths for me. Your heart rate is regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not loud, but it’s present. I'll note that in your chart. Your lungs sound clear, but there’s some mild wheezing on both sides. Do you have any history of asthma or chronic bronchitis?
PATIENT: Oh, wheezing? No, I’ve never been told I have asthma. And no bronchitis either. I do cough a little sometimes, especially in the mornings, but I always thought it was just a tickle in my throat. It’s not a bad cough, just… a little cough. Could that be it?
DOCTOR: It’s possible. Sometimes mild wheezing can be present without a formal diagnosis of asthma. We'll keep that in mind. Your blood pressure is 148/85. That’s a little elevated despite being on Lisinopril. Your pulse is regular, but it’s slightly weak, and I do feel some mild swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. There is some tenderness to palpation in your sternal area. Okay, Ms. Chelberg. Based on what you've told me and my examination findings, I have a few thoughts. You’re experiencing chest pain consistent with angina – a squeezing sensation brought on by exertion and relieved by rest. The elevated blood pressure, mild wheezing, ankle swelling, and slight murmur are also important findings.
PATIENT: Angina? That sounds… scary. Is that bad? What does that mean? And what about my chest hurting? Will it get worse? I'm getting a little worried now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Ms. Chelberg. Angina isn’t necessarily immediately life-threatening, but it is a warning sign. It means your heart isn’t getting enough oxygen. The squeezing pain you’re feeling is caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. Think of it like this: your heart is a very hard worker, and it needs fuel to do its job. The arteries that supply that fuel are getting narrowed, making it harder for the heart to get what it needs, especially when it’s working hard – like when you exert yourself. We need to investigate further to determine the cause of this reduced blood flow. I’d like to order a few tests. First, an EKG to look at the electrical activity of your heart. Then, a blood test to check your cholesterol levels and rule out other possible causes. And finally, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to look at your lungs and heart.
PATIENT: Okay… tests. That sounds… okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel better. What does the X-ray do? And will the blood tests hurt? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: The chest X-ray is a quick and painless procedure. It uses a small amount of radiation to create an image of your lungs and heart, so we can see their size and shape and look for any abnormalities. It's similar to getting a photograph, but using X-rays instead of light. The blood tests will involve a small needle prick in your arm. It's usually a quick pinch, and most people don't find it very painful. We’ll send the sample to the lab for analysis. The results usually take 24 to 48 hours to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of treatment. In the meantime, I want you to avoid strenuous activity. If you experience chest pain, stop what you’re doing and rest. If the pain doesn’t go away, or if it gets worse, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. No more stairs, and rest if it hurts. And go to the emergency room if it doesn’t go away. No stairs… that’s going to be hard, my apartment is on the third floor. But I’ll manage. So… the tests first. Where do I go to get those done? And will my insurance cover them? I have Medicare. And… can someone help me get to the appointment? My husband isn’t very good at driving anymore.
DOCTOR: That’s right, tests first. The lab is located just down the hall, room 203. The receptionist will check you in, and they’ll draw the blood. The X-ray is in the radiology department, room 110. They will schedule that for you after the blood work. Regarding your insurance, Medicare should cover both the blood work and the X-ray. However, it's always a good idea to have your insurance card with you just in case. The receptionist at both departments can verify your coverage. As for getting to the appointment, do you have any family or friends who could accompany you?
PATIENT: My daughter, Elena, she could probably take me. She lives nearby. I’ll call her after this. Okay. So, lab first, then X-ray. And my daughter will help. Is there anything else I need to know before I go? Anything I should tell the people doing the tests? Or… anything I should do before the tests? Like, should I eat something? Or not eat something? I always get nervous before tests.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent that Elena can help. Regarding the tests, for the blood work, you don't need to fast beforehand – meaning you can eat and drink normally. However, please drink plenty of water beforehand to help make it easier to draw the blood. For the X-ray, you’ll need to remove any jewelry or metal objects from your chest and upper body. Just let the technicians know that you're nervous – they’re used to it and will do their best to make you comfortable. And please don't hesitate to ask them any questions you may have. I’m also going to give you a written summary of these instructions, and a list of warning signs to look out for. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I was very scared, but I feel a little better now. Knowing what’s going to happen makes a big difference. I’ll go find room 203 now. And I’ll call Elena. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Chelberg. I’m glad I could help ease your mind. Remember, if you experience any concerning symptoms, don’t hesitate to seek medical attention immediately. Please feel free to call the clinic if you have any questions after the tests. I wish you all the best, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
