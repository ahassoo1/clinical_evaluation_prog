DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Shely. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itchiness, you see? It’s been driving me a little crazy lately. All over, really. Not… not a rash, just itchy.
DOCTOR: I see. Itchiness all over, not associated with a rash. Can you tell me a bit more about when it started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… oh, maybe a month or so ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little annoying. But it’s gotten worse in the last week or so. Especially at night, it keeps me awake. I thought maybe it was the heat, we’ve been having such warm weather. But it hasn't gone away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been progressing over about a month, worsening in the last week, and is particularly bothersome at night. Do you find anything relieves the itching, even temporarily?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I've tried some lotion, you know, just regular lotion. And I took a couple of baths, but it doesn’t seem to help much. Sometimes, if I distract myself, it's not as bad, but it always comes back. It’s just… constant.
DOCTOR: I understand. Constant itching can be very distressing. And lotion hasn’t provided much relief. Now, have you noticed any changes in your skin besides the itchiness?
PATIENT: No, not really. It looks normal, I think. Maybe a little dry? But I always have dry skin, especially in the winter. Nothing red, no bumps, just… itchy. My daughter keeps telling me I should see someone, so here I am!
DOCTOR: That’s good of your daughter to encourage you to come in. It’s always helpful to have someone looking out for us. And you're right, if it’s affecting your sleep, it’s worth investigating. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor put me on some pills and it’s been okay for years now. I also had my gallbladder taken out a long time ago, but that’s it, really. Nothing major. Oh, and arthritis in my hands, but it’s just a little bit, you know? Nothing that keeps me from doing things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, currently managed with medication, a cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – in the past, and some arthritis in your hands. Do you happen to know what medication you are taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I usually just have the pharmacy refill it. Let me see… Ah, here it is. Lisinopril, 20 milligrams. I take one every morning.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Lisinopril 20mg daily. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. The kind for seniors, you know? Nothing fancy. I try to eat healthy, but I figure it can't hurt to have a little extra insurance. And sometimes I take Tylenol for my hands if they really bother me, but not very often.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a multivitamin and occasional Tylenol for your hands. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat all sorts of things, and I haven’t had any problems with bug bites or anything like that either. My mother always said I had a strong stomach!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother had diabetes, and her mother did too. My father had… well, he had a weak heart, I think. He didn’t take very good care of himself. And my brother has arthritis, like me, but much worse. He's had to have a few surgeries. That’s about all I can think of right now. We weren't big on talking about medical things when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s helpful to know about these things, even if the information is limited. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. My husband smoked, bless his soul, but I always told him to do it outside. I never wanted to start. I always thought it was a terrible habit. He quit years before he passed, thankfully.
DOCTOR: I'm glad to hear he was able to quit. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little wine with dinner sometimes, Doctor. A glass or two, maybe a couple of times a week. Nothing heavy. I enjoy a good glass of Merlot with my pasta, if you know what I mean. It's more for the enjoyment of it than anything else.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly. Now, tell me a little bit about your work and social life. Do you work?
PATIENT: Well, I used to be a political scientist. I taught at the university for almost forty years! I retired a few years ago, though. Now I mostly volunteer at the library and spend time with my daughter and grandchildren. I try to keep busy. It's good to have something to do, you know?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Staying active is very important. Now, just to complete the picture, have you experienced any recent changes in your life that might be causing stress or anxiety?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. My husband passed away about five years ago, and that was hard, of course. But I’ve adjusted, I think. My daughter and grandchildren keep me busy, and I have good friends. No major changes, no. I mean, life has its ups and downs, but nothing particularly stressful lately.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Cassimatis. That’s very helpful information. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll start by checking your vital signs, and then I'd like to take a look at your skin. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat here, we’ll get started. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 140 over 90, but that can be affected by a number of factors. Your pulse and respiratory rate are normal, and your temperature is within the normal range. As for your skin, I don't see any obvious signs of a rash or other dermatological issue. It appears somewhat dry, which could contribute to the itching. I’m listening to your lungs now. They sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your lymph nodes are also normal.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s good to know. My mother always had high blood pressure, so maybe it runs in the family. And yes, my skin is always dry, especially this time of year. So, what do you think is causing the itchiness, Doctor? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Ms. Cassimatis. Given your history and the examination findings, several possibilities come to mind. The itching could be related to dry skin, known as xerosis, which is common with age. However, persistent generalized itching can also be a symptom of underlying medical conditions, such as kidney disease, liver disease, thyroid problems, or even certain types of cancer – although those are less likely given your otherwise normal examination. It can also sometimes be a side effect of medications, though you’re only taking a multivitamin and Lisinopril, and itching isn’t a common side effect of either. To rule out any underlying medical causes, I'd like to order some blood tests. Specifically, I'd like to check your complete blood count, kidney function, liver function, and thyroid hormone levels. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it will help figure out what’s going on, I’m happy to have the tests done. I'd rather know for sure. So, what do I need to do? Do I need to fast beforehand? And where will I get the tests done?
DOCTOR: Excellent. You do not need to fast for these tests. They can be done at any local laboratory. I can provide you with a requisition form with the list of tests needed, and recommend a few labs nearby if you’d like. Once the results are back – usually within a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to moisturize your skin regularly, especially after bathing, and avoiding harsh soaps or detergents. I am also going to write you a prescription for an anti-itch cream, a topical corticosteroid, to help relieve your symptoms while we await the results. It’s a mild strength cream, and should provide some temporary relief. Use it sparingly, only on the areas that are itchy, twice a day. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Thank you. A cream for now sounds wonderful. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. Where can I pick up the prescription? Is it nearby? And you'll give me the form for the blood tests?
DOCTOR: Certainly. The prescription is being sent electronically to your preferred pharmacy. Do you use CVS, Walgreens, or another pharmacy?
PATIENT: I use CVS, on Elm Street. It’s just a few blocks from here, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Perfect. The prescription has been sent to the CVS on Elm Street. You should be able to pick it up within a few hours. Here is the requisition form for the blood tests. As I mentioned, you can go to any local lab, but I’ve included a list of recommended labs nearby with their addresses and phone numbers. Once you've had the tests done, please let the lab know to send the results directly to this clinic. Do you have any other questions for me today, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You've been very thorough and helpful. Thank you so much for taking the time to listen and explain everything so clearly. I feel much better knowing we’re getting to the bottom of this. I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions before your follow-up appointment. We’ll schedule that appointment as soon as the lab results are available. Have a good day, and I hope the anti-itch cream provides some relief.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. I will see you soon, then.
