DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I'm Dr. Annesley. Welcome to the clinic. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh, well, I'm here about getting surgery. Weight loss surgery, that is. My wife helped me set up the appointment. I don't... I don't really remember all the details, honestly. It's a pre-checkup, right? Before the actual surgery?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. This is a pre-operative evaluation. We need to make sure you're a good candidate for surgery and that we have all the necessary information. Don't worry about remembering everything; we’ll go through it together. First, let’s talk about why you’re considering weight loss surgery. Can you tell me a little about your weight history?
PATIENT: Hmm… weight history. That’s… a tough one. It feels like I've always been… bigger. I don’t really recall a time when I wasn’t. It’s been a problem for a while, I guess. I’ve tried dieting, on and off, you know? Nothing really sticks. My wife says it's affecting my health, which is why we’re looking into this. She's the one who really pushed for it. I just… get tired easily. And things are getting harder to do. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Kochubey. It sounds like this has been a long-term struggle, and it’s commendable that you’re taking steps to address it. And it’s great you have your wife’s support. To get a clearer picture, can you tell me roughly how much you’ve weighed at different points in your life?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. That’s… difficult. Numbers aren't my strong suit. I think… when I was younger, maybe in my twenties, I was around 180? Something like that. But then things started creeping up. I’d guess around 220 a few years ago. And now… well, I haven't weighed myself in a while. My wife probably knows better. She’s the one who keeps track of those things. I think she said around 250 last time? But honestly, I’m just guessing now. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good starting point. Thank you. It’s perfectly alright if you’re not precise. Now, let's talk about any medical conditions you might have. Have you been diagnosed with things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Let me think… High blood pressure, yeah, I think so. The doctor mentioned something about that a while back. He put me on some pills for it. I take them every day. Diabetes… I don't think so? My wife would definitely tell me if I had that, wouldn’t she? Cholesterol… maybe? I've had blood tests, I know, but I don’t pay attention to the results. I just let the doctor handle it. Honestly, I’m not very good with all the medical stuff. It just goes in one ear and out the other. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not bad at all, Mr. Kochubey. Many people find medical information overwhelming. That's why we’re here – to help you understand. You mentioned taking pills for high blood pressure. Do you know the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Um… …I really don’t. It’s a little white pill. I take it with breakfast. My wife refills it for me, so I don’t even have to worry about it. I could… I could ask her when I get home? I'm really sorry, I feel like I’m not being very helpful. It’s just… my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. Don’t worry about it at all. We can easily find that information in your records. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My wife always asks when I eat something new, just to be safe, but I’ve never had to tell her anything. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. Not that I'm aware of, anyway. Is that okay? Should I be allergic to something?
DOCTOR: That's great to hear, Mr. Kochubey. It's good that you haven't experienced any allergic reactions. Now, let's talk about any previous surgeries or hospitalizations you may have had. Have you ever been operated on before, or spent time in the hospital for any reason?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, I think. That’s all I can really remember. And… oh! I broke my arm once, when I was playing soccer. But that was a long time ago. Other than that, I haven’t really been to the hospital. Nothing major. I try to stay out of there if I can. It's not my favorite place, you know?
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy and a broken arm. Good to know. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… That's a tough one. My family… we don't really talk about that stuff. My dad had… something with his heart, I think. He passed away a few years ago. And my mom, she has arthritis, pretty bad. I think my uncle had diabetes, but I’m not really sure. We just… don't keep track of those things. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It’s just not something we ever discussed.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Kochubey. It's common for families not to discuss medical history. We can work with what you know. Finally, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never have. And I don’t drink alcohol, either. Never really liked it. And definitely no drugs. I’m a pretty simple guy, Doctor. I just like to relax at home with my wife. We watch TV, cook dinner… nothing fancy. We try to eat healthy, but it's hard sometimes. We both work long hours. I do like sweets though. I have a bit of a sweet tooth. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not bad to enjoy sweets in moderation, Mr. Kochubey. That’s good to know. Okay, thank you for answering all those questions. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. We'll just check your vital signs, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a basic abdominal exam. It won't take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s going to be uncomfortable. I’m not a fan of doctors, if I’m being honest. But I’m here to get this surgery done, so I’ll do whatever you need me to.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll take things slowly and I’ll explain everything as we go. I’ll do my best to make you comfortable. First, I’m going to check your height and weight. Okay, step onto the scale for me, please. Blood pressure is 150/90, pulse is 88 and regular, and temperature is 37 degrees Celsius. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. And another one… Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild wheezing in your lungs. Finally, I’m going to examine your abdomen. Do you feel any pain or tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: Oh… yeah, a little bit. It's not terrible, but it's… uncomfortable. It feels kind of… bloated, all the time. And sometimes it hurts, especially after I eat. It’s just a dull ache, though. Nothing sharp or anything. I thought it was just gas, or something. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Mild tenderness and a feeling of bloating are common with weight gain. But we’ll want to investigate further. I'm going to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar, cholesterol, liver function, and kidney function. We’ll also do a basic metabolic panel. And I'd like to schedule an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this figured out and get the surgery done. The sooner, the better, honestly. All these tests… it’s a lot, but if it helps, then I’m all for it. When would I need to come back for those tests? And where would I go?
DOCTOR: I understand your eagerness, Mr. Kochubey. We’ll get everything done as efficiently as possible. The lab is located just down the hall, and you can go anytime tomorrow morning, after 8 AM, but before noon. You don’t need an appointment. Just tell them Dr. Annesley sent you for a pre-operative blood panel. As for the ultrasound, we can schedule that for next week, on Wednesday at 10:00 AM. The imaging center is located at 123 Main Street. You will need to call to schedule that with them; here is a number: 555-123-4567. I will also provide you with a list of instructions for the blood tests—specifically, that you should fast for at least 12 hours before your appointment. I'll review the results of these tests, and then we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine if you’re a suitable candidate for surgery. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. Wednesday at 10:00 AM for the ultrasound, and blood tests tomorrow morning. I’ll make sure to fast. I think I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I feel a little better now, knowing what’s going to happen next. One last question… is this surgery… risky? I haven’t really thought about the risks, to be honest. I just want to get healthy.
DOCTOR: That's a very important question, Mr. Kochubey, and it’s good you’re asking it. All surgeries carry some degree of risk. Weight loss surgery, like any major procedure, has potential complications. These can include infection, bleeding, blood clots, leaks from the surgical site, and nutritional deficiencies. There are also longer-term risks to consider, such as dumping syndrome and the need for further surgeries. However, it’s important to remember that these risks are relatively low, especially in experienced hands. We take many precautions to minimize them. We will thoroughly discuss all of the risks and benefits with you before proceeding with the surgery. You’ll have the opportunity to ask any questions you have, and we’ll make sure you fully understand what’s involved before making any decisions. I will also give you materials to review at home. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… everything for now. You've answered all my questions, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I’ll make sure to schedule the ultrasound and get the blood tests done tomorrow. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns between now and your next appointment. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next week.
