DOCTOR: Hi Josie, good to see you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have all day. It's my stomach. Acid reflux, I think. Been happening for a few weeks now. It’s… unpleasant. And frankly, I don't understand why it's taking so long to get this sorted.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A few weeks of acid reflux… unpleasant is a good way to put it. Let's get some details so we can figure out the best way to get this under control. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Details? What kind of details do you need? It burns! Food comes back up. It’s… common sense, isn't it? I eat, then I regret it. It’s worse when I lie down, naturally. Do I need to draw you a diagram?
DOCTOR: No diagrams needed, thank you. Just trying to get a clear picture. When you say “comes back up,” is that full meals, or more like a sour taste?
PATIENT: Both, actually. Sometimes it's just… a little bit. Like bile. Other times, it's… well, what I ate. Not everything, but enough to be… discouraging. And it happens more often than it should, if you ask me. I haven’t changed my diet, so I don’t know why it’s suddenly a problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, so both regurgitation of food and a sour taste coming up. And it’s a recent change, despite no changes to your diet. Do you notice if certain foods trigger it more than others?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. I eat sensible food. Steak, potatoes, maybe some vegetables. I'm not one of these fussy eaters. It seems random. Though… maybe spicy things. Yes, perhaps spicy things. But I like a little spice, so I won’t stop eating them just because of this… inconvenience. It’s not like I’m a delicate flower.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially spicy foods worsen it. And it’s not consistently triggered by anything specific. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think. Sometimes… a little bit of a cough. Not a bad cough, just… irritating. And… heartburn, obviously. It’s all connected, isn’t it? Look, I’m a busy man. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just going around in circles? I have appointments to get to.
DOCTOR: We are getting there. A little cough and heartburn along with the regurgitation. Just trying to rule things out. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Are you suggesting I’m wasting away? I maintain a perfectly healthy weight! Perhaps I’ve lost a pound or two, but that’s hardly significant. I'm a large man, always have been. It's probably muscle. I've been doing some work around the house. Honestly, the questions you're asking are… insulting.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my questions came across as insulting, that wasn’t my intention at all. Just standard questions to get a full picture. So, no significant weight loss then. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Look, I’m generally healthy. High blood pressure, maybe. But that's under control with medication. And… I had my appendix out years ago. That's about it. I don't spend my time going to doctors. A strong constitution, that's what I have. I eat well, I work hard. This… this is just a temporary setback. I expect a quick fix.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, managed with medication, and an appendectomy in the past. And you're currently taking medication for the blood pressure, correct?
PATIENT: Naturally. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Ten milligrams, once a day. Look, I’m not senile, doctor. I remember what pills I take. This is getting ridiculous. Are you going to actually do something, or just keep interrogating me? I have things to do. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10mg daily. Yes, I see it here. Right. Okay. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. It will only take a few minutes. Is that alright?
