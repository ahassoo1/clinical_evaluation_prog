DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh… cough. Yeah, I got a bad cough. Been coughing for… long time already. And tired all the time. Also, my nose… always blocked, then runny. Happens often. I think I get… sinus? I dunno the name properly.
DOCTOR: Alright, a cough, fatigue, and nasal congestion. It sounds quite bothersome. “Long time already” – could you be a bit more specific about how long you’ve been experiencing these symptoms, Mr. Tati?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific… Maybe… six months? Or more? Everything kinda blends together, you know? It comes and goes. Worse in the rainy season, I think. Not sure. Sorry, Doctor, I'm not good with dates.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mr. Tati. It's perfectly understandable. Six months or more, with fluctuations depending on the weather… that gives us a starting point. And you mentioned it's worse in the rainy season. Do you notice anything else that makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Uh… cold drinks make it worse. Definitely. And… dust. If I’m working, changing tires, lots of dust… cough gets really bad then. When I rest… it’s a little better. Not much, but a little. Also, my wife says I snore a lot. Don't know if that's important.
DOCTOR: That's all very helpful information, Mr. Tati. Cold drinks and dust are certainly triggers to note. And your wife mentioning the snoring is potentially relevant. Before we continue, I’d like to ask about other symptoms. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or night sweats along with the cough and fatigue?
PATIENT: Fever… sometimes. Not high fever, just feel warm. Chills… not really. Night sweats… uh… I sleep with the fan on, always hot. So… maybe? Hard to tell. I dunno what night sweats feel like. Sorry. I just wake up kinda sweaty sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, intermittent low-grade fever and occasional sweating during sleep. Thank you for clarifying. Now, let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… maybe? I sneeze sometimes. But everyone sneezes, right? I had… something in my chest when I was a kid. Doctor gave me some medicine. Coughing a lot. But that was… long time ago. I don't remember what it was called. Asthma? Maybe. I don’t know. Never really bothered me much after that.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible history of a respiratory illness in childhood and some seasonal allergies. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never been to the hospital. Just the doctor when I was sick. And… when my wife had the baby. I went with her, but I wasn't sick. No, no hospital for me.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like asthma, allergies, heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: My father… he had a bad heart. He passed away a few years ago. And my mother… she always coughed. Not like me, but a little cough. She had some problems with her… breathing? I dunno the proper word. And… my brother, he has allergies. Bad ones. Always sneezing. That’s all I remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, a history of heart disease in your father, a respiratory issue in your mother, and allergies in your brother. Thank you. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never! Bad for you! My wife would kill me if I smoked. No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Tati. And what about alcohol?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Just beer, with dinner. Not every day. Maybe… two or three times a week? Small glass. Nothing much.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional small amounts of alcohol. And finally, could you tell me about your work?
PATIENT: I change tires. At the shop. Lots of lifting, lots of dust, lots of… work. Long hours. It’s… hard work. Been doing it for… fifteen years maybe? I dunno exactly. Pays the bills.
DOCTOR: Okay, physically demanding work in a dusty environment. That gives us a better understanding of your daily exposures. Now, before we proceed to a physical exam, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… sometimes I take something for the headache. When it's really bad. Paracetamol, I think? From the shop. And… sometimes, my wife gives me vitamin C. When I cough a lot. That’s it. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional paracetamol for headaches and vitamin C supplements. Now, Mr. Tati, I’d like to perform a physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat and loosen your clothing, that would be great. I’m going to listen to your lungs and heart, check your nose and throat, and feel your lymph nodes. Your breath sounds are slightly diminished bilaterally, with some faint wheezing noted, particularly on exhalation. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Nasal mucosa appears inflamed with some clear discharge present. Throat is mildly erythematous, no exudate. Lymph nodes are slightly enlarged, non-tender. Do you feel any pain or tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: A little. Not much. Just… sensitive. Always feels a bit sensitive when I’m sick. But not painful, really. Just… feels swollen.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you, Mr. Tati. Based on what you’ve told me and the findings of the physical exam – the diminished breath sounds, wheezing, nasal inflammation, and mild lymph node swelling – it appears you’re experiencing symptoms consistent with a chronic respiratory condition, likely exacerbated by your work environment and potential allergic triggers. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further investigation, but it could be a combination of allergic rhinitis, bronchitis, and possibly some degree of asthma. I’d like to order a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection and an allergy test to identify any specific allergens. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Uh… okay. If you think it will help. But… what does it mean? Will it be expensive? I don’t have much money, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Tati. Let’s address that first. The CBC is a relatively inexpensive blood test. The allergy test can be a bit more costly, depending on the scope, but we can start with a basic panel to identify common allergens. I’ll have the billing department contact you with the estimated costs before proceeding with anything. And we can discuss options if the costs are a concern. As for what it means, the CBC will help us rule out any bacterial infection. The allergy test will help identify what you’re allergic to – things like dust mites, pollen, or mold. Knowing this will help us develop a treatment plan to manage your symptoms. I also recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying lung conditions. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: X-ray… more tests. Okay. If you think it's necessary. I just want to be able to breathe again, Doctor. And… I don’t want to get worse. So, yes. Do whatever you think is best. But please, can you make sure it doesn’t cost too much? My wife will be very worried.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Tati. Your comfort and well-being are my priority, and we will certainly be mindful of the costs. I’ll write the orders for the CBC, allergy test, and chest X-ray. The nurse will draw your blood now, and we’ll schedule the X-ray for you before you leave. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a bronchodilator inhaler to help open up your airways and ease your breathing. I’ll also recommend a nasal saline rinse to help clear your nasal passages. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Inhaler… nasal rinse… Okay. Sounds… complicated. What do I do with the inhaler? And how often do I use it? And… is it safe?
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Mr. Tati. The inhaler is quite simple to use. It delivers medication directly to your lungs to help open up your airways. The nurse will demonstrate the proper technique before you leave, and I’ll have you practice it here to make sure you’re comfortable. You’ll use it two puffs as needed, whenever you feel short of breath or wheezing. There’s no limit to how often you can use it, but if you find yourself needing it more than twice a week, it’s a sign that your condition may need further management. The nasal rinse involves using a saline solution to flush out your nasal passages. It helps clear congestion and remove irritants. You’ll use it twice a day. As for safety, both the inhaler and nasal rinse are generally very safe. However, some people may experience mild side effects, such as a dry mouth or a slight sore throat. The nurse will provide you with a detailed information sheet outlining potential side effects. Do you feel any better after hearing about the treatment plan?
PATIENT: A little. It's still… a lot to remember. But… knowing there's something I can do… that helps. And you said it will help me breathe easier. That’s what I need. Okay. I’ll try it. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Tati. I understand it’s a lot to take in, but we’ll work through it together. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and demonstrate the inhaler technique. I’ll also write a work note for you, excusing you from heavy lifting and dusty environments for a week, and a referral to an allergist for further evaluation. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: Work note… that’s good. My boss… he's not always understanding. No… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor Bakan. You’ve been very helpful. I hope these tests work. And… I hope I can breathe again soon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Tati. I’m optimistic that we can get your symptoms under control and improve your quality of life. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns after you leave. The nurse will be in shortly. .
PATIENT: .
