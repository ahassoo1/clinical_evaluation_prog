DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Look, I really don't have a lot of time. It's my throat. It hurts. Just…hurts when I swallow. Is that all you need to know? I work very long hours, you see.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your time is valuable, Ms. Ottaviani, “it hurts when I swallow” isn’t quite enough information for a proper assessment. We need to understand how it hurts, when it started, and if anything makes it better or worse. Let’s start with when did this sore throat begin?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I can't quite recall. A few days, maybe? It all feels like one long, tiring week. I’ve been feeling unwell for a while now, if that helps. Everything just…blurs together. I suppose it started feeling worse recently, which is why I bothered coming. Is that specific enough?
DOCTOR: A few days, worsening recently. And you said you've been feeling unwell for a while. Can you describe how you've been feeling unwell?
PATIENT: Tired, mostly. Very, very tired. And achy. Like an old woman, really. I’ve always been a strong worker, you see, but this…this is different. It’s just a general feeling of being off. No energy, no appetite. Is this really necessary, Doctor? I have shifts to cover.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Ms. Ottaviani. Fatigue and aches can be caused by many things. We need to rule out anything serious. Have you had a fever, chills, or any nasal congestion?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. No fever that I’ve noticed. Maybe a little stuffy nose, but that could just be the dust at work. I work with…well, it doesn’t matter what I work with. It’s not a clean job. Definitely no chills. I don't have time to be sick, Doctor. People depend on me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any difficulty breathing, any rash, or any pain in your chest?
PATIENT: Difficulty breathing? Goodness, no! If I had trouble breathing, would I be here talking to you? Really, Doctor. And a rash? No. I keep myself very clean, despite my job. And no chest pain. Just this…this annoying throat. Look, are we getting anywhere? Because I really need to get back to work. My boss is not understanding.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, I understand you're busy, but I need you to be patient. We're establishing whether this is a simple sore throat or something more concerning. Have you noticed any white spots on your tonsils, or any swollen glands in your neck?
PATIENT: White spots? Swollen…glands? Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t been examining the insides of my mouth! I have important work to do. I don’t have time for self-diagnostics. Are you suggesting I’m somehow incompetent? I just want something for the pain, and to be allowed to return to work. This is utterly ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Ms. Ottaviani, I am not suggesting you are incompetent. I am attempting to gather information so I can provide you with appropriate medical care. A proper assessment requires me to ask questions, and it requires your cooperation. Very well. Let’s proceed with a physical exam, then. Could you please open your mouth wide for me?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. I truly don’t have time for this. There. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Your tonsils are slightly inflamed, and I do see some redness in the back of your throat. No obvious exudate, but there is some mild swelling. I'm also palpating your neck now... And I do feel some tenderness in your anterior cervical lymph nodes. They’re not dramatically enlarged, but they are palpable. Okay. Based on the brief examination, it appears you have pharyngitis – inflammation of your throat. It's likely viral, but to be certain, I’d like to do a rapid strep test. It’s a quick swab, and it will rule out bacterial infection. Would you consent to that?
PATIENT: A swab? Doctor, honestly. This is getting out of hand. Look, I haven't got the plague. I just have a sore throat. But…fine. If it means I can get back to work sooner, do your…swab. Just be quick about it. And please don't poke me too hard. I have to manage a team, you see. Very delicate operation. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ottaviani. It will be a quick, slightly uncomfortable sensation. Please relax your throat and say “Ahhh”. Okay, that’s all. Now we’ll wait a few minutes for the results. While we’re waiting, do you have any allergies to medications, and are you currently taking anything?
