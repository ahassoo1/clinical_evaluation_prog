DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right in the back of my head, kinda feels like a tight band squeezin’. It’s been botherin’ me for…oh, goodness, maybe a week or so now? Not constant, comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Hmm, a headache for about a week…comes and goes, you said. And you describe it as a tight band sensation in the back of your head. Okay. Can you tell me a little more about when it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not tied to anything specific, not that I’ve noticed. It doesn’t seem to be worse with bright light, or loud noises… sometimes it’s there when I wake up, sometimes not. And it doesn’t really get worse throughout the day, just…is there. I tried some of those over-the-counter pain relievers, the ibuprofen and such, but they don’t seem to do much good, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. No clear triggers, not consistently related to light or noise. Ibuprofen isn't providing relief… Alright. Have you had headaches like this before, Percell, or is this new?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I get little aches and pains now and then, being my age, you know? But nothin’ quite like this. Not a steady pressure like this. I had a bad migraine once, a long time ago, when my daughter was born, but this doesn’t feel like that. It’s more…a dull, constant squeeze. I think this is new, yeah. Definitely new.
DOCTOR: Alright, sounds like it’s new. And not a typical migraine. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the headache?
PATIENT: Let me think… hmm. No fever, no blurry vision. I haven’t been feelin’ dizzy or anything like that. No stiff neck. My appetite’s been okay, maybe a little less than usual, but I figured that was just… gettin’ older, you know? I haven't felt nauseous, thankfully. No real changes in my vision either. Just the headache, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No fever, no vision changes, no nausea… Just the headache itself. Do you have any problems with your memory, or have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Oh, my memory's… well, it’s 84, Doctor! It ain’t what it used to be! But no, nothin' new in that department. And no weakness, no. I still walk just fine, still do a little gardening when the weather's good. Everything feels normal there. I can remember everything from yesterday just fine, and what I had for breakfast. Little things sometimes slip my mind, but that's to be expected, right?
DOCTOR: Right, perfectly understandable. Let’s move on to some other things. Do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let's see… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, maybe thirty years back? And my blood pressure was a little high for a while, but it's been pretty stable for the last few years, at least according to my old doctor. He retired, you see. Never really had anything serious, thankfully. Oh, and I had the flu pretty bad a couple winters ago, but everyone gets the flu, right? Nothing chronic, nothin' I’m actively treatin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, previously managed high blood pressure, and a bout of the flu. Any surgeries besides your gallbladder?
PATIENT: No, not that I can recall. Just the gallbladder. And a few stitches here and there when I was a kid, fallin’ out of trees and such. But nothin’ major, nothin’ that required a hospital stay or anything like that. I was a rambunctious boy, you see. My mother always said I was too curious for my own good.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. I eat just about anything. Never had a reaction to any medicine… I’ve taken a few antibiotics over the years, when I've been sick, and never had any trouble. No bee stings, no rashes, nothin' like that. Clean bill of health on the allergy front, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter things?
PATIENT: Just a little vitamin D in the winter, when it gets dark early. And sometimes I take a stool softener, if I'm feelin' a little… backed up. But that's about it. Nothing regular, nothing prescribed. I mostly try to stay healthy with good food and a little bit of exercise.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological exam to see if everything is working alright. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Go right ahead. I’m not worried, but I always like to know what’s goin’ on. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs appreciated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/85. A little elevated, but not significantly so. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Coordination is intact. No focal neurological deficits noted. Everything seems normal on the initial exam, but the headache is concerning.
PATIENT: Well, that's good to hear, I suppose. But still… this headache is botherin’ me. What do you think it could be, Doctor? Is it somethin’ serious? I’m not lookin’ for a diagnosis right away, just… what are we lookin’ at here?
DOCTOR: It’s difficult to say definitively without further investigation. Given your age and the relatively normal neurological exam, it's unlikely to be anything acutely serious like a stroke or tumor. However, a persistent headache warrants further evaluation. It could be a tension headache, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order a CT scan of your head just to be on the safe side, and I want to check your blood to rule out any underlying inflammation or infection. Do you have any insurance that would cover this?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, I don't have insurance. My wife and I… well, we got divorced a while back, and the insurance went with her. It's been too expensive for me to get on my own, I'm afraid. How much would these tests cost, roughly? And is there anything else we can do besides those scans? I'm a little worried about the cost, to be honest. I'm on a fixed income.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Percell. A CT scan can be quite expensive, especially without insurance. Let's explore some other options first. We can try a course of medication to see if we can alleviate the headache symptoms. I’m thinking a muscle relaxant and perhaps an anti-inflammatory. If the headache doesn’t improve with medication within a week or two, then we can revisit the possibility of the CT scan. We can also look into some local resources that may offer financial assistance for medical testing, but I can’t guarantee anything. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds much better, Doctor. Trying the medication first seems sensible. I'd much prefer that to a big, expensive scan right away, if we can. And thank you for lookin' into the financial assistance, that's very kind of you. What kind of side effects should I expect from the medication? And will it interact with the little vitamin D I take? I don't want any surprises, you know.
DOCTOR: The muscle relaxant can cause some drowsiness, so it’s best not to drive or operate heavy machinery while taking it. Some people also experience dizziness or dry mouth. The anti-inflammatory can sometimes cause some stomach upset, so it’s best to take it with food. As for the vitamin D, it’s unlikely to interact with either medication, but it’s always best to be cautious. I'm going to prescribe both medications. If you experience any concerning side effects, stop taking them and call my office immediately. I also want to see you back here in two weeks to reassess your condition. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. I'll be careful with the medication and watch out for those side effects. And I'll definitely come back in two weeks if it doesn't get better, or if things get worse. Thank you for takin’ the time to listen to me and for explainin’ everything so clearly. I feel a lot better just knowin’ what we're lookin' at here.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Percell. I’m glad I could help. My staff will provide you with the prescriptions and some information about the medications. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you in two weeks.
PATIENT: It was nice meeting you, Doctor Sham. I appreciate your kindness and patience. I will definitely call if anything comes up. Have a good day.
