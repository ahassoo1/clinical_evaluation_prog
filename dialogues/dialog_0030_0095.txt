DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Nissenbaum. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Quicksey. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I’d rather not be here. It’s… inconvenient. But fine. I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of my left ear. And my face… it feels a little droopy on that side. It's quite distressing, really. I don't understand why these things happen.
DOCTOR: I understand this is distressing, Ms. Nissenbaum, and I apologize for the inconvenience. It’s good you came in right away. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping are things we need to investigate promptly. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me when exactly you first noticed the hearing loss and facial drooping this morning?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It was… around 7:00 AM, I suppose. When I woke up. I usually wake up before then, but I hit snooze a couple of times. So, sometime between 7:00 and 7:30. It wasn't gradual. Just… poof. Gone. And then I felt… this. It’s subtle, but it’s definitely there. Honestly, I suspect it's a virus. Everything’s a virus these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, 7:00 to 7:30 AM, sudden onset of both hearing loss and facial drooping. A virus is certainly a possibility, but we need to rule out other causes as well. To get a better understanding, have you experienced any other symptoms along with this—such as dizziness, headache, changes in your vision, or any difficulty with speaking or swallowing?
PATIENT: Dizziness? No. Headache… I get headaches sometimes, but nothing unusual this morning. My vision is fine, as far as I can tell. And speaking and swallowing are… normal. Really, it's just the ear and the face. It's all quite… bothersome. I do hope this isn’t going to take long. I have a book club meeting later.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Nissenbaum. We will work as efficiently as possible. No dizziness, no unusual headache, vision and speech are normal. Now, have you experienced anything like this before?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I’ve never had anything like this happen before. I’ve had a cold or two in my life, of course. And the occasional migraine. But this? No. And frankly, I find it rather alarming. My husband… well, he would have known what to do. He was a practical man. But he’s gone now, as you probably gathered. So, I’m left to deal with these… inconveniences on my own.
DOCTOR: I am very sorry for your loss, Ms. Nissenbaum. It’s understandable that you’re feeling anxious, and dealing with this on your own is undoubtedly more challenging. Let’s move on to some medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any past medical conditions—like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've always been quite healthy, actually. I eat my vegetables. I try to get enough sleep. My blood pressure is usually… normal. I had a bit of a scare with my cholesterol a few years back, but I managed to get it under control with…diet. And exercise. Well, walking, mostly. I’m not one for strenuous activity. I suspect this is just… bad luck. Honestly. I don't do anything to deserve this.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Nissenbaum. So, no significant past medical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my tonsils out when I was a child. A very long time ago. And a hysterectomy, decades ago. That’s it. Nothing else. I avoid hospitals whenever possible. They’re… unpleasant places. And unnecessary. If it's not broken, don't fix it, that's what I always say.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and a hysterectomy. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None whatsoever. I eat everything. I take a multivitamin, sometimes. But that's it. I find most medications to be… overhyped. And full of side effects. Honestly, I prefer to let my body heal itself. I really don't understand why we're going through all of this. Is there anything you can immediately do to fix it? This is really disrupting my schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about your schedule and wanting a quick resolution. Before we discuss treatment options, I need to gather a bit more information to understand what we’re dealing with. Could you tell me if you are currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: I told you, just a multivitamin occasionally. And sometimes, if I have a headache, I take paracetamol. But I rarely get headaches, so it's not often. Honestly, I think this whole situation is rather… dramatic. I truly don't understand what all these questions are for. Are you going to actually do something, or are we just going to sit here all day?
DOCTOR: I apologize if I'm causing any frustration, Ms. Nissenbaum. I assure you, I want to help you as quickly and efficiently as possible. These questions are essential to rule out any underlying causes and ensure I recommend the most appropriate course of action. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as stroke, hearing loss, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Honestly? I have no idea. My family… they weren’t ones for discussing medical history. We kept to ourselves, mostly. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… well, he worked very hard. He died young, from exhaustion, really. As for strokes or hearing loss… I don’t recall. It’s not something we talked about. I really don't see how this is relevant to my current situation. It’s just… an ear problem. I'm starting to feel quite unwell just sitting here.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not always easy to gather that information. Since your family medical history is unclear, we’ll focus on what’s happening with you now. Finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean? I read. I garden. I attend book club. I lead a quiet life. I’m a radiologist, so I spend a lot of time looking at scans. It's… sedentary, I suppose. But it’s mentally stimulating. I don't smoke. I rarely drink alcohol. I try to eat healthy. Honestly, I’m a very responsible person. I don’t understand why all these questions are necessary. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Nissenbaum. That provides helpful context. Given your history of sudden hearing loss and facial drooping, your occupation, and the absence of other significant medical issues, I would like to perform a brief physical exam. This will involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and a neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have a book club meeting, you know. I highly doubt a physical exam will accomplish anything, but if it means I can leave sooner… But please be quick about it. And try not to poke me too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I'll be as efficient and gentle as possible. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that could be due to anxiety. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now I’ll check your neurological function. I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes, and I’ll test your facial strength and reflexes. I’m also going to check your ear with an otoscope.
PATIENT: Well? What did you find? Is it serious? I knew it was something awful. This is precisely why I avoid doctors whenever possible. Always bad news. Just tell me what’s wrong, and what you’re going to do about it. I haven’t got all day, you know.
DOCTOR: Ms. Nissenbaum, I understand your anxiety. Based on the examination, you are experiencing weakness on the left side of your face and some decreased hearing in your left ear. Your reflexes are also slightly diminished on that side. The ear canal appears clear, but the eardrum isn’t moving as it should. These findings are concerning for what we call Bell’s Palsy, which is a sudden weakness of the facial muscles due to inflammation of the facial nerve. It can sometimes be accompanied by hearing changes. However, it’s crucial to rule out other possible causes, such as a stroke, especially given your slightly elevated blood pressure. To do that, I recommend a CT scan of your head to ensure there isn’t a more serious underlying cause. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Honestly! More tests? This is ridiculous. I told you, it's just an ear problem. Bell’s Palsy… never heard of it. And a stroke? I’m perfectly healthy, as I’ve already explained. I’m not insured, you know. These tests are expensive. I’m not sure I want to proceed with any further testing. Perhaps it will just go away on its own. I’ve always been lucky.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about cost and the desire to avoid unnecessary testing. It’s true that Bell’s Palsy often resolves on its own, but it’s essential to rule out a stroke first, as early treatment is critical in that case. The CT scan will help us determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure you receive the appropriate care. Given your lack of insurance and your concern about costs, I can discuss alternative options, such as a referral to a neurologist for a consultation. They could assess your symptoms and determine if further testing is necessary. However, I strongly recommend at least considering the CT scan for peace of mind and to rule out a serious cause. To be clear, the symptoms you’re experiencing—sudden weakness and hearing loss—are concerning enough that I would typically recommend further investigation regardless. Would you like me to explore options for a neurology consultation, or would you like more information about the cost of a CT scan so you can make an informed decision?
PATIENT: Honestly, this is all very stressful. A neurologist? More appointments? I just want this to stop. I suppose… I suppose a neurology consultation is better than a CT scan. At least it doesn't involve radiation. But I don’t want to wait weeks to be seen. And I want someone who is… efficient. I don’t have time to waste explaining all of this to someone who doesn’t understand. Can you recommend someone good? And quickly? I have a book club meeting, you know. It’s a very important meeting.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. I understand your concern and desire for a quick appointment. I can recommend Dr. Eleanor Vance. She is a highly respected neurologist with a reputation for efficiency and thoroughness. She is located about 20 minutes from here. Here is a referral form with her contact information. I’ve also noted your concerns about a quick appointment. I will also call her office to let them know you are a new patient and emphasize the urgency of your situation. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of Prednisone, which can help reduce inflammation and potentially improve your symptoms. It is important to start taking this medication as soon as possible. I want you to monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any worsening of weakness, difficulty breathing, or changes in your vision, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about the medication, the referral, or the importance of monitoring your symptoms?
PATIENT: Prednisone… I’ve heard that has side effects. Everything has side effects. Fine. I’ll take it, I suppose. Just to get rid of this… this problem. But I don't want to be on it long. And I will call Dr. Vance. Honestly, I’m still not convinced this is necessary. But I’ll do it, just to appease you. Now, can I finally leave? I really must get going. My book club will be starting soon. And I’m the one leading the discussion this month. It’s a very important book, you know. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Nissenbaum. You’re free to leave now. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. I’ve documented everything, and we will follow up to see how you’re progressing. I wish you all the best, and I hope you enjoy your book club meeting. Have a good day.
