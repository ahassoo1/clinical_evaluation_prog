DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Kammer is fine. Look, it’s not… a problem, exactly. Just… things been a little down. I thought maybe a little note from a doctor… a “get well” card, you understand? Something to cheer things up. My ex-wife… she always liked getting cards. Makes people feel better, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: I see. So, you’re requesting documentation of a… general feeling of unwellness?
PATIENT: Documentation? Well, I wouldn’t put it like that. It’s more… a little encouragement. A little something to show I’m… being proactive. You know? Taking care of myself. I don’t feel sick, not really. Just… low. Is that what you need documented? “Low”? It’s a very… subtle thing, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, a “get well” card is not typically a matter for medical documentation. I am a physician, not a… provider of emotional support notes. However, to properly assess your condition, even if you describe it as “low,” I require a more detailed account. Could you elaborate on what you mean by “low”?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Look, I told you. Things just aren’t… peachy. My appetite's been… off. Not eating much. And I’ve been… not sleeping as good. It's not like a sickness, you understand? It’s… a feeling. A general… lack of pep. You want details? I used to get up at six, now it’s… closer to seven. Sometimes seven-thirty. Is that detailed enough for you? It’s a little thing, but it adds up, you know? A man needs his routine.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a change in appetite and sleep patterns. And a later wake-up time. Have these changes been gradual, or did they occur suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradual. Definitely gradual. It didn’t happen overnight, Doctor. It’s been… weeks, maybe a couple months. I ain’t one for keepin’ track of dates, you understand? Things just… slipped. Little by little. Now I wake up tired. And the food… doesn’t taste the same. Not bad, exactly. Just… nothin’ special. Like eatin’ cardboard, almost. You ever feel like that?
DOCTOR: I see. And has anything specifically triggered these changes, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Triggered? You mean… somethin’ happened? Well… the divorce, of course. That was a few years back, but… things still linger, you understand? She always made a good breakfast. And kept the house nice. Now… it’s just me. And a lot of dust. And quiet. Too much quiet. Is that what you’re lookin’ for? A trigger? That’s a pretty fancy word for… sadness, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, while I sympathize with your situation, it’s important we differentiate between grief and a potential underlying medical condition. A change in appetite and sleep, coupled with feelings of sadness, could indicate a number of things. Have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmmm… let me think. My back’s been achin’ a little more than usual. Probably from sittin’ around too much, I reckon. And I get… winded easier. Used to be able to walk a mile, no problem. Now… I gotta stop and catch my breath. And… I forget things. Not important things, mind you. Just… where I put my keys, or what I was sayin’. Is that what you mean by symptoms? It’s probably just gettin’ old, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Right. Back pain, shortness of breath, and forgetfulness. How would you rate your pain on a scale of one to ten, with one being minimal and ten being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Ten? Oh, no, not ten. That's… broken bone pain, I reckon. Mine's… more like a five. Sometimes a six, after I've been sittin' a while. It's a dull ache, mostly in my lower back. Not sharp, nothin' like a pulled muscle. Just… there. Constant. And the forgetfulness… it ain't like I'm losin' my mind, Doctor. Just… small things. Like where I left the remote. Or what I was gonna buy at the store. You ever misplace your keys?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, given your history of changes in appetite, sleep, mood, and these new physical symptoms, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. This will help me to assess your overall health and determine if further investigation is necessary. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Examination? Well… I suppose so. I ain't afraid of a little lookin' around. Long as you ain't gonna poke me too much. And… promise you won't tell me I need to start eatin' more vegetables. My ex-wife was always on about vegetables. She thought she knew everything. But… go ahead, Doctor. Let's get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat. I’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'd like to check your reflexes and range of motion. It will be relatively quick. Please remove your shoes and socks.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Shoes and socks off, you said? This is a little chilly in here, Doctor. Always cold in these places. And… just so you know, my feet ain’t pretty. Worked hard for a livin’, you understand? Boiler rooms ain’t known for bein’ gentle on a man’s feet.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is slightly elevated at 142 over 90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are normal, but there is some mild wheezing in the lower lobes of both lungs. Breath sounds are diminished bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and symmetric. Now, if you could just extend your arms and legs, I'll check your range of motion. Do you experience any pain with movement?
PATIENT: Pain? Not… terrible pain. Just a little stiff. This shoulder’s been botherin’ me lately. Old injury, I reckon. Fell off a ladder a few years back. Never really healed right. And… this knee. Used to be a pretty good athlete, back in my younger days. Baseball. But that was a long time ago. Everything creaks a little these days, Doctor. Like an old ship.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. Based on my examination and your reported symptoms, there are several possibilities we need to explore. Your elevated blood pressure, mild wheezing, and changes in appetite and sleep patterns are concerning. The joint pain is likely related to previous injuries, but we need to rule out other causes. I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level. We should also get a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Used to take a lot of… something for the dust, back in the boiler room. Pills, mostly. Little white ones. Can't remember the name now. It was a long time ago. But I ain't never had a reaction to nothin'. Blood work and a chest X-ray, you say? Sounds… thorough. And expensive, probably. My Medicare cover all that? It’s always somethin’, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover the necessary testing, Mr. Kammer. We'll submit the claims appropriately. It's important to gather this information to properly assess your health and determine the best course of action. While we await the lab results and X-ray, I recommend focusing on a healthy diet, regular – albeit gentle – exercise, and getting adequate sleep. Also, avoid any strenuous activity that exacerbates your joint pain. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No, not really. Just… whatever I can get over the counter for my aches and pains. Aspirin, mostly. Sometimes ibuprofen. And a little something for my… digestion. Gets a little backed up, you understand? Old age, I reckon. But I don’t take nothin’ regularly. Just when I need it. And… I try to eat right. Sometimes. It’s hard when you’re livin’ by yourself. Everything comes in a can these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kammer. Given your symptoms and medical history, I’m concerned about the possibility of several issues, including potential cardiovascular problems, respiratory concerns, and underlying musculoskeletal issues. We also need to consider the impact of your recent lifestyle changes and feelings of sadness on your overall health. I’m going to order the aforementioned blood work and chest X-ray. Once we have those results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a comprehensive treatment plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or severe joint pain – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Immediate medical attention…? Chest pain? That sounds… serious. I don't have chest pain. Not yet, anyway. But... a treatment plan? That sounds… complicated. Is this gonna be a long thing? I just wanted a little note, Doctor. A little "get well" card. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your concerns, and I apologize if I've caused you undue worry. The purpose of these tests is not to alarm you, but rather to gather information and rule out any potential serious underlying conditions. A proactive approach is always best. While I appreciate your initial request for documentation, it's my ethical obligation as a physician to thoroughly assess your health and address any potential concerns. A “get well” note is not a substitute for proper medical evaluation. We will proceed with the testing, and I assure you, we will discuss the results in detail and develop a plan that is tailored to your specific needs. We’ll take things one step at a time. Do you understand?
PATIENT: One step at a time… I suppose. It’s always somethin’, isn’t it? Alright, Doctor. Do what you gotta do. Blood work, X-rays… I’ll get it done. But… promise me you won’t find nothin’ too serious. I’m too old for all that. And… if you happen to have a spare "get well" card lyin’ around… well, it wouldn’t hurt. Just a little somethin’ to cheer me up, you understand?
DOCTOR: I will do my best to ensure we have a clear understanding of your health status, Mr. Kammer. As for the “get well” card… I’m afraid we don't typically provide those here. However, I can certainly provide you with documentation outlining your visit and any recommended follow-up care. The lab technician will draw your blood now, and we’ll schedule the chest X-ray for tomorrow morning. A nurse will provide you with the necessary paperwork and instructions. I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I reckon not. Just… thank you, Doctor. I guess. It’s a nice office, Doctor. Clean. My ex-wife… she always liked things clean. Alright then. I’ll see you tomorrow.
