DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. I am Dr. Blim. So, let's get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I got a letter from the lab, it seems my cholesterol is a little high. That's what the letter said, anyway. Hyper… something. I don't really understand all that medical stuff. I just want to make sure it's nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Hyperlipidemia, Ms. Geho. It simply means you have elevated cholesterol. Now, "a little high" is rather vague, and frankly, unhelpful. Do you have that lab report with you?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here it is. I tried to read it, but all the numbers… they just swam together. I mostly just saw the word "high" flagged in red.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, well. Your total cholesterol is 245, LDL is 160, HDL is 40, and triglycerides are 150. Not alarming, but certainly not optimal. Do you have any family history of heart disease or high cholesterol, Ms. Geho?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… My father had some heart trouble when he was older. He needed a… a stent, I think they called it. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had really bad circulation. Her legs… they weren’t good. Does that count? I’m not sure. I remember my mother worrying about it, always saying we all had “soft” hearts in the family.
DOCTOR: A family history is… relevant. And you mentioned your mother's concerns. Were these concerns ever substantiated with medical testing for her or other family members?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My mother… she wasn’t one for doctors. She believed in a good walk and a cup of tea for everything. She thought she had similar problems, but she never really got it checked out properly. She just… felt things. She was very sensitive, my mother. Always said she could feel when a storm was coming.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, feelings are not a substitute for laboratory data, Ms. Geho. Now, let's discuss your lifestyle. Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Not as much as I should, I suppose. I used to walk a lot more when I was working, but my job now is mostly at a desk. A lot of calculations and computer work. I do try to get out in the garden sometimes, that’s good exercise, isn’t it? Bending and digging… I probably don't do it as often as I should, though. And I do enjoy a nice glass of wine with dinner.
DOCTOR: Garden work is… adequate. And the wine… well, moderation is key, Ms. Geho. We'll need to address this. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just a daily vitamin, but that’s it. I try to eat a healthy diet, mostly vegetables and fish. I avoid fried foods and sweets as much as possible. I really haven’t had many health problems, to be honest. A little arthritis in my hands, but that’s just getting old, I think.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. I haven't been on one of these in… well, a very long time. Is it going to be cold? I always get cold easily.
DOCTOR: It will be… adequately warm, Ms. Geho. Let's begin. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs detected. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No palpable masses. Your weight is 124 pounds, and your height is 199 centimeters. BMI is 31.2. That places you in the obese category, Ms. Geho.
PATIENT: Oh. Obese? But I’m quite tall! I always thought I was just… solid. I haven’t weighed this much in years. I suppose I’ve put on a little weight since I retired. Less activity, you see. And comfort food… a little bit. But obese? That sounds rather… harsh.
DOCTOR: Ms. Geho, I am stating a clinical fact. Height does not negate the impact of excess weight. A BMI of 31.2 is objectively classified as obese. Now, let's focus on a plan of action. We'll start with dietary modifications and increased physical activity. I'll have the nurse print out a handout on a heart-healthy diet. I also recommend you aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week.
PATIENT: Okay. Thirty minutes… that doesn’t sound too bad. I could probably manage that. Walking, mostly. I’m not much for running or… those fancy exercise classes. And a handout… that’s helpful. I really do try to eat well. It’s just… things creep up on you, don’t they? I suppose I need to be more disciplined.
DOCTOR: Discipline is essential, Ms. Geho. I also recommend a follow-up lipid panel in three months to assess your progress. If your cholesterol levels do not improve with lifestyle modifications, we will discuss the possibility of medication. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. About the medication… what kind of medication are we talking about? And are there any side effects I should be aware of? I’ve always been a little wary of taking pills, if I’m honest. My grandmother, she had a bad reaction to something once… it wasn’t pretty.
DOCTOR: We would likely start with a statin, Ms. Geho. They are generally well-tolerated, but potential side effects include muscle aches, liver enzyme elevation, and, rarely, cognitive impairment. We would monitor your liver function with regular blood tests. As I said, we will attempt to manage this through lifestyle changes first. Medication is a last resort. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today, or are we finished?
PATIENT: Muscle aches… that doesn’t sound very pleasant. And cognitive impairment… oh dear. No, I think that’s everything. I suppose I just need to get walking and eat more vegetables. And try not to worry too much. Thank you, Doctor Blim.
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will provide you with the handout and schedule your follow-up appointment. I expect to see significant improvement at your next visit, Ms. Geho. Good day. .
PATIENT: Good day to you too, Doctor. I’ll do my best. I think I’ll just wait for the nurse then.
