DOCTOR: Good morning, Vicent. I’m Dr. Renzi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, to be frank, I’m hoping to talk about losing some weight. It’s getting… difficult, you know? I’ve tried a few things, but nothing seems to really stick anymore.
DOCTOR: Hmm, yes, weight loss can be a tricky one. It’s good you’re addressing it now. Okay, so you’ve tried some things in the past… can you tell me a little more about what you’ve attempted?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, mostly just… eating less. And walking. I used to walk quite a bit more, before my wife… passed. It’s harder to motivate myself now, I suppose. I also tried one of those meal replacement shakes for a little bit, but I didn't care for them much. They just didn’t… sit right with me, and they weren't very filling. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Vicent. It's completely understandable that motivation can be tough, especially with a loss like yours. And those shakes aren’t for everyone, definitely. So, eating less and walking – how long ago did you start those efforts, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Eating less… probably in the last year or so, after the doctor told me my numbers weren’t looking too good at my checkup. The walking… that was more on and off, but really tapered off after… well, after November. That’s when… never mind. Let's just say it's been a while since I was really consistent with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a year with the diet changes and a decrease in activity after November… thank you for sharing that, Vicent. Do you remember what those "numbers" were that the doctor mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, um… I don’t quite recall the specifics, Doctor. Something about my cholesterol being high, and… something about my sugar? I think he said it was borderline. I honestly try not to dwell on those things, you know? It just… worries me. I know I should remember, but I’m not as sharp as I used to be. It's getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Vicent. Don’t worry about remembering specifics – that’s what we’re here for. So, high cholesterol and borderline sugar… Okay. And besides those numbers, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My knees, they bother me more. Especially when it rains. And I get… winded easier, even just walking up the stairs. Nothing drastic, but it’s… noticeable. And I seem to be sleeping more during the day. Just little naps, but… more than I used to. I’m just… slowing down, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee pain, getting winded easily, and increased daytime sleepiness… Are you experiencing any pain in your chest, or shortness of breath at rest?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. No chest pain. And I can breathe fine when I’m just sitting or lying down. It’s just… exertion. Walking, even just a little bit. And sometimes, when I’m bending over. It's not a constant thing, though. That's why I haven't bothered the doctor much about it. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know, Vicent. Now, let’s talk a little about your general habits. Do you smoke, or have you in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never have. My wife… she didn’t approve of smoking. And truthfully, neither did I. Always thought it was a foolish habit. I do enjoy a little beer with dinner sometimes, though. A couple of bottles, maybe. Nothing excessive.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional beer… That's good to know. Now, how about your diet generally?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. A lot of fish, you know, we Chamorros, we like our fish. And rice, of course. And vegetables when I can. My daughter tries to bring me some when she visits. But… I admit, I do enjoy my sweets. Pan de sal, you know? And a little mango now and then. It’s hard to resist.
DOCTOR: Okay, fish, rice, vegetables, occasional sweets… Now, Vicent, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, or have taken recently?
PATIENT: Just my Medicare stuff, Doctor. For blood pressure, mostly. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes, when my arthritis acts up, I take some ibuprofen. That’s about it. Nothing else regularly. Oh, and I had a flu shot last fall. If that counts.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed, and a flu shot last fall… Alright, Vicent, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your knees. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Go ahead. I trust your judgement. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit of a murmur, which isn’t necessarily concerning at your age. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 140 over 85, a little elevated. Pulse is 78 and regular. There is some tenderness on the inner side of both knees, and a slight range of motion limitation. No significant swelling. Alright, Vicent. Everything sounds fairly typical, but your blood pressure is a bit high, and there is some arthritis in your knees. We should also run some blood work to see what’s going on with your cholesterol and sugar levels, and just get a general health overview. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Blood work is fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel a little better, you know? Less tired, less achy… I want to be able to enjoy my life again. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. Is it… is it okay if we talk about those weight loss medications now? That was the main reason I came in, after all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Vicent. And you’re very welcome. That’s precisely what we’re here for. Yes, let’s talk about weight loss medications. There are several options available, but it's important to understand that they aren't a magic bullet. They work best when combined with a healthy diet and regular exercise. Some of the newer medications, like semaglutide, have shown good results, but they can have side effects and aren’t right for everyone. We also have older options like phentermine, which can be effective, but also have potential risks. I’d want to review your blood work first to make sure you’re a good candidate for any of these. Have you been researching any specific medications already?
PATIENT: I’ve seen some things on the television, Doctor. About… Ozempic, I think it was? My daughter mentioned something about it too. She said it’s good for diabetes, but it helps with weight loss as well. I don’t have diabetes, though. I’m just not sure if it’s something I should even consider, to be honest. I don’t want to take anything that’s going to make me feel worse. I’ve heard stories…
DOCTOR: You’re right to be cautious, Vicent. It’s good that you’re thinking about the potential risks and benefits. Ozempic and Wegovy both contain semaglutide, and they are primarily diabetes medications, though they have become popular for weight loss as a secondary effect. Wegovy is specifically approved for weight loss, whereas Ozempic is for diabetes, though doctors often prescribe it off-label for weight loss. Because you don't have diabetes, Wegovy would likely be the more appropriate option, if it’s suitable for you. However, there are potential side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It can also interact with other medications. Given your blood pressure and knees, we need to be careful. Let’s get those blood tests done first. That will give us a much clearer picture and allow us to make a more informed decision. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. Very sensible. Blood tests first. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I don't want to rush into anything. My daughter said something about needing a shot, too? Is that right? I don't really like needles…
DOCTOR: Yes, Vicent, that’s right. Both Ozempic and Wegovy are administered as an injection, once a week. I understand that you're not keen on needles, and that’s perfectly alright. We can discuss alternative options if the injections are a deal-breaker. There are oral weight loss medications available, though they tend to be less effective. For now, let’s focus on the blood work. I'll write you a lab order, and the phlebotomist will take care of it. Then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and decide on the best course of action. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… perfect. Blood tests, then a follow-up. I trust your judgement. Thank you for being so patient with me. I really appreciate it. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Vicent. And you will, we'll get there. Here’s the lab order. The phlebotomist is just down the hall, in room three. Just tell them Dr. Renzi sent you. They'll take care of everything. I'll see you in about a week to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms or have any concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. And remember, we’re a team in this.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I will. I’ll see you next week.
