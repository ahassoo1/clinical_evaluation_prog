DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Miner, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, doc... it's my face and legs. They're just… puffy, you know? Been that way a bit now. Not sure why though. Never had anything like this before, not really.
DOCTOR: “Puffy,” you say. Hmm. And how long has this puffiness been going on, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A while. A few weeks, maybe? Hard to say, honestly. Time kinda… slips away these days. It wasn't sudden, that's for sure. Just kinda… gradually got bigger, I suppose. Didn't pay it much mind at first. Thought it was just… a bit of water, you know? Old age creeping up.
DOCTOR: Old age, huh?
PATIENT: Well, what else could it be? I ain't exactly spring chicken anymore, am I? Used to be able to work all day, no problem. Welding, soldering… tough work. Now… well, now I get winded just walkin’ to the mailbox. And this face… makes me look like a balloon. Not a good look.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, this puffiness… is it worse in the morning?
PATIENT: You know, now that you mention it… yeah, I think so. Mornings are the worst. Feels… tighter, you know? Like my skin is stretched too thin. Usually calms down a little throughout the day, but it never really goes away completely. Especially my ankles. They look like… well, like balloons too, I guess. It's embarrassing, honestly.
DOCTOR: And does anything make it better or worse besides time of day?
PATIENT: Hm. Not that I’ve noticed, really. I try to put my feet up when I can, but it doesn't seem to do much good. And I haven't changed anything in my diet… still eatin’ the same stuff I always have. Maybe salt? My wife used to say I put too much salt on everything. But… she's gone now, so I can put as much as I want, can't I? Not that I think it's the salt. Just… rambling now, probably.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's get a little more specific. Any shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Well, I get a little winded, like I said. But that's just from gettin' older, right? I don't… wheeze or nothin'. Just… tired easier. And maybe a little breathless when I climb the stairs. But I ain't been climbin' many stairs lately. Is that what you mean? 'Cause I ain't coughin' or nothin'.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your urine?
PATIENT: Changes in my… what now? You want to talk about my pee? Really, doc? Look, I go to the bathroom like everyone else. It's… you know… yellow. Sometimes lighter, sometimes darker. Haven't noticed nothin' different. Why are you askin' me about this? Seems kinda personal, don't you think?
DOCTOR: It's important, Mr. Miner. We need to rule things out. I’m just trying to get a complete picture. Okay, let’s move on. Any chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No! Never had chest pain. I’ve been workin’ with metal my whole life, doc, I’d know if somethin’ was wrong with my chest. That's what I do, remember? Welding and soldering... a bad chest would make that real hard. You're askin' a lot of strange questions, doc. Are you sure you know what you're doin'?
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your ankles. It'll only take a few minutes. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Well, alright. But don’t go pokin’ around too much. And be gentle, alright? My back ain't what it used to be. Just get it over with, doc. I got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Breathing sounds are a little diminished at the bases of both lungs. Significant pitting edema bilaterally. I’m noting 2+ pitting edema in both ankles. Alright, Mr. Miner. It does appear you have significant swelling, as you described. Given your history and the findings of the exam, it could be a number of things. We need to get some blood work done to check your kidney function and rule out other causes. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a urinalysis.
PATIENT: Blood work, huh? Great. Just what I needed. More pokin' and proddin'. Look, doc, is this serious? Is somethin' really wrong with me? You're makin' me nervous now. And what's all this talk about kidneys and… panels? I just want my face and legs to stop puffin' up! Can’t you just give me somethin’ for it? A pill or somethin’?
DOCTOR: Mr. Miner, it’s too early to say definitively what’s going on. The blood work will help us determine the cause of the swelling. It could be something simple, like fluid retention, but we need to rule out more serious conditions, such as heart failure or kidney disease. I understand you want a quick fix, but we need to be thorough. I'm not going to prescribe anything without knowing what's causing the problem. It would be irresponsible. I’ll order the blood work now, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. Can you get to the lab easily?
PATIENT: Lab, huh? It’s… down the street, I guess. But I don’t drive anymore. My wife… she always took me. Now… I gotta get a ride. This is a whole ordeal, isn’t it? Just to find out why my face looks like a balloon. Fine. I’ll get someone to take me. But you better have those results back quick, doc. I ain’t got all day. And… is this gonna cost me a fortune? I ain't exactly flush with cash, you know. Being a widower isn't cheap.
DOCTOR: The lab is at 14 Oak Street. The cost will depend on your insurance coverage… which you said you don’t have. We do have a financial assistance program; I can give you information about that after the results are back. We'll discuss options then. The results typically take 24-48 hours. Schedule a follow-up appointment with my office as soon as you have had the blood work done. Do you have any other questions for now?
PATIENT: Financial assistance… great. Just what I needed, more paperwork. No. No more questions. Just… get me out of here. I need to go lie down. And try to stop lookin’ like a pufferfish. That's all. Just… that's all. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Miner. Get a ride to the lab, and we’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
