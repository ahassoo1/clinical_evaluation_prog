DOCTOR: Hi Triana, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's… embarrassing. I’ve been dealing with this for weeks now, and nothing seems to help. Just… constant diarrhea. It's really disruptive, and frankly, I don’t have time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, that is disruptive, and you’re right to get it checked out. It’s good you came in. “Constant diarrhea” – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Ugh, like… all day. Not every second, but most of the day. And it's… watery. Really watery. I’ve tried everything over the counter – those things for upset stomachs, Imodium, even just… plain rice. Nothing stops it for long. And I’m not eating anything weird, you know? Just normal food. It's not like I went on some crazy trip and ate something bad. I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, "most of the day," watery, and not responding to over-the-counter meds. And you haven't had any recent travel or changes to your diet?
PATIENT: No travel. Diet's been… the same, pretty much. I eat what I always eat. Salmon, rice, vegetables… normal things. Look, I'm a practical person. I paint houses for a living, I don’t have time to sit around and analyze every single bite of food. It's just… happening. And it's really inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Right, understandable. So, it sounds like this came on gradually, without any obvious trigger. And it's impacting your work?
PATIENT: Impacting? It's ruining it! I can’t be climbing ladders when I have to… well, you get the picture. I had to send a crew home yesterday. It's costing me money. I just need a quick fix, honestly. I don’t have time for a long investigation.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your frustration, and I want to help. A “quick fix” is ideal, but we need to rule out anything serious before we just throw something at it. Let's try to get a better picture of things. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Absolutely not. Look, I told you, I’m a practical person. I would know if there was blood. I'm not stupid. It's just… water. A lot of water. Are you suggesting I have something serious? Because if you are, you should have asked me that right away. I don’t have time for… guessing games.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re right to ask. I don’t mean to imply anything serious, but it’s my job to rule things out. No blood is good. Have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: No fever. Maybe a little queasy sometimes, but nothing I wouldn’t just… push through. I don’t get sick easily. And no, I haven’t thrown up. Honestly, it's just the diarrhea. That’s it. It's like my insides are… leaky. Is that a medical term? Probably not. Just… constantly running to the bathroom. Look, can we just… get me something to stop it? Please? I have a job to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no vomiting, just the diarrhea. It sounds like you've been dealing with this for a while. I want to do a quick exam, just to listen to your abdomen and check for anything obvious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But make it quick. I have a crew waiting on me. And please don't tell me I need to... give a sample or anything. I’ve already dealt with enough of this. Just… listen, and tell me what I need to take to make it stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, no sample today. Just a quick listen. If you could lie down on the exam table, that would be great. I'm just listening for any unusual sounds. Okay… sounds are a little hyperactive, but not dramatically so. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness to touch that I can feel. No masses. Alright. Now, have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? No. If anything, I've been… trying to eat more to make up for… well, you know. It's not like I'm wasting away or anything. Look, I'm a normal weight. I’m strong. I climb ladders for a living. I don’t have time for… weakness. Is this going to take much longer? I really need to get back to work. I have a reputation to maintain.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No weight loss. And you sound very healthy and active, which is good. Given what you've told me, it sounds like you might have a case of infectious gastroenteritis, or maybe some Irritable Bowel Syndrome flaring up. To be on the safe side, though, I'd like to run a stool sample, just to rule out any parasites or bacterial infections. It's a quick test and will give us a more definite answer. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A stool sample? Seriously? I just told you, I've dealt with enough of this already! Look, I'm a busy person. I don’t have time to be collecting… specimens. Can’t you just give me something to stop it? An anti-diarrheal? Anything? I'm losing money every minute I’m here. I don’t need a diagnosis, I need a solution. Are you even listening to me?
DOCTOR: I am listening, Triana. And I understand your frustration completely. I want to help you get back to work as quickly as possible. But it’s important to rule out anything serious before I prescribe anything, especially if this has been going on for weeks. A stool sample is the best way to do that. It's a small inconvenience that could save you a lot of trouble down the road. If you're really unwilling to do a sample today, I can prescribe an anti-diarrheal medication to help manage the symptoms temporarily. But I strongly recommend we follow up with that stool sample. And I'd like to discuss some dietary changes that might help, even if it's just for a short time. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Give me the stupid pills. But if this doesn't work, I’m not coming back. And don’t bother lecturing me about my diet. I know what I'm doing. Just… give me something to stop it. Now. I have a job to do. And frankly, I'm wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm prescribing you Loperamide, 2mg after each loose stool, maximum 8mg in 24 hours. It's over-the-counter, so you can continue to get it easily if needed. However, please be aware that this will only manage the symptoms. We still need to figure out why this is happening. I also recommend staying well-hydrated with clear fluids like water or broth. If you experience any fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool, please go to the emergency room immediately. I’m going to print out some information about managing diarrhea and a list of foods to avoid while you’re experiencing symptoms. And I strongly encourage you to reconsider the stool sample. It’s the best way to get a definitive answer and prevent this from happening again. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
