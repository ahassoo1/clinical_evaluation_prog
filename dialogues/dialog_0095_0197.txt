DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarrotta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Just getting a card so I can drive for… well, a ride-share service. They need a commercial driver medical card, you see. I hope this doesn't take too long, I have a lot on my plate.
DOCTOR: I understand. A commercial driver’s license physical. Yes, we do those. It's a fairly standard exam, but it is more thorough than a regular check-up. We need to make sure you meet the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration standards. Let's start with some basics. Do you have any current medical conditions – anything at all – that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… Well, I had a hip replacement about ten years ago, but it healed up just fine. No problems with it since. And I get a little arthritis in my hands sometimes, especially when it’s cold. Other than that… not really. I take a little something for my blood pressure, but the doctor’s been happy with it. Does that count as a condition?
DOCTOR: Okay, hip replacement ten years ago, arthritis in the hands, and medication for blood pressure. Yes, the blood pressure medication is something we need to document. What medication are you taking for your blood pressure, and what’s the dosage?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. Every morning with my breakfast. And… the doctor changed it once, a few years back, but we went back to this dose. It seems to work best. I get it filled at the pharmacy down the street.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril 20mg daily. Good. And any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, tried everything, really. Never had a reaction to anything. Not even bee stings when I was a kid. Lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Have you ever had any serious illnesses or surgeries other than the hip replacement?
PATIENT: Well, when I was younger, maybe in my thirties, I had a really bad case of pneumonia. I was in the hospital for a week. But that was… a long time ago. Other than that, just the usual things – colds, flu, nothing major. And I had my gallbladder out, but that was… oh, goodness, must be thirty years ago now. Does that count? It wasn’t a big deal.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia, gallbladder removal, both a long time ago. We’ll note those. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had diabetes, towards the end of her life. And my father… he had heart problems. He passed away when he was fairly young, maybe in his sixties. My brother is fine, as far as I know. He lives in California, we don't see each other much. And my sister… she had high blood pressure, like me. Is that what you're looking for? Long list, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, diabetes in your mother, heart problems in your father, high blood pressure in your sister. That's helpful. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never smoked a day in my life. Alcohol… maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but very rarely. And drugs? Absolutely not. I’m a very careful person. Always have been. Never touched those things.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Alright, Ms. Sciarrotta, let’s do a quick physical exam. We'll check your blood pressure, pulse, vision, hearing, and do a basic neurological assessment, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we’ll need to do a urine test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Just get it over with quickly, if you don’t mind. I have appointments this afternoon. But yes, go ahead. What do you want me to do first?
DOCTOR: Alright. First, could you please step on the scale for me?
PATIENT: There. Done. Is that all?
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, if you could sit on the examination table, please. I’m going to start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 142 over 88. Pulse is 76 and regular. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let’s check your vision. Could you read the letters on this chart for me?
PATIENT: Okay… um… let’s see… the top line… is that E? Yes. And then… F… P… T… D. Is that right? I used to have perfect vision, you know. But it's getting harder these days.
DOCTOR: That’s fine, Ms. Sciarrotta. Vision has changed some, but it's not unexpected at your age. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Again… and again. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s a soft murmur, and likely benign, but we should note it. Lungs are clear. Now, a quick neurological exam… could you follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, I'm following it. See? Perfectly fine. This is taking a long time, Doctor. Are we almost finished? I really need to go.
DOCTOR: Almost finished, Ms. Sciarrotta. Just a few more quick checks. I need to palpate your abdomen and check your peripheral pulses. Pulses are good and equal in all extremities. Abdomen is soft and non-tender. Alright, just one last thing. I need a urine sample. There’s a cup in the bathroom. Please try to collect a mid-stream sample, and bring it back to me when you're ready. It's important for the screening.
PATIENT: Fine. A urine sample. I’ll be right back. Here. Is that everything? I really do need to get going.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I’ll send this to the lab for analysis. Okay, Ms. Sciarrotta, based on this preliminary exam, and your history, there are a few things we need to address. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and the murmur needs to be monitored. The urine sample will help rule out any underlying infection. I’m going to recommend a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician to discuss these findings in more detail, and potentially start medication to control your blood pressure. Depending on their recommendation, a cardiology consult might be advisable to further evaluate the heart murmur. For the commercial driver’s license, I will need to complete this medical examination report form. Based on the current findings, I'm not able to certify you at this time, until we get these issues addressed. I'll explain the process to you. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Not able to certify me? You mean I can't drive right now? After all this time? This is ridiculous! I feel perfectly fine. A little high blood pressure is no reason to stop me from working. And a murmur? Everyone has murmurs! So, what do I need to do? See my regular doctor? And maybe a… a heart doctor? How long is this going to take? I need to work! I have bills to pay. And what about this report form? Will they let me drive while I’m waiting for the doctor?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Sciarrotta. It’s not my intention to cause you hardship, but the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration has strict guidelines for commercial drivers to ensure public safety. Unfortunately, with the elevated blood pressure and the presence of a heart murmur, I cannot ethically certify you at this time. It’s not a matter of if you feel fine, but ensuring there are no underlying conditions that could compromise your ability to drive safely. Regarding the timeline, that will depend on your primary care physician's availability and their recommendation for cardiology evaluation. I can provide you with a referral to a local cardiologist, if you wish. They will determine the need for further testing, such as an echocardiogram or stress test. As for the medical examination report form, it will indicate that further evaluation is needed. The decision on whether you can drive while waiting for the evaluation is ultimately up to the licensing authority. I recommend contacting the Department of Motor Vehicles directly to inquire about their specific policies. I can provide you with their contact information. I apologize for the inconvenience, Ms. Sciarrotta, but these are the necessary steps to ensure your safety and the safety of others. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Fine. I’ll see my doctor. But this is going to be a mess. Okay. I think that’s all. Just… let me get out of here. Thank you… I guess.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Sciarrotta. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you all the best. .
