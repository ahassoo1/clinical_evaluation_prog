DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stepbro. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Oh… well, it’s a bit embarrassing, honestly. It’s… pain. Down there. In… well, you know. My… testicles. It started a few days ago, I think. It’s hard to say exactly when. Everything feels a bit… fuzzy lately.
DOCTOR: "Fuzzy" is not particularly helpful, Ms. Stepbro. We need specifics if I’m to be of any assistance. A few days ago… was that before or after the holiday weekend?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. The holiday… was that the Fourth of July? Yes, I believe it was after the Fourth. I… I did spend some time gardening, if that matters. I was trying to get the tomatoes in before the heat really hit. Everything is just… a little bit lost, you see? It’s not that I want to be vague, Doctor, it’s just… difficult to recall things clearly.
DOCTOR: Gardening. Right. And this pain… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. It’s… not always there, but when it is, it’s… uncomfortable. A dull ache, mostly. Sometimes it feels… heavy? It’s hard to describe. And it seems worse when I’ve been… active. Like, walking a lot or… you know… doing things around the house.
DOCTOR: "Doing things around the house" is not a diagnosis, Ms. Stepbro. Is the pain radiating anywhere – to your groin, your lower back, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh! Well… yes, actually. Now that you mention it, sometimes it feels like it goes up into my… lower stomach. Not a sharp pain, but… an ache. And maybe a little in my… groin, yes. It’s… not awful, Doctor, but it’s concerning. I haven't had this sort of thing before, and I… well, I worry.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any swelling, redness, or discharge accompanying this pain?
PATIENT: Oh goodness. Swelling… no, I don't think so. Redness… I haven’t really looked, to be honest. I… I'm not one for self-examination, if you understand. And discharge… no, certainly not. I would have noticed that, wouldn't I? It just… hurts. And I'm a little tired, now that I think about it. But I'm always a little tired.
DOCTOR: "Always a little tired" isn’t particularly helpful, Ms. Stepbro. We need to focus on what is new and relevant. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a good question. My memory… it’s been playing tricks on me. I think I had high blood pressure, years ago? The doctor put me on something for it, but I don’t remember what it was called. And… I’ve had a little arthritis in my hands for a long time. Nothing serious. I also get… little dizzy spells sometimes. But those come and go. Honestly, Doctor, I’m afraid I’m not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Right. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Oh! Yes. Years and years ago, when I was quite young, I had my appendix out. And… I think I had some… something done on my knee? After a fall. But it was a long time ago, and I don’t recall the details. I was rather… out of it, you see.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any family history of… testicular issues, or any cancers, for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh. Family history… That's a difficult one. My mother… she had something, years ago. But I don’t remember what it was. Something with her stomach, I think. And my brother… he was always very healthy. Never sick a day in his life. As for anything specific… down there? No, I don’t recall anyone ever mentioning anything like that. It wasn't something we talked about, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… well, just the occasional ibuprofen for my hands. When the arthritis flares up. And sometimes a little something for sleep, if I’m really restless. But not regularly. I try to avoid medication as much as possible. It makes me feel… sluggish, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stepbro. I’m going to need to perform a physical exam. Please lie down on the table. We’ll start with an abdominal exam and then I’ll need to examine the… affected area. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Oh… well, no, no objections. Though, Doctor, if you don't mind me saying, I am a little… self-conscious. But if it's necessary, then of course. Please be gentle, if you would. It's just… a sensitive area, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course. Please lie flat, and let me know if you experience any discomfort. I’ll start with the abdominal exam. Now, tell me, does this cause you any pain?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes. A little. Not terrible, but… uncomfortable. It’s a dull ache. Right… about there. It feels… a bit tender.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now, if you could relax… I’m going to examine the scrotum. Please let me know immediately if this is painful. Now, does this cause you any discomfort?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes… yes, that’s… tender. There. On the… left side. It’s… a bit of a sharp pain now. Not awful, but… definitely noticeable. And… it feels… swollen. Is that normal? Oh dear, I'm terribly sorry if this is difficult.
DOCTOR: There is some definite tenderness and a slight enlargement on the left side. It’s firm to the touch, and not entirely… smooth. I’m going to need you to lie flat, and I’m going to transilluminate the scrotum. Does that cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Ooh… yes, that’s… a bit strange. A little uncomfortable, but… not painful. It’s just… a weird feeling. It feels… brighter on one side than the other? Is that what you’re looking at? I’m terribly sorry if I’m being difficult, Doctor. I just… don’t like being touched down there, you see.
DOCTOR: The transillumination is not entirely clear on the left side, Ms. Stepbro. Given the tenderness, enlargement, and the lack of clear transmission of light, I am concerned about the possibility of a testicular torsion or a mass. It requires further investigation. I am going to order a scrotal ultrasound and a complete blood count. Given your history of dizziness and fatigue, I would also like to check your PSA levels. I strongly recommend you see a urologist as soon as possible. I can provide a referral. This requires prompt attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A torsion? A mass? That sounds… terrible. Ultrasound… blood tests… a urologist? Is it… is it serious, Doctor? I… I don’t understand. Is it cancer? Oh dear, I’m terribly frightened now. Prompt attention… what does that mean? I… I need to sit down.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stepbro, I understand your anxiety, but it's important not to jump to conclusions. A "torsion" means the testicle has twisted, cutting off blood supply, which requires immediate intervention. A "mass" could be a variety of things, benign or otherwise. The ultrasound will help us determine the cause of the enlargement and tenderness. The blood tests will give us a broader picture of your overall health and help rule out other possibilities. "Prompt attention" means you should schedule an appointment with the urologist within the next 24 to 48 hours. It's better to be safe than sorry. I will fax a referral to Dr. Ramirez, a highly respected urologist in the area. His office will contact you to schedule an appointment. I cannot definitively diagnose you without further testing. However, given your symptoms, it is important to rule out serious possibilities. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: Dr. Ramirez… alright. Within 48 hours… I can do that. But… will it hurt? Will I need surgery? And… what if it is something serious? Oh dear, I haven't told my family… they wouldn’t understand. Will I be able to… to work? I’m a woodworker, you see. It’s… it’s all I do. I can’t afford to be sick.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stepbro, I understand your concerns, but I cannot answer those questions definitively without the results of the ultrasound and the urologist's evaluation. The possibility of surgery depends entirely on the diagnosis. If it is a torsion, surgery is likely necessary. If it’s something else, the treatment plan will vary. Regarding your work, I cannot advise you to continue working until Dr. Ramirez has examined you and provided a diagnosis. Lifting heavy objects or straining could potentially exacerbate the condition. I can provide a note for your employer stating that you require a medical evaluation and may be unable to perform certain tasks. I will fax the referral to Dr. Ramirez immediately. His office will contact you to schedule an appointment. Please follow up with him as soon as possible. Do you have any further questions before I leave?
PATIENT: No… no, I don't think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For… for everything. Will… will someone call me with the results? Or do I have to… to call them? Oh dear, I'm so confused. And… and frightened.
DOCTOR: Dr. Ramirez’s office will contact you to schedule the appointment. They will let you know what, if any, preparations you need to make for the ultrasound. You will likely receive a call from the lab to schedule the ultrasound, and you should receive the results from them within a few days. I have provided you with all the information I can at this time. Follow up with Dr. Ramirez as soon as possible.
PATIENT: Oh dear… oh dear, oh dear… what am I going to do?
