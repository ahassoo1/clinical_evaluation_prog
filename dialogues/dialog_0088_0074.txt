DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. It’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Venna is fine. Well, my blood pressure's been acting up, that's what the nurse said, anyway. Been a little high, she told me. I don't rightly know what all that means, but she said I needed to see you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Venna, that’s good to know. “Acting up” is a perfectly fine way to put it. And you're right to ask what it means. High blood pressure, or hypertension, just means your heart is working a little harder to pump blood through your body. It’s very common, especially as we get older. Do you feel any different than usual?
PATIENT: No, not really. I feel…old, like always! But no, no headaches or anything. Just tired sometimes, but I'm ninety years old, so I figure that's just part of it. My husband used to say I was always a little dramatic about being tired. He passed a few years back, bless his heart.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you haven’t noticed any new or concerning symptoms. And it’s perfectly normal to feel tired at ninety! I’m sorry to hear about your husband. To get a better picture of what's going on, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Well, I haven't been to a doctor in…oh, goodness, a long time. Just for check-ups, mostly. Nothing serious ever. The nurse took down a list of my medicines, I think. I take somethin' for my arthritis, and a little pill for my water. And somethin' else... oh, dear, my mind ain't what it used to be. I got private insurance, if that matters. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That’s okay, don’t worry about remembering everything right now. We can go through it together. The nurse likely has a good list, and we’ll double-check it. Knowing about the insurance is helpful, thank you. Okay, I see here you take celecoxib for arthritis, furosemide for fluid retention…and amlodipine for blood pressure. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Celeco… somethin’? Furose… oh, yes, the water pill! And… amlodipine. That sounds right. Yes, those are all the ones I take. Every morning with my breakfast. Sometimes I forget and take ‘em at supper, but mostly I remember. Does that amlodipine help the blood pressure, then? Is that why I'm here?
DOCTOR: Yes, amlodipine is a blood pressure medication. And that’s a good question—we're here today to see if it's still working effectively, and if your current dose is the right one for you. Sometimes medications need to be adjusted over time. The nurse took your blood pressure, and it was a little elevated. I'd like to check it myself, just to confirm. Then, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick exam. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds…fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. My heart's been thumpin' alright for ninety years, so I reckon it can handle bein’ listened to. Just hurry it up a bit, if you don't mind. I got a peach cobbler in the oven I need to check on later. Wouldn’t want to burn it.
DOCTOR: I completely understand! Peach cobbler is important. I’ll be as quick as I can. Okay, just relax your arm for me. I’m going to inflate this cuff, and you’ll feel some pressure… there we go. Okay, your blood pressure is 158/92. That is a bit elevated. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath for me…
PATIENT: 158… what does that mean? Is that bad? I don't understand numbers. Just tell me if it's somethin’ I need to worry about. I’m listenin' for you, Doctor. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: It’s okay to not understand the numbers, Venna. 158/92 is higher than we'd like it to be. Ideally, we want it under 140/90, especially with your history. It doesn’t mean you need to panic, but it does mean we need to figure out how to get it down. Take deep breaths for me… yes… everything sounds clear right now, no extra noises. Your heart rate is a little fast, but that could be from anxiety about the blood pressure reading, or just normal for you. Do you ever feel short of breath?
PATIENT: No, not usually. I get a little winded climbin’ stairs, but that's just old age, I reckon. My breathin’s always been alright. Sometimes when it's real humid, I feel a little tight in the chest, but that's the weather. My mama always said I was sensitive to the weather. She was Cherokee, you know. A full-blood. I get my sensitivity from her, I suppose. Is that important? Does that have somethin’ to do with it?
DOCTOR: That's good to know about your family history, Venna. Sometimes certain conditions are more common in certain groups, and it’s helpful information. Sensitivity to weather can absolutely affect breathing and chest tightness, especially with humidity. Everything feels normal here, no tenderness. Your pulses are a little weak, but that’s not uncommon with your age and medications. Okay, everything sounds good physically. Based on your history, medications, and the blood pressure reading, it seems likely that your current medication dose isn't quite enough to control your blood pressure. We have a few options. We could increase the dose of your amlodipine, add another medication, or rule out any other underlying causes. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Addin' more pills sounds awful. I already forget takin’ the ones I got! Can’t we just…try somethin’ else? Maybe I just need to lay off the salt? My daughter always tells me I use too much salt. She worries somethin’ fierce. I don’t know… I don't want no more pills if I can help it. Is there anything else we can do? Like…eat somethin’ special? Or exercise? Though at ninety years old, exercise ain’t exactly easy. Just…no more pills, Doctor. Please.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Venna. You're right to be concerned about adding more medication, especially if it’s difficult to remember. And you're absolutely right to consider lifestyle changes first. Reducing salt intake is a very good place to start. That can definitely make a difference. Also, even gentle activity, like walking for 10-15 minutes a day, can help lower blood pressure. We can work with a nutritionist to create a meal plan, and I can have the physical therapist give you some exercises you can do at home. Before we make any changes, I want to rule out any other possible causes for your high blood pressure. I'm going to order a basic blood panel to check your kidney function, thyroid levels, and a few other things. It's just to be thorough. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… oh, dear. I hate needles. Always have. But… if you think it’s important, I suppose I can do it. But quick, now! And gentle! My veins ain’t what they used to be. Just…promise me you'll be quick. And gentle. And then maybe we can talk about that peach cobbler recipe? I got a secret ingredient…
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Venna. I promise I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will make it as comfortable as she can. We’ll get it over with quickly. Alright, I've ordered the blood work. You can go to the lab just down the hall, and they'll take care of you. It should only take a few minutes. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on the best plan for you. And yes, I absolutely want to hear about your peach cobbler recipe! A secret ingredient, you say?
PATIENT: That's good. It's a little bit of almond extract. My grandma taught me. She said it reminded her of the blossoms back home. Anyways, I’ll go get that blood work done. Tell me when you’ll have the results. And thank you, Doctor. You've been real patient with an old woman.
