DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I’ve been… unusually thirsty lately. And hungry, too. It’s just… more than usual, if you understand. It’s been going on for a few weeks now, I suppose. I was hoping to get it checked out, if that’s alright. I’d rather be getting back to work, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Unusual thirst and hunger for a few weeks. Alright. And when you say “more than usual,” can you quantify that a bit?
PATIENT: Quantify…? Right. Hmm. Well, I usually have a pint of water with my lunch, maybe another small glass in the afternoon. Now I’m going through… easily a litre, perhaps more, before dinner. And I find myself snacking constantly. Not big portions, just… needing something. Biscuits, a piece of fruit, that sort of thing. It’s… irritating, really. It disrupts my routine.
DOCTOR: So, significantly increased fluid intake – a litre before dinner, compared to a pint with lunch – and constant snacking. Do you feel like you’re losing weight despite the increased intake?
PATIENT: That’s a fair question. I… haven’t actually weighed myself recently, to be honest. My ex-wife used to keep track of that sort of thing. But… I think my trousers feel a bit looser. It’s hard to say for certain. I've been busy with work, and… well, I haven’t really noticed, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. Possible unintentional weight loss. And have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Urination…? Hmm. I suppose I’ve been going to the bathroom more often, yes. Especially at night. I usually don’t need to get up, but the last week or so… maybe two or three times a night. It’s not painful or anything, just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Increased frequency of urination, particularly nocturia… Okay. And are you experiencing any blurry vision, fatigue, or slow-healing sores?
PATIENT: Blurry vision… now that you mention it, my eyesight has been a bit off lately. I put it down to staring at spreadsheets all day, to be perfectly honest. Fatigue… yes, I suppose I am a bit more tired than usual. But again, work's been demanding. Slow-healing sores… no, nothing like that. I haven’t cut myself or anything recently. I haven’t even had a paper cut!
DOCTOR: Let's take a look at your medical history. Alright, I see you haven’t had a comprehensive metabolic panel in over a year. Given your symptoms – increased thirst, hunger, urination, potential weight loss and fatigue, and blurry vision – I’d like to order some blood work to rule out diabetes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Good heavens. My mother had that, actually. Yes, blood work sounds sensible. Anything to get to the bottom of this. As long as it doesn’t take too long, if you understand. I have a delivery schedule to maintain.
DOCTOR: Alright, I've ordered the blood work. It will require a fasting sample, so you’ll need to refrain from eating or drinking anything – except water – for at least eight hours beforehand. We can schedule it for first thing tomorrow morning. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, and the results usually come back within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I also want to check your blood pressure and do a brief neurological exam, just to be thorough. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: First thing tomorrow sounds… manageable. Yes, blood pressure and a neurological exam, if you think it’s necessary. Just… please be quick about it, if you would be so kind. I really do need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Please sit here and relax. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes and do a quick assessment of your sensory function. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Right. Reflexes… I haven't had my reflexes checked since school, I believe. Oh, that’s… surprising. Yes, I feel that. Sensory function… Yes, I can feel that. And that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Everything seems… within normal limits, although I do note a slightly diminished response in your left lower extremity. It’s subtle, but worth noting. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, while we wait for the blood work results, I recommend you try to limit your sugar intake as much as possible and stay well-hydrated. I also want you to monitor your blood glucose levels at home if you have a glucometer. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A glucometer… no, I don’t have one of those. I suppose I could purchase one, if you think it’s necessary. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not really one for self-diagnosis. I just want to know what’s wrong and how to fix it. Limiting sugar… I suppose I can manage that. And to be frank, I'm not particularly fond of sweet things. Is there anything else I need to be aware of? And can I get back to work now?
DOCTOR: Alright. We can discuss that with the nurse. I'll write a prescription for a basic glucometer and some test strips. The nurse will show you how to use it properly. At this point, it’s premature to give a definitive diagnosis, but your symptoms are certainly suggestive of diabetes, or at least pre-diabetes. The blood work will give us a clearer picture. For now, avoid sugary drinks, processed foods, and excessive carbohydrates. And no, I don’t recommend strenuous activity until we have the results. You can head back to work, but please follow these instructions carefully. We will contact you as soon as the results are available. Do you have any further questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Avoid sugar, no strenuous activity… and wait for the results. Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your time, though I must admit, I'm eager to get back to my schedule. I trust you’ll contact me promptly?
DOCTOR: Yes, we will contact you as soon as the results are available. The nurse will provide you with instructions on how to access your results online, as well. Have a good day, Mr. Erxleben.
PATIENT: Good day to you as well, Doctor.
