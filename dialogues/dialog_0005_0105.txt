DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about getting surgery. For my weight, you know? I think my wife set this up. She does most of that stuff. I just… show up. It’s a pre-surgery thing, right? I don’t really remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-surgical evaluation. Right. Your wife sounds very organized. Well, we’ll get everything sorted out. Just to be clear, are you looking into weight loss surgery?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s it. Weight loss surgery. I mean, I think that’s what it is. It's been talked about a lot at home. Honestly, Doctor, I don't remember all the appointments and what everyone said. I just know I’m… big, and it’s hard to do things. My wife thinks this will help. Is that… enough information? I feel bad not knowing more.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Kochubey. It's common to feel overwhelmed with appointments and details. We'll go through everything together. It's good your wife is supportive. First, let’s get a better understanding of your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… I think… maybe high blood pressure? The doctor mentioned something about it a while back. And I get… tired. Really tired. But I don’t know if that’s a condition, you know? I haven't really been to a doctor regularly. Mostly just when something really hurts. Does that make sense? I don’t think I have diabetes or anything like that. I like sweets, but… not that much, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, possible hypertension and fatigue. We'll need to check your blood pressure today to confirm. Fatigue can be caused by a lot of things, so we'll explore that further. And have you ever had any surgeries before?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, I don’t think so. Not that I remember. Maybe when I was little? Like… tonsils? But I really don't recall. Definitely nothing as an adult. My wife would have told me if I had, wouldn’t she? She remembers everything.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No recalled surgeries. Alright. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… My wife’s family is… healthy, I think. They eat a lot, though. My side… my mom passed away a few years ago. She had… heart problems, I think. And my dad… he’s got arthritis, bad knees. He’s always complaining. I don't really know if anyone else had weight problems. We didn't see them much.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart problems and arthritis. That's helpful. Now, let’s talk about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never. And I don’t drink, not really. Maybe a sip of wine at Christmas with my wife, but that's it. And definitely no drugs. I've never been into any of that. I work, come home, spend time with my wife. That’s about it. It’s a pretty quiet life.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That’s helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes I take something for my back. It hurts sometimes, from working. I think it's ibuprofen? The blue pills. And sometimes, when I get a headache, I take… Tylenol? The red ones. That’s about it. Nothing regularly. My wife buys them when I need them. I really don't keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey. We've covered a lot. Before we discuss potential surgical options, I need to get some basic measurements and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need. Sounds good, Doctor. Just tell me what to do. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let's get your height and weight. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs and check your blood pressure. It'll just be a quick exam. If you could step onto the scale for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay. I always feel a little awkward doing this. There. Is that what you needed?
DOCTOR: Okay, height is 155 centimeters and weight is 139 kilograms. Now, if you could have a seat on the examination table, please. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. It might be a little cold. Your heart sounds regular, but there’s a slight murmur. Nothing alarming at this point, but it’s something we’ll keep an eye on. Your lungs are clear. Now let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is elevated at 150/90. This confirms some hypertension.
PATIENT: Elevated? Is that bad? I knew something was off. My wife said I should get it checked. A murmur… that doesn't sound good, does it? What does that mean? Is this going to make the surgery harder? I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey, let’s take this one step at a time. Elevated blood pressure means it's higher than the recommended range, and we'll need to manage that. It doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t have surgery, but it’s something we need to address first to minimize risks. As for the heart murmur, it's a slight extra sound when your heart beats. It's often harmless, but it can indicate a valve problem. We'll need to get an echocardiogram – an ultrasound of your heart – to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Before we get to the surgery discussion, I want to rule out any other underlying conditions that could be contributing to your weight and fatigue. I'm going to order some blood tests to check your blood sugar, cholesterol, thyroid function, and vitamin levels. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Blood tests, echocardiogram… It’s a lot, isn’t it? I just wanted something simple. But… alright. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor. Blood tests and the heart thing. My wife will be glad you’re being thorough. She always worries. Will these tests take a long time? And… will they be expensive? We don't have insurance.
DOCTOR: It is a bit of a process, Mr. Kochubey, but it's important to have a complete picture of your health before considering any surgical intervention. The blood tests should take a couple of days to come back, and the echocardiogram can usually be scheduled within a week. Regarding the cost, I understand your concern about not having insurance. Let me see what the approximate costs are for these tests, and I'll also check if our clinic offers any financial assistance programs or payment plans. We can also explore some lower-cost options if available. I'll have my nurse, Maria, look into this for you and get back to you with the information. For now, let’s focus on getting these tests done. After we have the results, we can discuss the potential benefits and risks of weight loss surgery, and whether it's the right option for you. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Okay. That… that sounds good. If you can check on the costs, that would be a huge help. And if your nurse can explain everything… I get confused easily. Maria, you said? I'll try not to worry too much until we know more. Thank you, Doctor. It's a lot to take in, but I appreciate you explaining it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. We'll take things one step at a time. Maria will be in touch to schedule the tests and discuss the costs. She’s excellent at explaining things clearly. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to call the clinic. We’re here to help.
