DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Chilla. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It's… Chilla, yes. Marija Chilla. I received a communication from your office regarding some… paperwork. My husband thought it would be prudent to get this sorted. Something about making sure my wishes are… known, should anything happen. Frankly, I don’t see why it's necessary at my age, but he insisted. It's about advance directives, I believe?
DOCTOR: Yes, advance directives. A sensible precaution, though I agree, at 44 it’s not typically a pressing concern. Your husband, it seems, is a forward thinker. Nevertheless, it is responsible to document these things. So, to clarify, you are here to discuss establishing a living will and durable power of attorney for healthcare?
PATIENT: A… living will? Durable power of… Honestly, Doctor, I’m not entirely sure what all those terms mean. My husband used them when he explained it, but I was mostly listening for the gist. He said something about who makes decisions for me if I can’t… well, if I’m unable to. Is that correct? And what exactly is involved in setting these things up? It sounds rather… complicated.
DOCTOR: Complicated is… a relative term, Ms. Chilla. It’s less about complexity and more about thoroughness. Essentially, a living will – or advance directive, as it’s more formally known – outlines your wishes regarding medical treatment should you become incapacitated and unable to communicate them yourself. The durable power of attorney for healthcare designates an individual – usually a family member, such as your husband – to make those medical decisions on your behalf. It's about ensuring your preferences are respected, even when you are unable to voice them. We will go through a series of questions to determine what those preferences are. Now, before we delve into that, do you have any pre-existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Pre-existing conditions? No, nothing of any significance. I maintain a healthy lifestyle. I eat a balanced diet, I exercise regularly – though admittedly, not as much as I should these days – and I’ve never been one for excessive… indulgence. A touch of seasonal allergies, perhaps, and a mild headache from time to time, but nothing a little rest and a cup of mint tea can't resolve. Really, Doctor, I assure you, I'm quite well. It’s my husband who’s always fussing over something or another. He worries unnecessarily.
DOCTOR: Very well. While seasonal allergies and occasional headaches are not typically of concern, it is important to have a complete picture. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter remedies, for these or any other ailments?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely nothing. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible. A little lemon and honey for a sore throat, chamomile tea for sleep… things like that. I find most pharmaceuticals have more… undesirable side effects than the ailment they are supposed to treat. My husband keeps a supply of ibuprofen in the bathroom, for his back, but I rarely touch it. I believe in letting the body heal itself, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for natural remedies, Ms. Chilla. However, it’s important to document everything, even those occasionally used by family members. Now, have you had any major surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. I’ve been fortunate enough to avoid any such… invasive procedures. I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was quite young, but that hardly counts. A simple extraction, done by a perfectly competent dentist. Other than that, nothing. I take pride in my good health, you see. A healthy lifestyle, as I mentioned, and a strong constitution. It runs in the family.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, can you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That’s… a rather broad question, isn't it? My mother suffered from a touch of arthritis in her later years, and my father… he had high blood pressure, I believe. Nothing terribly serious. Mostly age-related ailments, really. On my husband’s side… his mother had something with her heart, I think. A valve, perhaps? He doesn't discuss it much. Honestly, Doctor, we aren't a family who dwell on… illness. It's rather unpleasant, wouldn't you agree? We prefer to focus on health and well-being.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective, Ms. Chilla. It is more pleasant to focus on wellness. However, even seemingly minor conditions can be relevant. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, or any other neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Neurological disorders? Goodness. No, not that I’m aware of. My grandmother… she was a little forgetful in her old age, but that's hardly unusual, is it? Everyone forgets things as they get older. It wasn’t anything… debilitating. She still knew who we were, and she enjoyed her garden right up until the end. My husband’s family… no, I don’t believe so. He would have mentioned it, surely, if there was something of concern. They were… quite sharp, his parents, both of them. Academics, you see. Very intelligent people.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Chilla, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! Doctor, the very idea! I find it utterly repulsive. My husband smoked when he was younger, a dreadful habit, but he quit years ago, thankfully. He says it was the most sensible decision he ever made. I have always maintained a healthy lifestyle, as I've repeatedly stated. I value my well-being, and I would never intentionally jeopardize it with such… harmful substances. A glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps, but nothing more.
DOCTOR: And how often would you say you consume alcohol, Ms. Chilla?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor, really. You're making me sound like a… a degenerate! It's not as if I'm indulging in a nightly binge! A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps two on a special occasion. Rarely more than that. My husband and I enjoy a quiet evening at home, occasionally with a nice bottle of Bordeaux. It's a civilized pleasure, Doctor, nothing excessive. Perhaps once or twice a week, at most. And usually with food! It's quite good for digestion, you know. Really, you are asking the most peculiar questions.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Chilla, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: As I mentioned earlier, Doctor, I have seasonal allergies. A little pollen, that sort of thing. Nothing life-threatening. A mild sniffle, perhaps a runny nose. I manage it with natural remedies, as I've said before. Otherwise, no. No allergies to medications, food, or anything else. I pride myself on having a rather robust constitution. I've always been able to eat whatever I please, without any ill effects. Really, Doctor, I fail to see the relevance of these questions. Are you suggesting that I have some hidden ailment? It's rather insulting, frankly.
DOCTOR: Ms. Chilla, these questions are standard protocol. It is my professional obligation to gather a complete medical history, even if you perceive them as unnecessary. It’s not a matter of suspicion, but of thoroughness. Now, before we proceed to discussing your advance directives, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A… physical examination? Now that is rather unexpected. I came here to discuss paperwork, not to be… prodded and poked! Honestly, Doctor, I think I've answered quite enough questions. I've told you repeatedly that I am in excellent health. I fail to see the point of subjecting myself to an examination when I have already provided a complete and accurate account of my medical history. I believe I’ll just take the paperwork and consult with my husband. Perhaps he can explain it to me more clearly. And frankly, Doctor, I find your line of questioning rather… intrusive. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Chilla. As you wish. I will have my assistant prepare the advance directive forms for your review. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider a physical examination. It is for your own benefit. Should your condition change at any time, please do not hesitate to contact our office.
