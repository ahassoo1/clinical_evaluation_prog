DOCTOR: Good morning, Chanz. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, to be honest, I don't really remember exactly why I booked this. Something about not sleeping well and... feeling a bit rubbish? My wife usually handled all this sort of thing, you see. It’s… been a while. But the lady on the phone said you were good with getting people sorted, so here I am.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Chanz. It happens! Sometimes just getting things checked out is a good idea. Not remembering specifics isn’t unusual, especially when things have been…difficult. "Rubbish" is a good way to put it, and not sleeping well is certainly something we can look into. Let's try to piece things together. When you say “not sleeping well,” can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Right, well… it’s not like I toss and turn all night, exactly. More like… I wake up. A lot. And I don’t really feel rested when I do get up. Like I haven't actually slept at all. It's frustrating. And I get tired… easily. I used to be able to work all day in the workshop, no problem. Now? I'm knackered by four o'clock. Don't know what it is. Probably just getting old, I suppose. Though I'm not that old. I'm only… twenty-nine. Or thirty. One of the two.
DOCTOR: Twenty-nine or thirty is definitely not "old"! It sounds like you’re describing some fatigue and disrupted sleep. It's good you're recognizing these changes. Let's not jump to conclusions. Fatigue can have lots of different causes, so we need to explore a few things. You mentioned feeling tired easily and waking up frequently. About how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… It started… shortly after… well, you know. After my wife, Sarah. It’s been… a good year, maybe a bit more? Everything sort of blurred together after that, to be honest. I was managing, just getting by, but… it’s been getting worse lately. More tired, more waking up, less interested in… well, everything, really. The workshop’s just gathering dust. I can’t seem to motivate myself to fix anything. It’s pathetic, really. A skilled craftsman, reduced to… this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Chanz. Losing Sarah must have been incredibly difficult, and it’s completely understandable that you’re still feeling the effects of that loss a year later. Grief can manifest in many ways, and fatigue and loss of interest are very common. It’s not pathetic at all; it’s a natural response to a significant trauma. Let’s explore this a bit further. Besides the fatigue and waking up, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… Let me think. My appetite’s gone a bit. Not that I ever ate much, but now I barely bother. And I’ve put on weight, strangely enough. Which is ridiculous, seeing as I’m barely eating. I suppose I'm just… snacking. Comfort eating, or something. It's biscuits, mostly. Dreadful habit. And… I’m a bit… grumpy, I suppose. Snapping at people. I don’t mean to, but it just happens. My neighbour, old Mr. Henderson, nearly got an earful last week just for asking about the weather. It’s embarrassing, really. I used to be a patient man.
DOCTOR: Okay, so loss of appetite, some weight gain despite that, and increased irritability. Those are all things we should definitely consider. It sounds like you're experiencing a combination of physical and emotional changes. It’s good you're noticing these things and being honest about them. Have you had any trouble with your concentration or memory, besides forgetting why you booked this appointment?
PATIENT: Oh, definitely. My concentration is…shot. I’ll start fixing a clarinet, get halfway through, and suddenly I haven’t got a clue what I was doing. I have to stop and rethink the whole thing. And…well, I forget things. Small things, mostly. Where I put my tools, what day it is…even what I had for breakfast. Though, to be fair, it’s usually just a biscuit. It’s… frustrating. Makes me feel useless. I used to be able to take a broken instrument apart and put it back together blindfolded. Now? It’s a struggle. It’s… degrading, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chanz. That’s helpful. Difficulty with concentration and memory, alongside the fatigue, changes in appetite and mood, and weight fluctuations… these symptoms, taken together, are giving us some important clues. Now, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask a few questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. My wife always handled the doctor’s appointments. She was very organised. I just… went to work, fixed things, came home. Never really had any need for doctors, to be honest. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing. Nothing serious. I haven't been hospitalised or had any major surgeries. Just the occasional cut or scrape from working with the instruments, but nothing that needed stitching. Honestly, I can’t think of anything. She always said I was as strong as an ox.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father… he had heart trouble, I think. Died when I was quite young. My mother… she lived a long life, thankfully. She was always a bit… anxious, to be honest. Worrying about everything. Never really had any serious health problems, though. Just a bit of arthritis in her hands when she got older. As for anyone else… I don’t really have a big family. Just a few distant cousins I haven't seen in years. I don't know anything about their health, to be honest. We weren't close. My wife’s family… they’re all quite healthy too, as far as I know. She always said they had good genes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Not really. I don't take anything regularly. Occasionally, if I get a bad headache, I’ll take a paracetamol, but that's it. My wife always said I was too stubborn to take medicine. She used to joke that I was allergic to doctors and pills. She wasn't far wrong, to be honest. I just… never needed them. Until now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chanz. No regular medications. Thank you for being so open with me. It sounds like you've been through a lot, and it’s completely understandable that you're feeling the way you are. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline and rule out anything obvious. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Whatever you need to do. Honestly, I’m not bothered. I just want to feel… normal again. Or as close to normal as I’m likely to get. Go ahead. Though, don’t expect much. I haven’t been examined since… well, since school, probably. And I wasn’t exactly a picture of health then either. Always getting into scrapes, me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure and heart rate. Then I’ll listen to your lungs and have a look in your ears and throat. We'll do a quick neurological check – just some basic tests of your reflexes and balance. And I'll feel your abdomen and listen for anything unusual. It shouldn't take long. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Not drastically high, but worth keeping an eye on. Let's listen to your heart now. The rhythm is regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s faint, but we may want to investigate that further. Your lungs sound clear.
PATIENT: A murmur? What does that mean? Is that bad? My wife never mentioned anything about a murmur. She always said I had a strong heart. Is it… serious? Honestly, you’re starting to worry me now. I just came here to get some help with my sleep, and now you're talking about murmurs and… what was it, neurological checks? I'm starting to feel a bit faint.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chanz, let's take a deep breath. It’s good you’re asking questions. A heart murmur isn't always serious. It simply means there’s an unusual whooshing sound when your heart beats. It can be caused by many things, some harmless, some that require monitoring or treatment. The fact that your wife never mentioned it doesn’t necessarily mean anything – it could have been very faint, or she may not have been aware of it. It’s important to investigate it further to determine the cause, and that’s what we’ll do. We’ll start with some blood tests and an electrocardiogram to get a better picture of your heart’s activity. Now, let's continue with the neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and balance. It's a quick assessment and will help us rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Fine. Go ahead. Honestly, I just want to know what's going on. I’m tired of feeling… rubbish. And tired. And forgetting things. Just… get on with it. But please, don't tell me I've got something awful. I don't think I could cope with that right now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Chanz. I understand. We’ll take things one step at a time. Follow my finger with your eyes, don’t move your head. Good. Now look at my nose. Excellent. Now I’m going to check your reflexes. This might feel a little strange. Good response on both sides. Now, stand with your feet together and close your eyes. A little unsteady, but not significantly so. Now, walk a few steps forward. Your gait is normal. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. It doesn't seem to indicate anything obviously concerning, but the murmur and your symptoms warrant further investigation.
PATIENT: Unsteady? That’s probably just because I haven't been doing much. I used to be so coordinated. I was a brilliant carpenter, always working with precise tools. Now… well, I’m lucky if I can manage a biscuit without dropping it. So, what happens now? Blood tests, you said? And what about this ECG thing? Honestly, it all sounds very… complicated. And expensive. I’m not sure I can afford a lot of tests. My wife… she handled all the finances too. I haven’t got a clue how much money we have left.
DOCTOR: Okay, Chanz, let’s sit down for a moment. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed, and it’s perfectly alright to be concerned about finances. We'll start with the blood tests to check your overall health, look for any signs of infection or inflammation, and assess your thyroid function. The ECG is a simple, non-invasive test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It will help us determine the cause of the murmur and rule out any underlying heart problems. As for the cost, Medicare should cover a significant portion of these tests. Our billing department will handle all the paperwork and can provide you with an estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses. We can also discuss options for financial assistance if needed. Before we proceed, I want to be upfront about my initial thoughts. Based on your symptoms – fatigue, sleep disturbances, loss of appetite, irritability, memory problems, combined with the heart murmur – I’m concerned about the possibility of depression, potentially complicated by an underlying medical condition. However, it’s far too early to make a definitive diagnosis. We need the results of the tests to get a clearer picture. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Depression? Well, that’s hardly surprising, is it? Losing Sarah… it’s been a nightmare. I just… I haven't been able to cope. I’ve been trying to pretend everything’s alright, but it’s not. It’s a long way from alright. I just wanted to sleep again. And feel… something. Anything. But… depression? You think that’s all it is? Just… feeling sorry for myself? I thought it was… physical. Something wrong with my heart, or my brain, or something. I'm a carpenter, Doctor, not a… a sad person. I build things. I fix things. I don't… fall apart.
DOCTOR: Chanz, it’s absolutely not about "falling apart," or thinking you're simply “sad.” Grief is a powerful and complex emotion, and it manifests in many different ways. It's incredibly common for people experiencing grief to develop symptoms of depression, and those symptoms are very real and can have a significant impact on your physical health. The fatigue, sleep disturbances, loss of appetite, irritability, and memory problems you’re experiencing can all be symptoms of depression, but they can also be caused by other medical conditions. That’s why it’s so important to run these tests – to rule out any underlying physical causes and to get a clear understanding of what’s going on. It's entirely possible that your depression is contributing to your symptoms, and that’s something we can treat. It's also possible that an underlying medical condition is contributing to your depression, and that’s something we need to identify and address. It's not an either/or situation. We're going to work together to figure this out, Chanz. And I want you to know that you're not alone. We have resources available to help you cope with your grief and address any underlying mental health concerns. Would you be open to discussing some options for grief counseling or therapy?
PATIENT: Counseling? Therapy? I… I don't know. I’ve never… I’m not sure I could talk to a stranger about… all this. It feels… ridiculous. And pointless. What good would it do? My wife always said I was too stubborn to ask for help. She was probably right. But… I suppose I’ve got nothing to lose, have I? I’m already feeling pretty rubbish. Maybe… maybe talking to someone would help. I don’t know. But… yes. Okay. If you think it would help. But… please. Don’t make me talk about my wife too much. It’s… too painful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Chanz. You are absolutely not obligated to talk about anything you’re not comfortable with. The goal of therapy is to provide you with a safe and supportive space to explore your feelings at your own pace. You are in control of the conversation. We have several excellent therapists on staff who specialize in grief counseling. I can provide you with a list of their names and contact information, and you can choose someone you feel comfortable with. You can also schedule a brief consultation with them to see if they’re a good fit before committing to therapy. Now, let’s focus on the next steps. I’m going to order the blood tests and ECG for you. The lab is just down the hall, and the technician will be expecting you. It shouldn't take long. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. Here’s a requisition form for the lab tests. The technician will need this, along with your insurance card. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Insurance card… right. Here. Is this the right thing? Honestly, I haven't a clue what I'm doing. Thank you, Doctor. For… everything. You've been very patient with me. I appreciate it. I just want to feel normal again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: That’s absolutely not too much to ask, Chanz. And you’re very welcome. It's my job to help you get back to feeling your best, and I’m happy to be here for you. Yes, that's the correct card. And don't worry about feeling confused – it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed when dealing with medical appointments and paperwork. We have staff available to help you with any questions you may have. Now, why don’t you head down to the lab?
PATIENT: Right. The lab. Thank you again, Doctor. I… I’ll see you later.
DOCTOR: .
