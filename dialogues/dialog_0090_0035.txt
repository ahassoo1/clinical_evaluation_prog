DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Oh, it’s these hiccups, you see. They just won’t stop. It’s been… well, a few days now, and they’re rather bothersome. Not painful, just… constant.
DOCTOR: Constant hiccups for a few days, you say. Hmm. Alright. And when did they start exactly?
PATIENT: Let me think… it was right after I had a lovely lunch with my daughter, Leilani. August 1st, I believe. We went to that new cafe down by the harbour - the one with all the flowers? Yes, August 1st. And I think I was laughing quite a bit – Leilani was telling me about her new puppy. Perhaps that’s what started it? Though I've had hiccups before and they never lasted this long!
DOCTOR: Well, laughing can sometimes cause them, yes. Though, lasting this long isn't typical. Have you tried any of the usual remedies?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes! Everything I could think of, really. Holding my breath, drinking water upside down… my grandson, Keanu, showed me one where you eat a spoonful of sugar… that just made me feel sticky! Nothing seems to be working, Doctor. It's quite frustrating. Do you think it could be something serious? I do worry sometimes, you know.
DOCTOR: Serious is a strong word, Ms. Sucich. It’s unusual to have hiccups persisting for this long, certainly. Let’s rule out the simple things first. Have you noticed anything else accompanying the hiccups?
PATIENT: Accompanying them… hmm. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. I've been a little bit tired lately, but I usually am this time of year. It gets warm even at night, and an old woman needs her rest! My appetite’s been normal, I think. No heartburn or anything like that. Oh! And my stomach feels a little bit bloated, now that you mention it. Not painful, just… full. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Bloated, you say. Interesting. And are you taking any medications currently, Ms. Sucich?
PATIENT: Just my usual blood pressure pills, Doctor. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And a small dose of Vitamin D, because the sun isn’t as strong these days. Nothing else. I try to stay healthy, you see. I don't want to be a bother to anyone! I did have a little trouble sleeping last night, though – the hiccups kept waking me up. It's exhausting, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no allergies, Doctor. Not that I'm aware of. I've been lucky in that regard, thankfully! Though, I used to get a bit of a rash when I touched poison ivy as a child, but that was a long time ago. Honestly, I can't remember much about it now. Is that important? I just want these hiccups to go away! It’s making me feel quite silly, you know. Trying to hide them when I’m out and about.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sucich. Let’s have a quick listen to your chest and abdomen, just to be thorough. Then we can discuss some possible causes and a plan. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds sensible. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. This old body doesn't move as easily as it used to!
DOCTOR: Alright. Your lungs sound clear. Abdomen is… a little tender in the upper quadrants, but no significant masses or rigidity. Your heart rate and rhythm are regular. Bloating is present as you mentioned. Given your age, the duration of the hiccups, and the bloating, it could be something relatively minor, like trapped gas. However, prolonged hiccups can sometimes be a sign of something more serious. I’d like to order a basic blood test – just to check your electrolyte levels and rule out any underlying issues. And an X-ray of your chest, just to be certain there's nothing going on with your lungs or diaphragm.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood tests and X-rays! That sounds… rather serious, doesn't it? I suppose you must know best, Doctor. Is it something I should be very worried about? I do get anxious easily, you see. I just want to be sure it's not anything too dreadful. And will the tests take long? I promised Leilani I'd help her bake a cake this weekend.
DOCTOR: Now, Ms. Sucich, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. It's standard procedure to rule things out. These are precautionary tests. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is wrong. The blood test is quick – a few vials, and we'll have the results back in a couple of days. The X-ray is even faster – just a quick image. As for the cake, I doubt either test will interfere with your weekend plans. I'll have the lab and radiology orders sent over to you. And if the hiccups worsen – if they become painful, or you develop shortness of breath, or fever – you need to go to the emergency room immediately, understand?
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Emergency room if they get worse... I understand. I suppose it's better to be safe than sorry. It's just… I haven’t had an X-ray in years! But you’re right, you know. Better safe. Thank you for taking the time to look at me, Doctor. I appreciate it. Hopefully it is just trapped gas. And I'll try not to worry too much about the cake.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll get those tests done and see what they say. I'll review the results as soon as they come in. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and avoid carbonated beverages. If you don't hear from my office within a few days, please call to follow up. That’s all for now. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. Hydrate and avoid fizzy drinks… I can manage that. Thank you again for your time, and for not laughing at my hiccups! It feels silly talking about it, but it's been quite distressing. I'll go and see about getting those tests done right away.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Ms. Sucich.
