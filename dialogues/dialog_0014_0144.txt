DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. Well, honestly? Just… curiosity, I suppose. My daughter keeps telling me I need to get checked out, make sure everything's still ticking. She worries too much, that one. But, you know, figured I'd humor her. It’s not like anything hurts, exactly. Just… old age, I guess. Is that even something you check for?
DOCTOR: “Old age” isn’t a diagnosis, Ms. Calvery, though I understand what you mean. It's good you're being proactive, even if it is at your daughter's insistence. We’ll do a general check-up, see how things are functioning. Now, let's start with the basics. You said nothing hurts specifically?
PATIENT: No, nothing a good night's sleep doesn't fix. Though my knees… well, they creak something awful when I bend down. Used to be able to squat right down, pick up anything. Now? Forget about it. But it’s just… knees. Everyone gets bad knees eventually, right? It’s not like it’s a problem problem. Is that making sense? I don't even know why I'm bringing it up.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, Ms. Calvery, even if you think it’s just normal wear and tear. Knee pain is common, yes, but we still need to assess it. When did you first start noticing the creaking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I start noticing… hmm. That's a good question. Years, dear. Honestly, years. Probably… after my husband passed, I think. Everything just started feeling a bit… stiffer, you know? I wasn’t doing much gardening then, not like I used to. He always said I had a green thumb. Maybe five or six years ago? It all blurs together, after a while.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, approximately five or six years. And has it been getting progressively worse, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it definitely comes and goes. Some days I barely notice it. Other days… well, getting up from the chair is a whole production. But it’s not constant. And honestly, I try not to think about it too much. Makes me feel even older, dwelling on aches and pains. Is there a point to all these questions, dear? Not trying to be rude, just… curious.
DOCTOR: No, not rude at all, Ms. Calvery. The questions help me get a complete picture. It sounds like it’s activity-related, which is typical. Okay. Let's move on from the knees for a moment. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I feel fine, mostly. A little tired sometimes, but who isn’t? I sleep okay, eat okay… though my appetite isn’t what it used to be. I don’t get sick very often, thankfully. Oh! And my hands sometimes feel a bit… numb in the mornings. But I figured that was just from sleeping wrong. Is that something I should be worried about?
DOCTOR: Numbness in the hands is something we should definitely discuss. How long has that been happening?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Again, years, I think. It comes and goes, like everything else. Mostly when I wake up. I shake them out, and it usually goes away. It’s not… debilitating or anything. My daughter keeps telling me it could be… arthritis? Or something like that. She reads too much on the internet, that one. Always diagnosing everyone. But it doesn't hurt, just… tingly. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, intermittent numbness in the mornings, no pain. Alright. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… my husband had high blood pressure, I remember that. He was always fussing with a little pill. Me? Not much. The doctor always said I was… robust. That was a nice word. I think I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And… oh! I had a bad bout of the flu when I was maybe fifty? But other than that, I've been pretty lucky, I think. Mostly just… old age creeping up on me. Is that helpful? I'm terrible with dates, you know. Everything just blends together.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, flu, otherwise generally healthy. We’ll verify those dates through your records. Now, any medications you're currently taking – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little something for my… well, for my bones. The doctor prescribed it a few years back, said I was getting a little… brittle. And sometimes, if I can't sleep, I take one of those nighttime things… the ones with the… you know, the melatonin. But that's it. Really. I don't like taking pills. Makes me feel… strange. And sometimes I take a little something for my heartburn, but only when I eat something spicy. My daughter makes a wonderful kimchi. Though it doesn’t agree with me sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, medication for bones, melatonin, and something for heartburn as needed. Now, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat everything. My husband always said I had a cast iron stomach. Maybe I had a little reaction to penicillin when I was a child, but that was so long ago I barely remember it. Nothing serious, just a little rash, I think. I don't go near bee stings, though. Those look… unpleasant. Is that helpful? I try to stay away from things that might bother me, generally. Mostly just common sense, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible penicillin reaction in childhood. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… That's a tough one. My mother… she died young, I think, from some kind of… weakness. But I wasn't very close to my family, to be honest. My father had a weak heart, I think. He mostly just sat and… worried. And my brother… he was always healthy as a horse. Died in a car accident, a long time ago. It's all a bit… blurry, to be honest. Everything happened so long ago. Is this important? I’m terrible with remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, mother died young, cause uncertain, father had a weak heart, brother died in an accident. It's helpful to know, even if the details are unclear. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no, I don't smoke. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband used to, but he quit years ago. I don't drink much alcohol either. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner, on special occasions. And exercise… well, I used to garden a lot. But my knees, you know? It's hard to get around these days. I mostly just… sit and read. Or watch television. Is that bad? I try to stay busy, but it's hard to move around like I used to. Old age, I suppose. It creeps up on you.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, occasional alcohol, limited exercise due to knees. Okay, Ms. Calvery, I think I have a good overview for now. I’m going to do a quick physical exam. Just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your knees. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I suppose you have to poke and prod a bit. Just try not to hurt me, alright? My bones aren’t what they used to be. Go ahead, doctor. I'm ready. Though I warn you, my knees are rather stubborn.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me, please… and exhale slowly. Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, but slightly diminished breath sounds bilaterally… likely related to age. Reflexes are a little slow, but within normal limits for your age. Now, let's take a look at your knees… Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Here we go. Oof. That’s… not as easy as it used to be. There we go. A little creaky, but I can still do it. See? Not completely useless yet. Though it does feel a bit… tight. And you're pushing them, aren't you? Are you trying to find something wrong?
DOCTOR: Just assessing range of motion and looking for any signs of inflammation. There's mild crepitus – that’s the grinding sound – and slight tenderness over the medial joint line of both knees. No significant swelling or redness. Range of motion is limited, but not severely. It appears to be osteoarthritis, which is very common at your age, Ms. Calvery. It's what happens when the cartilage in your joints wears down. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. We’ll get some x-rays to confirm.
PATIENT: Osteo… what-itis? Is that serious? Will I need… surgery? My daughter will be so worried if I need surgery. She's always reading about terrible things on the internet. Is there… medicine for it? Something to make it stop creaking? I don't want to be a burden. I just want to be able to… get around, you know?
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease, Ms. Calvery, meaning it gets worse over time. However, it’s rarely something that requires surgery right away. Most cases can be managed with conservative treatments. We'll start with x-rays to get a clearer picture of the cartilage in your knees. Based on those, we can discuss options like physical therapy, over-the-counter pain relievers, and possibly injections. There's also medication that can help with inflammation. We're not going to jump to surgery right away. And we will start with the least invasive treatments first. Let's see what the x-rays show, and then we can make a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. That sounds… better. Not surgery right away is good. I really don't want surgery. Physical therapy… I suppose I could try that. Though I'm not very… flexible anymore. And injections… what kind of injections? Will they hurt? My daughter always tells me I have a low pain tolerance. I just want to be able to walk to the grocery store without feeling like an old woman. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Calvery, that is absolutely not too much to ask. We will do everything we can to help you get back to doing the things you enjoy. As for the injections, they’re typically corticosteroids, which help reduce inflammation and pain. There is a small pinch, but it’s usually very brief. Some patients experience temporary discomfort afterward, but it’s generally manageable. We can discuss pain relief options before and after the procedure if necessary. First things first, let’s get those x-rays ordered. I’ll have the nurse take you to radiology, and then we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and make a treatment plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Alright. X-rays… fine. And then a follow-up appointment. Yes, that sounds… organized. Hopefully, it won't take too long. My daughter likes to schedule things for me, and sometimes they get… complicated. I just want to get this over with. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the x-rays? Should I remove my jewelry? I always forget these things.
DOCTOR: No, you don't need to remove your jewelry for the x-rays. Just wear comfortable clothes. The radiology technician will give you specific instructions when you get there, but it’s a very straightforward procedure. They’ll simply take some images of your knees. I’ll have the nurse escort you to radiology now. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to ask. And please, don’t worry. We’ll figure this out together. Let’s get you started.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, doctor. You seem… nice. Not like some doctors I’ve met. Lead the way. And thank you again. Hopefully, the x-rays don’t take too long.
DOCTOR: .
