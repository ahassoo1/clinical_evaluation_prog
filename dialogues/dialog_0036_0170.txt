DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just...this life insurance thing. They need me to get checked out, that’s all. Want to get it over with quick if we can.
DOCTOR: I understand. A life insurance physical. We can definitely get this done efficiently. Just so I have a complete picture, is there anything specific you’ve been experiencing that prompted the insurance company to require this exam, or is it just standard procedure?
PATIENT: Standard, I think. Didn’t tell me anything special. Just sent me here. I'm pretty healthy, honestly. Work a lot, that's all. Managing that hotel keeps a man busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And how long have you been managing the hotel?
PATIENT: About... eight years now? Maybe nine. Time flies when you’re fixing leaky faucets and dealing with…people.
DOCTOR: I can imagine. It sounds like a demanding job. Before we get started with the physical exam, let’s just go through a quick medical history. Have you had any serious illnesses or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… nothing serious. Had the flu a couple times, a bad cold last winter. Broke my wrist when I was a kid, fell out of a tree. Nothing that needed a lot of time in the hospital. Doctor patched me up and I was good to go. Is that what you need to know?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had to go under the knife. Lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, thinking about your family—parents, siblings, grandparents—is there any history of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or other major medical problems in your family?
PATIENT: My dad... he had some trouble with his heart when he got older. Had to watch what he ate, stuff like that. Mom was pretty healthy, lived a long time. Grandparents…I don’t really know, to be honest. Didn’t talk about that stuff much when I was growing up.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. Knowing about your father’s heart condition is helpful. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Maybe a little sensitive to shellfish, but not really an allergy, just…makes my stomach upset sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications—prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, sometimes. Nothing regular. Doctor told me years ago to take one, so I do when I remember. Sometimes I take something for aches, if I’ve been lifting stuff at the hotel. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and ibuprofen as needed. And lastly, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No smoking, never. Couple beers sometimes with dinner, that’s it. And definitely no…other stuff. Just trying to get this insurance done, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Putney. Alright, that gives me a good overview of your history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam—check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your throat and ears. Just standard stuff for the insurance company. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. Let's just get it done. The quicker the better, right?
DOCTOR: Exactly. It won’t take long. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 88. We can recheck it later, and it could just be a bit high because of being in the office. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, although I am hearing a slight murmur. This is not necessarily cause for alarm, but we should keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear. Now, let me take a quick look at your throat and ears. Your throat looks clear, and your ears appear normal. Finally, I’m going to measure your height and weight. Okay, your height is 174 centimeters and your weight is 97 kilograms. That gives us a BMI of 34.1, which puts you in the obese category. Again, this isn’t necessarily a cause for immediate concern, but something to be aware of. Now, I’d like to order some blood work—a complete blood count, a lipid panel, and a glucose level—just to get a baseline. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Wow. That’s a lot of numbers. Obese… okay. Look, I work long hours. Don’t have much time to…exercise. Blood work sounds fine. Anything else? Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be a lot to take in, but we're just gathering information. The blood work will give us a better picture of your overall health. It shouldn't take much longer. We just need to draw some blood, and the lab results should be back within a few days. Based on your history and the exam findings, I also recommend an EKG, just to get a more detailed look at your heart function, given the murmur I heard. It's a quick and painless test. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An EKG… more tests. Look, is all this necessary for the insurance? I just need them to approve the policy, that's all. I don’t want to spend a fortune on tests I don't need.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask. Let me double-check the insurance company’s specific requirements. It appears they are requesting a complete physical assessment, which includes blood work and an EKG for anyone over the age of 45 with a family history of heart disease – which you mentioned your father had. So, unfortunately, both tests are recommended to ensure a smooth approval process. However, we can discuss the results together and determine if any further investigation is truly necessary after we have the results. We don't have to act on everything immediately. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Okay, fine. If it's what they want. Just…get it over with. Let’s do the blood work and the EKG. I have a hotel to run, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood, and then we’ll get you set up for the EKG. It shouldn't take too much longer. I’ll be right here to answer any questions you have. Let me call the nurse now. She’ll explain the process.
