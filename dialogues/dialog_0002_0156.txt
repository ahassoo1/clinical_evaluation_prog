DOCTOR: Hi Jase, it’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Ranjan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Dr. Ranjan, nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach. It’s been… not great, lately. Like, a lot of diarrhea. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s just… persistent. I think that’s the right word? I feel like I’m always running to the bathroom. I… honestly, I don’t really remember exactly when it started, but a while ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, "persistent" is a good way to put it. It sounds really frustrating to be dealing with that for a while. And you're right, it's important to figure out what's going on. So, just to clarify, you've been experiencing diarrhea for some time now – you said a while ago, can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Ugh, it is frustrating. Sorry, dates are… not my strong suit. Let me think… maybe… a couple of months? Or three? It feels like it started around the time the weather got warmer, if that helps? I really wish I could be more precise. I just… don’t keep track of that sort of thing very well. It's just been… there.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, it’s perfectly okay if you don’t have an exact date. “A couple of months” is helpful enough. And noting it started around warmer weather is useful information. Okay, so diarrhea for roughly two months, starting around the warmer weather. Has anything specific seemed to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific things… not really, I don't think? I mean, sometimes after I eat… but it’s not like a particular food. It feels pretty random, honestly. Like, I've tried cutting out dairy, then gluten, just to see, and it didn't really make a difference. My husband keeps saying it's something I ate, but… I eat pretty much the same things all the time. He worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn’t seem to be related to any specific food or dietary changes. And your husband is just looking out for you! It's good you've already tried eliminating some common culprits, that helps us narrow things down. Besides the diarrhea, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, um… yeah, actually. Sometimes my stomach feels… crampy. Not always, but when it’s really bad, yeah, really uncomfortable cramps. And… I've been feeling pretty tired lately. Just… more tired than usual. I thought it was just from work, but maybe it's related? I don’t know. And… sometimes I feel a little nauseous, but I haven’t actually thrown up. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely makes sense. Cramping, fatigue, and nausea alongside the diarrhea gives us a bit more to work with. When you say fatigue, is it just feeling generally run-down, or is it interfering with your daily activities?
PATIENT: It's more than just feeling a little tired, I think. Like, I have trouble getting through the workday sometimes. I feel really drained, and I just want to sit down. I used to have a lot more energy. And… I've been calling in sick more often, if that tells you anything. My husband has been picking up extra shifts to cover me, which… I feel bad about. He says it’s okay, but… it’s not ideal.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the fatigue is impacting your work and daily activities, and you've had to take more sick days. That's definitely something we need to investigate. Let’s talk about your past medical history for a moment. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… well, I know I had some stomach issues as a kid, but I don't really remember what they were. The doctors did a lot of tests, but they never really figured anything out. They said something about my intestines being… sensitive? And… I think they mentioned something about celiac disease, but they said it wasn’t that. I've also been told I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS, a few years ago, but honestly, I don't really know much about it. Everything feels a bit blurry, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful information, even if it’s a bit blurry. So, some childhood stomach issues, possible sensitivity or IBS mentioned in the past. And you said they ruled out celiac disease?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think they did rule out celiac. It was a long time ago, so I don’t remember the details. They did some blood tests, I think, and maybe a biopsy? I just… I was really young. My husband is the one who remembers all these things. He’s really good with details. I mostly just remember feeling sick a lot. And… he said something about me being tested for Crohn's disease too, but that came back negative.
DOCTOR: Okay, Crohn’s disease negative, celiac negative, and a past mention of IBS. That gives us a bit of a history to work with. Do you currently take any medications?
PATIENT: Um… no, not really. Just some over-the-counter stuff sometimes, like anti-diarrheal medicine when it's really bad. But it doesn't really help much, honestly. And… sometimes I take something for the cramps, but it's just ibuprofen. Nothing regular, nothing prescribed. I try to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional over-the-counter anti-diarrheal and ibuprofen as needed. And you said those don’t provide much relief. Alright. Let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don't think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of sneezing when pollen is bad, but that’s about it. No food allergies, no known drug allergies… I’m pretty sure. My husband always asks me that too, but I always say no. He’s very cautious!
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let’s briefly talk about your family history. Do any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any medical conditions, especially related to the stomach or intestines?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. My mom has… something with her stomach, I think. She’s always complaining about it. She says it’s like IBS, but she never really goes to the doctor. And… my grandma, on my dad’s side, she had something really bad when she was older. She was in the hospital for a long time, but I don’t know what it was. It was before I was born. My husband says she had something autoimmune, but… I don't really know. Everything is a bit vague.
DOCTOR: Okay, some gastrointestinal issues in your mother, and a possible autoimmune condition in your grandmother. That’s helpful to know. Now, one last thing before we do a quick exam – what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh… um… what does that mean? Like, what do you want to know? I work full-time as a sales representative, like I mentioned before. And I’m married, obviously. I don’t really go out much. Mostly just stay home with my husband. I don’t smoke, and I barely drink alcohol. Is that what you mean? I’m not sure what else is relevant.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly the kind of information I need. So, you work full-time, you're married, don't smoke, and rarely drink alcohol. No significant travel history?
PATIENT: No, not really. We went to Pakistan to visit my family a few years ago, but that was before all this started. It was a long time ago. Other than that, mostly just stay local. Nothing exciting. I think that's everything, right? I’m getting a little tired now, if that’s okay to say.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly okay to say, and it's good you're telling me. We're almost done. Okay, so no significant travel history recently. Alright, Jase, thank you for all that information. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your stomach and check for any tenderness. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Just… please be gentle? My stomach is pretty sensitive right now.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, I'm listening now. Take some deep breaths for me. Hmm… it’s a little tender in your lower abdomen, particularly on the left side. Not dramatically so, but it’s definitely sensitive to the touch. I don't feel any masses or anything concerning, but there's some mild discomfort when I press here. I also notice a little bit of… bloating. Nothing major, but your abdomen feels a bit distended. How does that feel to you, does that match what you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s… yeah, that feels about right. The tenderness on the left side is where it usually hurts the most. And the bloating… definitely. I feel like I'm always bloated, even when I haven't eaten much. It’s really uncomfortable. Like, my clothes feel tighter, even though I haven't gained any weight. It’s just… always there. It’s good to know you can feel it too, though. Sometimes I feel like people think I’m making it up, because you can't really see it.
DOCTOR: I understand exactly what you mean, and it's helpful to confirm that what you're experiencing is indeed there. It's frustrating when symptoms aren't immediately visible. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Based on everything you've told me, and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms consistent with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or IBS, possibly with a flare-up. However, given the duration of your symptoms and the fatigue you're experiencing, I'd like to order some blood tests and a stool sample to rule out other potential causes, such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and infections. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. If it helps figure things out, I'm happy to do whatever tests are needed. I just… want to feel better. And… I'd like to know what's going on, so I can explain it to my husband. He worries a lot, and I hate seeing him stressed out. So, yes, please, let's do the tests. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s completely reasonable to want answers and to ease your husband’s worries. Okay, so I'm going to write you a lab order for a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a celiac disease panel, and a stool sample for infection and inflammation. The blood tests will require a simple blood draw, which you can do at the lab across the street. The stool sample will require you to collect a small sample at home, and there will be instructions with the kit. While we wait for the results, I’m going to recommend a low-FODMAP diet for a couple of weeks. It’s a temporary diet to help reduce symptoms. I’ll have the nurse print out some information about it. It can be a little tricky, but it often helps people identify trigger foods. We'll discuss the results in about a week. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – such as severe abdominal pain, fever, bloody stool, or inability to keep fluids down – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… complicated, but I can try the diet. A low-FODMAP diet, right? And I’ll go to the lab across the street for the blood tests. Hmm… I think I understand everything. Maybe. Will the nurse explain the diet to me? It sounds a little confusing. And… what if the tests don’t show anything? What then? I’m just… worried about it all, I guess. Sorry, I’m probably asking too many questions.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all! It's good to be informed and to voice your concerns. Yes, the nurse will definitely explain the low-FODMAP diet to you in detail. She’s very good at breaking it down and can provide some helpful resources. And regarding what if the tests don’t show anything… that's a valid concern. If the tests are negative, it strengthens the possibility of IBS, but we may need to consider further investigation, such as a colonoscopy, to rule out other possibilities. We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, let’s focus on the blood tests, the stool sample, and the low-FODMAP diet. Do you feel comfortable with that plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. Blood tests, stool sample, low-FODMAP diet. And if those don’t help, then maybe a colonoscopy. I can try it. I just… I hope it doesn’t take too long to figure out what’s wrong. Thank you, Dr. Ranjan. You’ve been very helpful. And… I really appreciate you listening to me. It’s nice to feel like someone understands.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I’m glad I could help. It's my job to listen and to try to figure things out together. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the diet information and get the lab orders sorted for you. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, and I'll see you in about a week.
