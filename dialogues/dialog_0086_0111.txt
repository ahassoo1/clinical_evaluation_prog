DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Drahota, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Though, frankly, I haven't much time for pleasantries. I trust this won't be a lengthy affair? My wife is expecting me.
DOCTOR: Well, I certainly hope not. Though a proper assessment takes the time it requires. But let's try to be efficient. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It's… my skin. It’s darkening. And I’m terribly fatigued, naturally. Always tired these days. Though I suppose that comes with age. Really, it’s quite bothersome. I’ve noticed it over the past few weeks, I believe. Or perhaps months. It’s all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I just want to know if it’s something serious, and if I need to… well, do anything about it. I've been working, as always, reinforcing iron. A strong constitution, you see. Always has been.
DOCTOR: "Reinforcing iron," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. Rebar work. It’s… strenuous, of course. But I’ve been doing it for decades. Strong back, strong hands. Though admittedly, the joints aren't what they used to be. Still, I manage. It's a respectable trade, building things. Unlike some of these… modern professions. Do you need details about the specifics of my work? I fail to see how that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: It could be relevant, Mr. Drahota. Environmental factors can certainly contribute to… various conditions. But let's focus on the fatigue and the skin darkening. When you say darkening, can you describe it further?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. It’s… a sort of dull bronze color, I suppose. Not like a tan, mind you. A much less… pleasant shade. Mostly on my arms and face, I believe. Though it's difficult to say with certainty. And it's not patchy, it's… uniform. As if the entire surface is just… less vibrant. Less… healthy. It's hard to explain. Frankly, I haven't paid it much attention until it began to bother my wife. She has a keen eye for these things. Is that sufficient detail? I truly haven’t a head for these minute observations.
DOCTOR: And this fatigue… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, mostly. A deep weariness. It's not as if I'm completely incapacitated, you understand. I still go to work. Still manage the garden, though not with the same vigor as before. It’s just… a persistent drag. A lack of… oomph. It’s difficult to describe. I wake up tired, work through the day feeling drained, and go to bed hoping for a respite that rarely arrives. It’s been… well, it’s been a while. Long enough to become… thoroughly irritating.
DOCTOR: And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. No, not that I can recall. No pains, no… unusual discharges. Appetite is normal, I suppose. Though my digestion isn’t what it used to be. But that's just age, naturally. My wife makes a lovely stew, but sometimes it doesn’t sit quite right. No fever, no chills, no… Well, nothing particularly noteworthy. Honestly, I consider myself a rather robust individual, despite this… skin issue and the fatigue. Is this taking long? I have commitments, you see.
DOCTOR: If you wouldn’t mind, Mr. Drahota, I’d like to take a look at your skin more closely. And perhaps check your pulse and blood pressure. Just routine.
PATIENT: Routine, very well. Though I assure you, my pulse is perfectly strong. Years of manual labor will do that for you. Just be quick about it, if you wouldn't mind. And please, no unnecessary probing.
DOCTOR: Pulse is strong, though somewhat irregular. Blood pressure is 140/90. Skin appears uniformly bronze-toned, as you mentioned. No obvious lesions or tenderness. Have you noticed any weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Hmm. Now that you mention it… perhaps a little. My wife has commented on my portions being smaller. Though, frankly, I haven’t been much in the mood for hearty meals lately. It’s likely just the fatigue affecting my appetite. I wouldn't say I've been actively losing weight, more that I’m… not gaining any. Is that significant? I find these questions rather… alarming, frankly. Are you suspecting something serious?
DOCTOR: I’m just gathering information, Mr. Drahota. Have you had any recent blood tests?
PATIENT: Blood tests? No, not recently. I haven’t been feeling unwell enough to warrant such things. A bit of fatigue and darkened skin doesn't require a battery of tests, does it? I’ve always prided myself on my constitution. I've never been one to bother doctors unless absolutely necessary. Honestly, I'm starting to feel rather… inconvenienced. My wife will be most displeased if I'm away much longer.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I'm concerned about the fatigue, the skin discoloration, and now the potential weight loss. Given your age and the lack of a recent medical evaluation, I'd like to order some blood work. It will include a complete blood count, liver function tests, and iron studies. It's essential to rule out several possibilities, including anemia and liver problems. We also need to check your blood sugar levels. It's also important to consider potential endocrine issues. I'm also going to recommend a referral to a dermatologist to assess the skin discoloration more thoroughly. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Endocrine issues? Anemia? Honestly, this is becoming quite alarming. I simply came in for a darkened complexion and a bit of weariness, and now you’re talking about… complications! Look, I’m a practical man. I don’t need a battery of tests for every little ailment. I’ll think about it. Perhaps a vitamin supplement will suffice. I refuse to be subjected to endless probing and analysis. I came here for a quick diagnosis, not a medical ordeal. I believe I’ve wasted enough of my time. Thank you for your… attention. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, with all due respect, dismissing these symptoms could be detrimental to your health. I understand your reluctance, but I strongly advise you to reconsider. I will write a referral to the dermatologist, and the lab order will be available at the front desk. If you experience any worsening of symptoms – such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or significant weight loss – please seek immediate medical attention. .
