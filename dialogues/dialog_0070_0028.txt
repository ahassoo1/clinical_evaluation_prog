DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's this cough. It just won't go away. It's been bothering me for...oh, I'd say close to a month now. And my heart…it feels a little funny sometimes with it.
DOCTOR: A cough for close to a month, and you’ve noticed some palpitations – a feeling of your heart being a little irregular – along with it. I see. Can you tell me a bit more about the cough?
PATIENT: Yes, palpitations is a good word for it, thank you. It’s not a bad feeling, just…noticeable. The cough…it's mostly dry, not much coming up. It’s worse when I lie down, mostly at night. Makes it hard to sleep, you know? And sometimes, when I get really moving, like walking up the stairs, it gets worse too. But it's not always bad, just…there.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dry cough that’s worse when lying down and with exertion, and you’ve noticed it’s been impacting your sleep. And these palpitations...do they occur with the cough, or independently of it?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a good question. I think…mostly with the cough. When I cough a lot, then my heart feels it. But sometimes, even just resting, I feel it skip a beat or two. Not often, but it happens. I've had heart trouble for a while now, you see. The doctor back home…well, he passed away a few years back.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s helpful to know you’ve experienced heart issues in the past, and I'm sorry to hear about your previous doctor. Knowing that history is important. So, to clarify, the palpitations are most noticeable when you are coughing, but you do occasionally experience them even at rest. Are these palpitations regular, or do they feel completely random?
PATIENT: They're…irregular, I think. Not like a steady thump-thump-thump, but more…a skip, then a little faster beat, then back to normal. It doesn’t last long, usually just a few seconds. It’s just enough to make me pay attention to my chest, you know? It doesn’t hurt, just…unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, a skipping sensation followed by a faster beat, lasting just a few seconds. That’s helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the cough and palpitations?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes, my ankles. They’ve been swelling up a bit, especially at the end of the day. I thought it was just the heat, but maybe it’s something else? And I get a little breathless sometimes, walking across the room, nothing major, but more than usual.
DOCTOR: Swelling in the ankles, particularly at the end of the day, and some shortness of breath with activity. These are important details, Ms. Sadhu. Now, let's talk about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have a list of any other medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh yes, I do. Here you go. It says… high blood pressure, that's for sure. And… congestive heart failure, that’s what the doctor back home told me. And arthritis in my knees, but that's just an old person thing, I guess. I also had pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered from that.
DOCTOR: Thank you. High blood pressure, congestive heart failure, arthritis, and a history of pneumonia. This is very helpful. And are you currently taking any medications for any of these conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Let me see… Here. I take lisinopril for the blood pressure, and… furosemide, that's a water pill, for the heart. And ibuprofen for my knees when they act up. That’s it, I think.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril and furosemide, as expected, and ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, mostly. I like my platanos, you know? And my husband…well, he always said I could eat a horse! He's passed on now, but he loved to see me enjoy my food.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, before we proceed, just one more question regarding your history. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reason besides the pneumonia?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Oh! Yes. Years ago, I had my gallbladder removed. That was…oh, must be thirty years ago now. And, like I said, I was in the hospital for the pneumonia a few years back. But other than that, no, not really. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal thirty years ago, and hospitalization for pneumonia. Now, Ms. Sadhu, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your ankles to assess the swelling. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m used to doctors poking and prodding, you know? It's all part of staying alive, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm listening to your heart now. I do hear a slightly irregular rhythm, as you described, and a bit of a murmur. It's not alarming, but it is worth noting. Your lungs sound a little congested, with some crackling sounds, particularly at the bases. This could be related to the fluid buildup from the heart failure. Now, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated, 150/90, and your pulse is irregular, around 88 beats per minute. Finally, let me examine your ankles. Yes, there is some noticeable swelling, or edema, in both ankles. It's pitting edema, meaning the indentation remains for a few seconds after I press on it.
PATIENT: Oh, my. That sounds like a lot of things wrong, Doctor. Is it bad? I just want to be able to sleep at night and walk to the store without getting too tired, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Sadhu. It does sound like a few things are going on, but we can work to manage them. Based on your history and the findings of the exam, it seems your congestive heart failure is likely contributing to your symptoms – the cough, shortness of breath, palpitations, and swelling in your ankles. The irregular heartbeat we heard, or arrhythmia, could also be playing a role. Now, to get a better understanding of what’s happening, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, kidney function tests, and a BNP level, which helps assess the severity of heart failure. I also recommend an EKG to further evaluate your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to look at your lungs more closely. Would you be comfortable with those tests?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it helps me feel better, I’ll do whatever you think is best. Blood tests and X-rays…I've had those before. Just let me know when and where to go, and I’ll be there. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It makes me feel better knowing what’s going on, even if it's not good news.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sadhu. I'm glad I could explain things to your satisfaction. The lab and radiology department are located just down the hall. I’ll have the order for the tests sent over electronically, and the staff will assist you with scheduling. Once the results are back, we’ll review them together and discuss a plan of action. In the meantime, I’m going to slightly increase the dose of your furosemide to help with the fluid buildup. I will write you a new prescription for that. Also, it is important to monitor your weight daily. If you notice a sudden weight gain of more than two pounds in a day or develop worsening shortness of breath, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions about these instructions?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand, Doctor. More water pills, and watch my weight. And call if things get worse. That sounds…manageable. Thank you. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Sadhu. I'm happy to help. I’ll also send a note to your primary care physician regarding our discussion today. Is there anything else I can assist you with before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Just getting these tests done and hoping for some good news. Thank you again, Doctor Abady. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sadhu. I’m glad I could help. I wish you all the best, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. We'll follow up once the test results are available. Have a good day, and take care. .
