DOCTOR: Hi Brodie, welcome. I'm Dr. Hernandez. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in… it’s this cough. Been… a long time now, I think. A dry cough. Just… bothersome, really. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… scratchy. I don’t even know how long it’s been. A while.
DOCTOR: Okay, a long-term dry, scratchy cough. I understand. “A while” is tough to pinpoint, so let’s try to narrow it down. Has it been weeks, months, or even longer?
PATIENT: Oh dear… months, I think. Maybe longer. Time… it all feels the same these days. My wife… she always remembered things like that. But she’s… gone now. So… months, probably. Definitely since the warm weather started. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Brodie. I'm very sorry to hear about your wife. It's completely understandable that remembering details might be harder right now. Months, since the warm weather started… that’s helpful. And you said it's a dry cough - meaning it doesn't bring up any mucus or phlegm?
PATIENT: No, no phlegm. Just… air. A tickle, and then… cough. Sometimes it happens more when I lie down. Or… when it’s dusty. I used to work on cars, you know. Body work. Lots of dust. Maybe it's from that? I don’t know. Everything’s a bit… hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a dry cough, worse when lying down and with dust exposure, and you have a history of auto body work. That’s good information. Have you noticed anything else associated with the cough?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I get… tired easily, I suppose. But I'm 90 years old! That’s probably just… old age. And sometimes… a little short of breath. But again, I walk slowly. It could be anything. I don’t really… pay attention to those things much anymore. It’s just… life. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some shortness of breath, which you attribute to age, which is reasonable. Just to be thorough, is the shortness of breath happening with exertion, like walking, or is it present even when you're resting?
PATIENT: Resting, mostly. Not when I’m walking, unless I really push myself. But I don't do much pushing anymore. Just… sitting around. It’s… there, though. A little bit. Like I haven’t got a full lungful of air. Does that make sense? I don’t want to bother you with all this old man stuff. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: It doesn't bother me at all, Brodie. It's my job to listen, and I appreciate you sharing all of this with me. Okay, so shortness of breath at rest, and a cough that's been going on for months. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats along with this cough?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don’t think so. Not recently. I might have felt a little warm sometimes, but that’s just the weather, isn’t it? It’s been hot. Chills… no. And night sweats… no, no, I don’t think so. I sleep pretty soundly, actually. Or, I try to. Old man’s sleep, you know. Not very restful, but sound enough. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. And just to cover all bases, have you experienced any chest pain or noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no. My heart… the doctor checked it a few years ago, said it was fine. Weak, but fine. And swelling… sometimes my feet feel a little puffy at the end of the day, but I figured that was just… old age again! I sit a lot, you know? Doesn’t help the circulation. I don’t think it’s anything serious. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to be able to sit comfortably without coughing all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chest pain, a history of a weak but otherwise normal heart check, and some ankle swelling you attribute to inactivity. I understand wanting to be able to sit comfortably. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, and check your ankles. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Go ahead. I don't mind. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. It’s just… I’m not used to all this fuss. But if it will help me stop coughing… please do.
DOCTOR: Okay, take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. And again… I'm hearing some mild wheezing in your lungs, especially on the lower lobes. Your heart sounds a little quiet, as you mentioned, but I don’t hear anything alarming. Now, let me take a look at your ankles… A little bit of swelling here, as you noticed. Now, I’m going to check your oxygen saturation with this little clip on your finger. It’s reading 92%, which is a little low, but not critically so. Okay, Brodie, a few things I'm noting. Mild wheezing, a quiet heart, some ankle swelling, and your oxygen is a bit low. Given your age and the length of your cough, and the fact that it's getting worse, I think we need to get a chest X-ray to see what’s going on in your lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A chest… X-ray? Oh dear. I haven’t had one of those in… a long time. Is it… dangerous? I don't like hospitals much. I just want to be able to breathe again, Doctor. But if you think it's necessary… I suppose I can do it. Just… try to be quick, alright? I get nervous easily. Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to be nervous, Brodie. It's not dangerous at all, it just takes a quick picture of your lungs. It doesn’t hurt – you’ll just stand still for a few seconds while the machine takes the image. It won't require a hospital visit, we can do it right here in the clinic. I want to rule out a few things, like pneumonia or possibly some old scarring in your lungs, which could be causing the cough and shortness of breath. This will help us determine the best course of action. While we’re waiting for the X-ray results, I’m going to order some blood work to check for infection and see how well your kidneys and liver are functioning. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… oh dear. More poking and prodding. Alright, alright. If you think it's necessary. I just… I don't like needles much either. But I trust you, Doctor. You seem like a nice young woman. So… chest X-ray and blood work. And then what? Will I have to take… medicine? I don't want anything that will make me… sleepy. I like to stay alert, you know? Even if I am just sitting around. Just… fix the cough, alright? That’s all I want.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Brodie. We’ll take things one step at a time. The X-ray and blood work will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. We'll then discuss the results and come up with a plan – and I promise to consider your preference about avoiding medications that make you sleepy. We’ll start with the blood work. It’s a small sample, just a few tubes. I’ll explain everything as we go, and the nurse will be right here to help. Once we have the results, we can talk about potential causes for your cough – it could be anything from a mild infection to something a bit more chronic. I’ll also ask you a few more questions while we wait. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm… that’s a good question. I don't think so. Not that I know of. My wife always remembered those things. But I haven’t taken much medicine in… a long time. Maybe penicillin? I had a bad reaction when I was young, a long time ago. But that was… decades ago. I don't even remember exactly what happened. Just… a rash, I think. I suppose I should write that down… but I don’t have anything to write with.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible penicillin allergy noted, although it was a long time ago and the details are unclear. That's good to know, and we'll make sure to avoid penicillin-based medications. Now, let's talk about your current medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Not any prescriptions. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Vitamins… sometimes I take a little fish oil. For my joints, you know? They get stiff. But that’s it. Just the fish oil, sometimes. My daughter brings it over when she visits. It’s… orange, I think. A little capsule. I don’t take it every day, just… when I remember. It doesn't seem to do much good, though. And nothing else. Just the fish oil.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional fish oil for your joints. Good to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your smoking history?
PATIENT: Smoking? Oh dear… now that’s a long story. I… I used to smoke. A long time ago. When I was young, during the war. Everyone smoked back then. Maybe a pack a day? I don’t remember exactly. But I… I quit. A long, long time ago. Decades ago. Maybe 50 years? I don't even remember. It was… a long time ago. My wife… she made me quit. For her. It was… good of her. Does that matter? It was so long ago. I haven't touched a cigarette in… forever.
DOCTOR: It absolutely matters, but the fact that you quit so long ago is very good news. We still need to consider it in the context of your current symptoms, but it’s a significant positive. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you live alone or with someone?
PATIENT: I live alone. My wife… she passed away a few years ago. It's been quiet ever since. My daughter visits sometimes, and my grandson comes over on weekends. But mostly… it’s just me. I keep myself busy, you know? I read a little, watch TV… mostly I just sit. It's… lonely sometimes, but I manage. I don’t want to be a burden on anyone. That's why I didn't come to the doctor sooner, I suppose. I thought it was just old age.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Brodie. It's brave of you to come in now, and you're not a burden at all. It's good that you have your daughter and grandson visiting. Now, one last question for now. Have you travelled outside of the country in the past year?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Not recently. Not in… decades. I used to travel a little with my wife, years ago. But that was… a long time ago. We went to see our daughter when she lived in California, and… somewhere else. But that was years and years ago. I haven’t left this state in… a long time. Mostly I just stay here, at home. It’s… safer that way. I get tired easily, you know? Travel… it’s too much fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brodie, that gives me a good overview. Now, let's get those blood tests and that chest X-ray done. The nurse, Maria, will be right in to draw your blood. Then we'll head over to the X-ray room, it’s just down the hall. It won’t take long. While we wait for those results, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've asked me everything, haven't you? Just… fix the cough, alright? That's all I want. And… thank you, Doctor. For being so patient with an old man. It's… nice of you. I'll just sit here, and wait. I suppose. Is there… water? My mouth is a little dry.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Brodie. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this cough. And you’re not a bother at all. There’s water right over there. Help yourself. Maria will be in shortly, and I'll be back as soon as we have the initial results. Just try to relax for a few moments, alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. Just waiting… that's what I do best.
