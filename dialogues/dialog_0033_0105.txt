DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Kochubey, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Bradlee Kochubey. It’s… good to meet you, Doctor… uh… Dech-ene? Sorry, I’m terrible with names.
DOCTOR: Dech-ene is fine. And please, let’s not dwell on pleasantries. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Oh, right. The surgery. My wife… she kinda set this up. I think it's for… losing weight? I don't really remember all the details, to be honest. She said something about an evaluation. It’s… about getting the surgery, I guess. Is that right?
DOCTOR: An evaluation for bariatric surgery. Yes, I see a note from your wife. Frankly, it's rather…unconventional to present for this without a clear understanding of the process yourself, Mr. Kochubey. But we can proceed. Let’s start with why you are considering this surgery. What are your specific concerns about your weight?
PATIENT: Specific concerns… hmm. Well, I get tired easily. Just walking around, you know? And my knees… they bother me. It's hard to keep up with my kids, honestly. And… clothes don't fit anymore. It's more embarrassing than anything, I guess. I just… want to feel better. I don't know if that makes sense. I haven't really thought about it that much, my wife handles most of that stuff.
DOCTOR: "Feel better" is rather vague, Mr. Kochubey. Let's try to be a bit more precise. How long have you been experiencing this fatigue and knee pain?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. A while. Years, probably. It’s kinda just… gotten worse over time. I don't really keep track of that stuff. Maybe… the last five years? Definitely more noticeable the last couple, though. It's hard to say exactly. Everything feels a little blurry when I try to remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your diet and exercise habits?
PATIENT: Uh… diet. Well, my wife tries to get me to eat healthy, but… I like my food. I work in retail, so lunch is usually whatever's quick and easy. Fast food, sometimes. We have dinner at home most nights, she's a good cook. Exercise… not much. I walk around at work, is that exercise? I used to play soccer when I was younger, but… that was a long time ago. Really, I just sit a lot. Sorry.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Nothing regularly. Sometimes I take something for a headache, if I need it. And… I think my wife gives me a multivitamin sometimes? I really don’t keep track of those things. Nothing prescribed, though. Definitely not. I don’t really like taking pills if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Huh. That’s a good question. I don’t think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. My wife always asks before I try new foods, just in case. But I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, no. I mean, not that I know of. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Let's move on. Do you have any history of medical problems?
PATIENT: Medical problems… hmm. I think I had… strep throat when I was a kid? And I broke my arm once, playing soccer. Nothing serious, though. My wife says my blood pressure is a little high sometimes, but… I don’t really pay attention to that stuff. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time, honestly. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Oh boy. Family history… My dad, he had… heart problems, I think. He wasn’t very healthy. And my mom, she had… diabetes, maybe? I’m not really sure, to be honest. My wife knows all that stuff. We come from Iraq, originally, so… keeping good records wasn’t always easy, you know? It’s kinda blurry. Sorry. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll proceed with a physical examination. Please step onto the scale. And then we'll check your vitals. I need a clear picture, Mr. Kochubey.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Scale, right? I hope it's not one of those fancy ones that tells you everything. I'm not good with numbers, as you can probably tell.
DOCTOR: 139 pounds. And your height is listed as 155 centimeters… which is approximately five foot one. Blood pressure is elevated: 148 over 92. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, but there is some… increased subcutaneous fat. Alright. We'll need some blood work to get a better baseline. I’ll order a complete metabolic panel and a lipid panel.
PATIENT: Okay… blood work. That sounds… serious. What exactly will that tell you? And… what happens after that? I'm starting to feel a little nervous, to be honest. My wife said this evaluation would be simple, but… it doesn't feel very simple.
DOCTOR: It will give us a clearer picture of your overall health, Mr. Kochubey. Cholesterol levels, blood sugar, kidney function… basic things. It’s standard procedure. As for what happens after that… depends on the results. We’ll discuss your options. I’ll have the lab technician draw the samples now. Follow me. And try not to worry. Although, frankly, a more proactive approach to your health would be beneficial.
PATIENT: Okay… follow you. Proactive… right. I'll try. It's just… hard to keep track of everything. Is there anything I should do before the blood work? Like, should I fast or something? Or… is there a website or something I can look at to help me understand all this? I just feel… lost, to be honest. My wife is usually the one who handles all this stuff. .
DOCTOR: Yes, you should fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. No food, no sugary drinks. Water is fine. And frankly, Mr. Kochubey, relying solely on your wife is… suboptimal. I can provide you with a basic informational pamphlet on bariatric surgery, but I suggest you take some responsibility for your own well-being. The lab is just down the hall, second door on the left. .
