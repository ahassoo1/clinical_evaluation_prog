DOCTOR: Bula! And hello to you. I'm Dr. Kimm. It’s lovely to meet you, Ms. Steines. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello to you, Doctor. Just Venna is fine. Folks call me that. It's my blood pressure, I reckon. Been a little high lately, and my daughter, bless her heart, she told me I ought to get it checked. Don't want any trouble with that, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, Venna. Good on your daughter for encouraging you to come in—it’s always wise to get these things looked at. “A little high” is good information, but can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I don't rightly know how high. Just… the nurse took it a couple times when I was visitin' my daughter, and she said it was up. Made a face, she did. I don’t have one of them machines to check it myself, see? I mostly just feel… tired, I suppose. Regular tired, for an old woman. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Venna. It's very common for high blood pressure to not have obvious symptoms, especially at first. Tiredness can be a sign, though, so it's good you mentioned that. Do you know roughly when you noticed the tiredness starting?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably… spring, maybe? Around the time the dogwoods bloomed? It's been a warm one, this year. Hard to say for sure, things kinda blur together when you get to be my age, you know? But I'd say a few months now, at least. It ain't the bad kind of tired, like the flu. Just… slow. Everything feels a little slower.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of feeling slower. That's helpful. And aside from the tiredness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. My hands ache a bit sometimes, but that's just the arthritis. Old age, mostly. And my knees, don’t even get me started on my knees! But that’s been goin’ on forever. Nothing new that I can think of. I still bake, you know. Can’t stop now, even if my daughter says I ought to rest more. She worries too much, that girl.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Venna. It’s good you're still able to enjoy baking! Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… well, the doctor back in Oklahoma, years ago, he said I had a touch of the sugar. But he put me on a diet, and I lost some weight, and he said it was fine. That was… oh, Lord, must be twenty years ago now? Haven't had any trouble with that since. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains of gettin' old. No hospital stays, nothin' like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of slightly elevated blood sugar that was managed with diet many years ago. That's good information. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had a surgery. Too scared of 'em, truth be told. My mama always said I didn't have a good constitution for surgery. I just avoided it if I could. Didn’t like the thought of folks cuttin' on me.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. That simplifies things. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mama, she lived to be ninety-two. Had a good long life, she did. She had some trouble with her heart towards the end, I reckon. My daddy, he didn't live as long. Died when I was a young woman, from somethin' in his chest. My brother, he’s still livin’, but he lives out in California and I don't see him much. He's got high blood pressure, too, if I recall rightly. Seems to run in the family, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart trouble and high blood pressure. That is helpful to know. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Just the arthritis cream, Doctor. Rub it on my hands and knees. That's it. Don't take no pills, if I can help it. Always been a bit suspicious of 'em. My mama used to make all sorts of teas and remedies. Preferred those, myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications besides the arthritis cream. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had an allergy in my life, thank the Lord. I can eat anything, pretty much. I like a good peach cobbler, myself. Though my daughter says I ought to cut back on the sugar, naturally. She's always lookin' out for me, that girl. But I ain’t had any bad reactions to anything, ever.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That's good. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I live alone, in the same house I grew up in. It's small, but cozy. I spend most of my days bakin', readin', and watchin’ the birds. I don’t get out much anymore, except to go to church on Sundays and to visit my daughter when I can. I used to garden, but it's gotten too hard on my knees. Used to be able to grow the best tomatoes you ever did see.
DOCTOR: Okay, mostly quiet activities at home. Now, have you ever smoked cigarettes, or used any other tobacco products?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life, Doctor. My mama wouldn’t allow it. Said it was a nasty habit, and would ruin your lungs. And I always listened to my mama. Never seen the appeal, frankly. Always preferred a good cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Alright, no history of smoking. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. Like Christmas, or my birthday. Nothing regular, mind you. Not much of a drinker, never have been. A glass of sweet tea is more my speed.
DOCTOR: Okay, very occasional wine. That’s good to know. Alright, Ms. Steines, this has been very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just checking your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a few other things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Do what you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just get it over with, I suppose. The sooner I get this sorted, the sooner I can go home and bake a pie.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Can you please take a deep breath for me… and relax your arm. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated – 150/90. Your heart sounds regular, but a little bit fast. Your lungs sound clear, but breathing is a little shallow. I’m going to listen to your abdomen as well. Sounds normal. Overall, everything seems okay, but your blood pressure definitely needs to be addressed. I would like to order some blood work to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and a basic metabolic panel. This will help me get a clearer picture of your overall health and rule out any underlying causes for your elevated blood pressure. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. 150? That is high, isn’t it? My daughter was right to worry, then. Blood work, you say? Well, if you think it's necessary. I don't much like needles, but I reckon I can handle it if it'll help. Just… don't take too much blood, alright? I’m an old woman, and get weak easily. Where will I go to get this blood work done?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Steines. We’ll only take the amount of blood necessary for the tests. And you are right, we'll be gentle. The lab is right down the hall, room 203. They’re very good there, and they'll take good care of you. Once the results are back – usually a few days – we’ll schedule another appointment to discuss them and come up with a plan. In the meantime, I'd like you to start monitoring your diet, reducing your salt intake, and aim for at least 30 minutes of light exercise, like walking, each day. Is that something you think you could manage?
PATIENT: Diet… exercise… At my age? Well, I suppose I can try. My daughter will be pleased to hear me say that. I reckon I can cut back on the salt. I do like a good salted tomato, but I can manage. And I suppose I can take a little walk around the yard each day. It’ll be good for me, I guess. Room 203, you say? Alright, I’ll go do that now. I just want to get this all over with and get back to my kitchen. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Steines. You're doing a great job taking charge of your health. The lab staff will be expecting you, and they'll get you taken care of. And please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. I'll see you in a few days. Take care now.
PATIENT: Alright, thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I reckon I’ll be seein’ you soon.
