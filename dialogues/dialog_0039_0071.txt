DOCTOR: Hello, Karry. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It's a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it's about getting some shots, I reckon. My niece, she's trying to come here from over in Mexico, and they said I need to make sure she's got all the right vaccinations before she can get a visa. I'm a bit lost on what exactly that means, if you don't mind me saying.
DOCTOR: Of course, no problem at all. That's very thoughtful of you to want to get everything sorted out for your niece. It can be a little confusing knowing what vaccinations are needed for travel and visa requirements. So, just to be clear, she's coming from Mexico?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, that’s right. From Mexico. She's lived there for a good while now, with her mother. I just want to be sure we do everything properly. I wouldn't want any trouble with the paperwork or her getting turned away. It's been a long time since I had to think about things like this, and I want to be certain I’m doing what’s needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, that helps. And just how old is your niece, if you don't mind me asking?
PATIENT: She’s… let me see… she turned 23 just last month. July, it was. A young woman, still. She’s never been to the States before, so this is all new to both of us, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, 23. Okay. Generally, for adults coming from Mexico, we want to make sure they’re up-to-date on routine vaccinations – things like tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis... measles, mumps, rubella… Have you happened to look at her vaccination records at all, or do you know if she’s had any vaccinations previously?
PATIENT: Well, that's the problem, Doctor. She doesn’t have her records handy. Her mother says things were a bit… disorganized when she was younger, and they didn’t keep very good track of it all. That’s why I’m here, to figure out what she needs, not what she’s had. I understand those are important things, but it's hard to know where to start. Is there a way to test and see if she’s got immunity to those things?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly understandable. It’s very common for records to be lost or incomplete. And yes, we can definitely do some blood tests to check for immunity to certain things – measles, mumps, rubella, varicella , sometimes even tetanus. It's best to be thorough, and those tests will give us a good starting point. Before we order anything, though, let's talk a little bit about her general health. Has she been feeling well recently?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, that sounds sensible. She’s been doing well, as far as I know. She calls me regularly, and she hasn’t mentioned any sickness or anything troubling her. She works in a small bakery, so she’s on her feet a lot, but she seems strong and healthy. No coughs, no fevers, no aches… She's a good, hardworking girl. She did have the chickenpox when she was little, I remember that, but everything else… it’s a bit of a mystery.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Knowing she had chickenpox is helpful. Okay, so, just to confirm, no known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. She's never mentioned anything like that to me. Her mother hasn’t said anything either. She doesn’t take any regular medicines, either. Just… a normal, healthy young woman, really. I do worry about her being nervous about the shots, though. She’s not fond of needles. Is there anything you can do to make it easier for her?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No allergies is helpful. And we can absolutely make it as comfortable as possible for her. We have numbing cream we can use beforehand, and I’m very gentle. We can also talk through the process beforehand to ease her anxiety. Okay, let's get started with some basic checks then. I'll just listen to her heart and lungs, and check her blood pressure. Then we can draw some blood for those immunity tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Thank you for being so understanding and patient. She will appreciate that very much. Listening to her heart and lungs and the blood tests… that sounds like a good plan. I'm just glad we're getting this sorted out. It's a weight off my mind, honestly.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Alright, if you could have her sit up on the examination table, that would be great. I’ll start with her heart and lungs. It's a quick listen, just to make sure everything sounds as it should. Then we’ll move on to blood pressure. After that, the phlebotomist will come in to draw the blood for those tests. It’ll just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. She's right here, ready when you are. She's a bit shy, so please don’t mind if she doesn't say much. She's listening, though, and I'll be sure to explain everything you tell me. Is there anything I need to do while you listen? Should I hold her hand, or…?
DOCTOR: That's very thoughtful of you. No, you don’t need to do anything specific. Just being there with her is plenty. Hello there. I'm Dr. Kamahele. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. It might feel a little cold, but it won't hurt. Just breathe normally. Her heart sounds regular and strong. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 118/72. That's all within a normal range. Now, we’ll just get some blood drawn to check those immunity levels. Do you mind if I quickly clean your arm with an alcohol swab?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Cleaning the arm is fine. She’s a bit nervous, but she’s trying to be brave. She said she remembers getting shots as a little girl, but she doesn’t like the pinch. Is there anything I can do to help her relax while the phlebotomist is doing it? Maybe distract her? She likes stories, if that helps. And I can hold her hand, if she wants. Just let me know. She trusts me, so whatever you suggest, I’ll back it up.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful of you. Having someone she trusts there will make a big difference. Distraction is a great idea! Telling her a story is perfect. And holding her hand is a good option too. I’ll let the phlebotomist know to be gentle and take her time. They're very good at making patients feel comfortable. Let me just call them in now. Just one moment... They'll be here shortly. In the meantime, is there anything I can answer for either of you?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think we’re alright for now. Just getting the tests done is the main thing. She's a little anxious, but she's doing her best. I just want to make sure she’s healthy and ready to come here, and you’re doing everything you can. I appreciate your kindness and patience. We're ready when the phlebotomist comes.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful to hear. I understand it can be a little stressful. "Hi, I'm Sarah, the phlebotomist. Dr. Kamahele explained you’ll be getting some blood drawn to check your immunity levels. It’ll just take a few minutes. I'll be gentle." "Just let me know if you feel any discomfort, okay?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am. She said she’s a bit nervous, but she'll be alright. I'll be right here, holding her hand. Just take your time, and she’ll be fine. We appreciate you being so gentle. We’re ready when you are.
DOCTOR: “Okay, all done! Just apply a little pressure to this gauze pad for a few minutes, and you’ll be all set.” Excellent. Now we just need to wait for the lab results, which usually takes about 2-3 business days. We can either call you with the results, or you can log onto the patient portal to view them online. Which would you prefer?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a relief! Thank you both so much. She’s doing alright, just a little bit pale. Calling me with the results would be wonderful, if that’s alright. I’m not very good with computers, I’m afraid. And I’ll write down my number here, just in case. I really appreciate all your help, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Certainly. No problem at all. Alright, I have your number here. I’ll give you a call as soon as the results are in. In the meantime, if she develops any fever, rash, or feels unwell, please don’t hesitate to give us a call. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's everything. You’ve been so kind and thorough, and I really appreciate it. She’s a bit shaken up, but she’ll be alright. Just knowing she’s getting the right care is a weight off my mind. Thank you again for everything. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I’m glad I could help. You have a good day as well. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor.
