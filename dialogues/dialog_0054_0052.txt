DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Aye, good morning to ye too, Doctor. Nice to meet ye as well. Well, it's this morning sickness, really. Been happenin' for a wee while now, and it's a bit concerning, seein' as I've got me heart troubles. It just…comes up, usually right after I wake up. Not pleasant at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, “morning sickness” – and you mentioned you have some heart troubles, which is good you brought that up. Just to clarify, when you say “morning sickness,” is that what you’ve been calling it, even though it’s happening at other times of day as well?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s right. It's a silly name for it, I suppose, but it's the only way I could think to describe it. It mostly happens in the mornin', but it’s not uncommon after me lunch either, if I've eaten somethin' a bit heavy. It's not like…being sick sick, if ye ken what I mean. More like a strong wave of nausea. It passes after a bit, but it’s worryin' me all the same.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it's more of a feeling of nausea, coming in waves, and it’s not always limited to the morning, sometimes after lunch too, especially with heavier meals. And you’re concerned about it given your heart condition. That’s perfectly reasonable. Let's get a bit more detail. How long has this been going on for?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think now... It started, oh, maybe six weeks ago? At first, it was just now and then, I thought it was just a funny turn. But it's been gettin' more frequent the last couple of weeks, definitely. I’d say it happens at least three or four times a week now, maybe more if I'm not careful with me diet. I try to eat light, but ye know how it is, a man needs a good meal sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about six weeks duration, starting sporadically and increasing in frequency to three or four times a week, sometimes more depending on your diet. And it seems to be related to what you eat. Aside from the nausea, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside it?
PATIENT: Aye, well now that ye mention it... I've been feelin' a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. Just a general weariness, like I haven't had a proper night's sleep. And me ankles have been a bit swollen, but that's been happenin' on and off for a while now, ever since… well, ever since the heart started givin' trouble. It’s hard to say what's new and what's just the usual troubles, ye ken? I've also been a bit short of breath when I walk up the stairs, but I put that down to the heart as well.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to separate new symptoms from existing ones with a heart condition. Fatigue, ankle swelling, and shortness of breath… those are all important things to note. Let's talk about your heart condition briefly. Do you know what the specific diagnosis is, and what medications are you currently taking for it?
PATIENT: Aye, I do. The doctor told me it's congestive heart failure. It was a few years back now, when it first started givin' trouble. As for medications… let me see… I'm on Lisinopril, 20 milligrams every day. And Furosemide, 40 milligrams, also every day. Oh, and Digoxin, 125 micrograms, but that's only once a day. I try to be good about takin’ them, but sometimes I forget. I'm gettin' on in years, ye know. But I try me best.
DOCTOR: Okay, so congestive heart failure, managed with Lisinopril 20mg daily, Furosemide 40mg daily, and Digoxin 125 micrograms daily. And you sometimes have trouble remembering to take them, which is understandable. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any other medical conditions besides your heart failure?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to any medicine, thankfully. And no, nothin' else really. Just the heart, mostly. I had me appendix out when I was a lad, but that was a long time ago. I'm a fairly healthy man, all things considered. I used to walk every day, but I've been takin' it easy lately with this nausea and shortness of breath. I don't want to overdo it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, appendectomy long ago, and generally healthy aside from the heart failure. You've reduced your activity level due to the nausea and shortness of breath. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Aye, of course. Well, I live alone in a small cottage just outside of town. Been there all me life, practically. I used to work at the library, helpin' folks find books and such. Retired a few years back now, though. I enjoy a good book, of course. And I like to garden when the weather’s nice. I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a wee dram of whisky on special occasions. I used to smoke, but I gave that up about ten years ago. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. But I do have a sweet tooth, I must admit. And I do enjoy a good biscuit with me tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, living alone in a cottage, retired librarian, enjoys reading and gardening, minimal alcohol, former smoker, generally healthy diet with a fondness for sweets. Before we move to a physical exam, one final question regarding family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, particularly anything related to the heart, kidneys, or stomach?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think... Me father had high blood pressure, I remember that. And me mother, she had some trouble with her stomach, always complainin' of indigestion. I don't think anyone on either side had any serious heart problems, though. Me aunt Bessie, she had diabetes, but that was on me wife's side. And that's about all I can think of, really. It wasn't a family that talked much about their ailments, ye know. Kept things to themselves mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with high blood pressure, mother with indigestion, no significant heart problems reported in the family. Thank you, Mr. Benic. That’s very helpful information. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I’m used to havin’ me heart listened to, unfortunately. Just let me know if ye need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 150 over 90. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart. I'm hearing a slightly irregular rhythm and a faint extra sound – what we call an S3 gallop – and some crackles in your lungs. That could indicate fluid buildup. Now I’ll just quickly feel your abdomen. Mild tenderness in your upper right side. Do you experience any pain when I press there?
PATIENT: Aye, that’s a bit tender, yes. Not sharp, more like a dull ache. It comes and goes, really. I thought it was just indigestion, like me mother used to get. It’s usually after I eat somethin' a bit heavy, though not always. It's been worse the last few days, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull ache in the upper right abdomen, worsening recently and related to eating. Given your history of congestive heart failure, the nausea, fatigue, ankle swelling, shortness of breath, elevated blood pressure, the sounds I heard in your heart and lungs, and now the tenderness in your abdomen, there are a few possibilities we need to investigate. It could be a worsening of your heart failure, contributing to fluid retention and the nausea. The tenderness could be something separate, like indigestion, or it could be related to your heart condition impacting your liver. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney function tests, liver function tests, and a BNP level – that’s a test that helps us assess your heart failure. I also recommend an EKG to check for any new heart rhythm abnormalities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Tests are a good idea. I trust yer judgement. A BNP level… I’ve heard of that one, somethin' to do with the heart, right? As for the EKG, I've had those before, so I know what to expect. Just let me know when and where I can get these done. I'm happy to go along with whatever ye think is best.
DOCTOR: Yes, the BNP level helps us assess the severity of your heart failure. Excellent. I’ll write you a referral for blood work and an EKG. You can have those done at the lab just down the street – I’ll give you the paperwork. Once the results are back, typically within a couple of days, I’ll have the nurse contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I'd recommend reducing your salt intake as much as possible, and try to stick to lighter meals. If you experience any significant worsening of your shortness of breath, chest pain, or severe swelling in your ankles, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Aye, that all makes sense, Doctor. Less salt, lighter meals… I can manage that. And I’ll keep an eye out for the worsenin’ symptoms, and head to the emergency room if I need to. Just one question… could this be serious? I mean, I've had me heart troubles for a while, but this feels a bit different.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Mr. Benic. It’s difficult to say definitively without the results of the tests. However, the combination of new and worsening symptoms does warrant investigation. It could indicate that your heart failure is worsening, and that's something we need to address quickly. It's also important to rule out other potential causes for your abdominal pain and nausea. I don't want to alarm you, but it's always best to be proactive. We are taking the necessary steps to get a clear diagnosis and develop a treatment plan. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Do you have any other concerns or questions at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. Ye've covered everything, really. I appreciate ye takin' the time to listen, and for explainin' things so clearly. I'll go and get those tests done right away, and I'll keep an eye on things. Thank ye again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Benic. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any concerning symptoms before your follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and I'll see you soon.
PATIENT: Aye, ye too, Doctor. Thank ye kindly.
