DOCTOR: Right. Mr. McKinnon, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Edric McKinnon. Look, I appreciate you seeing me, Doc. I’m not usually one for doctors, but this… this weakness is getting a little worrying.
DOCTOR: Weakness. Yes. Vague symptoms are… less than helpful. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… right. Okay. It started, maybe a month ago? In my legs, mostly. Feels like… like trying to lift something really heavy when it’s not actually heavy. It's hard to explain. I just… get tired quicker. And it’s spreading now, a little bit to my arms. It's not pain, exactly. Just… gives out, kinda. Especially if I try to do something for a long time.
DOCTOR: “Gives out.” Hmm. And this happens with sustained activity?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s a good way to put it. Sustained activity. Like, if I’m doing work – I do auto damage appraisals, so I’m crawling around under cars a lot – after a while my legs just… feel like jelly. I gotta sit down. And it’s not just physical work, either. Yesterday, I was filling out some forms, and my hand started shaking and felt really weak. It’s just… unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable. Right. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. I’ve been sleeping okay, I guess. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but I figured that was just from worrying about this weakness. No fever, no dizziness… Appetite’s normal. Oh! Actually… sometimes my muscles twitch a little. Not all the time, just… random little flutters. Mostly in my calves, I think. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: Muscle twitches are… common. Stress, dehydration… all sorts of things. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Do you have any relevant past medical history?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox as a kid, broke my arm once, usual stuff. Nothing major. No surgeries, no long-term illnesses. And I haven't been taking any medication, either. I avoid it if I can. Honestly, I’m a pretty healthy guy, usually. That's why this is so weird.
DOCTOR: Family history?
PATIENT: Hmm. My dad had high blood pressure, I think. And my grandma, on my mom’s side, she had… arthritis, maybe? It was a long time ago, I don't remember exactly. Nobody really talked about health stuff much in my family. I have a brother and a sister, they seem okay. No weird illnesses, as far as I know. Look, is this taking long? I got a couple of appointments I need to get to this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Let’s just do a quick exam, then. It'll be faster. Please lie down on the table. I'd like to check your reflexes and strength.
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Just let me know what you need me to do. The quicker we get this done, the better. I really appreciate you squeezing me in today, Doc. I hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Relax your leg. Now, push your heel down, against my hand. Keep pushing… Good. And now the other leg. Squeeze my hands. Resist me. … Alright. Now, look straight ahead. Follow my finger. Okay. Reflexes are… slightly diminished. Strength is… within normal limits, but borderline in the lower extremities. I’ll need to do a few more tests.
PATIENT: Borderline? What does that mean exactly? Is it something bad? Look, I'm not a doctor, I just need you to tell me straight. Is it something I need to worry about? I’m not looking for a whole explanation, just… is this a serious problem or not? Because I have work to do, you know?
DOCTOR: It means further investigation is needed. I'm not going to offer speculation based on incomplete data. Now, please remain still. I'm going to check your cranial nerves. This will involve following my finger with your eyes, and I’m going to lightly touch your face. It is standard procedure.
PATIENT: Cranial nerves… Look, I appreciate you trying to be thorough, Doc, but honestly, this is making me a little anxious. Is there anything you can tell me right now, even just a possibility of what might be going on? Like, is it something with my back? Or my legs? Because if it’s something I need to worry about long-term, I need to know. I have a business to run, and I can’t afford to be laid up for weeks. Is it… is it something like… multiple sclerosis, or something?
DOCTOR: Mr. McKinnon, I understand your anxiety. However, I will not engage in speculative diagnoses based on a ten-minute examination and your own internet research. I'm going to order a full blood panel, including a complete metabolic panel and a thyroid panel. We also need to rule out vitamin deficiencies. Additionally, I'm ordering an MRI of your brain and spinal cord to assess for any structural abnormalities. Until we have those results, I cannot provide you with a definitive answer. I am referring you to a neurologist for further evaluation. Here is a referral form. Schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Do you understand?
PATIENT: MRI… neurologist… Okay. Okay, I hear you. Blood tests, MRI, neurologist. That… that sounds expensive. And time-consuming. But alright. If that's what you think is necessary. Can you at least tell me… is it something serious? Like, should I be worried about… not being able to work? Is it something that… gets worse quickly? I just need to know if I need to start… making arrangements. I don’t have insurance, Doc. This is going to be a problem.
DOCTOR: Mr. McKinnon, I understand your financial concerns. However, I am not a financial advisor, and I cannot provide medical advice based on your lack of insurance. I can provide you with a list of clinics that offer financial assistance. As for your question, I cannot definitively say whether this is a serious condition without the results of the tests. The symptoms you described could indicate a variety of issues, ranging from mild vitamin deficiencies to more concerning neurological conditions. The best course of action is to follow through with the testing and consult with the neurologist. I strongly advise you to do so as soon as possible. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No. No, I think that’s… that’s all. Just… thanks, Doc. I guess I’ll… I’ll try to schedule something. Thanks for… trying. .
