DOCTOR: Hi Genette, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you too. My legs, you see. They bother me something awful at night. Cramping, mostly. It wakes me up. It’s been going on… well, a good while now. I don’t rightly recall when it started, but it’s been a bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping in your legs at night, that's definitely something we can look into. And it’s been going on for a while, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, a while. Not recently started, no. More… gradual. It comes and goes, but lately it's been more often. It’s a sharp pain, mostly in the calf, I think. Though sometimes it's hard to tell. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Genette. Memory can be tricky. So, the cramping is mostly in your calves, and it's been happening more frequently recently. Does anything seem to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm. That’s a good question. I don’t… I don’t think so. I walk a bit, you know, around the house. Not much more than that these days. I used to be quite the gardener, but that was… a long time ago. I sit a lot, mostly. And read. Does that do anything? I truly don’t know. It just happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it seems to happen pretty randomly, even with just normal activity like sitting and reading. And no specific movements or activities make it worse that you've noticed. Now, when you say “cramping,” can you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Well… it’s a tightening. A hard, hard tightening. Like someone’s squeezing my muscle really, really tight. And then it hurts. A sharp pain, like a… a pulling feeling. It makes me want to stretch my leg out, but even that doesn’t always help. It just… stays tight for a bit. Then it fades. But it comes back, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, a hard tightening with a sharp, pulling pain. And stretching doesn’t always relieve it. That gives me a better idea. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the cramping?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Hmm. My legs… they feel a little heavy sometimes. Not all the time. Mostly just in the evenings. And… well, my feet get cold easily. Always have, really. But I don't know if that's related. It's cold where I live, you know. Alaska. It gets chilly.
DOCTOR: Right, Alaska. That explains the chilly feet! Okay, so heavy legs in the evenings and cold feet, along with the cramping. Now, I’m going to ask you a few more general questions, if that's alright. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. I’ve seen a few doctors in my time. Let me think… I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, years ago. But they gave me a little pill for that, and I took it for a while. I don’t take it anymore, though. The doctor said it was fine. And… well, I had a hip replaced, many years ago. But that’s healed up just fine. I don’t think that’s related, though. Nothing else comes to mind, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure that was treated with medication, and a hip replacement. Good to know. Are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a little something for my arthritis now and then, when it flares up. But it's just… ibuprofen, I think. Or naproxen. Something like that. I don’t take it every day, only when my joints are bothering me. And a little vitamin D, the doctor suggested that. For the cold, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen or naproxen for arthritis as needed, and vitamin D. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Allergies… not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I’ve had a few mosquito bites in my time, but that’s about it. I’m not allergic to penicillin, I think. The doctor asked me that once, years ago. But I don’t recall ever having to take it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll just check your legs and feet, feel your pulses, and check your reflexes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That's perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. It’s just… my legs haven’t been feeling their best, so I’m happy to have you look at them. Please, go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm feeling your pulses, and they feel a little weak, but present. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, but that can be common with age. I'm also noticing some mild tenderness in your calves when I press here. No swelling, though.
PATIENT: Oh, my. Weak pulses, you say? That doesn’t sound very good. I hadn’t noticed… I suppose I don’t pay much attention to those things. And diminished reflexes… Well, I’m an old woman, Doctor. Things don’t work quite like they used to. Tenderness, you say? Yes, I have noticed a bit of ache there, especially in the evenings. It’s just… I thought it was my arthritis acting up.
DOCTOR: Okay, it's good you’ve noticed the ache. The diminished reflexes and weaker pulses are something we need to investigate further. Given your symptoms - the cramping, tenderness, weak pulses, and diminished reflexes - it sounds like you might be experiencing peripheral artery disease, or PAD. It's a narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to your legs and feet. The reduced blood flow can cause cramping, pain, and other symptoms. It's important to rule this out or confirm it, so I'd like to order a simple test called an ankle-bracial index, or ABI. It compares the blood pressure in your ankles to the blood pressure in your arms. It's non-invasive and can give us a good idea of what's going on. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Peripheral… artery… disease? That sounds… serious. Narrowing of the arteries… reduced blood flow… Cramping, pain… I’ve never heard of such a thing. A test, you say? Ankle-bracial… index? Is it painful? Will it take long? I don’t mind a test, if it will help figure out what’s wrong with my legs. But I do hope it’s not too… disruptive. I don't get out much, you see.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be concerned, Genette. It is serious, but it’s also very treatable, especially when caught early. The ABI is very simple and completely painless. It involves taking blood pressure readings on your ankles and arms using a cuff, just like when we check your regular blood pressure. It takes about 15-20 minutes, and we can do it right here in the office. It won’t be disruptive at all. If the ABI shows signs of PAD, we may need to do further testing, like an ultrasound, but we’ll cross that bridge if we come to it. For now, let’s just get the ABI done and see what it shows. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, well, that sounds… not too bad. No pain, you say? Just blood pressure readings? Like what I get at the doctor’s office? That I can handle. Fifteen minutes… yes, that’s perfectly alright. I’d rather know what’s going on, even if it’s not good news. Yes, let’s do the test. Please, go right ahead. And thank you, Doctor, for explaining everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease a little, knowing what to expect.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Genette. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. I’ll get the nurse to come in and do the ABI for you now. While she’s doing that, I’ll write up the order and some instructions for you. It’s just a quick, painless procedure, and we should have the results in a few minutes. Nurse, could you please come in and do an ABI on Genette Bilstein?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. I do appreciate it. I’ll just sit here quietly and wait, then. I suppose there’s not much else to do. It’s good to be getting it checked out, finally. My legs have been bothering me for so long, it’s a relief to be taking some action.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Genette. It’s always best to be proactive. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Just relax, and the nurse will be with you shortly. I'll be right outside if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: .
