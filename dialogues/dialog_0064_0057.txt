DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well… it’s about the cancer. It’s… been hard.
DOCTOR: I see. Cancer… that is hard. And I appreciate you sharing that with me. Could you tell me a little more about what’s been hard specifically?
PATIENT: It’s… everything, really. I lost my husband last year, and then I found out about this. It just feels like too much. And… I don’t really know what to do about it, if that makes sense. I keep getting tired, and it hurts sometimes. But mostly I just… feel lost.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Chellsea. Losing your husband and then receiving a cancer diagnosis… that’s an enormous amount to cope with. It’s okay to feel lost. It’s… a very natural response. Let’s try to break things down a bit. You mentioned tiredness and some pain. Can you tell me more about the tiredness?
PATIENT: It’s… not just regular tired. Like, I can sleep all night, and then still feel like I haven't slept at all when I wake up. I used to be able to do so much, work all day and still have energy for… things. Now I get winded walking up the stairs. And it’s not just physical. I just… don’t want to do things. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: That sounds incredibly draining, Chellsea. It's good you're able to describe it like that. It sounds like more than just simple tiredness; it's impacting your energy levels significantly, and even affecting your motivation. And it's helpful to know it's not just physical. Now, about the pain… where are you feeling that, and can you describe what it feels like?
PATIENT: It’s mostly in my stomach, I think. It’s… a dull ache, most of the time. Not sharp, but… just there. Sometimes it gets worse after I eat. And it feels… full, even when I haven’t eaten much. It’s just uncomfortable. It's hard to describe… it’s just… a constant weight, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache in your stomach, feeling full quickly, and it’s worse after you eat. That's helpful to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with that – any changes in your bowel habits, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss?
PATIENT: Um… I have been losing weight, I think. I haven’t really been keeping track, but my clothes feel… looser. And I guess I haven’t been very hungry, which is probably why. No nausea or vomiting, though. And… everything seems pretty normal otherwise, if that makes sense. Like, I’m not… sick, just tired and achy and… sad.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Chellsea. It sounds like you’re experiencing a combination of physical and emotional symptoms. You mentioned you’ve been diagnosed with cancer. Do you mind telling me what type of cancer it is, and what treatment you’re currently receiving, if any?
PATIENT: It’s… stomach cancer. They found it a few months ago. I’ve been doing… chemotherapy. It makes me feel even more tired, and sometimes sick, but they said it’s the best way to fight it. I don’t… really know what they’re doing, to be honest. They just give me the medicine and tell me to rest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Sometimes, things move very quickly, and it can be overwhelming. It’s good you’re letting me know that you feel you don’t fully understand the treatment plan. We can definitely address that. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything. I used to take a medicine for my blood pressure, but they took me off of it when I started the chemotherapy. Other than that… no, I don’t think so. I'm pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And what about any other medical conditions you have, besides the cancer and the previous blood pressure issue?
PATIENT: No… nothing else, really. I was always pretty healthy before all of this. I… used to hike a lot. I miss that. Does that matter?
DOCTOR: It absolutely matters, Chellsea. Knowing you were active and healthy before the cancer helps us understand what's changed and what we can work towards. And it's perfectly valid to miss things you used to enjoy. Now, let's talk a bit about your family history. Are there any other instances of cancer in your family, and if so, what type?
PATIENT: Um… my grandmother had breast cancer, I think. A long time ago. And my uncle… he had something, but I don’t really remember what. It wasn’t stomach cancer, though. It was… lung cancer, maybe? I’m not really sure. My mom isn't around, so I don't have anyone to ask.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What… what does that mean?
DOCTOR: Apologies, it's a bit of medical jargon. It just means things like… do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh! Okay. No, no, none of that. Never have. My husband… he used to have a beer sometimes, but I never did. I don’t like any of that stuff. I don’t even like the smell of smoke.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to get a better sense of how things are currently. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check a few other things. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Okay… yes, that’s alright. I guess. Whatever you think is best. Is it going to hurt? I don’t like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: No, it shouldn't hurt. It will be gentle, just listening and feeling around. I’ll explain everything as I go, and you can tell me to stop at any time if you're uncomfortable. Let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Could you please lie back on the exam table?
PATIENT: Okay… I… I’m a little cold. Is there a blanket or something?
DOCTOR: There you go. Better?
PATIENT: Yes, thank you. That's much better. Okay… ready when you are. Just… be gentle, please?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will be. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Take nice, deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear, although your breathing sounds a little shallow. That could be from the fatigue and stress. Now I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. I'm just checking for any tenderness or swelling. Please tell me if anything feels painful. I notice some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen, particularly on the left side. No significant swelling or masses detected. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly distended. Okay. And finally, I’m going to check your pulse and blood pressure. Your pulse is a little elevated at 88 beats per minute, and your blood pressure is 110/70. That’s within a normal range, but a little higher than it might usually be. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your patience.
PATIENT: Okay… that wasn't so bad. Thank you for being gentle. What does it mean? Is something wrong? What's going to happen now?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. It’s good you tolerated the exam well. As for what it means… the tenderness in your abdomen, along with your symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, and early fullness, continue to suggest something is going on with your stomach. The elevated pulse and slightly higher blood pressure could be related to the stress and discomfort you’re experiencing. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen. The blood work will help assess your overall health and look for any signs of inflammation or infection. The CT scan will allow us to visualize your stomach and surrounding organs in more detail. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: A CT scan… Is that safe? I've heard things about radiation. And… is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, and it's important to be informed. CT scans do use a small amount of radiation, but the benefits of getting a diagnosis in your case outweigh the risks. The radiation dose is relatively low, and we take precautions to minimize your exposure. We use the lowest possible dose needed to get a clear image. As for pain, the CT scan itself shouldn't hurt. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. You may need to drink a contrast dye beforehand to help highlight your organs, and that can sometimes cause a warm, flushing sensation, but it’s usually mild. I can provide you with more information about the CT scan, including the potential risks and benefits, if you’d like. We also have a radiologist who can answer any specific questions you may have. Would you like me to proceed with ordering those tests?
PATIENT: Um… okay. I guess so. If you think it's important. But… will it take a long time? And… what if they find something bad?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, it's perfectly natural to feel anxious about this. The tests themselves shouldn't take too long. The blood draw will be quick, and the CT scan usually takes around 20-30 minutes. It may take a few days for the results to come back, though. As for what if they find something… we’ll discuss the results thoroughly, and we’ll work together to create a plan. Remember, finding something doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the worst-case scenario. It simply means we have more information, and we can make informed decisions about your care. We have a team of specialists who can help, including oncologists, surgeons, and palliative care professionals. I won’t leave you alone to face this. I'm going to order the blood work and schedule the CT scan for you. In the meantime, do you have any other concerns or questions I can address?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. And… thank you for touching my arm. It helped.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chellsea. My pleasure. Remember, I'm here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns, even if they seem small. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and give you instructions for the CT scan. I’ll review the results as soon as they’re available and contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, Chellsea. And please, try to rest.
PATIENT: Okay. I will. Thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're most welcome. We'll figure things out together.
