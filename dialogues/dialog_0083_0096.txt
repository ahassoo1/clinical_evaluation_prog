DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's this sun, really. I've been getting really bothered by it lately. My eyes, mostly, but my skin feels funny too when I'm out in it. It’s...photosensitivity, I think the lady on the phone called it. Is that right? I just want to be able to go about my day without feeling like I'm burning up.
DOCTOR: Photosensitivity, alright. It’s good you’ve already considered that possibility. It's helpful to have a starting point. To get a better understanding of what's going on, could you describe exactly what you mean by “bothered” with your eyes?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see. It’s not just that it’s bright, you know? Everything seems…too much. Like, really harsh. And it makes my eyes ache afterwards, and sometimes I get a bit of a headache. And things look kinda blurry for a little bit. It’s been getting worse over the last few months, definitely. It's hard to explain…it's just uncomfortable, and makes me want to close my eyes all the time. I used to be able to handle the sun just fine.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, increased sensitivity to light, aching eyes, occasional headaches, and some blurry vision, worsening over the past few months. That’s helpful. And you're saying this is a recent change—you haven't always experienced this?
PATIENT: That’s right. Not at all. I used to spend hours gardening, no problem. My wife… she loved her flowers, and I helped her a lot. But this started maybe… six months ago? It was gradual at first, just noticing things were a bit brighter. But now, even on cloudy days, I feel like I need sunglasses. And it’s not just the bright light, it's like… everything feels too intense, even indoors sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything else changed in your life around the time this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Well… my wife passed away last year. It was… sudden. Everything changed after that, really. I moved here, to be closer to my sister. I haven’t been eating as well as I used to, I guess. And I've been taking more time to myself… a lot more time. I've been trying to get back into gardening, but it's hard to enjoy it when the sun bothers me so much. Does that count? It’s not a new medication or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Komarov. Losing your wife is a significant life event, and it’s completely understandable that you’ve experienced many changes. Grief can manifest in unexpected ways, and it's important to consider all factors. Before we delve deeper into potential causes, let’s do a quick review of your medical history. I see here you have Medicare. Do you have any known allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’m pretty healthy, usually. Just a bit of arthritis in my hands, but that’s about it. Nothing that keeps me from doing things, but it gets a bit stiff in the mornings. And… well, like I said, I’ve been a bit run down since… everything happened. But no allergies, no serious illnesses, nothing like that. I try to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, some arthritis, and generally good health. That’s good to know. Are you currently taking any medications for your arthritis, or anything else at all, even over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just ibuprofen sometimes, when my hands are really bothering me. Nothing regularly, though. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. And… oh, sometimes a bit of melatonin to help me sleep. It doesn’t always work, but my sister suggested it. It's not a prescription, you can get it at the pharmacy. It helps if I can't sleep, that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed and melatonin occasionally. Thank you. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. I’d like to check your eyes, and possibly take a look at your skin. It will help me assess the severity of the sensitivity and rule out other possibilities. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on. My eyes have been bothering me so much, I'm happy to do whatever tests you need to do. Is it going to be uncomfortable? I get a bit nervous with things near my eyes.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, and I'll do my best to make it as comfortable as possible. It won’t be anything painful. I’ll just be shining a light into your eyes and looking at them through a few different lenses. I’ll also take a quick look at your skin—just a visual examination. If you could please have a seat, we’ll start with your eyes. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, I’m going to check your visual acuity—that's just how well you can see at different distances. Could you read the letters on this chart for me, starting with the top line?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds alright. Alright, let's see… um… is it… E? Yes, E. And then… F? Yes, F. And then… uh… let me lean forward a bit… P? Yes, P. And… oh, now they're getting a bit blurry… is that… R? Yes, I think it's R. And… oh, I can't quite make out the next one… it’s a bit fuzzy. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Komarov. It's helpful to know where your vision is at. Your visual acuity is 20/30 in your right eye and 20/40 in your left eye. That means you have some difficulty seeing fine details, which could be contributing to your sensitivity to light. Now, I’m going to shine a light into each of your eyes, and ask you to follow my pen. This is to check your pupillary response – just to see how your pupils react to light. I will also look at the inside of your eyes to check for any abnormalities. Could you look straight ahead for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay, looking straight ahead. It's a bit bright, but I can manage. Just let me know if it gets too uncomfortable, right? It feels… a little different than just normal bright light, like it’s almost… stinging. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: Yes, please let me know if it becomes uncomfortable. And yes, a stinging sensation is something to note. I'm observing that your pupils are reacting normally to the light, but I do notice some mild redness in both eyes. The inside of your eyes appears healthy otherwise, no apparent lesions or signs of inflammation. Now, let's take a look at your left eye. Again, just focus straight ahead, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay, looking straight ahead. It's the same on this side, a bit of a stinging feeling. It’s not painful, just… irritating. I think it’s worse on my right eye, maybe? It's hard to tell. Is that redness something serious, Doctor? I hope it's not something awful. I’ve been a bit worried about my eyes lately.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Komarov. The mild redness is something we'll need to investigate further, but it’s not necessarily indicative of something awful. It could be a sign of irritation or inflammation. You are right, it appears slightly more pronounced in your right eye. Now, I’d like to take a quick look at your skin, particularly your face and arms. Just to assess for any signs of photosensitivity or rash. Could you please roll up your sleeves, if you don't mind?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here you go, Doctor. I haven't really noticed anything different with my skin, to be honest. I get a bit of dry skin in the winter, but that's about it. I haven’t been sunburned or anything like that this summer. I try to stay out of the sun when it's really hot. It’s just my eyes that have been bothering me so much. But go ahead and take a look. Let me know if you see anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Komarov. I'm observing some mild dryness on your forearms, but no visible rash, blisters, or signs of sunburn. Your skin tone appears generally normal, although there is a slight pallor overall, which could be a result of limited sun exposure. Alright, based on the examination, we have some mild redness in your eyes, sensitivity to light, and a slight pallor. You also mentioned the occasional headache and some difficulty seeing fine details. Your past medical history is relatively unremarkable, and you are currently taking ibuprofen and melatonin as needed. It's difficult to determine the exact cause of your symptoms without further investigation. However, several possibilities come to mind. It could be a simple case of eye strain or dryness, especially given your recent changes in lifestyle. However, we need to rule out other potential causes, such as a viral infection, corneal abrasion, or a more systemic condition. I'm also considering the possibility of photosensitivity, which could be related to an underlying medical condition or a reaction to a medication, although you haven't reported any new medications recently. I think we should start with some basic blood tests to get a better understanding of your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also recommend a comprehensive eye exam with an ophthalmologist to assess the health of your eyes and rule out any structural abnormalities. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood tests and an eye exam… whatever you think is best to figure out what’s going on. I just want to feel normal again, to be able to go outside without worrying about my eyes. My wife… she loved gardening. I want to be able to do that again. So, yes, let's do the tests. What kind of blood tests are we talking about? And do you have a recommendation for an ophthalmologist around here?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Komarov. We’ll do everything we can to get you back to enjoying the things you love. The blood tests I’m ordering will be a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or inflammation, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a Vitamin D level to rule out a deficiency, which can sometimes contribute to eye strain. We'll also test for ANA, a marker of autoimmune conditions, just to be thorough. As for an ophthalmologist, I highly recommend Dr. Emily Carter at Coastal Eye Care. She’s very experienced and has a great reputation in the area. Here’s a referral note and her contact information. They should be able to get you in within a week or two. I'll also write you a prescription for lubricating eye drops to help alleviate some of your discomfort in the meantime. Try to use them several times a day, especially when you're exposed to bright light or working at a computer. And please, if your symptoms worsen or you experience any new symptoms, such as pain, blurred vision, or discharge, don’t hesitate to contact me or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That’s very helpful, thank you, Doctor. Dr. Carter… I’ll give them a call tomorrow. And the eye drops… I will definitely use them. It’s just… I'm a bit worried about what the blood tests might show, to be honest. But I trust your judgment. Um… no, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you for listening to me, and for taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I really appreciate it. I hope the tests don’t take too long to get back, and I hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Komarov. I understand your concern, and it’s perfectly natural to feel anxious about the tests. We'll get the results back as quickly as possible, and I’ll contact you as soon as they’re available to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, please try to rest and take care of yourself. Remember, we’re here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions or concerns before then, don’t hesitate to call the office. It was a pleasure meeting you today. I wish you all the best, and I hope you start feeling better soon.
