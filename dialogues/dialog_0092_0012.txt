DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I am here today because I am planning a cruise – a bit of a dream trip, really – and the cruise line requires some medical information. They sent me a form, and I thought it best to get a doctor to fill it out properly. I’m Velda Squiers, by the way, in case that wasn’t clear.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Squiers, that’s perfectly reasonable. Cruise lines often have those requirements for passenger safety. I’m happy to help you complete the form. To start, could you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, I’ve generally been quite fit and healthy, Doctor. I’ve not had any serious illnesses, thankfully. I do get the occasional… well, a bit of a cold now and then, like anyone does, but nothing that’s kept me from my work. I'm a merchandise displayer, you see – window trimming and such. It keeps me on my feet, which I like. I was widowed five years ago now, and I think keeping busy has been good for me. Is there anything specific you’d like to know?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Squiers. Keeping active is excellent. And I’m very sorry to hear about your loss. Just to be thorough, let’s go through a few things systematically. Could you tell me about any past medical conditions you have been diagnosed with, even if they seem minor?
PATIENT: Let me think… Minor, you say? Hmm. Years ago – must be thirty years or more – I had a bout of… well, the doctor said it was bronchitis. Kept me in bed for a week or so, but I recovered fully. And I used to suffer from migraines when I was younger, but those haven’t bothered me for a very long time, perhaps fifteen years or more. Oh, and I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, but that was a long, long time ago. I can’t think of anything else, really. Is that the sort of thing you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Squiers, that’s very helpful. Bronchitis, migraines, and an appendectomy—thank you. And have you had any surgeries besides your appendectomy?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing else. Just the appendix when I was a young girl. I’ve not been one for hospitals, thankfully. I always preferred a bit of fresh air to a doctor’s waiting room, if you understand what I mean. It’s always best to avoid them, if possible, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: I certainly understand that sentiment, Ms. Squiers. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: No medications at all, Doctor. Not a single one. I don't take anything regularly. Sometimes, if I have a headache – a proper one – I might take a paracetamol, but that’s very infrequent. Perhaps a couple of times a year, if that. I'm not insured, so I try to stay well and avoid needing them, if I can. It all adds up, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Squiers. No regular medications and only occasional paracetamol for headaches. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I'm aware of, Doctor. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me, and never had a reaction. I’ve been stung by a bee or two in my time – gardening, you see – but nothing more than a bit of a swelling and discomfort. My mother was allergic to pollen, but I don’t seem to have inherited that. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard, really. Is that what you were asking about?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfect, Ms. Squiers. No known allergies. Now, could you tell me about the medical history of your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history... That's a bit trickier. My mother lived to be eighty-seven, and she was quite healthy until the very end. She had a bit of trouble with her joints in her later years, arthritis, I think, but nothing major. My father died relatively young, in his sixties, from a heart condition, I believe. He didn't look after himself very well, to be honest. And I had a brother, but he passed away a few years ago. He had… well, diabetes, I think it was. That’s about all I can recall, really. It was a long time ago now, and I wasn't always involved in their medical affairs.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Squiers, that’s helpful. So, mother with arthritis, father with a heart condition, and a brother with diabetes. Now, to get a better overall picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, as I said, I'm a merchandise displayer, so I’m on my feet most of the day. It's physical work, arranging things and climbing ladders and such. I eat fairly healthily, I think. I like a good, cooked meal, but I don’t eat a lot of processed foods. I enjoy a glass of wine with my dinner sometimes, but not excessively. And I walk everywhere, I don’t drive. I used to smoke, years ago, but I gave that up a long time ago, thankfully. And I don’t have any pets, and I live alone. Does that give you a good enough picture?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Squiers, that’s very helpful. Active job, healthy diet, occasional wine, and no smoking. Now, just one final area to cover before we do a quick physical exam. Are there any symptoms you’re experiencing right now that are concerning you, even if they seem minor?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing at all. That's why I felt a bit silly coming here, if I'm honest. I’m perfectly well. I just thought it best to get everything checked over before going on the cruise. I don't want to cause any trouble on board, or need a doctor while I'm away. It's a long journey, and I'd like to enjoy it without any worries. I sleep well, eat well, and feel well. Truly. It's just… being sensible, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s very wise of you, Ms. Squiers. It’s always best to be prepared. And there’s absolutely no need to feel silly – preventative care is excellent. Alright, then. Just to be thorough, and to complete the cruise line’s form, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly fine. Go ahead. I'm happy to do whatever you need. I'm used to being poked and prodded, if that's any consolation! It’s all part of being sensible, as I said. I’m a bit of a practical woman, you see.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could just hop up on the table for me. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is within the normal range. And your pulse is 72, also normal. Your heart sounds are regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Your reflexes are also within normal limits. Everything appears to be in good order, Ms. Squiers.
PATIENT: That’s very reassuring to hear, Doctor. I'm glad everything seems to be alright. It’s good to know I'm fit enough for a bit of travelling, isn’t it? I always try to look after myself, so it’s nice to have that confirmed. What about the form for the cruise line? Will you be able to complete that?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Squiers, absolutely. Based on my examination and our conversation, I will complete the cruise line’s medical form. I’ll state that you have no known significant medical conditions, no current medications, and no allergies. I'll also note your past medical history of bronchitis, migraines, and an appendectomy, and your family history as we discussed. This should be sufficient for their requirements. It will take me just a few moments to finalize this. While I do that, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve been very thorough, and you've answered all my questions. I’m very grateful for your time and assistance. It’s put my mind at ease, and I can now look forward to the cruise without any worries. Thank you very much indeed. Perhaps you could just let me know when the form is ready?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Squiers. Here you are. This is a copy for your records. I’ll also keep a copy in your file. Do you have any plans for where you’re going on your cruise?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s wonderful! We're going to the Mediterranean – Italy, Greece, and Croatia. I’ve always wanted to see those places, and my late husband always promised he’d take me. It’s… well, it’s a bit of a dream come true, really. A bit of a bittersweet dream, perhaps, but a dream nonetheless. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been most helpful. I think that’s everything.
DOCTOR: That sounds absolutely wonderful, Ms. Squiers. I’m very glad I could help you prepare for such a special trip. Enjoy every moment, and please do take care of yourself. If you experience any health concerns during your travels, don’t hesitate to seek medical attention. And if you need a doctor when you return, please don’t hesitate to schedule an appointment. Have a fantastic time!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. I appreciate your kindness and thoroughness. Goodbye to you, and thank you once again.
