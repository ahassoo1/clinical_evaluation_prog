DOCTOR: Hi Jinnie, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. It’s August 2nd, and I see you’re here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's… rather embarrassing, to be frank. But I suppose that's why one comes to a doctor, isn't it? It's my… friend’s husband. He’s been having… a bit of a problem. A discharge, you see. Not very dignified. And frankly, I'm the one who had to make the appointment. He’s… reluctant, shall we say.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s definitely alright to be a bit embarrassed, and I appreciate you bringing him in. It’s good he has your support. So, to clarify, you’re here today on behalf of your friend’s husband, and he’s experiencing a discharge?
PATIENT: Yes, precisely. A discharge. Quite unpleasant, really. It’s… not something one discusses over tea, is it? And he's a respectable man, Doctor. A very respectable man. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't… concerning. Is it… something serious? He's terribly worried about what people will think, you understand.
DOCTOR: I completely understand his concern about privacy and reputation. We maintain strict confidentiality here, and I assure you, everything discussed will remain between us. As for whether it’s serious, it’s hard to say without a little more information. Can you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Describe it? Well… it’s… liquidy. And… yellowish. Not a nice yellow, mind you. More of a… sickly shade. And there’s… an odor. A rather unpleasant odor. I tried not to breathe too deeply when I noticed it. Honestly, it's quite distressing. Is that helpful? I’m not a medical person, you see. I just know it's not… normal.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. A yellowish, liquidy discharge with an odor… that does give us a starting point. Has he experienced any other symptoms – any pain, burning, itching, fever, or discomfort?
PATIENT: Pain, you say? Well, he’s a man, Doctor. Men don’t admit to pain. But… he has been a little… quieter than usual. And he's been going to the bathroom more frequently, I believe. Though, he attributes that to the… the heat. It is August, after all. He hasn't mentioned burning or itching, no. And I haven’t seen him with a fever, but he is a bit… flushed sometimes. Is that what you mean by “flushed”? He does enjoy a glass of sherry in the evenings, you understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased urinary frequency, a little quieter than usual, and some flushing… That’s good to know. Has this been going on for a long time, or is it a recent development?
PATIENT: Well, it’s difficult to say precisely. He's not one for… sharing details, if you catch my drift. But I believe it started about a week ago. Perhaps a little longer. It wasn't terribly noticeable at first, just a… a slight dampness, really. But it's definitely worsened in the last few days. Honestly, I was hoping it would just… go away on its own. One does, you know. But it hasn't, and now it's… quite alarming.
DOCTOR: Alright, a week or so, gradually worsening… Thank you for being so forthcoming, despite the awkwardness. Now, I'd like to ask a little about his medical history, if you don't mind. Does he have any known medical conditions, like diabetes or any sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Sexually transmitted infections? Really, Doctor! I assure you, my friend’s husband is a man of impeccable character. Such a question is… rather indelicate. He does have a touch of high blood pressure, managed with medication, of course. And he had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but he recovered fully. As for anything else… no, nothing of note. He leads a very… regular life. I can hardly imagine him… engaging in anything that would lead to such infections. Honestly.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question was insensitive. I certainly didn't intend to imply anything. It's simply important to rule out all possibilities. High blood pressure is good to know. And is he currently taking any medications for that, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, the medication. Always the medication. He takes… Lisinopril, I believe. A small white pill. And he occasionally takes something for his arthritis, when it flares up. Ibuprofen, perhaps? He's not terribly organized, you see. I'm the one who manages most of his affairs. Honestly, I’m starting to think I should be the patient, not him. It’s quite a burden, really. He also takes a multivitamin, if that’s relevant. A rather large one, to be honest. He insists it keeps him “regular.”
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril for blood pressure, Ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and a multivitamin. Thank you. Now, before we examine him, I'd like to ask about any allergies he may have – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Let me see. He’s not terribly prone to allergies, thankfully. He did have a bit of a reaction to penicillin many years ago, a rash, I believe. But that was a long time ago. And he’s rather fussy about shellfish. Not an allergy, precisely, but he doesn't like the texture. He calls it… “slimy.” And he gets a bit of hay fever in the spring, but he just sneezes a lot. Nothing serious. Honestly, he’s a rather robust man, all things considered. Are we nearly finished? This is… quite draining.
DOCTOR: Okay, a past reaction to penicillin, avoidance of shellfish due to texture, and seasonal hay fever. That’s helpful. Alright, Jinnie, if he’s comfortable, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll need to listen to his heart and lungs, and I’ll also need to examine the area where he’s experiencing the discharge. It won’t be pleasant, but it’s important to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Examine him? Doctor, are you suggesting… I am to be present during this examination? That is… entirely inappropriate! And frankly, I doubt he would permit it. He’s a very private man, you see. I came here to relay the information, not… to witness such a thing! I’m quite certain he'll refuse. Honestly, the very idea! Perhaps you could just prescribe something? An antibiotic, perhaps? Something strong? I'm sure that would be sufficient. This is all rather… undignified. .
