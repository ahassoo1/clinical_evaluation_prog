DOCTOR: Well, hello there. Louine Cannington, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Louine Cannington. Though I doubt you’ve met many like me, being so… tall. It’s a Marshallese thing, you know. Not everyone understands.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, I've seen a fair variety of people in my practice. Though, admittedly, height isn't usually the first thing patients bring up. But, that's… interesting. Regardless, we’re not here to discuss your stature. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s my foot. A terrible sore, really. Been bothering me for weeks now. It’s on my… well, on the side of my foot. Keeps getting worse, despite what I’ve been doing. And frankly, I expect a bit more from modern medicine than just letting things fester, you know? My husband, God rest his soul, always said I needed to be firm with doctors. They don’t always know best.
DOCTOR: Right. A sore on your foot, getting worse despite treatment. Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, weeks. At least six, I’d say. Maybe longer. Time… it slips away when you're older, you know? I’ve been putting ointment on it, like the lady at the pharmacy suggested. Some kind of antibiotic stuff. Didn't do much good. It’s red and… well, it’s angry looking. And painful, terribly painful when I walk. I used to be able to walk anywhere, now… not so much. It's a nuisance, really. A big nuisance.
DOCTOR: And what sort of ointment was it, exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it was a white tube. Smallish. Had a blue stripe, I think. Now, don’t ask me the name of it. I don’t bother with remembering names of things. I just ask for something for a sore, and they hand me a tube. Honestly, all these different creams and potions… it's all the same, isn't it? Just marketing, if you ask me. My neighbor, she keeps track of everything. Maybe she knows. But I shouldn’t have to rely on my neighbor to tell you what I put on my foot!
DOCTOR: Well, with all due respect, it is rather important to know what you’ve been applying to the wound. It could be interacting with something else, or even causing the problem. Do you have the tube with you?
PATIENT: Honestly, you'd think a doctor would know what common ointments look like. It was just a standard tube! But, no, I don’t have it with me. I emptied it, remember? That’s why I’m here! I left it in the bathroom trash. Honestly, this is… frustrating. I came here for help, not a lecture on pharmacy labels. It's a white tube, with a blue stripe. What more do you need to know? Perhaps you should just look at my foot. It's quite obvious something is wrong, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's have a look then. Please, have a seat on the table and remove your shoe and sock. I'll need to examine it properly. But I assure you, I am trying to help. It’s simply…difficult to provide appropriate care without knowing specifics.
PATIENT: There. Happy now? It’s not a pretty sight, is it? And quite painful, I might add. Be careful, now. Don’t poke it too hard. I’ve got… sensitive nerves. And it’s not just my nerves that are sensitive, if you understand me.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see. It appears to be a fairly substantial ulcer, with some surrounding redness and… some drainage. And you mentioned pain?
PATIENT: Yes, pain. Quite a bit of it, actually. Especially when I put any weight on it. It's a throbbing sort of pain, and it keeps me awake at night. And it smells… well, it’s not pleasant, I assure you. My husband used to say I had a nose like a bloodhound. I can certainly smell it myself now, and I don’t appreciate it. It's a sign of infection, I presume? I always get infections, ever since… well, never you mind. The point is, it’s not getting better.
DOCTOR: It does appear to be infected, yes. There's some warmth to the touch, and the drainage is… concerning. Do you have any fever, chills, or feel generally unwell?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. I feel… tired, of course. But I’m eighty-nine years old! I’m always tired. That’s just… being old. But no, nothing beyond the usual aches and pains. And this foot, of course. That’s the main problem. It's just… irritating. And painful. And frankly, I expect more than just a shrug and a "you’re old" diagnosis, you know? I used to be very active. I don’t want to be confined to a chair.
DOCTOR: I haven't suggested you’re simply “old,” Mrs. Cannington. We need to determine the extent of the infection. Given the appearance and your description, I suspect this may be more than a simple localized infection. Do you have any diabetes or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Goodness no. My husband, he had a touch of that, but not me. I eat perfectly healthy, mostly fish and taro. Always have. I’m a Marshallese woman, we live off the land and the sea. It's the modern food that's the problem, all that sugar and processed nonsense. No, I’m perfectly healthy for my age. Just this foot, this terrible, irritating foot. Are you going to do something about it, or just keep asking questions?
DOCTOR: I’m accessing your EHR now to review your history. It appears there is a record of pre-diabetes diagnosed five years ago, and a family history of type 2 diabetes. While you may not have a formal diagnosis currently, it’s important to consider, as diabetes can significantly affect wound healing and increase risk of infection. I need to order some blood tests to get a better picture of your overall health and the extent of the infection. I'm also going to order a wound culture to identify the specific bacteria causing the problem.
PATIENT: Blood tests? Wound cultures? Honestly, it's all so much fuss. My husband always said doctors just like to run tests to justify their salaries. I suppose… I suppose you have to do what you think is best. But I’m telling you, it’s probably just a simple infection. A little ointment and a bandage, that’s all it needs. But if you must run tests, get it over with quickly. I have a luncheon to attend next week, and I don’t want to miss it because of this… this medical drama.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ve ordered the blood work and wound culture. The lab technician will come in shortly to draw blood. The wound culture will require a swab of the affected area. It may be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be overly painful. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a course of oral antibiotics to help fight the infection. I also want you to elevate your foot as much as possible and avoid putting weight on it. We need to keep it clean and dry. And Mrs. Cannington, while I understand your skepticism, these tests are important to ensure we’re providing the most appropriate care and ruling out any underlying conditions. It's not about justifying a salary, it's about your health.
PATIENT: Oral antibiotics, you say? Well, all right. As long as they don’t have any… side effects. I’ve heard stories, you know. And I do have my luncheon. And I absolutely will not miss it. My friend, Elsie, is making her famous coconut crab salad. A delicacy, you understand. Just make sure these tests don't take too long. And keep the swab gentle, please. I have sensitive skin. And I expect a full explanation of everything when the results come back. No medical jargon, mind you. Plain English. I'm eighty-nine years old, not a doctor. Now, get on with it. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Cannington. The lab technician will be in shortly. I will explain the results in plain English, I assure you. And I’ll make sure to keep the swab as gentle as possible. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. That’s a good question. I don’t think so. Not that I recall. I used to get a bit of a rash from some of those tropical flowers, but that was when I was a girl. Nothing serious. And I've taken all sorts of things over the years, you know. For aches and pains, for colds, for… well, for being old. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. But if I start feeling funny, I expect you to do something about it. Immediately. I have a luncheon to attend, you understand. A very important luncheon. Now, where is this lab technician? This is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. She should be here any moment. While we wait, let me reiterate the importance of keeping the wound clean and dry. And if you notice any signs of worsening infection – increased pain, redness, swelling, fever – please contact the office immediately. We're taking this seriously, Mrs. Cannington, and we want to ensure you recover quickly. And… yes, about your luncheon. We'll do our best to have these results back as soon as possible. Is there anything else I can address before the technician arrives?
PATIENT: No. I think that's all. Just hurry up with those tests. And be gentle with the swab. I’m telling you, I have sensitive skin. And if I miss Elsie’s coconut crab salad… well, I won’t be responsible for the consequences. Now, bring on the technician. This is all very… disruptive. A perfectly good afternoon wasted in a doctor’s office. Really. .
