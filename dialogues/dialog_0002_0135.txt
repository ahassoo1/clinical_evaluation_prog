DOCTOR: Hi Gerhard, it’s nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Ranjan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Ranjan. It is… a pleasure to meet you as well. I am here because of my ear. It is… leaking something. A discharge, you understand? It started… maybe three days ago. Not very much, but it is… concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, a discharge from your ear for the past three days. That is concerning, and good you came in to get it checked out. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about the discharge?
PATIENT: Certainly. It is… clear, mostly. A little bit… sticky, perhaps. Not painful, thankfully. And… there is no smell, if you are asking. It just… comes out. Sometimes when I move my head, a little more will come. It is the left ear, if that is important. I have not had a fever, or any dizziness. Just… the leaking.
DOCTOR: Okay, clear, sticky discharge from your left ear, started three days ago, no pain, no smell, happens with head movement, and no fever or dizziness. That’s helpful. Have you noticed any changes in your hearing on that side?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question. Yes, actually. I… I think my hearing is a little… softer, on the left side. Not gone, you understand. Just… quieter. It is difficult to explain. Like… someone has turned down the volume, just a little. I did not notice it right away, but now that you ask… yes, it is not as good as before.
DOCTOR: Alright, so some decreased hearing in that ear along with the discharge. Have you ever had any ear infections before, Gerhard?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. When I was a boy, in Somalia, I had… several. My mother… she always used something warm. A cloth, you understand? And… drops. But it has been… many, many years. Perhaps thirty years ago, at least. I have not had any problems with my ears since then, until now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of ear infections as a child, but nothing for about thirty years. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any pain in that ear at all – even a mild ache – recently, or any ringing in your ears?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain. Not even a little bit. And… no ringing. Just the quietness. It is… very subtle, the quietness. I had to… concentrate to notice it. But now that you ask, yes. A quiet… hum, almost. Not a loud ringing, just… something there that was not there before. It comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a subtle quiet hum that comes and goes with the decreased hearing and the discharge. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, no cold or the flu. I had… a bit of a cough, maybe two weeks ago. Very mild, only for a few days. But nothing serious. I took some… medicine from the pharmacy. It went away quickly. But that was before the ear problem started. Before the leaking and the quietness.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mild cough a couple of weeks ago that resolved on its own. Let's do a quick examination of your ear, if that's alright with you. I'll use an otoscope to take a look inside. It doesn't hurt, I promise.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… acceptable. Please, proceed. I trust your… judgement. I am a bit nervous, but… I understand it does not hurt. Just… tell me if you see anything concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, I do see some fluid in the ear canal, and the eardrum looks a little… bulging and slightly red. It’s not a severe amount of fluid, but it explains the discharge and decreased hearing. It looks like you have an ear infection, likely acute otitis media. Now, to be sure, I'm going to check your temperature and listen to your lungs just to rule out anything else going on. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… sensible. An infection, you say? That is… unfortunate. But I am glad to know what it is. Yes, please check my temperature and lungs. Whatever you think is best. I trust your… expertise. It makes me feel… better knowing what is wrong.
DOCTOR: Good. Okay, your temperature is normal, and your lungs sound good. So it does seem to be isolated to the ear infection. Given your history and the findings, I recommend we start you on a course of oral antibiotics. I'm thinking Amoxicillin, 500mg three times a day for ten days. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Antibiotics, you say? Yes, Doctor. That… sounds good. Amoxicillin, ten days, three times a day. I can… manage that. Will it… make me feel better quickly? And… are there any… side effects I should know about? I do not want to feel… worse. I hope it will… clear up the leaking and the quietness.
DOCTOR: Good. Amoxicillin is usually very effective for ear infections. Most people start feeling better within a day or two, but it’s important to finish the entire course, even if you feel better, to make sure the infection is completely cleared. Common side effects are usually mild – things like nausea, diarrhea, or stomach upset. If you experience any severe side effects – like a rash, difficulty breathing, or severe stomach pain – stop taking the medication and contact me immediately. I'll also recommend over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, to help manage any discomfort. And try to keep the ear dry – avoid swimming or getting water in the ear. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. I have… never had a reaction to any medication. I can… take ibuprofen or acetaminophen if needed. I will keep the ear dry, as you say. No swimming. And I will finish the entire course of antibiotics, even if I feel better. I understand. It is… very helpful to have clear instructions. Is there anything else I should know? Or… anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: Good. That’s excellent. No allergies and you understand the instructions, that's very helpful. Just try to get plenty of rest and drink plenty of fluids. Avoid smoking or being around smoke, as it can irritate your ear. I'll give you a prescription for the Amoxicillin, and I’d like to see you back in a week to check your progress. If your symptoms don’t improve within a few days, or if they get worse, please contact the office right away. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. You have… answered all my questions. I understand the instructions… very well. Rest, fluids, avoid smoke, finish the antibiotics, follow-up in one week. I will… do my best to follow your advice. Thank you… very much for your help. It has… eased my mind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Gerhard. I’m glad I could help. And don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns at all. Here’s the prescription. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in a week.
PATIENT: .
