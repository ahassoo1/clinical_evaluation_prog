DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. My wife… she want… baby. We old, you know? I think… we need help to… make baby? I forget… what she say exactly. Is for… future, maybe?
DOCTOR: Right. A… future baby. Okay. You and your wife are hoping to start a family. And you’re… concerned about your age. I see. Let's start with this, Mr. Carlotta. How long have you and your wife been trying to conceive?
PATIENT: Trying? Hmm… not long. Maybe… few months? Not many. She… she do things. I don’t… understand all the things. She tell me when… to do my part. But… nothing happen yet. She worry. I worry too, a little. Is good to check, yes?
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months. And your wife is doing most of the… work on this, it sounds like. Let’s get a bit more detail here, just so I have a clearer picture. Have either of you ever been evaluated for fertility issues before?
PATIENT: No, no. First time. Everything… good before. We have… children, long ago. From… first wife. But is many years. This wife… new. We happy. Is… surprise we need help now. I think… maybe time change things. You know?
DOCTOR: Alright, so you've had children previously, with a former wife. And this is new, this difficulty conceiving with your current wife. I see. Just to clarify, when you say “time change things,” are you experiencing any… changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… changes? Let me think. I get… tired quicker. Old man problems, you know? And sometimes… trouble sleeping. But that is always. Nothing new… really. I eat good, mostly. My wife… she make sure. I feel okay. Just… slow. Not like before. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some trouble sleeping. We’ll get to that. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history, Mr. Carlotta. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… Doctor, my head is… fuzzy sometimes. I see many doctors over years. I forget names. No, I don't think so. Nothing big. Just… old man aches. I take something for… water retention, maybe? My legs swell sometimes. My wife handle the pills. She know everything. I go to the clinic when she say. I trust her.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Water retention medication… we'll get that list from your wife. Look, I need you to be a little more specific here. We can't just go on "old man aches." Let’s just quickly go through some basics. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Hmm… let me see… long, long ago… I broke my arm when I was young. Playing football. They fix it. And… I had… something on my eye. Small cut. They… put stitches, maybe? Is many years ago. Not big surgeries. Nothing important. Just… little fixes. Is that okay? I forget so much now. It’s… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm, small eye procedure. Anything else you can recall?
PATIENT: Hmm… I… I think I had a problem with my… stomach once? Very long ago. They gave me pills. And… Oh! And they took out some teeth. Many teeth. When I was older. Is that… important? It was a long time ago. My wife, she keeps all the papers. She knows the doctors’ names and… everything. I just come and… do what they say. Is that bad? That I forget?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Carlotta, it's not bad that you forget, but I need you to try and recall as much as possible. This is important for figuring out what's going on. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there a history of any medical problems in your family?
PATIENT: Family… My mother… she lived long life. Very strong woman. But… she had trouble walking when she was old. Like… legs weak. My father… he was farmer. Very strong too. He died… young. From… fever, maybe? Long ago. We didn't have good doctors then. My brothers and sisters… I don't know. We lost touch. It's been many years. I don't remember their problems. Sorry, Doctor. I wish I could remember more. My head… it feels empty sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, Mr. Carlotta, I understand. Let's move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: Substances? No, no. I don't… do those things. Never liked them. My wife… she doesn’t allow it. I drink tea. Sometimes, I have a small glass of wine with dinner. Very small. And… I used to smoke, long ago, when I was young. But I stopped. Many years ago. For my health. My wife made me stop. She is very good wife.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I don’t think so. Not that I know of. Sometimes my skin gets itchy. But that is from the sun. My wife puts lotion on it. She always tells me to wear a hat. I don't remember ever being… sick from a pill. Not really. Is that… good? I get a little dizzy sometimes, but that is just old age, I think. Is that enough? I hope we are done soon. I get tired easily.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. Look, based on what you've told me – and it’s been difficult getting a complete history – it seems the most likely cause of difficulty conceiving is related to your age and potentially some underlying health issues. We need your wife to bring in a complete list of your medications, and any previous medical records she has. And we’ll need to do some basic blood work to check your hormone levels and overall health. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work? Yes… yes, that is okay. If you think it will help. I trust you, Doctor. My wife… she will bring the papers. She is very organized. And… the tests. You will… poke me? I don't like needles. But… if it helps make baby, I will do it. Just… be quick, yes? And thank you, Doctor. For trying to help. I really want to have a baby with my wife.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood. She's very good, and it won't take long. I’ll have the results sent to your wife as soon as they are available. And please, make sure she brings in those medical records. It’s crucial for getting a clear picture of your health. Here’s a requisition form for the blood work. Any further questions before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor. My wife… she will handle everything. You have been very patient with me. I forget things so easily. I will see you… when the results are ready? Thank you again.
