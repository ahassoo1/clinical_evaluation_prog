DOCTOR: Right. Lyman Jezik, 79. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… well, it’s this shaking. Mostly in my hands. It’s been… a while now, I guess. Not sure how long, exactly. Everything feels a bit blurry these days, you know? It just… happens. Makes things difficult.
DOCTOR: "A while now," isn't terribly helpful, Mr. Jezik. We need some idea of a timeframe. Weeks?
PATIENT: Weeks… months? Honestly, doc, I couldn’t say. It comes and goes. Sometimes it’s barely noticeable, other times… well, it’s hard to hold a cup steady, that sort of thing. I used to work with pipes, you know, water and…wastewater. Steady hands were important then. It wasn’t like this then, though.
DOCTOR: Right. Previous occupation…plumbing. And this shaking… does anything specifically trigger it?
PATIENT: Trigger it? Hmm… not that I’ve noticed, not really. Maybe when I’m… trying to do something delicate? Like buttoning a shirt. Or… writing. Though I don’t do much of either anymore. It just happens. It’s more noticeable when I’m resting, I think. Not when I’m actively doing something. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It’s… less helpful when it happens randomly, Mr. Jezik. But alright. And aside from the shaking, are you experiencing anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else… let me think. Well, my memory isn't what it used to be, that's for sure. I forget things… constantly. Names, dates… where I put my glasses, half the time. Though, at my age, isn't that just expected?
DOCTOR: "Expected" doesn’t rule things out, Mr. Jezik. We need to differentiate normal age-related changes from something… more. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… uh… I get tired easily. Really easily. But who doesn’t, at my age? I haven’t been sleeping great, either. Wake up a lot during the night. And my stomach… it’s been a bit upset lately. Not sure if it’s what I ate or… well, something else. I don't really pay attention to those things anymore.
DOCTOR: So, fatigue, disrupted sleep, and some gastrointestinal discomfort. Alright. Any family history of… neurological conditions?
PATIENT: Neurological… what now? My sister, uh… she had something with her balance, when she got older. Fell a few times. But I don’t know what it was. It was a long time ago. My father… he was a strong man. Never sick a day in his life. As far as I know, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Sister with balance issues. Not particularly helpful. And you said you’ve been sleeping poorly?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Wake up several times a night. Can't seem to get comfortable. And when I do sleep, it doesn't feel… restorative, you know? Like I haven't slept at all. It's been going on for… a while. Again. I keep saying that, don’t I? It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Yes, you do. Okay, Mr. Jezik, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to check your reflexes, your coordination, and take a listen to your heart and lungs. It won't take long. Please extend your arms.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just get it over with, doc. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Okay. Reflexes are a little slow, and you have a visible tremor in your hands. It’s not severe, but it’s present. I’m going to check your gait now, Mr. Jezik. Can you stand up and walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: My knees aren't what they used to be. There. Happy now?
DOCTOR: Alright. It's… a bit unsteady. Mr. Jezik, given your age, the tremor, and the other symptoms you've described, several possibilities come to mind. It could be essential tremor, which is common, or it could be something else. I'm going to order some blood work to rule out other potential causes, such as thyroid issues or vitamin deficiencies. I also recommend a neurological consult, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Neurological… More doctors. Wonderful. What kind of blood work? And what's a "consult," exactly? Look, doc, I'm an old man. I just want to know if there's something seriously wrong, or if this is just… old age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: The blood work will be a standard panel—checking your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and basic metabolic functions. A consult simply means I'm referring you to a specialist—a neurologist—who has more expertise in conditions affecting the nervous system. They can perform more specialized tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. Look, Mr. Jezik, I can't give you a definitive diagnosis without further investigation. It's possible this is just age-related changes, but it's also important to rule out other possibilities. It's better to be safe than sorry. I'll get the requisitions for the blood work ready now. And I'll provide you with a referral to a neurologist. You'll need to call their office to schedule an appointment.
PATIENT: Alright. Fine. Just… get it over with. I suppose. Is that all? I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all for today, Mr. Jezik. The lab requisition and referral are printed and I’ll have the nurse give them to you before you leave. She’ll also give you a list of neurologists in the area. Try to schedule the appointment as soon as possible. And Mr. Jezik... try not to worry too much. We're just being thorough.
PATIENT: Easy for you to say. Alright. Thank you, I guess. Now, if you’ll excuse me…
