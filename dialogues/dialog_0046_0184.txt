DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. My name is Dr. Glowka, and it's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't have all day. It's about... well, it's about how I look. Not happy with it, see? Things are... droopin'. Always been a strong man, workin' with steel and all, but now… not so much. I want somethin' done about it. Quick like.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. It sounds like you're concerned about some changes in your physical appearance, and you’d like to explore options to address them. I assure you, we’ll do our best to be efficient with your time. When you say “droopin’,” could you tell me a little more specifically what areas you’re referring to?
PATIENT: Hmph. Specifics. Alright. It's the neck, mostly. And... under the chin. Used to have a proper jawline, you know? Now it's just... wobble. And the skin, it's not tight like it used to be. It feels loose. Like an old rubber band. I want it fixed. Not lookin' for a full face lift, mind you. Just... tightened up. Is that somethin' you can do? And how long will it take? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're noticing changes in the skin and muscle tone of your neck and under your chin – a loss of firmness, and some looseness of the skin. That's certainly something we can discuss. Before we talk about potential treatments, I'd like to get a bit more information about your overall health. Have you noticed any other changes recently, besides the ones you’ve described?
PATIENT: Other changes? Well... my bones ache more than they used to. Gets cold easy, too. But that's just gettin' old, isn't it? I ain't askin' about arthritis or nothin'. Just want this neck fixed. And I’ve been feelin’ a bit tired lately, but who doesn’t, eh? Look, doc, I don’t need a full check-up. Just tell me what can be done about the wobble. And the price. That's important.
DOCTOR: I understand you'd like to focus on the changes to your neck, and I respect that. However, fatigue and bone aches can sometimes be related to underlying conditions that could influence treatment options or recovery. Just to be thorough, and to ensure we're making the best decision for you, would you mind if I ask a few quick questions about these symptoms?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Quick is the key word, Doctor. Don't go askin' me about my childhood or nothin'. Just the aches and tiredness. And then tell me about fixin' the neck. What can you do? I seen some things on the television... tightenin' and pullin' and all. Is that somethin' you offer? I don’t want to look like one of them… you know… plastic dolls. Just… better.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Trendler. We'll focus on your concerns. Regarding the aches and tiredness - when did they start?
PATIENT: Started... hmm. Maybe six months ago, give or take. It comes and goes. Some days I feel alright, others I just wanna sit down. It's worse in the cold, though. And when I've been workin' hard. I do a bit of odd jobs still, you know? Not pile drivin' anymore, too old for that, but… light stuff. Buildin' fences, fixin' roofs. Nothing serious. But it does take it outta me. Now, about the neck… what options are there? I want real talk, Doctor. No fancy words.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of intermittent aches and fatigue, worse with cold weather and exertion. That’s helpful. As for options regarding your neck, there are a few possibilities. Some of the less invasive treatments include injectables – things like Kybella, which can help reduce fat under the chin, or fillers to restore some volume. We also have procedures like radiofrequency skin tightening, which uses energy to stimulate collagen production and improve skin elasticity. More involved options include a neck lift, which can address both skin laxity and muscle tone. Given your preference for a more conservative approach, and the fact that you’re still active, I would initially recommend exploring non-surgical options. However, to determine the best course of action, it would be beneficial to perform a physical examination of your neck area. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Physical examination… you mean touchin' my neck? Alright, fine. Get it over with. But don't go pokin' and proddin' too much. And explain what you're doin' while you're at it. I don't like surprises. And I still want to know what everything costs before you start. I ain't made of money, you know. This better not be a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I understand your concerns completely. I'll explain everything as I go, and there will be no surprises. First, I’ll simply palpate – gently feel – your neck to assess the underlying muscle structure and identify any areas of concern. Then, I'll examine the skin for laxity and texture. I’ll also be looking at the position of your jawline and thyroid gland. It’s a non-invasive process, and it shouldn't cause any discomfort. As for cost, each procedure has a different price point. After the examination, I can give you a detailed breakdown of the options, along with their associated costs. We can also discuss financing options if needed. Okay, I’m just feeling along your jawline now. Do you feel any tenderness or discomfort here?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Not yet. Feels like a normal touchin', I suppose. But if you start pullin' or somethin', let me know. Used to havin' strong hands on me, buildin' things, you know? This is… gentle. Too gentle, maybe. But go ahead. Just don’t poke around too much. And tell me what you’re lookin’ at, Doctor. Don’t just stare at my neck like it’s some kinda puzzle.
DOCTOR: I’m feeling for the underlying muscles – the platysma muscle, which is responsible for the contour of your neck. It feels a bit… attenuated, meaning it’s lost some of its firmness. I’m also assessing the skin's elasticity – how much it bounces back when I gently lift it. As you mentioned, it does feel a bit loose. I'm not seeing any obvious lumps or bumps, which is good. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I do this?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's a bit… pinch-y. Not painful, exactly, but… noticeable. Like a rubber band stretchin' too thin. Used to havin' tougher skin, workin' outdoors all these years. Sun and wind, you know? Toughened it up. But this… feels fragile. What does that mean, Doctor? Is it bad? Am I fallin' apart? Don’t tell me I need surgery already. I told you, I want the gentle stuff first. And how much is this… touchin’ gonna cost me? You gotta give me a number, Doctor. A real number.
DOCTOR: It means your skin has lost some of its natural elasticity, which is common as we age, particularly with sun exposure, as you’ve experienced. The sensitivity you’re feeling is likely due to this diminished elasticity and the fact that the underlying tissues are less supportive. It doesn't mean you're falling apart, Mr. Trendler, not at all. It simply means we need to explore options to restore some of that support and firmness. Regarding the cost of the examination, it’s included as part of the initial consultation fee, which is \$150. This covers my time and assessment, and allows me to provide you with personalized recommendations. It doesn’t obligate you to any further treatment. Now, let’s move on to assessing your thyroid gland, just to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to these changes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: \$150… just for touchin’ my neck? Seems a bit steep, but alright. Get it over with. Thyroid, you say? What’s that got to do with my wobble? But fine, touch it. Just be quick about it. And no surprises, remember? I don’t want a lecture about somethin’ I can’t fix. Just tell me what you find. And then tell me what we can do about the neck. Gentle stuff, remember? I ain't gettin' any younger, and I don’t want to look like a prune.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about the thyroid, Mr. Trendler. The thyroid gland produces hormones that regulate metabolism, and changes in thyroid function can sometimes affect skin texture and muscle tone. It's a standard part of a neck assessment to rule out any underlying thyroid issues. I'm not feeling any obvious enlargement or nodules on your thyroid gland, which is good. It feels normal in size and consistency. No tenderness to palpation either. So, based on my examination, there’s no evidence of any underlying medical conditions contributing to these changes. This supports the idea that we can explore cosmetic options to address your concerns. Now, let's discuss those options. Given your preference for a gentle approach, I would recommend starting with radiofrequency skin tightening. It’s a non-invasive procedure that uses energy to stimulate collagen production and improve skin elasticity. It typically requires a series of treatments, spaced a few weeks apart, and the results are gradual but natural-looking. It costs \$300 per session, and most patients require 3-6 sessions for optimal results. We can also discuss Kybella, which reduces fat under the chin, but I would typically recommend radiofrequency first. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: \$300 a session? And 3 to 6 sessions? That’s… a lot of money, Doctor. A lot of money. More than I was expectin'. Radio… whatever-you-called-it… sounds less scary than surgery, but still… expensive. Does it hurt? And does it really work? I don’t want to waste my time and money on somethin’ that ain’t gonna make a difference. I seen those infomercials… they always look too good to be true. Tell me straight, Doctor. Is it worth it? And what happens if it don’t work? Do I get my money back?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost and efficacy, Mr. Trendler. It’s a significant investment, and you’re right to ask these questions. Radiofrequency skin tightening works by delivering energy to the deeper layers of your skin, stimulating collagen production. Collagen is what gives your skin its firmness and elasticity. As we age, collagen production declines, leading to sagging and wrinkles. Radiofrequency helps to rebuild collagen, resulting in a tighter, smoother appearance. As for discomfort, most patients describe it as a warm sensation, similar to a hot stone massage. We can also use a topical anesthetic cream to minimize any discomfort. Regarding results, radiofrequency can provide noticeable improvements in skin tightness and texture. The results are gradual, which many patients prefer, as it looks more natural. We typically see improvements after the first few sessions, with optimal results after 3-6 sessions. As for a money-back guarantee… unfortunately, we don’t offer a full money-back guarantee. However, we do offer a complimentary consultation after each session to assess your progress and adjust the treatment plan if needed. If you’re not seeing the desired results after the initial three sessions, we can discuss alternative options, such as Kybella or a more involved procedure. We also have financing options available to help make the treatment more affordable. Would you like me to show you some before-and-after photos of patients who have undergone radiofrequency skin tightening?
PATIENT: Before-and-after photos… alright. Let me see ‘em. But don’t show me no fancy models. Show me regular people. People who look like… me. And don't try to sell me nothin', Doctor. I’m a practical man. I want to see real results, or I’m walkin’ out of here. And tell me again about this Kybella thing. What does that do, and how much does that cost? I still ain’t convinced this radio-whatever-it-is is gonna work. This neck ain’t gonna fix itself, you know. And I’m runnin’ out of patience… and money.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. Here are some photos of patients who have undergone radiofrequency skin tightening. As you can see, they all had varying degrees of skin laxity, similar to your own. These photos are unretouched and represent realistic outcomes. You can see improvements in skin tightness and contour after just a few sessions. Now, regarding Kybella, it's an injectable treatment that permanently destroys fat cells under the chin. It's a good option for patients with stubborn fat that doesn't respond to diet and exercise. It typically requires 2-3 treatments, spaced a few weeks apart. The cost per treatment is \$600. It's a more targeted approach than radiofrequency, but it doesn't address skin laxity. It's best suited for patients with excess fat under the chin, but minimal skin laxity. To summarize, radiofrequency is a good option for improving skin tightness and texture, while Kybella is best suited for reducing stubborn fat under the chin. Given your concerns about skin laxity, I would still recommend starting with radiofrequency. However, we can also discuss combining both treatments for optimal results. Do you have any further questions, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Those photos… they look… better. Still don’t know if it’ll work on me, but they look better. \$600 a pop for Kybella… that’s… a lot. And you’re sayin' I might need that and the radio-whatever-it-is? This is gettin’ expensive, Doctor. Real expensive. Look, I ain’t made of money. I’m a retired pile driver operator, not a millionaire. Let’s cut to the chase. If I just do the radio-whatever-it-is, how many sessions am I lookin’ at? And what’s the total cost? Be honest with me now. And don't try to upsell me on anything else. I just want to tighten up this wobble, and I want to know how much it’s gonna cost me. Final answer. No surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. Let's be clear. If you opt for radiofrequency skin tightening only, I would recommend a minimum of 4 sessions to see noticeable results. Most patients benefit from 6 sessions for optimal tightening, but 4 is a good starting point. At \$300 per session, 4 sessions would cost you a total of \$1200. Six sessions would cost \$1800. That includes the initial consultation fee, which we’ve already covered. I won't upsell you on anything. My goal is to provide you with realistic options and help you achieve your desired results, while respecting your budget. We can always reassess your progress after 4 sessions and determine if additional treatment is needed. Do you think you'd like to schedule the first session, or would you like some time to think about it?
PATIENT: \$1200… just to tighten up this wobble? That's… a lot of money. A lot of money. But I guess… I guess it’s better than lookin’ like a prune. Alright. Let’s do it. Schedule the first session. But… I want it soon. I don’t want to wait around. And… make sure it's a comfortable place. I don't want no fancy music or nothin'. Just a quiet room and a competent technician. And… no surprises. Understand? No surprises. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Trendler. I understand completely. We’ll schedule your first session for next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. It will be in a private treatment room, and we'll ensure it's a comfortable and relaxing experience. Our technician, Emily, is highly experienced and will explain the procedure in detail before we begin. She'll also be happy to answer any questions you may have. Here's your confirmation slip. It includes the date, time, and location of your appointment, as well as contact information if you need to reschedule. Before your appointment, please avoid any blood-thinning medications and refrain from excessive sun exposure. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Blood-thinning medications? Hmm. I take somethin’ for my knees… arthritis, you know? Let me think… it's… naproxen. Is that blood-thinning? And I was out in the sun yesterday, fixin’ the fence… Here, look at this. Is this gonna be a problem? I don’t want to waste my time and money if I can’t even have the treatment. And what happens if I do have to cancel? Do I get a refund? I gotta be sure about this. This is a lot of money, you know. A lot of money.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Trendler, naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID, and it does have blood-thinning properties. It's important to discontinue use at least 72 hours before your appointment to minimize the risk of bruising. Being in the sun yesterday isn't ideal, but it shouldn't be a major problem as long as you didn't get a sunburn. We'll assess your skin condition at the appointment and take appropriate precautions. Regarding cancellations, we require 24 hours’ notice. If you cancel with less than 24 hours’ notice, there is a \$100 cancellation fee. However, if you need to reschedule, we'll do our best to accommodate your schedule without any penalties. I recommend stopping the naproxen three days before your appointment. And please avoid any further sun exposure. Do you have any other concerns?
PATIENT: Three days, eh? Alright, I can manage that. I’ll stop takin’ it tomorrow. And I’ll stay outta the sun. This is gettin' complicated, Doctor. A lot of rules. Alright. I think… I think that’s everything. I’m just hopin’ this works. I’m tired of lookin’ like a prune. Alright then. I guess I’ll see you next Tuesday. Don’t keep me waitin’. And… no surprises, remember? No surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. We’ll do our best to provide you with a comfortable and effective treatment, and we’ll keep you informed every step of the way. We’ll see you next Tuesday at 10:00 AM. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions before your appointment.
