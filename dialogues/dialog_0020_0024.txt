DOCTOR: Good morning, Kiante. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need a letter, actually. A letter confirming that I’m able to fly. It’s… a bit complicated, but the airline needs it. I lost my husband a few months ago, and they’re being extra careful about documentation now, with… everything.
DOCTOR: I see. I’m very sorry for your loss, Kiante. Losing a spouse is… incredibly difficult. And yes, airlines can be quite strict with documentation these days. A "fit to fly" letter, alright. To write that accurately, I’ll need to gather some information from you. It's mainly to ensure there aren't any medical conditions that would pose a risk during air travel. Let’s start with your general health. Have you been seen by a doctor recently?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. I’m on Medicare, so I see a doctor regularly for check-ups. Let me think… I had a full physical just three months ago, on May 2nd. Everything was… normal, I guess. No major issues. They checked my blood pressure, cholesterol, the usual. I can give you the doctor’s name and number if that helps. Dr. Evelyn Reed at City General.
DOCTOR: Dr. Reed, City General. Excellent. That’s very helpful, thank you. I'll try to access those records if possible. Just to confirm, when you say "normal," were there any specific concerns discussed at that appointment?
PATIENT: No, nothing specific. Dr. Reed said my blood work was good, and my heart sounded strong. She did mention my weight—I've been a little thinner lately—but she didn’t seem too worried. Just said I should try to eat more. It's been hard, honestly, since… well, since my husband passed. My appetite just hasn’t been the same. But it hasn't been a medical thing, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Kiante. Grief affects everyone differently, and loss of appetite is very common. We're not necessarily looking for medical problems here, just gathering information for the airline’s request. Aside from the change in appetite, have you noticed any other changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I sleep okay, though sometimes I wake up a bit early. I haven’t had any new pains or anything. I walk every day – I usually go to the park – and I haven't felt dizzy or short of breath. Honestly, Doctor, I feel… okay. Just sad, mostly. But physically, I’m fine. I haven't taken any new medications since... well, since everything. I stopped taking the blood pressure pills my husband used to get me a few months ago – Dr. Reed said they weren't needed anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. So, no new medications. And you discontinued the blood pressure medication on Dr. Reed’s advice. That’s helpful. Just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None that I know of, anyway. I’ve eaten pretty much everything, and I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My husband was the one with allergies – pollen, mostly. I always remembered to bring his medication when we traveled. But me? Nothing. I'm pretty open, I guess. I’ve never had anything I needed an EpiPen for or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good to hear. Now, regarding your travel plans – do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that you're aware of, even if they haven't bothered you recently?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I used to get migraines when I was younger, but those stopped years ago. And my knees get a little achy sometimes, but that's just from walking, I think. Nothing that would stop me from flying. Dr. Reed did a full workup a few months ago, and she didn't mention anything serious. I feel like if I had something major, she would have said something. I'm reasonably healthy for my age, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional knee pain, and migraines that have resolved. That’s helpful to know. Just one last quick question before we do a quick physical exam. Have you had any recent hospitalizations or surgeries?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I've been lucky, really. A few broken bones when I was a kid – nothing major. But I haven’t been hospitalized or had surgery as an adult. I've always been pretty careful. I just want to get this letter so I can… I just want to go visit my sister. She lives in Germany, and I haven’t seen her since… well. It's been a while, and the airline is making it very difficult. I'm sorry for rambling, Doctor. I just want to get this sorted out.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Kiante. It’s completely understandable to be anxious in this situation. We’ll do our best to get this letter for you. Alright, so no recent hospitalizations or surgeries. That’s excellent. Let’s just do a quick physical exam – listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, just to make sure everything sounds and looks good. It will just be a quick check to confirm everything you've told me. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need. I just want to get this done. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient.
DOCTOR: Of course, Kiante. Please, have a seat here. We’ll just start with listening to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go. Is there anything specific I should be doing? Or just… breathe normally?
DOCTOR: Just breathe normally, Kiante. And I'll ask you to take a few deeper breaths in a moment. Okay, good. Everything sounds clear. Heart rate is normal – 72 beats per minute and regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezing or crackles. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. Blood pressure is 128 over 78. That’s within normal limits. Pulse is strong and regular. Overall, everything sounds and looks good, Kiante. Just as you described.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear. Thank you, Doctor. I was worried they would find something. So… does that mean you can write the letter?
DOCTOR: Yes, Kiante, absolutely. Everything checks out. It sounds like you’re perfectly fit to fly. I'm drafting a letter now, confirming your medical clearance for air travel. I’ll include details from our conversation today, noting the absence of any contraindications. It might take a few minutes to finalize, so please just relax. Do you need anything while I finish this?
PATIENT: No, thank you, I'm alright. Just… getting this done would be wonderful. I appreciate your help so much, Doctor. Really. It's just… been a stressful few months.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Kiante. This confirms your fitness to fly. I've included my contact information should the airline have any questions. Please review it to make sure everything is accurate. I also want to reiterate my deepest condolences for your loss. I hope you have a safe and peaceful trip to visit your sister. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Everything looks perfect. Thank you so much, Doctor Beinborn. You've been a lifesaver. No, I think that’s everything. Just… thank you again. I really appreciate it. I’m glad I could help, Kiante. Have a wonderful trip. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything in the future.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kiante. And truly, my condolences once more. Travel safely, and take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. .
