DOCTOR: Bula! And hello there. I’m Dr. Kimm. It’s nice to meet you, Ms. Julie. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, um, yes. Hello. It’s… it’s about my sight and hearing. They’ve just… gone. Rather suddenly, you see. Honestly, I haven’t got the time for this, but my housekeeper insisted. It's all rather inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Sudden changes in sight and hearing can be worrying, and it is inconvenient when things don’t go as planned. Let’s try to figure out what’s going on. When you say they "went," can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it was just… this morning, really. Woke up, and things were… muffled. And blurry. Very blurry. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a haze. I can't recall the specifics. Did something happen? Was there a… a notice? I do find it terribly rude to spring these things on people without warning.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this happened this morning when you woke up. And it sounds like it was a fairly sudden change. No injury or anything specific that you can recall that might have caused it?
PATIENT: Injury? Good heavens, no. I’m a surgeon, you know. I perform surgeries. I don’t suffer them. Though, admittedly, it’s been a few years since I was actively practicing. It's... unimportant. Look, is this going to take long? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Alright, a retired surgeon, that’s good to know. And I appreciate you letting me know about your luncheon - we’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Sudden changes like this, even without a known injury, do need to be checked out. To get a better idea of what’s happening, could you tell me a little more about the blurry vision?
PATIENT: Blurry… it's like looking through a… a dirty window, perhaps? Though I keep a very clean home, I assure you. Everything is… indistinct. Shapes, mostly. And the hearing... everything sounds like it's underwater. Very muffled. Honestly, it’s quite distressing, but I’m sure it’s nothing serious. These things happen with age, don’t they? I've always been very particular about my health, though. And very busy.
DOCTOR: Yes, it does sound distressing. And you're right, changes can happen with age, but sudden changes like you're describing always warrant investigation. Okay, just to clarify, is the blurriness in both eyes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Both, I believe. Yes, definitely both. I wouldn't be able to tell you specifics, you see. It’s all rather… the same. I simply noticed everything was… less clear. It's a very inconvenient affliction, to be sure. Are you going to do something, or just ask questions? I really must get to that luncheon.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and wanting to get to your luncheon. I am gathering information to help determine what’s going on and what the next steps should be. Okay. And has there been any pain with either the vision or the hearing changes?
PATIENT: Pain? No, certainly not. I’m not prone to dramatics, you know. It’s simply… a lack of clarity. And a muffling. It's… unsettling, of course. But not painful. Honestly, I've dealt with far worse. I just want to know how long this is going to take. I have a reputation to uphold.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain. That’s good to know. Alright, Ms. Julie, I'm going to do a quick exam, just to check your vision and hearing. It won't take long, and it will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Very well. But please be quick. And try not to touch my hair. I just had it done. Honestly, this is most inconvenient. Do hurry.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be as quick and careful as possible. And absolutely, I'll be mindful of your hair. Okay, let’s start with your vision. Could you please look straight ahead at that chart on the wall and tell me what you see?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s all a blur. Just… shapes. Letters, perhaps? I can’t distinguish them. Is that the big ‘E’? No… maybe a ‘P’? It’s quite indistinct, you see. This is dreadful. I can usually read perfectly well. Are you sure this chart is correct?
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. It sounds like your vision is significantly reduced. Alright, now let’s check your hearing. I’m going to put these headphones on you, and you’ll tell me when you hear a sound in each ear. It’s just a simple beep. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A beep? Honestly. Very well. But if it’s too loud, I’ll need you to remove them immediately. I have very sensitive hearing, usually. Though, admittedly, it's a little muffled at the moment. Do get on with it. I’m wasting valuable time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Julie, I’m going to start with the right ear now. Just let me know when you hear the beep. … … Any sound?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. It's… silent. Or perhaps just muffled. Very muffled. Honestly, this is quite alarming. Are you sure these things are working correctly? My housekeeper gets the best equipment, you know. Surely these headphones aren’t faulty? It's all rather… unprofessional.
DOCTOR: Okay, no sound in the right ear. Let’s try the left ear now. … Any sound?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. It’s completely silent in this ear as well. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite faint. This is… unacceptable. I need to see a specialist immediately. A proper specialist, not… this. I simply haven’t got time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Julie. It sounds like you're experiencing a significant loss of hearing in both ears, and a substantial decrease in vision in both eyes, and the sudden onset is concerning. Given the sudden nature and the complete loss you're describing, I agree that we need to get you to a specialist right away. I’m going to recommend an immediate referral to an otolaryngologist and an ophthalmologist. It could be a number of things causing this, and they are best equipped to diagnose and treat the issue. I’m also concerned about the possibility of a more serious underlying cause, so we want to rule those out quickly. Are you able to get to those appointments fairly quickly?
PATIENT: Appointments? Specialists? Honestly, the inconvenience! Well, my housekeeper usually handles all of that. She has excellent connections. I suppose she can arrange something. But it needs to be prompt. And I expect the best possible care, naturally. I have a very busy social calendar, you see. This is all… highly disruptive. Do you have any idea how long this is going to take, in total?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the disruption to your schedule, Ms. Julie. I will certainly make a note of your preference for prompt appointments and the best possible care in the referral requests. Given your complete loss of both vision and hearing, I'm going to also recommend we get you to the Emergency Room immediately, just to rule out any serious, acute conditions like a stroke. While it may not be that, it's best to be safe. We need to have tests done right away. Would you like me to call an ambulance, or would you prefer to have your housekeeper arrange transportation?
PATIENT: An ambulance? Absolutely not! That’s preposterous. My housekeeper will arrange transportation, naturally. She has a very reliable driver. I simply refuse to be seen in an ambulance. Honestly, this is all becoming quite… overwhelming. Just get me the specialist information, and I'll have my housekeeper deal with the rest. And make sure they’re the best. The very best. I’m not interested in substandard care. Honestly, this is highly unprofessional, springing this on me like this! Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have a luncheon to attend, eventually. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Julie. I understand. I'll get the referral information to you right away, and I'll emphasize the need for prompt and excellent care. I will also note your preference for a private transport. Please do encourage your housekeeper to call them immediately, and don't hesitate to go to the nearest emergency room if you experience any worsening symptoms. Thank you for coming in, and I hope you feel better soon.
