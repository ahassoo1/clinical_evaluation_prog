DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer, please have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Well, it’s… family. My sister, she got sick. Real sick. And my mom… she had something, a long time ago. I just… want to make sure I’m okay, you know? I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Family history, right. Sensible. Although, frankly, worrying about what might happen isn't usually the most productive use of a doctor's time. Still. Let’s get some details. Your sister is sick… what exactly is wrong with her?
PATIENT: I… don’t know exactly. Cancer, I think. Something with her… tummy? She doesn’t like to talk about it much. And my mom… it was years ago, when I was a kid. She was always tired. Doctor said… something about her blood? I don’t remember much. It was a long time ago. I just… I get tired easy now too, sometimes. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: "Something with her tummy" and "something about her blood"...very specific, Mr. Schwer. Honestly, it’s difficult to make much of that. Was your sister's cancer diagnosed by a doctor?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! Yes, a doctor. She went to the hospital. Big hospital in the city. They did… scans and tests. She told me. I just… I don’t remember what kind of cancer. She’s got a lot of appointments now. And the tiredness… it’s not all the time, but it’s there. It worries me, you know? It feels like… I need to know if I should be scared.
DOCTOR: “Scared” isn’t a medical term, Mr. Schwer. Let's focus on facts. Your sister has been diagnosed with cancer – that’s important. Do you happen to know what type of cancer?
PATIENT: Um… she said… colon? Is that right? Colon cancer. And she’s doing… chemo, I think. That's what she told my niece. It makes her sick, sometimes. I don't want to bother her with questions, so I just… try to avoid talking about it. I just want to know if I need to get scans and tests. Like she did.
DOCTOR: Colon cancer in a sibling does increase your risk, though not dramatically. It’s good you’re thinking ahead. Now, let's talk about you. Aside from this tiredness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… tired. And maybe a little… achy sometimes? Old age, I guess. I work on my feet a lot, selling things. It’s a hard job. I eat okay, I think. Mostly. I like noodles. Does noodles cause aches? I don’t know. Sorry, I’m rambling. It’s just… a lot to think about.
DOCTOR: Noodles are not inherently detrimental, Mr. Schwer. Though a balanced diet is always advisable. You mention aches. Where exactly are you aching?
PATIENT: Mostly my… back. And my knees. After a long day, they really bother me. I thought it was just the job. Standing all day, walking around… but now I’m wondering if it’s something else. Like my sister… or my mom. Is it bad that I keep thinking about them? I feel silly, worrying about aches when my sister is… well, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s not “silly” to be concerned about your health, Mr. Schwer, though obsessing over possibilities isn't helpful either. Back and knee pain can be related to your work, as you said. However, given your family history, it wouldn't hurt to rule out other causes. Let’s do a quick physical exam, starting with your back. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Here. Is this okay? It’s a little stiff. I should probably stretch more. I just… don’t have the energy sometimes, you know? Especially after work. It’s a long day.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There’s some tenderness along your lower spine, and your range of motion is restricted. Not dramatically, but enough to warrant further investigation. You also appear slightly underweight. What is your approximate weight, Mr. Schwer?
PATIENT: Uh… I haven’t weighed myself in a while. Maybe… 53 kilos? Something like that. I used to be bigger, but… I don’t eat as much anymore. Not much appetite, you know? And I work hard. It burns a lot of energy. I just… feel tired all the time.
DOCTOR: 53 kilograms with a height of 185 centimeters… that puts your BMI at 15.5, which is significantly underweight. This, combined with your fatigue and family history, is concerning. I'd like to order some blood work to check for anemia, inflammation, and basic organ function. Also, a complete metabolic panel. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I don’t take much medicine. Just… when I get a cold. I think. I haven’t been to the doctor in a long time. Medicare… will it cover all this? I worry about the bills.
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover the necessary tests, Mr. Schwer. We’ll submit the claims for you. Don't worry about the details at this point. Now, let’s get these blood tests ordered. The lab is down the hall, third door on the left. They’ll take about 30 minutes. And then, I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. How about next week?
PATIENT: Okay, next week sounds good. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. It just… feels good to know someone is looking into it. My sister… she’s very strong. I just want to make sure I’m okay, too. I’ll go do the blood tests now. Third door on the left, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, third door on the left. The nurse will explain the procedure. We’ll see you next week, Mr. Schwer. And try not to worry unnecessarily. Although, frankly, proactively addressing these issues is a sensible course of action. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you again, Doctor. .
