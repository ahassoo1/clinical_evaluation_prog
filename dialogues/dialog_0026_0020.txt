DOCTOR: Good morning, Avril. It's lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is nice to meet you also. Well, I am here for this… telehealth visit, yes? My son, he made the appointment for me. I am not so good with computers, so he does all of that. I think it is to just… check how I am doing.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right, Avril. A general check-up. That's perfectly fine. It sounds like your son is very helpful. It’s good to have someone assist with these things. Let's just talk through a few things, if you don't mind. Just to get a better picture of how you are doing. Perhaps we can start with what's been going on lately?
PATIENT: Yes, that is good. My son, Tomas, he is very good. Always looking after me. Lately… well, things have been… normal, I think. Not much changes for me these days. I work at the garage, still. Fixing cars. It keeps me busy. My back, it sometimes bothers me, but what can you do? It is part of the job.
DOCTOR: That's good you’re staying busy, Avril. It’s wonderful to have something that keeps you active. And fixing cars is… well, it’s work, isn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes, it is work! But I like it. I have been doing it a long time. My husband, he taught me. He… he owned the garage before me. It is… a good memory. But my back, like I said, it is sometimes very sore after a long day under a car. Not every day, but… enough to notice.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to keep doing something you enjoy, even if it has its challenges. And it sounds like that garage holds a lot of meaning for you. Now, about your back… when you say “sore”, can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Yes, it does. Sore… hmm. It is not a sharp pain, you understand? More like… a dull ache. Especially when I bend over. Or when I stand up after being crouched down for a while. It gets better if I sit or lie down. And sometimes, a warm bath helps. But it is always there, a little bit. Not all the time, like I said, but… it is always something. I do not take anything for it, usually. It is just… old age, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache, worse with bending and crouching, relieved by rest and warm baths… that gives me a better idea. And it sounds like you’ve been managing it well on your own for a while now. Now, when you say it’s been “a while”, could you tell me roughly how long you’ve noticed this back discomfort?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is… a difficult question. It started, I think, maybe… five years ago? Slowly. At first, I did not even notice it. Just a little stiffness after a long day. Then it got a little worse, a little worse each year. Now… it is just part of me, I suppose. Not sudden, not from an injury. Just… a slow change. Five years, maybe? Or a little longer. I am not good with remembering dates.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Avril. It’s understandable. Five years is helpful. So it’s been a gradual onset, not a specific incident. Now, let’s step back for a moment. Aside from your back, are you experiencing any other discomfort or symptoms anywhere else?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get tired, of course. But what old woman does not get tired? My knees sometimes ache, a little bit, but that is the weather, I think. And I… sometimes I feel a little breathless when I climb the stairs. But I am not a young woman anymore! I do not think it is anything serious. Just… getting older. Everything feels a little slower these days. No sharp pains, no cough, no fever. Nothing like that. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, some knee aches with the weather, and a little breathlessness with stairs… And you attribute those to getting older, which is certainly reasonable. Now, thinking about your overall health… have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had my gallbladder removed, many years ago. Maybe… twenty years? Thirty? I do not remember exactly. And I used to have high blood pressure, but the doctor put me on medicine for that. I stopped taking it a few years ago, he said it was okay. Everything was good at the last check-up, I think. But… that was a long time ago. And… my husband, he had diabetes. But I do not have that, I am sure. I do not eat much sugar.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal many years ago, history of high blood pressure managed with medication that was discontinued, and a family history of diabetes. That’s all very helpful information. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones or vitamins?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes I take something for a headache, if I have one. But not often. And sometimes, if I cannot sleep, I take a little… sleeping pill. But only when I really need it. Nothing every day. Just… when I am very stressed or something. I do not like taking pills, if I can avoid it. They make me feel… strange. I prefer a warm bath and a good book.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional headache medication and an occasional sleeping pill when needed. We'll make a note of that. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I have never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything. I have a strong stomach! My husband, he was allergic to… bees. But I am not. I can eat shellfish, I can eat nuts… everything. I have never had any trouble. I think I am very lucky. Perhaps a little dust sometimes makes me sneeze, but that is all. No serious allergies, no.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Avril. No known allergies. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No! Never. My husband, he used to smoke, but I always made him smoke outside. It is very bad for you, smoking. I do not understand why people do it. No, I have never smoked. And I do not drink much alcohol, either. Just… a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, if I am feeling festive. But not every day. And not much. It makes me feel… dizzy. No, I am a healthy woman, mostly. It is the work, that is the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking history, and minimal alcohol consumption. That's excellent. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your work at the garage?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I work with cars. Fixing them, mostly. Changing oil, brakes, sometimes bigger jobs if I have to. I have been doing it for… a long time. Since my husband… since he got sick. He owned the garage, and I learned from him. It is hard work, but I like it. It keeps my hands busy, and my mind busy. I have good customers, too. They trust me. It is… a good life, mostly. I lift things sometimes, crawl under cars… It is not easy on the body, but I manage. I have to, you know? I need to keep the garage going. It is… everything.
DOCTOR: That’s admirable, Avril. It sounds like you're a very resourceful and dedicated woman. Keeping the garage going is a testament to that. Now, I'm going to ask you a few quick questions, just to get a general overview of how things are going. Have you noticed any recent changes in your weight?
PATIENT: No, not really. I always eat the same. Maybe… a little heavier in the winter, when I do not go out so much. But mostly the same. I do not weigh myself often. It does not change much. I am a solid woman, always have been. I do not worry about my weight. It is just… me. Perhaps a pound or two, sometimes. But not much. I eat good food, mostly. Not too much sugar, not too much fat. Just… normal food. I do not diet or anything. It is just… me.
DOCTOR: Okay, stable weight, generally maintaining a normal diet. And finally, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or bladder function recently?
PATIENT: No. Everything is… regular. Yes, regular. No problems there. Everything works as it should. I do not have any trouble with… any of that. I am sorry, I do not like talking about such things. But no, everything is normal. Yes. Normal. Is that all the questions, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's all the questions for now, Avril. Thank you for being so open with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a quick look at your reflexes. It won’t take long. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that is fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I have not been to a doctor in a long time, so I am sure you will know what is best. Just… be gentle with my back, if you are going to touch it. It is sometimes a little sore, you know? But otherwise, it is fine. Do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Avril. I’ll be very careful. First, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, breathing sounds are normal. Now, could you just take a deep breath for me, and again… and one more time. Okay, lungs sound good. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Finally, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, just to be thorough, I will gently feel along your spine. Let me know if anything is painful. Any pain here?
PATIENT: No… no, that is okay. Ooh, that is a little sore. But… I told you. It is always a little sore there. Not sharp, just… a dull ache. Like I said, from the work. But otherwise, it is fine. You do not need to press too hard. Just… gently. Yes. Gently. It is just… old age, I think. And lifting things. But it is okay. Really. It is just a little sore. Do not worry about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Just some tenderness in the lower back, consistent with your description of the work you do. That’s good to know. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you're generally in good health, Avril. The elevated blood pressure is something we should keep an eye on. And the lower back pain seems consistent with muscle strain from your work. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… not really. You said my blood pressure is a little high? Should I be worried? Is that… serious? And… about my back. Is there anything I can do? Besides… stopping work? Because that is not an option. Is there anything I can take? Or… anything I can do to make it better? Maybe some exercises? Or a special pillow? I just… want to keep working. I need to keep working.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's address those questions. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not at a level that requires immediate medication. We can try some lifestyle modifications first – watching your salt intake, getting regular exercise when possible, and managing stress. We’ll recheck it in a few months to see if it improves. As for your back pain, stopping work isn't ideal, and I understand that. There are several things we can try. I recommend some gentle stretching exercises to strengthen your back muscles. I can provide you with a handout with some examples. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help with the pain and inflammation. And yes, a supportive pillow can make a difference when you’re resting. I also want to be cautious. Given your work and the potential for ongoing strain, I think it would be beneficial to get an X-ray of your lower back just to rule out any underlying issues. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds good. The exercises, the pillow, the medicine… I can try that. And… the X-ray. If it will help, yes. I want to be careful. I do not want to make it worse. My son, he will be glad to hear that. He worries about me. He says I work too hard. So, the X-ray is okay. And… can you write down the exercises for me? And the name of the medicine? I am not good with remembering things. You have been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Avril. I’m glad I could help. Okay, let me print out a handout with some gentle stretching exercises for your back. It also includes some tips on proper lifting techniques. For the pain relief, I recommend ibuprofen or naproxen, taken as directed on the label. I’m going to write a prescription for the X-ray. You can take this to the radiology department at the hospital. They’ll schedule an appointment for you. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in three months to review the results of the X-ray and see how you're doing with the exercises and medication. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes… that sounds perfect. The exercises, the medicine, the X-ray… and the follow-up appointment. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind. My son, Tomas, he will be very happy to hear all of this. He is always looking after me. Is there anything else I should be doing? Anything I forgot to tell you? I just… want to be sure I am doing everything right. I do not want to get sick.
DOCTOR: You've been very thorough, Avril. Honestly, you're doing great. Just remember to listen to your body. If the pain gets worse, or if you develop any new symptoms, don't hesitate to call the office. And, as we discussed, focus on those lifestyle modifications – watching your salt intake, managing stress, and getting regular, gentle exercise when possible. Just one more thing. Have you had a flu shot recently?
PATIENT: No, I have not. I always forget. My son, he reminds me every year, but I always put it off. I do not like needles. And… I never seem to get the flu anyway. But… maybe I should get one this year? If you think it is important? I do not want to get sick and have to stop working. That would be terrible.
DOCTOR: Given your age and the fact that you're working, it’s definitely a good idea to get a flu shot. It won't guarantee you won't get the flu, but it significantly reduces your risk and can lessen the severity of the symptoms if you do get it. It’s a quick and easy way to protect yourself. We can give you one here today, if you’d like. Would you like me to administer the flu shot now, or would you prefer to schedule it for another day?
PATIENT: Oh… well… I do not like needles… But… if it is important, yes. Yes, I will get the shot. Just… be quick, please. And… do not tell me when you are doing it. I do not want to look. Just… do it quickly. Thank you, Doctor. You are very kind to remind me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Avril. I understand your apprehension. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Just look away, and I'll let you know when it’s done. All done. You didn’t even feel a thing, did you?
PATIENT: It… it wasn’t so bad. It just… surprised me a little. But… it is done now. Thank you, Doctor. You were very quick. Now… can I go home? My son, Tomas, he is probably wondering where I am. He worries about me, you know? I think I have done everything you asked. The exercises, the medicine, the X-ray… and the shot. I am a good patient, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: You absolutely are a wonderful patient, Avril. And you've been incredibly cooperative. Yes, you're free to go home now. Just remember to follow the instructions I’ve given you, and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Here’s your discharge paperwork, and a summary of our visit. Drive safely, and give my best to Tomas. It sounds like he takes very good care of you. It was lovely meeting you, Avril. Please, take care.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind. And… yes, Tomas is a good son. He worries too much, but… he means well. I will remember everything you said. The exercises, the medicine, the X-ray… and to call if I have any questions. Thank you again, Doctor. Goodbye.
