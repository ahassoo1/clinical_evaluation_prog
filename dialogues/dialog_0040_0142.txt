DOCTOR: Right. Jaxston Lawther, 22. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Well, it's… my head. It's been, like, really bad lately. I get these headaches, and I start sweating a lot, and my heart feels like it's racin'. It's… hard to explain. It just happens. I don't really remember what sets them off, if anything does.
DOCTOR: Right, headaches, sweating, racing heart. And you say you don't recall anything specific triggering these episodes?
PATIENT: No, not really. That's the thing. It's not like, “Oh, I had coffee and then it happened.” Or, you know, stressful day at work. It just… comes on. Honestly, I wish I knew why. It's happened a few times now, and it's gettin' kinda scary.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Scary is… not a helpful symptom, frankly. When these episodes occur, how long do they typically last?
PATIENT: Uh… that’s a good question. It feels like… hours, maybe? But I could be wrong. Sometimes I just try to sleep it off, and then wake up feeling kinda drained. It’s hard to keep track, honestly. It's not like a consistent thing. Sometimes it's a couple of hours, sometimes feels longer... I don't know. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It’s… something. And do you have any other symptoms during these episodes?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes I feel kinda nauseous, like I might throw up, but I don’t usually do. And things seem… brighter, or… off, somehow. Like my vision's weird. It's hard to describe. Like everything’s too much, you know? But that might just be because my head's poundin'. I don't really know what's what when it happens.
DOCTOR: Right. Nausea, altered vision. Have you had any fever, neck stiffness, weakness, or numbness with these episodes?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I don’t think so. Neck's not stiff… I mean, it feels okay. Weakness… not really. I feel kinda tired afterwards, but not during. Numbness, no. No, nothing like that. Honestly, it’s mostly just the headache, sweating, and heart racin’. And the weird vision sometimes. It's just… unpleasant. I haven't noticed any of those other things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any medical problems, have you had any surgeries, or are you currently taking any medication?
PATIENT: Uh… medical problems… not really. I mean, I get sick sometimes, like everyone else. No surgeries. And I'm not takin' any medication, no. Nothin' regular, anyway. I had some painkillers once for a bad tooth, but that was years ago. That's it, I think. I don’t go to the doctor much.
DOCTOR: Family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmm. My dad's side… my grandad had high blood pressure, I think. And my mum… she gets migraines sometimes, really bad ones. But other than that, nothin' I can really think of. No heart problems or anything, as far as I know. It's a pretty… normal family, I guess. Is that what you're lookin' for?
DOCTOR: Right. And what about lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… what does that mean, exactly? Like, what do you want to know? I work, you know, at the factory. It's… physical. Not super strenuous, but I'm on my feet a lot. I don't… party much. And I guess I don't eat great, mostly just what's quick and easy. I try to get enough sleep, but it doesn't always happen. I don't smoke or do drugs, if that matters. I used to drink a bit, but not so much anymore.
DOCTOR: And how much would you say you drink in a typical week?
PATIENT: Uh… well, like I said, not much anymore. But, when I do drink… maybe a couple of beers on a Saturday night? Sometimes. Not every week. Honestly, it’s been months since I had more than one or two. It's really not a regular thing. I'm not a big drinker, never was. I just… wanted to be honest. I don't want to sound like I'm hidin' somethin'. It’s more like a social thing when I do drink, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick exam, just to get a baseline. Lie back on the table, please. I'll listen to your heart and check your blood pressure. And then I want to check your reflexes. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. No problem. Hope it's nothin' serious. Just… a really bad headache, right?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure’s a bit elevated, but not alarmingly so. Reflexes seem normal. Any recent head trauma?
PATIENT: Head trauma? Uh… no. Not that I can remember. I mean, I've bumped my head a few times, like everyone does, but nothing serious. I haven’t been in any accidents or anything. Not recently, anyway. I’ve definitely never been knocked unconscious. I don’t think so, no. Why? Is somethin' wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s… unlikely to be anything serious. But given the episodic nature, and the associated symptoms, I'm leaning towards… tension headaches, possibly exacerbated by stress and a less-than-ideal lifestyle. We can try some over-the-counter pain relief, and I suggest you focus on getting more sleep, reducing stress, and improving your diet. If they persist, or worsen, then we’ll consider further investigation. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay… yeah, that sounds… okay. I mean, I'd rather it not be anything serious. So, over-the-counter pain relief, more sleep, less stress… and better food. I can try that. But what kind of pain relief? And what do you mean by “less stress”? That’s kinda hard, you know? Is there anything else I should be lookin' out for?
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Follow the dosage instructions on the packaging, obviously. And “less stress” means finding ways to manage it. Exercise, relaxation techniques… eliminate triggers if you can identify them. Frankly, I don't have time to provide a stress management course. If the headaches are accompanied by fever, stiff neck, vision changes, weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, go to the emergency room immediately. Otherwise… try the pain relief and lifestyle adjustments. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… ibuprofen or acetaminophen. No fever, stiff neck, vision changes, weakness, or difficulty speaking. Got it. It’s just… hard to know what the “triggers” are, if I don’t even know what's causin' the headaches in the first place. But… I’ll try. I guess. Is there anything else I need to know before I go? Or… am I good to leave now?
DOCTOR: Here. It’s a general information sheet on headaches. I suggest you read it. And I’m not going to repeat myself. No, you're good to leave. Try not to waste my time again unless absolutely necessary. Next!
PATIENT: Okay… Thanks… I guess.
