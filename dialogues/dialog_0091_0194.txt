DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Mayhugh. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Terasa. It's… well, it's my ears, mostly. And a bit of dizziness. It comes and goes, you see. Honestly, I don't remember exactly when it started, but my daughter, Lani, she got worried and insisted I come. There’s a history of it in the family, she says. My husband… he had problems with his balance, too. It's all a bit fuzzy, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Terasa. It’s perfectly alright if details are a little fuzzy; we’ll work through it together. It's good of Lani to encourage you to seek medical attention, and family history is definitely important information. To start, could you describe the dizziness a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to describe it… It’s not like being seasick, not exactly. More like… the room spins for a little bit. Just a few seconds, usually. Sometimes it happens when I stand up quickly, but not always. Other times it just… comes on. It's hard to explain. And with it, my hearing… goes muffled. Like someone turned down the volume. It doesn't last long, though. A few minutes, maybe. Then it's back to normal. Or… mostly normal. It's never really completely normal, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds quite unsettling, Terasa. The sensation of the room spinning, accompanied by muffled hearing, is helpful information. It does sound as though we are dealing with a vestibular issue, potentially affecting your inner ear. The fact that it occurs with position changes is also important. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me if anything specific triggers these episodes, aside from standing up?
PATIENT: Oh dear… triggers… That’s a good question. I don't know if anything specific triggers it. I’ve been trying to pay attention, but… I mostly notice it after it’s happened, not before. Sometimes when I'm… busy, I suppose. Like at work. It's a bit hectic there, you see. Lots of noise. And people. But I've been working there for years, and it didn't always happen. Honestly, everything feels a bit… jumbled in my memory lately. Is that normal? Maybe it's just old age.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to have some difficulty recalling specific triggers, Terasa. And it's not unusual to experience some memory lapses as we get older – although we’ll certainly want to rule out any other contributing factors. The fact that it seems to be more prominent during busy or noisy situations is worth noting. Let’s move on to some other questions, if you don't mind. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the dizziness and muffled hearing?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. No… not really. Well, sometimes I feel a little… off-balance, even when I'm not dizzy. Just a bit unsteady on my feet. And, now that you mention it, I suppose my hearing hasn’t been quite as sharp as it used to be, even when it isn’t muffled. It's just… gradual, you see? I just figured it was my age. I don’t know… maybe a little ringing in my ears sometimes, too. A faint sort of hum. But I've had that on and off for years, so… I didn't think much of it. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that, Terasa. It’s helpful to have a complete picture, even if things seem gradual or minor. The unsteady gait, the gradual hearing loss, and the ringing in your ears—that’s tinnitus—are all potentially related, and definitely worth investigating further. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, the doctor keeps an eye on my blood pressure, it goes up sometimes. And my knees… they ache something awful, especially when it's cold. I take something for that, a little pill. And I have Medicare, if that’s important. Honestly, that’s about it. I was always pretty healthy, until… well, until recently. My husband, he had diabetes, but I never did. I don't remember what else the doctors have told me over the years… it all just fades away, you see. .
DOCTOR: Thank you, Terasa. High blood pressure and knee pain are good to know. And having Medicare is helpful information for billing purposes. It's quite common for details to be a little hazy over time, so don’t worry about that. To clarify, the pill you take for your knees – do you remember the name of that medication?
