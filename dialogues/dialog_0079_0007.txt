DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Reihner. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you are 42 years of age. I trust you are having a reasonably good day, all things considered. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, 42 is correct. As for a “reasonably good day”… it could be better. I am here because I am in pain. It’s… well, it hurts a lot. I’d like to get it fixed, if possible.
DOCTOR: "Pain," you say. A rather… nonspecific complaint, but we shall proceed. Could you be more precise?
PATIENT: Precise? I… yes. It’s in my back. Lower back, mostly. It started… oh, maybe three weeks ago? I was working, putting up fence. Heavy work. It hasn't gotten better, and it’s making it hard to… well, to work. That’s important, you see. I need to work.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, triggered by physical labor. And you need to work, I understand. A practical concern. Is this pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant. There are times it’s worse, like when I bend over, or try to lift something. Those times, it feels like… a sharp knife. Other times it’s just a dull ache. But it’s always there, a little bit. Even when I’m just sitting. It doesn't go away completely.
DOCTOR: Constant pain, exacerbated by movement, described as both sharp and dull. Sitting doesn't provide relief. Hmm. And does this pain radiate anywhere – down your legs, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes, it does. Down my left leg, mostly. Not all the way to my foot, but to just above my knee. It feels… tingly sometimes, along with the pain. Not numbness, exactly. Just… a buzzing feeling. It’s worse when the back pain is really bad.
DOCTOR: Radiating pain down the left leg, accompanied by tingling… Now, have you experienced any weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Weakness… not really. It’s… harder to stand for long periods, maybe. And getting up from a chair is… less easy than it used to be. But I haven’t fallen, and I can still walk. I just… don’t feel as steady on my feet as I once did. Is that what you mean by weakness? I don’t know medical terms.
DOCTOR: Difficulty with prolonged standing, increased effort with ambulation…yes, that could be described as weakness, or more accurately, diminished strength. Now, Ms. Reihner, let's move on to some other areas. Have you had any problems with your bladder or bowels recently?
PATIENT: Bladder or…bowels? I…no. Not that I've noticed. Everything works like normal, if you want to know. I haven’t had any trouble with that. Why do you ask? Is that something I should be worried about? I’m sorry, I just… I don’t understand what that has to do with my back.
DOCTOR: Routine inquiry, Ms. Reihner. It's standard practice to rule out certain…complications. Now, have you ever had any prior injuries to your back?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing serious. I mean, I’ve pulled muscles before, working. Everyone who does physical labor does, you know? But nothing that ever required a doctor. Just…rest and some liniment. This is different. This hasn’t gotten better with rest. It’s just…worse and worse. I’ve been trying to ignore it, but I can’t anymore.
DOCTOR: No significant prior back injury… A progressive worsening of symptoms despite conservative management. Now, Ms. Reihner, let’s briefly discuss your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, arthritis, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. I have Medicare, but I don't go to the doctor much. I was married… my husband, he handled all that. And… he’s gone now. I just take a vitamin, that’s all. I don't have any of those conditions you mentioned. I try to stay healthy. I need to be strong for work.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had a reaction to anything. I can take most things, I think. I haven't had to take much in my life, thankfully. But, like I said, my husband took care of all that. I don’t remember any specifics. I just… know I haven’t had a bad reaction to anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s proceed with a physical examination, then. If you'd be so kind as to lie face down on the examination table. We will begin with assessing your range of motion and checking for tenderness in your lower back. Please inform me immediately if anything causes excessive pain.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. I will let you know if it hurts. Is… is there anything I should be doing? Like, should I relax? I don’t want to make it worse.
DOCTOR: Try to relax as much as possible, though I understand that may be difficult. We will start with gentle palpation. I'm simply going to press on your lower back to identify areas of tenderness. Breathe normally. Now, can you tell me where the pain is most intense?
PATIENT: It's… right here. And…it feels like it goes a little deeper than the surface. It's not just on the skin, it's… inside. And when you press… here. That's very tender. It feels like a sharp ache. It's not a good feeling.
DOCTOR: Tenderness localized to the lumbar spine, left side, with reports of deep, sharp pain upon palpation. Now, I'm going to assess your range of motion. I'd like you to gently bend forward, as far as you comfortably can. Again, please stop if you experience excessive pain.
PATIENT: It’s… hard. I can’t go very far. It hurts right here, and it feels like something is… stuck. I can’t bend much further without a lot of pain. It's not like it used to be. I used to be able to touch my toes. Not anymore.
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion upon forward flexion, with reported pain and discomfort. Now, I would like you to lie on your back, and I will assess your reflexes and strength in your lower extremities. Please keep your legs straight.
PATIENT: Okay, I’m on my back. This is… not easy. My legs feel… stiff. What will you do? I hope it doesn’t hurt too much. I’m worried about making it worse.
DOCTOR: Now, I’m going to test your reflexes. And again… Now, I would like you to attempt to lift each leg individually, while keeping the other leg flat on the table. Please inform me if you experience any weakness or pain.
PATIENT: That felt… strange. And now, lifting my legs… It’s… difficult. It feels… heavy. It’s not as strong as it should be, Doctor. I can feel it. Both legs feel… weak. But the left one is worse.
DOCTOR: Diminished reflexes bilaterally, with greater weakness noted in the left lower extremity. Alright, Ms. Reihner. Based on my examination and your reported symptoms, it appears you are experiencing lumbar radiculopathy, likely secondary to a disc herniation or spinal stenosis. However, to confirm this diagnosis, we will need to obtain imaging studies – specifically, an MRI of your lumbar spine. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: Lumbar… what? And… an MRI? That sounds… serious. A disc what? Is that… bad? Will I need surgery? I don’t understand any of these terms. And…what does this mean for my work? Is there anything I can do right now to make it better? I’m sorry, I’m just… worried. This is a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Reihner, let's break this down. "Lumbar radiculopathy" simply means there is irritation or compression of a nerve in your lower back. A "disc herniation" is when the cushion between your vertebrae slips out of place and presses on that nerve. Spinal stenosis is a narrowing of the space around the nerves. Both can cause the pain and symptoms you’re experiencing. As for surgery, not necessarily. Many cases can be managed with conservative treatment – physical therapy, pain medication, and lifestyle modifications. We need the MRI to determine the exact cause and severity of the problem before deciding on the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. Over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, can help manage the pain. I will write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant as well. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: So… no lifting. Pain pills. And… this MRI. Is that painful? And… how long will it take to get the results? And… the physical therapy… will that help? I just… I need to know if I can still work. That’s… very important to me. I can’t afford to not work. What if it’s really bad? I’m sorry for asking so many questions. I just… I’m scared.
DOCTOR: Ms. Reihner, it's perfectly alright to ask questions. It's my job to address your concerns. The MRI itself is not painful. You will lie on a table and a large magnet will create images of your spine. It is a bit noisy, but it is a non-invasive procedure. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. Once we have them, we can discuss the specifics of your condition and develop a treatment plan. Physical therapy can be very effective in managing back pain, especially if it's due to a disc herniation or spinal stenosis. It will involve exercises to strengthen your core and back muscles, improve your flexibility, and reduce your pain. As for your ability to work, that will depend on the severity of your condition. I recommend discussing your limitations with your employer and exploring options for modified duties while you recover. I can provide a work note outlining your restrictions once we have the MRI results. I understand your concerns, and I assure you we will do everything we can to get you back to work and feeling better. Do you have any other questions at this point?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. You explained it well, Doctor. So… I need to schedule this MRI. And then I come back to see you with the results? And…you’ll write a note for work? Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the MRI? I don’t want to mess it up. And… thank you, Doctor. For being patient with me. This is… a lot.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Reihner. I will have the receptionist schedule your MRI. Please ensure you inform them of any metal implants or allergies you may have. You do not need to do anything special to prepare, but it is best to remove any jewelry or metallic objects before the procedure. Once you have the results, please bring them to our office, and we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. I will be happy to provide a work note outlining any restrictions you may have, as needed. Do you have any questions about that?
