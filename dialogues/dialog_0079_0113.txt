DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you’re 74 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Seventy-four, is it? Seems like yesterday I was… well, never you mind. It’s this… going to the bathroom, I suppose. Too much of it. All the time. It’s a nuisance, really. A proper nuisance.
DOCTOR: "Too much of it," you say. Very well. Could you elaborate on that, please?
PATIENT: Elaborate? What do you mean? I just told you! I go… a lot. More than a man should, if you ask me. Especially at my age. It's not like I'm drinking gallons of water, either. Just a normal amount. It’s just… constant. Keeps me up at night, mostly. And when I'm out doing things… well, you can imagine.
DOCTOR: I understand you're experiencing frequent urination. When did you first notice this becoming a problem, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I notice? That's… a good question. Everything’s a bit of a blur these days, you know? I suppose… maybe a few months back? Or was it last fall? Honestly, it crept up on me. Didn’t happen all at once. Just… gradually got worse and worse. It’s hard to put a date on it, really.
DOCTOR: Very well. And is there anything that seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Let me think… Not really. Not that I've noticed. Maybe… when it's cold? I feel the urge more when the weather turns. But honestly, it's pretty consistent. Doesn't matter what I eat or drink. Doesn't matter if I've been sitting or walking. It just… happens. A proper bother, I tell ya.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you experience any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not a bit. Burning… hmm. Now that you mention it… maybe a little discomfort sometimes? But it’s not pain, mind you. It’s just… a little sting, perhaps? Very mild. Barely noticeable, really. I wouldn't call it painful. More like… an annoyance.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you having any difficulty starting to urinate, or emptying your bladder completely?
PATIENT: Difficulty? Now there's a question. Hmm... Sometimes it takes a moment, yes. A little hesitation, you could say. Not a long time, mind you. Just… a beat or two. And emptying… well, I suppose I don’t always feel like I get everything out. But I don't sit there forever, trying. It's just… a feeling. Maybe a little dribble afterwards, sometimes. But nothing major. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a young man anymore. Things don't work like they used to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color or smell? Goodness, I haven't been studying my urine, Doctor! You expect me to be looking at that? I go to the bathroom, and that's that! It looks… yellow, I suppose. Like urine usually looks. And smell… well, it smells like urine, too! I haven’t noticed anything different. Honestly, I’ve got more important things to worry about.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, or had any problems with your kidneys?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh, no, never. Not me. I've always been a healthy man, despite what my wife says. And kidneys… hmm. I had a bit of a back problem years ago, but the doctor said it wasn’t my kidneys. Nothing serious, I assure you. Just an old man’s aches and pains. I don't recall any trouble with my kidneys, specifically.
DOCTOR: And have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… Oh! Yes, I had my appendix out when I was a young man. A proper scare, that was. And… oh, and I had a bit of work done on my knee a few years back. Arthroscopic, they called it. Nothing major. Just cleaned some things up. Besides that… no, I can’t recall anything else. Old age, you know, it makes one forgetful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a little something for my blood pressure, the doctor gave it to me a while back. Can't remember the name of it, honestly. And… oh, sometimes I take an aspirin for my joints when they're acting up. That’s about it. I don't go in for all these fancy pills. Natural remedies are better, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat just about anything, and I’ve never had a problem. My wife always tells me I should be more careful, but I’m a hardy man. A bit of dust bothers my nose sometimes, but that’s hardly an allergy, is it?
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. I'll need to check your abdomen and, if you don't mind, perform a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. It will provide me with valuable information. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: A… a what exam? A digital… oh dear. Now hold on just a minute, Doctor. You want to… check my prostate? With your… fingers? Well, that's… that's a bit much, isn't it? I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that. I came here about going to the bathroom too much, not… that. Is there absolutely no other way?
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, with all due respect, a digital rectal exam is a standard procedure for evaluating potential prostate issues, which are a common cause of frequent urination in men your age. It’s a necessary step to rule out any serious underlying problems. While I understand your discomfort, refusing this examination will limit my ability to provide an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. We can discuss alternatives, such as a PSA blood test, but it's not as comprehensive. Are you willing to reconsider?
PATIENT: Oh, bother. Always something with doctors, isn't it? A proper nuisance. Well… I suppose if you say it’s necessary. But I’m not happy about it, Doctor. Not happy at all. Just… get it over with quickly, alright? And be gentle. A man’s got his pride, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie on your side with your knees drawn up towards your chest. I will explain each step as I proceed. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but it should be brief.
PATIENT: Brief for you, maybe. A proper indignity, this is. Just… hurry it up, Doctor. The sooner this is over, the better. Don't poke around too much, alright?
DOCTOR: Alright. The prostate feels mildly enlarged, but there are no immediately concerning nodules or irregularities. There was some residual urine present. Now, I'd like to order a urinalysis and a PSA blood test to get a clearer picture. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Enlarged, you say? That doesn't sound good. And residual urine… what does that even mean? Is it serious? Honestly, Doctor, you're not making me feel any better. A urinalysis and a blood test… fine. Whatever you think is necessary. Just… tell me if it's something awful, alright? No sugarcoating.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, an enlarged prostate is a common condition in men of your age, known as benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. It’s rarely a sign of anything serious, but it can cause urinary symptoms like frequent urination and difficulty emptying your bladder. The residual urine indicates that you’re not fully emptying your bladder, which can increase the risk of infection. The urinalysis and PSA test will help us determine the severity of the condition and rule out any other potential causes. We'll discuss the results when they are available, and formulate a plan accordingly. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: Benign… what-now? And infections… oh dear. So it is serious, then? You said ‘risk of infection’. I don't want an infection! What kind of plan? Will I need… surgery? My wife will have a field day if I need surgery. Honestly, Doctor, you're throwing a lot of medical terms at me. It’s all a bit overwhelming. Just… tell me in plain English. Is this something I need to worry about right away?
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, I understand your concern. To put it simply, your prostate is slightly larger than it should be, causing some difficulty with urination. It's not an immediate emergency, but it does require attention. Surgery is one potential option, but it’s rarely the first line of treatment. We'll likely start with lifestyle modifications – things like reducing fluid intake before bed and timed voiding – and possibly medication to help relax the muscles in your prostate and improve urine flow. The PSA test will help us assess whether further investigation, such as a referral to a urologist, is necessary. We'll discuss all of these options in detail when the results are available. I will order the tests now, and the clinic will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience fever, chills, or significant pain during urination, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: Timed voiding? What does that even mean? And lifestyle modifications… I suppose I can try. But honestly, I’m not optimistic. My wife will be all over me if I have to get up all night. Tell me honestly, Doctor… is this going to ruin my life?
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, with all due respect, your condition is manageable. Timed voiding simply means urinating on a regular schedule, even if you don't feel the urge, to help retrain your bladder. It's unlikely to "ruin your life," as you put it. With proper management, you should be able to maintain a reasonable quality of life. I understand your concerns, but it's important to remain optimistic and follow my recommendations. Now, if you have no further questions, I believe we have concluded for today. The clinic staff will assist you with scheduling your follow-up appointment. .
PATIENT: Optimistic… easy for you to say. Fine. I suppose I’ll see what the clinic says. Honestly, doctors… always making a mountain out of a molehill. . .
