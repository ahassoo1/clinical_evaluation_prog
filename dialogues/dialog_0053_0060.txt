DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Theriot, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor Pitmon. It’s… family history, really. My mother’s side, specifically. A lot of heart trouble. And cancer, unfortunately. It’s just… looming over everything, you know? I want to make sure I’m okay. Preventative stuff, if that makes sense. I don’t want to end up like them.
DOCTOR: Right. Preventative. Understandable. Though, honestly, worrying about family history before anything is wrong... it’s a bit much, don’t you think?
PATIENT: A bit much? With all due respect, Doctor, it’s called being responsible. My uncle died young. Young. And my mother… well, let's just say it wasn’t pretty. I’d rather be proactive than… than wait for something to happen. It’s not being dramatic, it’s being smart. Don't you think?
DOCTOR: Look, I appreciate a patient who takes their health seriously, truly. But running a battery of tests on a perfectly healthy twenty-four-year-old simply because a relative had an issue?
PATIENT: “Perfectly healthy?” I haven’t even had a check-up in years! How can you say I'm perfectly healthy? And it's not just "an issue," Doctor. It's a pattern. A genetic predisposition. You’d think someone with your education would understand that. Is this going to be a problem? Because if you're just going to dismiss my concerns, I’d rather not waste either of our time.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to be… confrontational. I'm simply suggesting we approach this with a little more… practicality. Genetic predisposition is possible, certainly, but it doesn’t guarantee anything. Now, let’s get some actual information. Tell me, have you experienced any symptoms yourself?
PATIENT: Symptoms? No. Not exactly. Just… anxiety, I suppose. Always feeling a bit run down. A little… breathless sometimes. But who doesn’t feel breathless these days? It’s probably just stress, honestly. From work, and… everything else. But that doesn’t mean it's nothing, does it? That's why I'm here! I want to rule things out.
DOCTOR: “Anxiety, occasional breathlessness.” Right. And are these episodes of breathlessness brought on by anything specific?
PATIENT: Not really. It's... random. Sometimes it's after climbing stairs, but other times it's just... sitting there. Or walking across the room. It's not predictable, which is what worries me. If it was just when I exerted myself, I wouldn't be here bothering you. It just feels… different. And I don't like it.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history? Not much to tell, honestly. Usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, maybe. Broken arm when I was eight. Nothing serious. No hospitalizations. No chronic illnesses. I’m generally… healthy. Until recently, at least. That’s why I’m starting to get concerned, and why I scheduled this appointment in the first place. I don’t like feeling like I'm ignoring something potentially serious. Do you need a list of vaccinations? Because frankly, I don’t have one.
DOCTOR: Alright. No chronic illnesses, broken arm as a child. And no idea about vaccinations. I'm going to need to check your vitals and listen to your heart and lungs. It's just standard procedure. Afterwards, we can discuss… potential tests. Though, I still maintain it may be premature. Let’s start with the physical exam, shall we?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do. But I want to be clear – if you tell me everything is fine and I still feel anxious, I'm getting a second opinion. I'm not leaving until I feel like my concerns are being taken seriously. Now, let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a seat. I’ll start with your blood pressure. Then we'll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Try to relax. It makes things easier, you know.
PATIENT: Relax? Easier for you, maybe. Just… hurry up. I have things to do. And honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit… claustrophobic in here. Is this room even ventilated properly?
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 120/80. Heart rate is 72, regular. Breath sounds are… slightly diminished bilaterally, but no wheezing or crackles. Palpating your abdomen now... no tenderness, no masses. Any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Not intentionally. Maybe a couple of pounds, but nothing drastic. Work’s been stressful, so I haven't been eating as much. More… picking at things than actual meals, if that makes sense. It's probably just stress-related. But I've noticed my clothes feel a little… looser, maybe? It’s hard to say. I haven't been paying much attention to it, to be honest. I've been too preoccupied with… everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history specifically?
PATIENT: Where do I even begin? My mother’s father – heart disease. Massive heart attack, age 68. My maternal aunt – breast cancer, early fifties. My mother herself – high blood pressure, diabetes, and… a stroke, last year. It was… rough. And then there’s a distant cousin on my mother’s side, colon cancer. It's practically a family tradition. Does that answer your question? Is that enough family history for you?
DOCTOR: Right. Significant family history of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Given your concerns, occasional breathlessness, and family history... I suppose we can run some basic tests. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and an EKG. And, frankly, I think a chest X-ray is warranted. We’ll see what those reveal. It will likely alleviate your anxiety, if nothing else.
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, that's exactly what I want. I need to know. So, what's the next step? Where do we do these tests? And how long will it take to get the results? I'd like to schedule a follow-up appointment now, just to be safe. I really don't want to leave this unresolved for too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m ordering the blood work and EKG now. The lab is just down the hall, third door on the left. And the X-ray technician is located across the hall, suite 204. They’ll get you in as soon as possible. Results typically take 24-48 hours. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week, once the results are available. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and give you the lab requisitions and instructions. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that works perfectly. Thank you, Doctor. Finally, some action. I appreciate it. Just... please make sure they understand my concerns, okay? It's not just about getting numbers back. I need someone to actually look at them and take them seriously.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Theriot. I’ll make a note in your chart. Sarah is very thorough and will ensure your concerns are addressed. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to see. Please, let me know if you have any questions for Sarah. .
PATIENT: .
