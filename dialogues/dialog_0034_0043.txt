DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Gibbel. My name is Dr. Seil. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, I've been getting these headaches, right in the back of my head. Not all the time, but enough to bother a fella. They've been going on for… oh, let me think… about three weeks now, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Percell. Headaches for about three weeks, located in the back of your head. Can you describe the headaches for me?
PATIENT: Well, they aren't like, pounding, you know? More of a… dull ache. Like someone's tightening a band around my head. And sometimes, it feels like it goes up the back of my neck a little. It’s not constant, comes and goes. Seems worse when I’m reading, actually. I do a lot of reading, see. Old newspapers, mostly. Keeps the mind sharp.
DOCTOR: That's good to stay mentally active, Percell. A dull ache, tightening sensation, sometimes radiating to the neck, and worsened by reading… I see. Is there anything that relieves the headache?
PATIENT: Hmm, relieve it… not really, not much. Sometimes, if I just sit quietly in a dark room for a bit, it’ll calm down a little. But it always comes back. And a warm washcloth on the back of my neck helps some, but not for long. I've tried those over-the-counter pain pills, the ones for headaches, but they don’t seem to do much good either.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, quiet, dark room and a warm washcloth offer some temporary relief, but the pain returns. Over-the-counter pain relievers aren’t effective. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headaches?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. No fever, no dizziness. My vision’s been okay, I think. I had a little trouble with my balance a couple times, but I figured that was just getting up too fast, you know? Old age catching up with me. No nausea or anything like that. Just the headache, mostly. Oh, and I've been a little more tired than usual, but I figured that's just…well, being 84.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, dizziness, or vision changes. Some mild balance issues, but attributing those to getting up quickly. No nausea. Increased fatigue, but assuming that's age-related. Now, Percell, can you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh boy, medical history… that's a long story. Let's see... I had pneumonia when I was a young man, back in Laos. But that was a long time ago. I had my gallbladder removed maybe fifteen years ago. And my blood pressure gets a little high sometimes, the doctor told me, but I don't take anything for it regularly. Just try to watch my salt intake. Other than that, not much. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay. Pneumonia in Laos many years ago, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, and some history of high blood pressure, managed with dietary changes. Have you had any surgeries other than your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: No, sir, just the gallbladder. And a few stitches here and there when I was a kid, climbing trees and getting into mischief. But nothing major, not since I came to this country. I've been pretty careful since then. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And Percell, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. I don’t really believe in taking a lot of pills unless I absolutely have to. I try to eat healthy, get a little exercise when I can, and that’s about it. My daughter keeps telling me I should take a vitamin D supplement, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements. Now, can you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. We ate a lot of different things growing up, you see, foraging in the jungle and such. My wife, God rest her soul, she was the one who always worried about allergies, but I never had any problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a tough one, Doctor. My family… well, we didn’t have a lot of doctors growing up. But my mother, she had arthritis in her hands when she got older. And my brother, he had some heart trouble, but he didn’t take care of himself, you see. Smoked too much, drank too much. Other than that, not that I recall. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t keep good records.
DOCTOR: Alright. Arthritis in your mother and heart trouble in your brother. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Well, I came to this country as a refugee back in the 70s, after the war. Worked hard my whole life, mostly farming. Been divorced for about twenty years now. Have one daughter, bless her heart. She lives in California, comes to visit when she can. I live alone, mostly. Keep myself busy reading, watching the news, and tending to my garden. It’s a quiet life, but it’s my own.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Percell. That's helpful. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know about these headaches, or anything else going on with your health?
PATIENT: Hmm... Let me think. Oh! Yes. I've been feeling a little bit more forgetful lately. Not terrible, but I sometimes misplace things. Keys, glasses… things like that. And I have a little trouble remembering names sometimes. But I figured that was just getting old too. It's just... little things. But I wanted to mention it, just in case.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Percell. That’s good to know. Some increased forgetfulness… We’ll make a note of that. Alright, Percell, I’d like to do a quick physical exam now. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that's fine. Go right ahead, Doctor. I'll do whatever you need me to do.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/86. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.2 Fahrenheit. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your neurological function. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can do that. Just tell me when to stop.
DOCTOR: Good, excellent. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is that good?
DOCTOR: That's good, good strength. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Both reflexes are present and equal. Finally, I’m going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Your ears look clear, and your throat is normal. Okay, Percell. Everything seems generally normal on the exam, but the elevated blood pressure and your reports of headaches and forgetfulness warrant further investigation. I would like to order some blood work to start, including a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test. We should also check your vitamin D levels.
PATIENT: That sounds reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood work, you say? Alright. Will that take long? And will I need to fast before that, or anything?
DOCTOR: Yes, blood work. You will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the test, meaning no food or drinks other than water. The lab will give you specific instructions when you go. It will take about an hour to draw the blood and send it off to be analyzed. We should have the results back in about a week. In the meantime, I would like you to monitor your blood pressure at home if possible. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home, or can you easily obtain one?
PATIENT: No, I don't have one, Doctor. Never really needed one before. My daughter, she might have one… I'll have to ask her when I talk to her next. But I can probably get one at the drugstore, if I need to. Monitoring my blood pressure… alright. I can do that. Is there a certain time of day I should be checking it, or just whenever I feel up to it?
DOCTOR: Good. If you can get one, that would be helpful. Check it twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening, before you eat anything or take any medications. Keep a log of the readings – the date and time, and the systolic and diastolic numbers. While we're waiting for the blood work results, let's talk about some things you can do to manage your blood pressure. First, try to reduce your salt intake. Avoid processed foods, canned soups, and fast food. Second, make sure you're getting regular exercise, even if it's just a short walk each day. And third, try to manage your stress levels. Do you have any hobbies or activities that you enjoy?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds doable, Doctor. Less salt, more walking, less stress… easier said than done, maybe, but I'll try. I do enjoy my reading, that helps calm me down. And I like tending to my garden, when the weather's nice. It's good to be outside, get some fresh air. But sometimes, worrying about things gets the best of me, you know? Especially with everything going on in the world these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's difficult to manage stress, especially with current events. Reading and gardening are excellent coping mechanisms, though. Percell, given your reports of headaches and forgetfulness, and the elevated blood pressure, I'd also like to discuss the possibility of a mild cognitive impairment. While it may be nothing, it's best to rule out any underlying causes. Would you be open to a simple cognitive screening test during your next visit?
PATIENT: A…cognitive screening test? You think… you think my mind is going? Oh dear. I've been a little forgetful, that's true, but I figured that was just old age. If you think it's important, Doctor, then yes, I'm willing to take the test. But it does worry me a little, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be worried, Percell. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. A cognitive screening test is a simple way to assess your memory and thinking skills. It's like a little check-up for your brain. It can help us identify any areas that might need further evaluation, and it can also give us a baseline to track any changes over time. We can schedule that for your next visit. In the meantime, let’s focus on the blood work and managing your blood pressure. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Percell?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you’ve covered everything. Just… try not to worry me too much, alright? I'll try to cut back on the salt, get more exercise, and I'll ask my daughter about that blood pressure cuff. And I'll see you next time for that… brain test. Thank you for your time, Doctor Seil. I appreciate you listening to me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Percell. I understand your concerns, and I will do my best to keep you informed and address any questions you have. We'll take things one step at a time. Here's a lab order for the blood work. The receptionist will help you schedule a follow-up appointment for your cognitive screening. Take care of yourself, Percell. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your next visit. .
