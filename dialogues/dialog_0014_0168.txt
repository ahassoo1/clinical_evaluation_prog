DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pandolfi, good to see you. Or… as good as can be, I suppose, when someone's coming to see a doctor. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Osterholm, it’s rather… delicate. I’m dating someone, and I suppose I just want to make sure everything is… in order, shall we say? One must be prudent. It’s not every day a woman my age meets someone… suitable.
DOCTOR: “Suitable,” yes. Right. Look, Ms. Pandolfi, I appreciate… discretion, but frankly, vague concerns aren't terribly helpful. Are you experiencing any physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. Not at all! I maintain a very… respectable lifestyle. It’s more a matter of… preventative care. Ensuring everything is as it should be before… well, before things become serious. You understand. One doesn’t want any… surprises. I simply want a clean bill of health, a confirmation, if you will, that I am… fit for companionship.
DOCTOR: So, you want a general check-up, focused… on sexual health, essentially?
PATIENT: Precisely! Though I prefer to call it… relational health. It sounds so much more… refined. And yes, a thorough assessment is exactly what I’m after. I wouldn’t want to, heaven forbid, be… burdening anyone with unforeseen complications. It’s simply responsible. Do you require a list of… activities? To better gauge the necessary… scope of the examination?
DOCTOR: Activities?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, surely there’s a protocol. One must be comprehensive, wouldn’t you agree? To ascertain potential risks. The level of… engagement, shall we say, dictates the thoroughness, doesn't it? I wouldn’t want to waste your valuable time with unnecessary… probing, if everything is quite… standard.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, let’s be clear. I’m a family medicine doctor. I do general health screenings. I'm not here to… catalog your personal life. I need to understand what specific concerns you have. Are you worried about sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Oh! Well, when you put it that way. It sounds rather… indelicate. But, yes. Of course, that's part of it. One simply wants to be… certain. It would be mortifying, simply mortifying, to discover something… untoward. And, honestly, the gentleman is… rather charming. I wouldn’t want to ruin everything with a… preventable issue. Is there a standard test for… everything? I assume there is. A complete panel, as it were.
DOCTOR: Alright. A standard STI screening includes tests for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV. We can also check for herpes if you'd like, though that one is often done based on symptoms. Do you have any known allergies or have you ever tested positive for any STIs in the past?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. My mother always said a strong constitution is a woman’s greatest asset. And no, I've never… needed to be tested before. I've always been… careful, you understand. This gentleman is… different. He’s quite persuasive. But I wouldn’t want any past indiscretions to… complicate matters now, of course. So, all of them, please. The complete panel, as you said. To be perfectly thorough. And do you administer the results privately? One wouldn’t want any… gossip.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Pandolfi, results are confidential. Now, regarding your medical history… have you had any significant illnesses, surgeries, or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had my tonsils removed as a child, a rather unpleasant affair. And a minor wrist fracture in college – tripped over a rug during a cotillion, can you imagine? But nothing serious, nothing that would… preclude a healthy relationship. I’ve always been quite regular with my check-ups, though they’re usually just for… maintenance, you understand. Blood pressure, cholesterol… the usual. My physician always praised my vitality. Is there a particular illness you’re concerned about? Perhaps something… communicable?
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsils removed, wrist fracture… noted. And no major medical issues reported. What about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother lived to be 92, a testament to good genes and sensible living. She never smoked, barely drank a glass of sherry, and walked every day. My father… he had some heart trouble in his later years, but that was due to stress, I believe. He was a very important man, quite burdened with responsibility. As for grandparents… I believe my maternal grandmother had some… arthritis. Nothing terribly serious. Is there something specific you're looking for? A predisposition to a… particular ailment? I assure you, we are a remarkably healthy family.
DOCTOR: Just routine, Ms. Pandolfi. Do you currently take any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, just a daily multivitamin, for general well-being, of course. And occasionally, I take a calcium supplement, Doctor, to support bone density. One must be proactive, you understand. Otherwise, perfectly fine. No prescription medications, thankfully. I pride myself on maintaining a natural constitution. And I rarely, if ever, drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of champagne on a special occasion, but that’s hardly… frequent. Is that sufficient, Doctor? Or do you require a detailed inventory of every… herbal remedy I’ve ever encountered?
DOCTOR: No, that’s fine. Now, let's talk about… your social habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! I find the very notion… appalling. My mother would be horrified. I've always been vehemently opposed to smoking. It’s simply… uncouth. And detrimental to one's complexion, naturally. No, Doctor, I assure you, I am a perfectly healthy, non-smoking individual. This gentleman… he doesn't smoke either, thankfully. It's a rather important… compatibility factor, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Pandolfi, it sounds as though you’re very diligent about your health. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then we can draw some blood for the STI panel. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Perfectly acceptable, Doctor. Though I do hope it won't be too… intrusive. I've always been rather sensitive about my… personal space. But I understand it's necessary. And do you sterilize the equipment, naturally? One wouldn't want to… contract anything from the examination itself. It would be rather ironic, wouldn’t it? And please, be gentle. I haven’t had a thorough examination in… quite some time.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Pandolfi, everything is sterilized. Please, have a seat. We’ll keep it as comfortable and efficient as possible. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Can you tell me your height and weight?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’m approximately five feet six inches, and… well, let’s just say I’m a comfortable 160 pounds. I’ve always been… generously proportioned. But my physician assures me it’s healthy weight. It’s the distribution, you understand, that matters. And please, don't feel obligated to comment on it. It's a rather sensitive topic, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, five feet six inches, 160 pounds. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. A little elevated, but not alarming. Heart sounds are regular, but a slight murmur is present. Probably benign, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft. Now, I’ll need to draw a small amount of blood for the STI panel. Please, extend your arm.
PATIENT: Oh dear. I do detest needles. Absolutely detest them. Is it going to be terribly painful? And please, be swift. I’ve always been rather faint-hearted, you see. One might be… overcome. And do let me know when you’re finished. I prefer not to… anticipate it. A quick, decisive prick, if you will. That’s all I ask. A quick, decisive prick.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pandolfi, it will be a quick prick. Just try to relax. There. All done. See?
PATIENT: Oh! That was rather quick, actually. Though my arm does feel a bit… strange. And is there any chance of… bruising? I have a rather important engagement this evening. A dinner date, you see. One wouldn’t want to arrive with a… noticeable mark. And do I need to restrict my activities? Perhaps no dancing? Or vigorous conversation? It’s just that my gentleman friend… he’s rather… particular.
DOCTOR: A little bruising is possible, but it should be minimal. Avoid strenuous activity for a few hours. Vigorous conversation should be perfectly safe. The lab results will be available in a few days. We’ll call you with the results. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, rash, or unusual symptoms, please contact us immediately. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. Though… do you think it's advisable to mention this visit to my… gentleman friend? Or would it be better to keep it discreet? I wouldn't want to… alarm him unnecessarily. He's a very sensitive soul, you see. And he prides himself on… composure. Perhaps a vague explanation of a routine check-up? Or is that… misleading? It's simply… complicated.
DOCTOR: Ms. Pandolfi, I am a physician, not a relationship counselor. Whether or not you disclose this visit to your companion is entirely your decision. I recommend being honest and open in your relationships, but ultimately, it’s your choice. Do you have any medical allergies I should make note of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No allergies, as I said before. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to… strong perfumes. My mother always said they induced headaches. But nothing medically significant. No, Doctor. Perfectly allergy-free. As far as I know. Well, thank you for your time. And for… reassuring me. It's been… enlightening. Though perhaps a bit stressful. I suppose I shall await your call. And try to… compose myself.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pandolfi. You're welcome. Do try not to worry. And please, don't hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. Have a good evening.
PATIENT: .
