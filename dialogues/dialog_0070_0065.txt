DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’ve been… gaining weight. It’s rather unsettling, and I haven’t altered my routine, so I thought it best to have a doctor take a look. It’s been happening for a few months now, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weight gain when there haven't been changes to your lifestyle can be concerning, and it's good you're addressing it. A few months, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, approximately three months, perhaps a little longer. It wasn’t sudden, thankfully, but… noticeable. I used to weigh myself regularly, but recently I haven’t been inclined to. I didn’t want to know, if that makes any sense. It’s been a bit distressing, honestly.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. It’s perfectly normal to avoid something that’s causing you distress. And thank you for sharing that with me. Let’s try to get to the bottom of this. To start, could you tell me a little more about your typical day?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, my husband, Tomas, and I wake around six. He goes to work shortly after – he’s a carpenter. I manage the household, mostly. Cleaning, cooking… I volunteer at the church a few times a week, helping with the food bank. In the evenings, we usually have a quiet dinner and watch television. It’s… rather ordinary, really. I wouldn’t say I’m particularly active, but I’m not entirely sedentary either. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful. It sounds like a reasonably active, though perhaps not strenuous, routine. And you mentioned volunteering – how many times a week do you typically do that, and roughly how long does each session last?
PATIENT: Generally, two times a week. Sometimes three, if they’re short-handed. Each session usually lasts about three to four hours, lifting boxes mostly – not terribly heavy, thankfully. It's more standing and walking than anything strenuous, if that clarifies anything. I do enjoy it, it feels good to help.
DOCTOR: It does clarify, thank you. Lifting, even lighter boxes, is still activity. Now, let’s talk about your diet. Could you describe a typical day of eating for you?
PATIENT: Of course. Well, breakfast is usually oatmeal with some fruit. Lunch is… typically a sandwich, perhaps with some soup. Nothing extravagant. Dinner is generally meat – chicken or pork – with potatoes and vegetables. We try to eat healthy, truthfully. Tomas does most of the cooking. We aren’t big on sweets, though I do enjoy a small piece of chocolate occasionally. We drink water with our meals, sometimes tea. I don’t drink soda. I suppose it's fairly standard, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds like a generally balanced diet. And how much water would you estimate you drink in a day?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Perhaps six to eight glasses? I don’t keep precise track, but I try to stay hydrated. We’ve always been told it's important. And I do refill my glass throughout the day, so probably at least that much. I wouldn't say I force myself to drink, but I do drink regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, six to eight glasses is good. Now, let’s move onto other potential factors. Have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Hmm… other changes? Let me think. No, not particularly. I've been sleeping alright, perhaps a little more tired than usual, but nothing debilitating. My mood has been stable, I think. No changes in my bowel habits... No swelling in my ankles or feet, nothing like that. It’s rather perplexing, truthfully. I haven’t altered any medications, either. I don't take anything regularly.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. And just to be thorough, have you experienced any changes in your skin or hair?
PATIENT: No, nothing of note. My hair is… well, it’s greying, as one would expect at my age. But no unusual thinning, dryness, or anything like that. My skin is its usual fair complexion. I do moisturize, of course. It gets quite dry in the winter. But no rashes, blemishes, or anything concerning. I’m quite meticulous about skincare, truthfully. It’s a habit from my mother.
DOCTOR: Good. And one final question regarding changes before we proceed to past medical history: have you noticed any increased thirst or urination lately?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I urinate as frequently as I always have, and I don’t feel particularly thirsty. I suppose that rules out some possibilities. It truly is a puzzle, isn't it? I am rather frustrated that I cannot pinpoint the cause. Perhaps it’s simply aging? Though I find that rather… discouraging.
DOCTOR: It is frustrating when we can’t pinpoint a cause immediately. It’s good that you haven’t experienced those changes, though. Aging can contribute to some metabolic changes, but let’s explore further before attributing it to that. Now, let me ask about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, thyroid problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I've been fortunate to remain in relatively good health, thankfully. I’ve had the usual childhood illnesses – measles, chickenpox – but nothing serious. I've never been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, and I haven’t been hospitalized except for the birth of my son, many years ago. My family has a history of… well, mostly just aches and pains, to be honest. Nothing particularly alarming. I see my dentist regularly, of course. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily. That's good to know, truly. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, I haven’t. Nothing of that nature. Just the usual preventative care, truthfully. Dental work, yearly check-ups… I’m quite diligent about maintaining my health. I believe in preventative measures, if that makes sense. I find it far easier to prevent something than to treat it, if possible. My mother always said an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. It stuck with me, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible approach. Now, could you tell me about any allergies you have?
PATIENT: No allergies that I am aware of. I haven't reacted to any medications, foods, or environmental factors. I don't have any sensitivities or issues that I know of. Honestly, I feel almost silly that I have so little medical history! It is mostly just a consistent, ordinary life. Is this information helpful, Doctor? Perhaps I am not a very interesting patient.
DOCTOR: Not at all! A lack of significant medical history is excellent information, and you're not a boring patient! It helps us rule things out and focus our attention. Now, just to confirm, you're currently not taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Precisely. Not a single one. I occasionally take a pain reliever for a headache, but that's infrequent, and it’s just ibuprofen – a standard dose. Other than that, nothing at all. I prefer natural remedies whenever possible, a cup of tea, a warm bath… I truly avoid medication unless absolutely necessary. It's a habit, I suppose. My husband often jokes that I'm more afraid of the side effects than the ailment itself.
DOCTOR: That's understandable. Alright. Now, finally, let's talk about your family. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, as I mentioned, mostly aches and pains. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had arthritis, quite severely, towards the end of her life. My father had some heart trouble later in life, but he smoked for many years, so it’s not terribly surprising. My brother is perfectly healthy, as far as I know. Nothing major, truthfully. No history of diabetes, thyroid issues, or anything like that. It's a rather unremarkable family history, to be frank. Does that assist you, Doctor? I am eager to find the cause of this weight gain. It is unsettling, to say the least.
DOCTOR: It does, thank you. An unremarkable family history is also helpful information. Alright, Ms. Selbitschka, thank you for providing me with such a detailed history. It’s very thorough, and I appreciate your patience. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Yes, absolutely. I am quite prepared to do whatever you deem necessary. I trust your judgment entirely. I just want to understand why my weight is increasing, and what, if anything, can be done about it. I am at your disposal. Please proceed at your convenience. I will remain still and cooperate fully.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’d please, step onto the examination table. I'm going to start by checking your height and weight. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen, and check your reflexes. It shouldn't take long. Okay, your height is 155 centimeters and your weight is 83 kilograms. Now, if you'll please, take a deep breath and I'll listen to your lungs.
PATIENT: Very well. . One moment. . I trust the instruments are accurate? My husband always jokes about unreliable scales... It is a bit of a family jest. But please proceed, Doctor. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Lungs sound clear. No wheezing, crackles, or other unusual sounds. Now, I’ll listen to your heart. Heart sounds regular. No murmurs or abnormal rhythms detected. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. Any tenderness or pain when I press here?
PATIENT: . No, Doctor, that feels perfectly normal. No pain whatsoever. My abdomen is quite... unremarkable, to be frank. I occasionally experience a little indigestion, but nothing persistent. It comes and goes. This feels no different than usual. No tenderness at all. Please proceed. I am cooperating fully. It is a relief that everything seems normal so far, truthfully.
DOCTOR: Good. No masses or tenderness detected. Now, I'll check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal, bilaterally. Alright, Ms. Selbitschka, the physical exam didn’t reveal anything immediately concerning. Given your history and the physical findings, and the fact that you’re not experiencing any other symptoms, my initial thought is to rule out any underlying metabolic causes for the weight gain. Specifically, I'd like to order some blood tests.
PATIENT: Blood tests? . Certainly, Doctor, if you deem it necessary. What specifically will these tests reveal? I admit I am not particularly knowledgeable about medical procedures. I’ve always been fortunate enough to remain in good health. I suppose I simply wish to understand what is happening. Are these tests… invasive? Will they be painful? I apologize for my constant questions, I simply want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Selbitschka. It's perfectly reasonable to ask questions. The blood tests aren't invasive and they shouldn't be painful—just a quick prick of a needle. Specifically, I want to check your thyroid hormone levels, your blood sugar levels, and a complete metabolic panel. This will help us rule out hypothyroidism, diabetes, and any other underlying metabolic imbalances that could be contributing to the weight gain. We will also assess your lipid profile, just as a general health screening. The results typically take a few days to come back. Once we have them, we can discuss them in detail and formulate a plan. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Thyroid, blood sugar, metabolic panel... I shall attempt to remember those terms. . As long as it’s not terribly painful, I am quite prepared to proceed. A few days to wait… I suppose patience is a virtue. Is there anything I should do to prepare for the blood draw? Should I fast beforehand? Or is there any particular clothing I should wear? I want to ensure I am properly prepared, and not cause any inconvenience to the laboratory staff.
DOCTOR: Excellent questions. Yes, for the most accurate results, you will need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. That means no food or drink – except for water – during that time. As for clothing, wear something comfortable with sleeves that can easily be rolled up. It's really quite straightforward. The lab is just down the hall. I'll write you a requisition form with detailed instructions. You can go whenever it’s convenient for you. Once you've had the blood draw, you can schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss the results, or we can do a phone consultation if that’s easier. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly manageable, Doctor. Fasting for eight to twelve hours... I can certainly arrange that. I will ensure I have nothing to eat after dinner tonight. I will locate the lab, and schedule an appointment accordingly. A requisition form, you said? Excellent. Thank you, Doctor. You have been most thorough and patient with my questions. It has alleviated much of my anxiety. I appreciate your careful consideration and detailed explanations. I shall return with the results as soon as possible. Is there anything else I should be aware of before I depart?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. I'm glad I could alleviate some of your anxiety. And you're a very thoughtful patient – it’s helpful when I have a good understanding of your concerns. No, I don’t think there’s anything else at this point. Just try to relax and focus on getting some rest. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms while you're waiting for the results—such as excessive thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, or changes in your skin—please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Here’s the requisition form. Please let the lab technician know if you have any concerns about your veins. I’ll look forward to discussing the results with you. Have a good day, Ms. Selbitschka.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Abady. I shall certainly remember that advice. And I will inform the technician of any concerns, should they arise. . I wish you a good day as well. I believe that concludes our consultation for today. I shall depart now and schedule the blood tests as soon as possible. Goodbye, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Goodbye, Ms. Selbitschka. Take care, and I’ll see you soon.
