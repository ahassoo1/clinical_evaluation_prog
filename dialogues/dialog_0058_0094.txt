DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um... hello. The paper... says education? I don't... really remember why I'm here. My husband, he made the appointment. Something about… learning? I work with metal, very hot metal, all day. It's noisy. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: Right. Education… that’s… unusual. Your husband scheduled this appointment for you?
PATIENT: Yes. He worries a lot. About… everything. He said I don’t… listen to my body. I feel fine, mostly. Just tired, sometimes. Metal work is hard. Is this about my ears? It is very loud, you know. Like, really loud. I have to yell to talk to people at work.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, the noise exposure is definitely something we should address. Let's try to clarify what’s going on. When you say you feel tired, is it a new thing?
PATIENT: New…? I don't know. Maybe. Everything feels… the same, you know? Work, home, sleep, work. It's all a blur, honestly. I don't really think about feeling tired. I just… do things. My husband gets mad when I forget things. Like, he tells me I didn't take the chicken out of the freezer. Or I forget to pay the bill. It's not a big deal. Is this about my memory? Because he said… something about that.
DOCTOR: So, you're experiencing some forgetfulness, and your husband is concerned it's impacting daily life. And you work with extremely loud machinery all day. We’ll need to get some more details, but it sounds like we should probably rule out some things. Let's start with your ears. Have you noticed any ringing in your ears, or any difficulty hearing conversations, especially at work?
PATIENT: Ringing…? Sometimes. Like, a high-pitched sound. But it goes away. Everyone at work says their ears ring. It's just… the metal! Very loud. I usually can hear okay, I think. I have to ask people to repeat themselves sometimes, but that's because they mumble! My husband says I turn the TV up too loud. Maybe they are just quiet talkers. I don’t know. Is this taking long? I have to get back for dinner.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. It sounds like you’ve been exposed to a significant amount of noise for a while, and it could be contributing to some hearing loss. We'll do a quick hearing test just to get a baseline. But frankly, I suspect this is more than just noise. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? Like, what kind of symptoms? I don't… feel sick. Just tired. And sometimes my head hurts. But everyone gets headaches, right? Maybe it's from the heat at work. Or the yelling. I don't know. My husband said I've been… slower, lately. What does that even mean? He's always saying something. This is… stressful. Can we just be quick? I really need to get home.
DOCTOR: Okay. "Slower," headaches… Alright. Let's do a basic neurological exam. It’s just a few quick tests to check your reflexes, coordination, and balance. It will help rule out other potential causes for these symptoms. And it is important we get a clear picture here, Ms. Fontanazza. It's not just about feeling "stressed." It's about your overall health. Please follow me.
PATIENT: Fine. But I don't like tests. And I told you, I'm just tired. Metal work is hard. And my husband always worries too much. But... alright. Let's get it over with. But make it quick. Really quick. I have to make dinner.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just follow my instructions. First, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please sit comfortably and let your arms relax. Now, tell me if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Ouch! That was… surprising. It didn't hurt bad, but it wasn’t very nice. And it makes my leg jump. What are you looking for? It just… jumps when you hit it. Like a… a little frog. Is that normal? My husband says I’m easily startled too, but that’s just because I’m always busy.
DOCTOR: It’s normal for your leg to kick reflexively. We're checking the strength of your reflexes. Now, I’m going to ask you to close your eyes. Can you tell me which direction I’m moving my finger?
PATIENT: Okay… okay. But I’m not very good at this. I need to see what’s going on. My eyes are closed! How can I tell? And it makes me dizzy when I close my eyes. Stop! It’s not helping. My husband will be mad if I’m not home soon. This is… frustrating. Just tell me what’s wrong, instead of making me do silly things.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s enough for now. Look, Ms. Fontanazza, it’s difficult to get a proper assessment when you're not cooperating. But based on what you've told me—and your husband's concerns—I'm concerned there may be something more going on than just fatigue. The combination of noise exposure, forgetfulness, headaches, and the changes your husband has noticed… it warrants further investigation. I recommend a hearing test, and a more comprehensive neurological evaluation. I’m also going to order a basic blood panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions.
PATIENT: Blood panel? Neurological evaluation? That sounds… expensive. And complicated. I don’t need all that. I just need a vacation. Maybe a quiet place, away from metal. My husband always jumps to conclusions. He worries too much! What about the ringing in my ears? Can't we just get me earplugs? That seems easier. And cheaper. I don’t understand all this… investigation. Just give me something for the ringing, and let me go home. I have dinner to make. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, I understand your concerns about cost, and I can provide you with information about resources that might help. But ignoring these symptoms is not a responsible course of action. You are experiencing a constellation of symptoms that require evaluation. I can provide you with earplugs to help with the ringing, but that is only addressing one small piece of the puzzle. I strongly recommend you allow me to order the hearing test and bloodwork. And frankly, if your husband is concerned enough to schedule this appointment, I suggest you take his concerns seriously. I’m not trying to be difficult, but your health is important. I’m concerned, and I want to rule out anything serious. Do you understand?
