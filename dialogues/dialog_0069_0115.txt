DOCTOR: Good morning, Annelle. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Andraca, was it? Yes… well, it’s about my skin. It’s turned rather… yellow. It’s quite alarming, really. I believe the young man at the front desk said something about… the liver? I don’t recall the specifics, I’m afraid. It's all a bit of a blur these days.
DOCTOR: Yes, Annelle, I see. Yellowing of the skin – that's called jaundice – can be concerning, and it can be related to the liver, but there are other possibilities as well. It's good you noticed it. You’re right to get it checked out. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me when you first noticed the yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh dear. When did I first notice… That’s a difficult question. It feels like… a few weeks, perhaps? Maybe a month? I honestly couldn’t say with any certainty. Everything seems to run together lately. I was looking in the mirror… getting ready, and it just… struck me. A rather unpleasant surprise, I assure you.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Annelle, it's perfectly understandable to have trouble pinpointing the exact timing. A few weeks to a month is helpful. Has the yellowing been getting progressively worse since you first noticed it, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Oh, it has been getting worse, I think. Yes, definitely worse. At first, it was just… a slight tinge, barely noticeable. But now… well, now it’s quite obvious. My daughter, bless her heart, pointed it out. She insisted I come see someone. I don't usually bother with doctors, you know. A waste of time, most of the time. But she was very insistent.
DOCTOR: It’s good your daughter encouraged you to come in. It's always best to have a family member advocate for your health. And you're right, it's better to be safe. Besides the yellowing of your skin, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… let me think. Oh, goodness. I have been feeling rather tired lately. More tired than usual, and I’ve always been a bit of a napper. And my stomach… it hasn’t been quite right. A little… uncomfortable, and I haven’t much of an appetite. I suppose that’s all. Nothing terribly dramatic.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and a decreased appetite, along with the stomach discomfort. That's helpful information. Has the stomach discomfort been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes, Doctor. It’s not a sharp pain, you understand. More of a… dull ache, really. And sometimes there's just a feeling of fullness, even when I haven’t eaten much. It’s… unpleasant, but I’ve had worse. I’ve always had a delicate constitution, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. A dull ache and feeling full easily. Have you noticed any changes in your stool – the color, or consistency?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you're asking about… things one doesn't usually discuss. Well… yes, actually. It’s been… paler than usual. Very pale, almost… clay-colored. It worried me a bit, to be honest. I thought perhaps it was something I ate, but then the yellowing started…
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Annelle. It’s important information. Pale stools, along with the yellowing of your skin and eyes, are definitely things we need to investigate further. Now, I'd like to ask a few more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you had any past medical problems – things like diabetes, heart disease, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had a bad bout of pneumonia when I was quite young, but I recovered fully. And my arthritis, of course. It flares up from time to time, but it’s just… old age. Nothing serious. I don’t recall anything else… I had a rather unpleasant gallbladder issue years ago, but they removed it. That was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, pneumonia in the past, arthritis, and gallbladder removal. Good to know. Do you currently take any medications for your arthritis or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little something for the arthritis. A small white pill. I believe it's called… Ibuprofen? Yes, that’s it. Just when it flares up. I don’t take it every day, only as needed. And a little something for my blood pressure, sometimes. But not regularly, the doctor told me to only take it if it feels high.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ibuprofen as needed and blood pressure medication occasionally. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard. I can eat just about anything. A few aches and pains, of course, but no serious allergies. I've never had any trouble with medications either.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your skin and eyes more closely. It will just take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Go ahead, Doctor. I suppose it’s necessary. Just… be gentle, please. My skin is rather thin, you know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Annelle. I will be very gentle. Alright, let’s start with your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Let me know if anything feels tender. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a little uncomfortable, yes. Not sharp, just… a dull ache. Like a pressure. It's been like that for a while now. And a little higher up, on the right side… that's a bit tender too. It’s not terrible, but I can definitely feel something.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the upper right quadrant and a little higher up. That's consistent with what you've been describing. And here… I'm noting some tenderness and a slight enlargement of your liver. Now I’m going to check your skin and eyes more closely. The jaundice is quite noticeable in your skin and the whites of your eyes are also yellowed. Okay, Annelle. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam findings, there are several possibilities we need to investigate. The jaundice, fatigue, pale stools, abdominal discomfort, and enlarged, tender liver are concerning. It’s possible this could be related to a problem with your liver, gallbladder, or bile ducts.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound very good, does it? What does that mean? Is it… serious? I don't understand all those medical terms.
DOCTOR: You're right, those terms can be confusing, Annelle. Let's try to keep it simple. Your liver is an important organ that helps your body process food and remove toxins. When something interferes with its function, it can cause a buildup of a substance called bilirubin, which is what causes the yellowing of your skin and eyes – the jaundice. Several things can cause this. It could be a blockage in the bile ducts – the tubes that carry bile from your liver, or it could be a problem with the liver itself, like inflammation or infection. Right now, I can’t say definitively what’s going on. We need to do some tests to get a clearer picture. I'm going to order some blood work to check your liver function, and I also recommend an abdominal ultrasound to get a better look at your liver, gallbladder, and bile ducts. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, blood work and… an ultrasound. Yes, I suppose so. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on and… what can be done about it. I don’t want to spend my remaining years feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Annelle. That's a very reasonable request, and we'll work towards that together. The blood work will give us information about how well your liver is functioning and if there's any inflammation or infection. The ultrasound is a painless imaging test that will help us visualize the organs in your abdomen and look for any blockages or abnormalities. I'll write up the orders for these tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and the ultrasound can be scheduled at the imaging center across the street. They'll contact you directly to schedule that appointment. Once we have the results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and decide on the best course of action. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. As good as anything, I suppose. Will the results take long? I don’t want to be waiting for weeks on end. And… what if it’s something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Annelle. We'll try to get the results as quickly as possible. Typically, the blood work results come back within a few days, and the ultrasound report should be available within a week. I'll personally follow up with both the lab and the imaging center to expedite the process. As for what if it is something serious… We won't jump to conclusions until we have all the information. If there is a problem, there are often things we can do to manage it, even if it's complex. There are many different treatments available, depending on the cause. We’ll discuss all your options thoroughly and make a plan that's right for you. For now, try not to worry too much. We're taking the right steps to find out what's going on. I'll also provide you with a written summary of today’s visit and the tests I've ordered. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… thank you. I appreciate your kindness. I was very apprehensive about coming here, but you’ve put my mind at ease… somewhat. I suppose I’ll go and get the blood work done then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Annelle. I'm glad I could help ease your mind, even a little. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns at all. The nurses are always happy to assist. Here’s that summary for you. Just take your time getting to the lab. And remember, we’re here to help every step of the way. Have a good day, Annelle, and I’ll see you again soon after the tests are completed.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
