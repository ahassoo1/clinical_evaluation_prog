DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Neeraj Auelua. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me in? Let me think... It's my tummy, I think. It feels... big. And I don’t want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to, anyway. It’s just... not feeling right.
DOCTOR: Okay, your tummy feeling big and not wanting to eat as much. That's good information to start with. When did you first notice your tummy feeling bigger, Soila?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did I notice? That’s a hard one. It feels like… a long time now. Maybe… a few weeks? Or maybe longer? It’s all a bit blurry, you see. I don't keep good track of time these days. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Soila. It’s common to lose track, especially as time goes on. A few weeks or longer is helpful. Has the feeling of being full or your tummy being bigger been getting worse over that time, or has it stayed about the same?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think it’s getting a little bit worse, yes. Not fast, you understand. But… it feels more uncomfortable now. And I find myself… just not wanting to bother with food. Even things I used to really enjoy. Like… borscht. I used to love borscht.
DOCTOR: Okay, getting a little worse, and a loss of appetite, even for foods you used to enjoy like borscht. That’s important. Do you have any other symptoms along with that?
PATIENT: Oh… symptoms? Let me think… Sometimes I feel a little tired, yes. Not all the time, but… more tired than usual, maybe. And… sometimes my legs feel a little swollen, especially at the end of the day. Is that a symptom? I’m not very good at remembering these things, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Swelling in your legs and feeling more tired than usual – those are definitely things we need to look into. When did you start noticing the leg swelling, Soila?
PATIENT: Oh, the legs… that started around the same time as the tummy, I think. Maybe a little bit after. When I take my shoes off in the evening, I notice it more. They feel… puffy, you see? Not terribly bad, but… noticeable. Is that alright? I hope I’m not telling you too much.
DOCTOR: No, you're not telling me too much at all, Soila. It’s good you're sharing all of this. Puffiness in your legs around the same time as the tummy issues and fatigue… okay. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits lately?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Oh dear… what does that mean, exactly? I’m sorry, Doctor. Sometimes I don’t understand the big words. Do you mean… going to the bathroom?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Soila. Yes, I mean going to the bathroom—your stools. Have you noticed any changes in how often you go, or the appearance of your stools—are they different than usual?
PATIENT: Oh! Okay, yes. Well… I haven't been going as often, that's for sure. And… they are harder, you see? Not like they used to be. I used to go every day, like clockwork. Now… not so much. It makes me a little uncomfortable, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, less frequent bowel movements and harder stools. That’s helpful. Now, Soila, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh… weight loss? Hmm. I don’t know, Doctor. I haven't been weighing myself. I used to, when I was younger, but… not anymore. I just haven’t been feeling up to it. It’s possible, I suppose. I just haven’t been eating much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Not weighing yourself, but possible weight loss due to decreased appetite. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment, Soila. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical conditions… That was a long time ago. Let me think… I had something with my heart, I think. A long, long time ago. And… something with my blood pressure, maybe? The doctor gave me some pills for it, but I haven’t been taking them lately. It's all a bit blurry, you see. My memory is just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of a heart condition and high blood pressure. Do you remember what the doctor told you about those conditions, or what medications you were taking?
PATIENT: Oh… the medications… no, I don’t remember the names. Little white pills, I think? And the doctor said… something about keeping my salt intake low. That’s all I really remember, I’m afraid. I used to try, but… sometimes I forget. It’s hard when you get older, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Soila. It's perfectly normal to have trouble remembering details from the past. You mentioned pills for blood pressure and low salt intake. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… surgeries… Let me think… Yes! I had my gallbladder out, a very long time ago. And… I think I had something on my knee, when I was younger. But it was so long ago, I don't remember much about it. Just a lot of pain, I think. And then I woke up, and it was over.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and something on your knee. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. Sometimes I get a little itchy, but that’s just my skin, you see? It’s always been sensitive. No, I don't think I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh… medications… No, not really. I stopped taking the pills for my blood pressure a while ago, like I said. And I don't take any vitamins or anything like that. I used to take a little something for my bones, but I ran out, and I just… didn’t bother to get more.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no current medications. Now, Soila, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh… family history… That was a long time ago. My mother… she had a weak heart, I think. And my father… he had something with his stomach, maybe? But they both lived to be very old, so it wasn’t too bad. I had a brother, but he passed away many years ago. I’m not very good at remembering these things, you see? It’s all a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: I understand, Soila. That’s alright. History of heart problems in your mother and something with the stomach in your father. Let's move on to your social history. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. I live alone. Always have, really. I have some nice neighbors, but… they are busy with their families, you see. I manage alright on my own, though. I used to have a daughter, but she moved away a long, long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, you live alone and your daughter lives far away. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. I never smoked. Never liked it. My mother didn’t smoke either, and it smelled terrible. No, I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh… alcohol? I used to have a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes, many years ago. Just a small one. But I don’t drink anymore. It doesn’t agree with me, you see. And I don't really care for it anymore, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. No smoking, very limited alcohol use in the past. Now, Soila, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just be gentle, alright? My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Soila. I will be very gentle. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, alright. Deep breath… like this? It’s a little hard, you see? My chest feels… tight sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear a little bit of congestion in your lungs, but nothing too concerning at this point. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Could you please lie down for me?
PATIENT: Oh… lie down? Alright. Oh… that’s a little uncomfortable. My tummy… it hurts when I lie down, you see?
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just feeling your abdomen now. It is a bit tender in the lower part of your tummy, and I can feel a slight fullness. I’m going to check your legs now for swelling, as you mentioned. Could you please roll over onto your back?
PATIENT: Oh… roll over? Alright. Oh… careful, Doctor. My hips… they don’t move so easily anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, Soila, I do notice some swelling in your legs, as you mentioned. It's called edema. And I’ve also measured your blood pressure and it is a bit elevated. Everything else seems okay on the basic exam. We should probably do some blood work and possibly an imaging scan, just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… blood work and scans? That sounds… complicated. I don’t like needles, you see. And I don’t understand all the big words. What are you looking for, Doctor? Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Soila. It does sound complicated, and I'll explain everything as clearly as I can. The blood work will help us check how well your kidneys and liver are working, and rule out any infections. The scan – it's like a picture of the inside of your tummy - will help us see what's causing the fullness and any possible changes in your organs. The needle prick for the blood work is quick, and we can make it as painless as possible. As for the scan, it doesn't hurt at all, you just lie very still. Would you be willing to let me order these tests?
PATIENT: Oh… tests… Well… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor. But promise me you’ll explain everything, alright? I don’t want any surprises. And… will it cost a lot of money? I don’t have much, you see. I’m not insured.
DOCTOR: I absolutely promise to explain everything thoroughly, Soila, and I understand your concerns about the cost. We'll do our best to keep things as affordable as possible. I'll also see if we can connect you with resources in the area that might help with the costs, given your lack of insurance. We'll also see if we can order the most essential tests first to give us a clear picture without incurring too much expense. Would you like me to start with a blood test and an abdominal ultrasound?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Blood test and… what did you call it? An ultra-sound? If you promise to explain everything, and try to keep it affordable, then yes. But… will I have to go somewhere else? I don't like going places on my own. It's hard, you see?
DOCTOR: You won't have to go anywhere else, Soila. We can do the blood test right here in the clinic, and the ultrasound technician will come to us. You won’t have to leave the building at all. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood. Once the results are back, I’ll review them with you and we’ll discuss the next steps. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s good. Here in the clinic… that’s much better. No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I worry a lot, you see.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Soila. I understand your worries, and I’ll do my best to make sure you feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. The nurse will be in shortly. Just relax, and we'll take things one step at a time. If you need anything at all, please don’t hesitate to ask.
