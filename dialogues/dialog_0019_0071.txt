DOCTOR: Well, hello Karry. Good to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Karry Skarbek. I received a letter… about needing certain… shots, I believe, for some paperwork I’m completing. It has to do with a relative coming to live with me from overseas. I need to know what's required, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Right, yes, I remember seeing something about that in your file. Immigration paperwork can be…particular. So, it's for your relative immigrating, and the paperwork requires proof of vaccinations, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s correct, Doctor. My niece… she’s never been to this country before. And the letter I got said I needed to come speak with a doctor about what vaccinations she will need before she can finalize everything. I just want to be certain we’re doing it all correctly, and…well, to be honest, I’m a bit confused by all the information.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It is a bit complicated, and it’s good you came in. We want to make sure she’s protected and that you fulfill all the requirements. Let's start with her age, if you don’t mind me asking?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. She is… twenty-three years old. Just turned twenty-three in May, as a matter of fact. She’s a healthy young woman, as far as I know, but she grew up in a very rural area and… I’m not certain what shots she might have received when she was younger.
DOCTOR: Okay, twenty-three. That's helpful. And you’re right to be cautious about what she's had previously, especially growing up in a rural area. It’s not always well documented. Do you happen to know anything about her vaccination history?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I truly don’t. Her mother… well, we haven't spoken in quite some time. And she handled all of that when my niece was a child. I’m afraid I have no records or knowledge of what she’s been given. We'll have to start fresh, won’t we? I suppose that's alright, if that’s what needs to be done.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, that happens frequently. We’ll treat it as starting fresh. It’s the safest approach. Now, to be sure, and just to cover all bases, has she ever had a measles vaccination, or even had measles itself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question, Doctor. I… I honestly don't know. I’ve never asked. She’s never been ill with measles that I’m aware of, but… like I said, I haven’t been around her for a very long time. Would a blood test be able to tell us if she’s had it?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can do a blood test to check for measles antibodies. That'll tell us if she's developed immunity, either through vaccination or previous infection. It’s a good starting point. Let’s also go through a quick list of other common vaccinations. Have you or does she have any idea if she's had a tetanus shot within the last ten years?
PATIENT: Tetanus… let me think. No, I don’t believe she has. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I’ve never heard her mention anything about a tetanus shot, and I’ve certainly never taken her to get one. Is that the one you get if you step on something sharp? For lockjaw?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's the one! Tetanus, often called lockjaw, is very important, and it's usually given with diphtheria and pertussis – often called a Tdap booster. Okay. Now, just to be thorough…has she ever had the chickenpox vaccine, or had chickenpox as a child?
PATIENT: Chickenpox… Oh, yes! She did have chickenpox when she was very little, maybe… seven or eight years old? It was a bad case, I remember her mother saying. She was quite sick for a week or so. She had spots everywhere, poor thing. She hasn't had it since, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Having had chickenpox does provide immunity. Alright. And what about influenza, the flu vaccine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, I don’t think she’s ever had a flu shot, Doctor. We don’t have much of a flu season where I am, and…well, honestly, it wasn’t something we thought much about. It's usually just a little sniffle, if anything. Would she need to have one before she comes, even if she’s never had it before?
DOCTOR: It’s a good question. We typically recommend an annual flu vaccine, and since she’s never had one, it’s definitely something we should consider, especially with travel involved. It's not necessarily required for the immigration paperwork, but it's certainly beneficial for her health. Okay, let’s move on. Have you or she ever had any vaccinations for Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B?
PATIENT: Hepatitis… oh dear. No, I don’t believe so. Those aren't names that come up much in conversation. Are those the ones you get if you… well, if you’re not careful? I’m afraid my medical knowledge isn’t the best. I always leave things like that to the professionals.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. And that's exactly why you’re here. Hepatitis A and B are both liver infections, and vaccinations are available to protect against them. Hepatitis B is often given to newborns, and Hepatitis A is recommended for travelers. Since she's traveling here, we should definitely consider it. One last thing, just to be sure: has she ever had a polio vaccine?
PATIENT: Polio… Oh, my. That rings a bell. I remember… yes! I believe she did get the polio vaccine when she was a little girl. I seem to recall a little needle and… a sticker, maybe? It was a long time ago, of course. Would we need to check if it was the live oral version or the shot? Does it matter?
DOCTOR: Yes, it does matter a little bit, though it’s not usually a huge concern. The oral polio vaccine, which isn't used in the US anymore, can, in very rare cases, cause vaccine-derived polio, so there are some specific protocols. We'll make a note to check her records if we can obtain them. Alright. To summarize, she's had chickenpox, polio , and has never had measles, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, influenza, or Hepatitis A/B vaccines. Is that a fair assessment?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds about right. You've got a good memory! That covers just about everything, as far as I know. So, what happens now? Do we need to get all of these shots before she arrives, or can we do some of them when she gets here? And… is there a cost associated with all of this? My retirement income isn’t terribly large, and I want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's a very good question. We can certainly start some of the vaccinations now, and others can be given when she arrives. It's often best to space them out for optimal immune response. Given her age, she'll likely need a Tdap booster, the flu vaccine, and the Hepatitis A vaccine series. We'll need to do a blood test to check for measles immunity first. As for the cost…that depends on your insurance coverage. Do you have a card with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do. It’s a private plan, through Blue Cross Blue Shield. I’ve had it for many years. I'm not certain what's covered and what isn’t, to be honest. I mostly just use it for routine check-ups. I haven't had a lot of medical expenses in recent years, thankfully. Will your office be able to bill the insurance directly?
DOCTOR: Yes, we can definitely bill Blue Cross Blue Shield directly. Let me see… Okay, it looks like your plan does cover most vaccinations with a copay, and the blood test should also be covered with a copay. There may be some additional costs depending on the specific vaccines used, but we’ll confirm everything with the lab and pharmacy before administering anything. It looks like your copay for vaccinations is $30 per dose, and $25 for the blood test. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly manageable. Thirty dollars a dose and twenty-five for the test… that’s very reasonable. So, what’s the first step? Do we need to schedule an appointment for the blood test, and then one for the shots? And about how long will it take for everything to be completed? I’m hoping to have my niece here by November, if possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, let’s schedule the blood test first, to check for measles immunity. We can do that here in the office, it’ll take about 30 minutes. We’ll need to draw a small sample. Then, once we have those results back, which usually takes about 3-5 business days, we can schedule the vaccinations. Given the need for a series of shots, and to allow for the best immune response, we're looking at needing at least 4-6 weeks to complete everything. That would likely get everything done in time for your November timeline, yes. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfect, Doctor. Four to six weeks… that gives us plenty of time. Let’s go ahead and schedule the blood test, then. Whenever is convenient for you. I’m fairly flexible. And thank you, Doctor. You’ve really put my mind at ease. I was very worried about all of this paperwork and what was needed, but you’ve explained everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Karry. That's what I'm here for. Let me just pull up the schedule… How about next Tuesday at 2:00 PM?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2:00 PM… yes, that works perfectly. I’ll make a note of it. Is there anything I need to do before the appointment? Fasting or anything like that?
DOCTOR: No, no fasting required for the blood test. Just make sure she’s well-hydrated. And perhaps avoid any strenuous activity right before, just to make things a little easier. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and patient with me. I truly appreciate it. I’ll see you next Tuesday, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Karry. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. We’ll see you next Tuesday. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions before then.
