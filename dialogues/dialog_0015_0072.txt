DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I've been… forgetting things. Little things, mostly, but it's starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Forgetting things, you say. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It's hard to say exactly. Maybe six months, give or take? It started slowly, like misplacing my keys more often. Now it feels like… words sometimes just don’t come to me. Or I walk into a room and forget why I went in there. It's not all the time, but it's enough to make me nervous.
DOCTOR: Six months. And these instances… are they interfering with your daily routine at all?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. I work as a dentist, so I have to remember things, obviously. I haven't messed anything up at work yet, thankfully, but I’m definitely having to double-check things more. And at home… I used to be really good at keeping track of appointments, but now I rely on my sister to remind me constantly. It's frustrating.
DOCTOR: A dentist, you say. That does require a good memory. And your sister is helping with appointments. Alright. Before we proceed, let's get a thorough history. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, but that was ages ago. I'm generally pretty healthy, actually. I try to eat well, and I walk most days. No high blood pressure or diabetes, nothing like that. I have Medicare, if that’s helpful.
DOCTOR: Appendix removed in adolescence, Medicare coverage… good to know. Any family history of memory problems, dementia, or neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That’s a tricky one. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she… well, she got very confused towards the end of her life. The family just said she was “getting old,” but looking back, it seemed like more than that. My mother always said she worried it might be something hereditary, but we never really got it checked out. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Grandmother with possible dementia… Noted. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, honestly. I really try to avoid taking pills if I don’t need to. No blood thinners, nothing for sleep, nothing at all beyond the vitamin. I don’t even take anything for headaches, usually. I just try to rest when I need to.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, none that I know of. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. I can eat anything, thankfully. I'm not allergic to bee stings or anything like that either. I think my sister might be allergic to penicillin, but that’s her problem, not mine.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, Ms. Heidenthal, I’d like to do a brief physical and neurological exam. This will just help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, we'll do some simple tests to assess your memory, coordination, and reflexes. Please follow my instructions as closely as possible. If you could sit up there for me, please.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just let me know if I need to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. Pulse is 72, regular. Temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Good reflexes bilaterally. Now, let’s test your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your index finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: Like this? Is that alright? It feels a little… strange being tested like this.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good. A little hesitant, but acceptable. Now, can you repeat that, but close your eyes?
PATIENT: Okay… is that right? I’m trying to concentrate. It’s harder with my eyes closed.
DOCTOR: Accuracy slightly diminished with eyes closed. Now, I'm going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory. What is today's date?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Um… let me think. It's… August… the 2nd? I think. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I hope I'm right.
DOCTOR: Correct. Now, can you tell me the names of three objects I’m going to name?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Go ahead. I'll try my best. I hope I don't forget them right away!
DOCTOR: Pen, chair, and picture. Now, I'm going to ask you to recall those same three objects in five minutes. I'll ask you some other questions in the meantime. Can you tell me your date of birth?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. My birthday is… March 15th, 1987. I always remember that one, it's a good day. Now, can I ask what kind of questions you’re going to ask? It’s just… I’m a dentist, and I ask a lot of questions, so being on this side of things feels a little odd.
DOCTOR: Standard questions to assess cognitive function, Ms. Heidenthal. Nothing to be concerned about. Now, can you spell the word “world” backwards?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um… backwards? That’s tricky. Let me think… d-l-r-o-w? Is that right? I’m usually better at things like this. It's just… all the tests together are making me a little flustered.
DOCTOR: Close. It's d-l-r-o-w. Now, let’s see if you can recall those three objects I asked you to remember earlier: pen, chair, and picture.
PATIENT: Pen… chair… um… Oh dear. I… I think I remember the pen and the chair, but the third one… is it… a lamp? No, a picture? I’m so sorry, Doctor. I just can’t seem to grasp it. This is really worrying me now.
DOCTOR: It appears there is some difficulty with immediate recall, Ms. Heidenthal. Based on the physical exam and your responses, it's too early to make a definitive diagnosis. However, your symptoms and the findings warrant further investigation. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin B12 level to rule out any underlying medical causes. We also need to consider a neuroimaging study – an MRI of the brain – to assess for any structural abnormalities. I’m referring you to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation. They will be able to conduct more advanced cognitive testing and determine the best course of action.
PATIENT: Oh. That sounds… serious. MRI and a neurologist? Is it… is it something bad, Doctor? I mean, you said "rule out," but… I’m just a little scared now. I just wanted to find out why I keep forgetting things, not… not all of this.
DOCTOR: Ms. Heidenthal, it is important to remain calm. These tests are precautionary. Many things can cause memory issues, and it's crucial to identify the root cause. While your symptoms are concerning enough to warrant further investigation, it does not automatically mean something serious is going on. We are simply ruling out all possibilities. The neurologist will provide a more detailed explanation of your cognitive function and discuss potential treatment options if needed. I will send the referral to Dr. Albright – she is an excellent neurologist in the area. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding stressful situations and ensuring you get adequate sleep and nutrition. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay. Dr. Albright… I'll write that down. Avoiding stress… that’s easier said than done, but I’ll try. And sleep… yes, I suppose I could try to get more sleep. Um… will these tests tell me if it’s… hereditary? Like, if my grandmother… if this is something I’m going to pass on to my children? I don’t have any yet, but I hope to… eventually. And… what if it is something serious? What are the… options? I know you said the neurologist will explain, but… I just want a little bit of information, if you don’t mind. Even just a little.
DOCTOR: Ms. Heidenthal, I understand your anxiety. Regarding heredity, the neurologist will assess your family history and may recommend genetic testing if appropriate. It is possible that some cognitive decline has a genetic component, but many factors contribute, including lifestyle and environmental influences. As for “options” if it is something serious, the course of action depends entirely on the diagnosis. Mild cognitive impairment can sometimes be managed with lifestyle changes and cognitive therapies. More severe conditions, such as Alzheimer’s disease, have medications that can temporarily alleviate symptoms, and support services are available to assist both the patient and their family. However, I must reiterate that it is far too early to discuss specific treatment options without a definitive diagnosis. The neurologist is best equipped to provide that information after a thorough evaluation. I will ensure Dr. Albright receives all of my findings, including the results of your blood tests and neuroimaging. She will contact you directly to schedule your appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your cognitive function or physical abilities, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything, for now. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you being so… thorough, and for answering all my questions, even the difficult ones. It’s still scary, but I feel a little bit better knowing what’s going to happen next. I’ll wait for Dr. Albright’s call. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I trust Dr. Albright will provide excellent care. I will be in touch if any concerning results are reported. Take care of yourself. Stop.
