DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi Doctor. Just need a check-up for… a sports team. Tryouts, you know? Gotta make sure I’m good to go. Don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good planning. A pre-participation physical, then. To get started, can you tell me a little more about the sports team?
PATIENT: It’s… a Mongolian wrestling team. A bit of a long story how I ended up trying out at my age, honestly. It's mostly younger guys, but they needed someone with… experience. Mostly just local stuff, though. Not like, Olympic level or anything.
DOCTOR: Mongolian wrestling – that sounds interesting! And it’s wonderful you’re staying active. Local competition is great. To get a good picture of your overall health, let's go through some questions. First, have you had any significant illnesses or medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I mean, I had the flu a couple times, like everyone else. Broke my wrist when I was a kid, but that healed up fine. Nothing major, nothing I’ve needed a doctor for in… a long time. Honestly, I can’t even remember the last time.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any surgeries. Still got all my original parts, so to speak. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. Can we… get this over with? I got a bit of a schedule today.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We can move efficiently through this. Let’s talk about your family history, then. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: My… uh… my dad had some problems with his heart when he got older. Real older. Like, late eighties. And my mom… she had high blood pressure, I think. But that’s about it, honestly. My family wasn't really big on going to doctors, so nobody really knew much about anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Nope. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Always thought it was a silly habit. My lungs are good, I promise you. Wrestlers need good lungs.
DOCTOR: Good to hear. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a drink now and then. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, or a little glass of wine. Nothing… serious. I don't drink every day, or even every week. I'm not a big drinker.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing at all. I try to stay away from those things if I can. Prefer natural remedies, you know? And honestly, haven't needed anything. Is this almost done?
DOCTOR: Alright, almost finished with the questions. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. My mom always said I had an iron stomach. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, ever. So, I think I'm good on that front. Can we… get to the physical part now? I’m starting to get a little impatient.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. No known allergies. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, yeah, that’s fine. Just… try to be quick, okay? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kingan, take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Now, breathe deeply again… and out… Lungs are clear bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/90. That's a little elevated. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Okay, everything seems generally okay, but your blood pressure is slightly high. Do you regularly monitor your blood pressure at home?
PATIENT: No, I don't. Like I said, I don't really go to the doctor much. Never thought I needed to. Is that… bad? Should I be worried? Is this gonna stop me from trying out?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, but it's good to be aware of your numbers, especially as you get older. A single elevated reading isn't cause for immediate alarm, but consistently high blood pressure can lead to health problems down the road. It might not stop you from trying out, but we need to investigate it a little further. Before we get into that, are you experiencing any symptoms like headaches, dizziness, or blurred vision?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I feel fine. Perfectly fine. Maybe a little tired, but that’s just… life, you know? I just want to wrestle. Is there anything I can do to get this blood pressure down quickly? Like, right now?
DOCTOR: Okay, no current symptoms. It's good that you're not experiencing anything. To quickly lower your blood pressure, you can try taking a few deep breaths, and focusing on relaxing. However, that's a temporary fix. We need to understand why your blood pressure is elevated. I recommend we do some blood work to check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar. It’s a standard panel. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Ugh… blood work? Seriously? Look, is this necessary? Can’t I just… try out? I'm a pretty healthy guy. I’ve been wrestling my whole life! I don't want to spend a bunch of time and money on tests if it’s not gonna change anything. Can’t we just wave it through?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kingan, and I appreciate you being upfront. However, I have a professional and ethical responsibility to ensure your safety. We can’t just “wave it through” without knowing what’s going on. Elevated blood pressure can sometimes indicate underlying conditions that need to be addressed. Since you are uninsured, I can see if there are any local resources available to help reduce the cost of the blood work. Alternatively, we can discuss a basic diet and lifestyle plan and monitor your blood pressure over a few weeks. But I strongly recommend the blood work for a comprehensive assessment. Would you like me to check for resources, or would you prefer to discuss a monitoring plan first?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Look, checking for resources sounds… good. Please. Just… I don’t want a huge bill. And I really need to know if this is gonna keep me from wrestling. Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Like, a specific food to avoid or something?
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s focus on resources first. There's a local community clinic that offers discounted blood work for uninsured patients. Let me get you the contact information. Here you go. They have a sliding scale fee based on income. In the meantime, reducing your sodium intake can help lower your blood pressure. Avoid processed foods, salty snacks, and fast food. Regular exercise, like walking for 30 minutes most days of the week, can also be beneficial. It would also be good to limit alcohol consumption. I recommend you schedule an appointment with them as soon as possible and bring the results back to me. If you get any headaches, dizziness, or chest pain in the meantime, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that… sounds okay. I can try that. Sodium, no processed foods… Got it. Walking… I can walk. Okay, look, thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you trying to help. I’ll call them tomorrow. Is there anything else I need to do, or can I go now? I really need to get going.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kingan. I'm glad I could help. For now, focus on those lifestyle changes and scheduling that blood work. No, you don't need to do anything else right now. You can go. I’ll be here if you have any questions or concerns after you get the results. Here’s a quick summary of what we discussed that I can put in your chart. Good luck with the tryouts, and please take care of yourself. Feel free to call the office to schedule a follow-up appointment once you have the lab results.
