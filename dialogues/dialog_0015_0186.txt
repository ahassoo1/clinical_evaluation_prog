DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kingan. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, good morning Doctor. I'm here for a tryout physical. For the…uh…the wrestling team. Gotta get cleared, you know? Don't want any surprises when I start practicing again.
DOCTOR: Wrestling, you say?
PATIENT: Yep. Been doing it on and off for…well, a long time. Mostly local stuff. But this is a bigger team, a little more serious. So they want a check-up first. Makes sense, I guess.
DOCTOR: Right. And how long has it been since your last physical, Mr. Kingan?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. A few years, maybe? Honestly, I don't really keep track. Probably before I moved back here. Why do you ask? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Well, just trying to get a complete picture of your health history. A few years is quite a while. And I do see your current weight listed as 129 pounds. Are you feeling well otherwise?
PATIENT: Yeah, mostly. I feel pretty good, actually. Strong, for my age. I stay active, you know? That weight…well, I'm naturally thin. Always have been. I eat okay, I think. Not a huge eater, never have been. Is that a problem? Should I be heavier for wrestling?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily a problem, Mr. Kingan, but it's…unusual for someone participating in a sport like wrestling to be at that weight. We need to rule out any underlying causes for unintentional weight loss. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Not really. Like I said, never been one to eat a lot. Maybe a little less when I'm training hard, but that's just 'cause I'm burning more energy, right? I don't feel sick or anything. Just…thin. Look, is this going to keep me from trying out? That's what I'm worried about.
DOCTOR: Let's not jump to conclusions. We need to gather some more information. I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history, then I'd like to do a physical exam. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing serious, anyway. Had the usual childhood stuff, you know, chickenpox, measles…but nothing a doctor ever wrote down. I’ve broken a few bones wrestling over the years, but they healed. No long-term problems. Honestly, I'm pretty healthy.
DOCTOR: And your family?
PATIENT: My family…well, my dad was…pretty strong, lived a long life. Worked hard all his life. Mom…she wasn’t as strong, had some heart trouble when she was older. But that was later in life, you know? No one else…really had any major health issues that I know of. I don’t really keep in touch with a lot of them.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you currently take any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it. Always figured my body does okay on its own. Just eat regular food, get some rest. That’s always worked for me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'm going to ask you some questions about your daily habits. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. Never touched any of that stuff. Bad for you, you know? Gotta keep my body in shape. Wrestling requires a clear head and good lungs.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s move on to the physical exam. We'll start with your vitals, then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please step onto the scale for me. And then we'll proceed with the rest of the examination.
PATIENT: Fine by me. Just get it over with. Hopefully everything checks out okay. I really want to do this.
DOCTOR: Okay, your weight is confirmed at 129 pounds. Your height is 183 centimeters. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Respiration is 16. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Your neurological exam is normal, and I do not note any obvious physical abnormalities. However, your low weight is concerning. It is significantly below what is typical for someone your height and age, particularly given your activity level.
PATIENT: See? I told you I'm naturally thin! What does that mean though? Am I…sick? Should I be worried? What's going to happen now? I just want to wrestle, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I'm not saying you are sick, but we need to investigate why you're so thin. It could be something simple, or it could indicate an underlying medical condition. We need to rule out possibilities such as malnutrition, thyroid issues, or even something more serious. I'm going to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, electrolytes, and complete blood count. I also recommend a stool sample to check for any signs of malabsorption. I also would like to order a chest X-ray. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Whoa, hold on a second. Blood work, stool sample, chest X-ray? That sounds…serious. Is this really necessary just to wrestle? Can't I just…eat more? I’m a bit overwhelmed, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, with all due respect, "eating more" is not a sufficient response when your weight is significantly below a healthy range. It’s my professional responsibility to investigate potential underlying causes. The tests I've ordered are standard procedures for evaluating unexplained weight loss. The X-ray is to rule out anything affecting your lungs or chest cavity. I understand your concern, but these are necessary steps to ensure your safety. Wrestling is a physically demanding sport, and we need to make sure you're healthy enough to participate. I can refer you to a specialist in internal medicine if you’d like a second opinion. But, the tests will have to be done regardless to ensure your well-being. Do you have any allergies that I should note before ordering the blood work?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. I get it. You’re the doctor. No allergies, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. But…how long is this going to take? And can I still practice while I’m waiting for the results? I’ve got tryouts next week.
DOCTOR: The blood work and stool sample can be completed at the lab across the street. The X-ray can be scheduled at the imaging center down the hall. It should take approximately 2-3 business days to get the results back. Mr. Kingan, until we have the results, I strongly advise against participating in any strenuous activity, including wrestling practice. It would be irresponsible of me to clear you without knowing the underlying cause of your weight loss. I will provide you with a note excusing you from physical activity. I understand this is frustrating, but your health is my priority. Do you have any questions about these orders?
PATIENT: No…I guess not. Just…a note. Okay. So, no wrestling until I get this note, and then these tests…and then maybe I can wrestle? That sounds…like a long time. Where do I go for the tests exactly? And do I need to schedule anything?
DOCTOR: Here are the requisitions for the blood work and the chest X-ray. The lab is located at 123 Main Street, right across the street. You can walk in anytime during their business hours. The imaging center is at 456 Oak Avenue. You will need to call them to schedule an appointment; the number is on the requisition. I’ve also included a note for your coach excusing you from physical activity until we have the results. Please follow up with me as soon as you have the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Lab, imaging center, results, follow up. Got it. Alright, Doctor. Thank you. I guess I'll go do these tests. Hopefully, it’s just something simple. .
