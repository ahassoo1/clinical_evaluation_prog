DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Annelle. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good afternoon to you as well, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s about my coloring, you see. A bit yellow, and it’s… concerning. My niece noticed it first, and she insisted I come see someone. I… honestly don't remember much about why exactly, only that it has something to do with my liver. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Right, yes, I see a note here about some concerns raised by family… and a potential history of… liver issues, perhaps?
PATIENT: Potential is… a good word. Everything feels rather distant, you see. It was some time ago. I believe it was diagnosed… a long while back. Hepatitis, maybe? Or something similar. I don’t recall the specifics. It’s just… this yellowing is new. And a bit frightening, to be honest. I do apologize for being so vague. It’s… it’s just how my memory is these days.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Annelle. Memory can be… unreliable, especially as we get older. It's perfectly alright. Hepatitis is a possibility, yes. And yellowing of the skin – what we call jaundice – can be a sign of liver problems. Let's try to piece things together. Could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed this yellowing?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did I first notice? It… it was after a visit from my niece, Elara. She came to help with the garden, about… two weeks ago, perhaps? She pointed it out then, said I looked… unwell. Before that, I honestly hadn’t paid much attention. I suppose I don’t look at myself closely very often these days. Is two weeks… a long time for something like this to develop? I’m truly sorry for not being more helpful.
DOCTOR: Two weeks… alright. That gives us a starting point. It’s not necessarily a long time, but it’s good you noticed it relatively quickly. Now, besides the yellowing, have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… let me see. I've been… rather tired, I suppose. More so than usual. And a bit… achy. But I’m an old woman, Doctor, aches and tiredness come with the territory! It's difficult to say what’s new and what’s just… me. My appetite hasn't been very good, either. But again… I rarely have a big appetite these days. Oh, and perhaps a little… discomfort in my stomach. But nothing severe, truly. I hope that helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, some aches, decreased appetite, and mild stomach discomfort. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’d like to check your abdomen, and just generally get a feel for things. Then we can talk about some possible tests. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam… yes, alright. Though I must warn you, Doctor, I bruise easily. And… I’m not very flexible anymore. Please be gentle. And… do let me know if anything is… uncomfortable. I don’t want to cause any fuss.
DOCTOR: Of course, Annelle. We’ll take it very slowly and gently. I'll be mindful of that. Alright, if you could just lie back for me… I'm just going to press here, and here. Does that cause any pain?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a little tender, yes. Just there, on the right side. Not sharp pain, but… discomfort. It feels… swollen, perhaps? Though I couldn't say for certain. Everything feels a bit… mushy these days. Please, do be careful. It’s… sensitive. And… are you sure this is necessary? I don’t mean to be difficult, Doctor, but I simply don’t like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Of course, Annelle. We can stop at any time. My apologies. It sounds like there may be some tenderness in your right upper quadrant, which is where the liver is located. That's why I was checking. And no, it’s never necessary to continue if you’re uncomfortable. Considering your history, and what you’ve told me about the jaundice, fatigue and discomfort, I'd like to order some blood tests. They’ll help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on with your liver function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… yes, that sounds… much more reasonable. Anything that doesn't involve being prodded is a welcome change, frankly. Yes, please. Blood tests are perfectly alright. When… when would I need to go for these? And… are they painful? I apologize for all the questions, Doctor. It’s just… I get anxious about these things. And I don’t have anyone to… accompany me.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Annelle. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious. And it’s alright that you don’t have anyone to accompany you. The tests are quite simple, just a small sample of blood. There will be a small pinch, of course, but it’s usually over very quickly. We can get you scheduled at the lab across the street. They're open until 5 PM today. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Today? Oh dear. I hadn’t expected… today. I suppose I could… manage. But I'm rather tired, as I mentioned. And the walk… it's a bit long for me. Is there… absolutely no other time available? I’m truly sorry for being difficult, Doctor. I’m just… not feeling very strong at the moment. It would be lovely to have a bit more time to… prepare. .
DOCTOR: You’re not being difficult at all, Annelle. And yes, let me see what else is available… Hmm… how about tomorrow morning at 9 AM?
