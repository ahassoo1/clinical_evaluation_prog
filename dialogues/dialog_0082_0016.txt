DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about my bruising. I’ve been on that blood thinner for… oh, it must be five years now, since my wife passed. And lately, I’ve been bumping into things, you know, just normal stuff, and I bruise like a peach. It’s getting ridiculous, frankly. I don’t recall this happening this badly before.
DOCTOR: Five years on a blood thinner… yes, that's good to know. And you're noticing increased bruising with even minor bumps?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Minor bumps! I barely feel them sometimes, and then… a lovely purple bloom appears. It's not painful, mind you, but it looks awful. And my daughter keeps fussing over me, telling me I need to be more careful. As if I’m a child. Honestly, I just want to know why it’s happening now, after all this time. Is the medicine… wearing off, maybe? Or is it something else? I’m not a fan of unnecessary tests, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Farson. It's good you're noticing a change, and it's perfectly reasonable to want to understand what's going on without jumping to tests right away. It could be related to the medication, as you said, perhaps a slight change in how your body is processing it. But there are other possibilities too. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me what kind of blood thinner you are taking?
PATIENT: Warfarin, Doctor. That’s what they prescribed after… well, after everything. And I get my levels checked regularly, like they tell me to. Though frankly, I can never quite understand what the nurse is saying about the numbers. Something about an INR? It all just goes in one ear and out the other. I just nod and smile, and hope for the best. They always say it's "in range," though. Usually.
DOCTOR: Warfarin, alright. And you said your INR is usually "in range"?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s what they tell me. I go to the lab every month, same routine. Stick, poke, wait, numbers, leave. I wouldn't know a good INR from a bad one if it hit me in the face. Honestly, Doctor, sometimes I think they just say that to get rid of me. It's probably perfectly fine. I just… this bruising is new, and it’s worrying. I don’t want to end up in the hospital because of a little bump. My wife… well, hospitals weren’t kind to her.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Farson, and your history is important. It’s good you’re bringing this up. Even if the INR has been stable, changes can happen. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I'd like to take a look at the bruising and check for any other signs. Then we can discuss if further investigation is needed, and I’ll happily explain the INR numbers to you in plain language. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. A quick look is fine. I’m not keen on a lot of poking and prodding, but a quick look… that’s reasonable. And please, do explain those numbers to me. I feel like I’m being kept in the dark. It’s just… frustrating. My wife always handled all the medical things. I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. We'll take it slow, and I'll explain everything as we go. Let's start by just taking a look at your arms and legs. Alright, I see some bruising here, as you mentioned. The coloration suggests they are in different stages – some are newer, some are older. There's no significant swelling or tenderness to palpation. Now, let's take a look at your legs. Similar findings on your legs. No significant swelling or pain. Do you notice any easy bleeding elsewhere – nosebleeds, bleeding gums when you brush your teeth, blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothing like that. No nosebleeds, gums are fine, and… well, I try not to look too closely at things when I go to the bathroom, if you understand. But no, nothing obvious. It’s just the bruises. And they seem to pop up so easily now. I barely graze myself shaving, and boom, a new purple masterpiece. It’s ridiculous. I used to be able to knock my shins against everything and barely get a mark. Now, it's like my skin is made of paper.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, no other signs of bleeding, and the bruising seems to be occurring with minimal trauma. That’s helpful to know. Now, just to get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about your other medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I take… a statin for cholesterol, Doctor. And something for my blood pressure, an “ACE inhibitor,” I think they called it. And… that’s it, I think. Just those two, plus a multivitamin every day. I try to keep things simple. My daughter keeps telling me I should see a specialist about my arthritis, but I refuse. I’ve lived with it for years, and I’m not about to start taking a whole bunch of new pills now.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a statin, an ACE inhibitor, and a multivitamin. That’s good to know. And you're understandably hesitant about adding more medications for the arthritis. Just one more question for now: have you noticed any recent changes in your diet, or any new supplements you've started taking?
PATIENT: No, no changes to my diet. I eat the same things I always have. Steak, potatoes, vegetables… a little too much sugar, probably. And no new supplements. I tried that glucosamine stuff a few years ago, but it didn’t do anything, so I stopped. I’m not one for fads, Doctor. I like my routine, and I stick to it. I just want to know why I’m bruising like an old peach. Is it the warfarin? Is there something seriously wrong? Honestly, I don’t want to die of internal bleeding from bumping into a coffee table.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Farson. It’s perfectly reasonable to be worried about internal bleeding, and we'll definitely investigate this thoroughly. It could be related to the warfarin, as you suspect, even if your INR has been stable. There are other potential causes as well, including interactions with other medications, underlying medical conditions, or even just age-related changes in your blood vessels. Given your history and the recent increase in bruising, I think it would be prudent to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel . These tests will give us a more detailed look at your blood cells and organ function. We'll also repeat your INR, just to be sure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Tests are tests, I suppose. As long as they don’t take too much blood. And if they find something… what then? More pills? I really don’t want more pills. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to go back to how things were. Bumping into things without turning into a human bruise. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all, Mr. Farson. And we'll take things one step at a time. The tests will help us understand what's going on, and then we can discuss the best course of action. It may not necessarily involve more pills. It could be something as simple as adjusting your warfarin dosage or identifying a potential interaction with another medication. I'm ordering the CBC and CMP now. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once the results are back, we'll review them together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, try to avoid any activities that could cause trauma, and let me know if you notice any new symptoms, such as unexplained bleeding or fatigue. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Just… try not to keep me waiting too long for the results. I don’t like being left in the dark. And thank you. For listening, at least. My wife… she always knew what to do. I’m just trying to figure things out on my own now. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Farson. I understand, and I'll do my best to get the results back to you as quickly as possible. The lab usually takes a few days, but I'll follow up with them to expedite the process. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care of yourself, Mr. Farson. And remember, we'll figure this out together.
