DOCTOR: Good morning, Odell. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning. Doctor Lahn, right? Yes. I… need to go somewhere. For work. It’s… far. And I need… shots? My wife… she always took care of this. Before. So… I just need what she used to get, I guess. For traveling.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you need some travel vaccinations. It’s perfectly alright if you’re unsure of the specifics – that’s what I'm here for. Before we figure out what "shots" you might need, can you tell me a little more about where you’re traveling to?
PATIENT: Somewhere… hot. Very hot. Lots of sand. My company, they send me. It’s a job. Building… things. On airplanes. I don’t… I don't remember the name of the place. It was… a long flight. Lots of bumpy parts. It’s… not America. That's all I know. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, “somewhere hot with lots of sand, not America” gives us a starting point. And you’re traveling for work, building things on airplanes… That's helpful. Do you know roughly how long you’ll be gone for, or if you’ll be traveling back and forth frequently?
PATIENT: A few months, maybe? I think. They said… long term. But things change. My boss… he doesn't tell me everything. Back and forth… no. Just… go there. Do the work. Then come back. One big trip. I hope. I don’t want to go back so often. It’s… hard to leave. Even now.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months in one location, and you'd prefer not to travel back and forth. That's good to know. Now, thinking about your health generally… Have you had any vaccinations before in your life, as far as you recall?
PATIENT: Vaccinations… My wife, she took me to the doctor sometimes. When I was sick. But I… I don't remember what he gave me. Just… a little poke. In the arm. A lot of little pokes, maybe? When I was a kid. Nothing much since then. I was always… healthy. She always said so. But… I don't keep track of these things. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not bad at all, Odell. Many people don't keep track, and that's perfectly alright. We can figure it out. Since you’re unsure of your vaccination history, it's best to be thorough. Before we discuss potential travel vaccines, can you tell me if you have any allergies – to medications, foods, insect stings, anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. No, not really. I eat everything. My wife, she always cooked spicy food, and I never had a problem. I get bitten by mosquitoes, of course. Everyone does. But… I don’t react. Not like… swelling up or anything. I don’t think so. Maybe a little itchy. But that's it. Nothing serious. Never been to the hospital for allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No known allergies. And you haven’t had any serious reactions to insect bites. Now, let's talk about any medications you're currently taking – prescription or over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements, anything at all. Do you take anything regularly?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Not anymore. After… after my wife… I stopped taking everything. She used to remind me. For my… stomach. Something with acid. But I don’t remember the name. And I haven't seen a doctor since… well, you know. I just… try to eat healthy. And sleep. But that’s it. No pills. No anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. No current medications. I understand things have been difficult, and it's understandable that you haven't been to the doctor recently. Just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past… Hmm. I used to get sick sometimes. When I was little. Colds, mostly. My wife always took care of it. She… she made me soup. And… and kept me warm. When I got older, just… stomach problems. A little bit of pain. Nothing serious. The doctor gave me some pills. But… I don’t remember much else. Never been in the hospital. Never had any… big illnesses. That I know of. I'm pretty strong, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy with occasional stomach issues in the past, and no major illnesses or hospitalizations. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No. Never. No surgeries. Not even… when I was a kid. My wife… she always said I was too… tough to need surgery. Just cuts and bruises, sometimes. Working with airplanes, you know. But nothing serious enough for a doctor to cut me open. Never.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. And you mentioned working with airplanes… What exactly do you do?
PATIENT: I… put things together. On the airplanes. The… the outside parts. The skin, and… and the things that make it fly. It’s… complicated. I don’t really understand it. My boss… he tells me what to do. I follow the instructions. I fix things that are broken. And I make sure everything is… tight. That’s all. It’s… a job. I'm good with my hands. That's what he says. Aircraft Structure, Surfaces, Rigging, and Systems Assembler. That's the name they give it. But I just… build things.
DOCTOR: Okay, you're an Aircraft Structure, Surfaces, Rigging, and Systems Assembler. That’s helpful to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family… My parents… they died a long time ago. When I was young. I don’t… I don’t remember much about them. They… they lived in Nepal. I came here a long time ago. I don't know about their… sicknesses. I have a sister, but I haven't seen her in many years. We don’t talk. I don’t know about her health, either. So… no. I don't know. I’m sorry. It's… been a long time. I don't really have a family anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. That’s alright. It's perfectly understandable. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Never. I don’t… I don’t do those things. My wife… she didn't like them. And I… I didn’t want to make her upset. So… no. I just… drink water. And eat healthy. That’s it. Never smoked. Never drank. Never… anything like that. I don't need those things. I just need to… work. And… and remember her.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. That's good to know. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general appearance. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes. That’s… fine. If you need to. Just… be quick, please. I have to… go back to work soon. I don't want to be gone too long. And… and I don't really like doctors. But… if you need to, it's okay. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackles that I can hear. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. That’s slightly elevated, but not overly concerning at this point. We can keep an eye on it. Okay, and I notice you are a bit underweight, Odell. 104 pounds at a height of 155 cm... that's a BMI of 27.3, placing you in the overweight category. And your skin appears generally healthy, although a little dry. Everything seems generally okay, Odell, but we’ll need to discuss your weight. Now, based on what you’ve told me, and knowing you’re traveling to a hot climate, I recommend a few vaccinations. Have you had a tetanus booster in the last 10 years?
PATIENT: Tetanus… booster? What is that? I don’t… I don’t remember. I just remember getting poked. When I was little. My wife… she took care of all of that. I don't keep track of these names. Is it important? I just need… whatever she used to get, before. For the hot place. So I can… work. And come back. That’s all. Is this booster… the same thing?
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. It's alright if you don't remember. A tetanus booster protects you against a serious infection called tetanus, which you can get through cuts or wounds. It's recommended every 10 years. Since you don’t recall when you last had it, and we’re preparing for travel to a potentially less-sanitary environment, I recommend getting one now. Additionally, depending on the specific region you’re traveling to, I’d recommend Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccinations. These protect against infections you can get from contaminated food and water. Do you know anything about the sanitation conditions where you’ll be working?
PATIENT: No. I don’t know. My boss… he doesn’t tell me these things. He just says… build the airplanes. He gives me the instructions. I don't ask questions. I just do the work. I eat what they give me. It’s… okay. I guess. Sometimes it tastes funny. But I don’t want to cause trouble. Is… is the water bad? And… what is Typhoid? Is it… serious? I don't want to get sick. I just want to… finish the job. And come back.
DOCTOR: Okay, Odell. It sounds like you’re not sure about the sanitation conditions, and that's concerning. It's better to be safe than sorry, so I recommend both the Hepatitis A and Typhoid vaccinations. They are very safe vaccines, and they can protect you from potentially serious illnesses. Hepatitis A is a liver infection you can get from contaminated food or water. Typhoid is a bacterial infection that causes fever and abdominal pain, also spread through contaminated food and water. We can give you these vaccinations today. They typically require a booster shot after a certain amount of time, but we can discuss that later, depending on how long you’ll be gone. Would you like me to proceed with these vaccinations, Odell?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes. Just… do them. Whatever she used to get, just give me that. If it helps me… finish the job. And come back. I don’t want to cause trouble. Just… get it over with. Quickly, please. And… and tell me if it hurts a lot. I don't like needles. But… I need to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, Odell. You're doing the right thing. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I'll explain each step before I do it. It will feel like a small pinch, and it will be over before you know it. Okay, that's the first one. And… there's the second. All done. There you go. Just a little pressure to stop any bleeding. You may experience some mild soreness at the injection sites for a day or two. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help. Everything looks good, Odell. I recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment in a few weeks to discuss any potential side effects and to plan for any necessary booster shots, depending on the duration of your trip. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I… I think that’s all. Just… when will I feel better? And… will these things… really protect me? I don’t want to get sick. I just want to… come home. Is there… anything else I need to know? Before I go? Anything I should… avoid eating? Or drinking? Just… anything.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to be concerned, Odell. You should start feeling better within a day or two. Mild soreness at the injection site is common, but it shouldn’t interfere with your daily activities. As for whether these vaccinations will protect you, yes, they significantly reduce your risk of contracting Hepatitis A and Typhoid. They aren’t 100% effective, but they provide a very good level of protection. Regarding what to avoid, it’s best to be cautious with food and water where you’re traveling. Drink bottled water only, and avoid ice cubes. Eat thoroughly cooked food, and avoid raw fruits and vegetables unless you can peel them yourself. Be cautious with street food, and only eat at reputable establishments. I also recommend bringing a basic first-aid kit with you, including antiseptic wipes, bandages, and pain relievers. And if you experience any symptoms of illness – fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, jaundice – seek medical attention immediately. Finally, I'm going to give you a print-out with information on travel vaccinations and hygiene tips. Do you have any other questions before you leave?
PATIENT: No. I think… that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. I just… want to go home. I’ll… I’ll schedule the follow-up appointment. If I… if I remember. Just… be careful. That’s what she always said.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Odell. And you take care as well. Remember, if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to call the clinic. And yes, be careful. That's very good advice. .
