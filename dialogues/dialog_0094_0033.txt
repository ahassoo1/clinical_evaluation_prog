DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. My name is Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the faintest idea why I'm here. My… assistant, I suppose, scheduled this. Something about not being able to see or hear properly? It’s quite inconvenient, really. I have a very busy schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Julie. It happens sometimes – a check-up scheduled by someone else. So, you're experiencing some difficulty with your vision and hearing?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. That’s what she said. It’s all a bit…muddled. Things are just…not as sharp as they used to be, and sounds are rather faint. It's not dire, Doctor. I simply need to know if it’s something serious that will interfere with my work. I’m a surgeon, you know. Pediatric, but still. Precision is…paramount.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Julie. Precision is essential in your line of work. And it’s good you’re getting this checked out. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed these changes in your vision and hearing?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the foggiest. A few weeks, perhaps? It's all rather…gradual. I don’t make a habit of scrutinizing my senses, if you understand. I simply use them. It's just…things aren't quite right. Is that helpful? Honestly, I don’t recall a specific moment. It’s not as if a light switch flipped, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Julie. It often develops gradually. So, several weeks of noticing things aren’t as sharp visually, and sounds are fainter. Have you noticed it affecting your daily activities at all – besides your work?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, what else do I do? I work. I have standards, you know. I don't spend my days…frivolously engaging in hobbies. Though, my housekeeper did mention I asked her to repeat herself a few times last week. But that woman mumbles! It's hardly a reliable indicator, is it? Honestly, I expect a certain level of clarity from people, not the other way around.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, you've noticed some difficulty hearing your housekeeper, but you attribute that to her speech rather than your own hearing. Aside from that, you haven’t noticed any other specific instances where your vision or hearing has been problematic?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I can recall. I’ve simply been…less comfortable. Less certain. It’s difficult to explain. Everything feels…dull. But I assure you, I haven’t been incapable of performing my duties. I simply want to know if this is something I should be concerned about, and if so, what can be done about it. I haven’t got time for lengthy investigations, you understand. I have patients.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns and your busy schedule, Ms. Julie. We’ll certainly aim to be as efficient as possible. To get a clearer picture, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll check your vision and hearing, and also take a look in your ears, nose and throat. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But please be quick about it, Doctor. I do have a schedule to maintain. And I trust you’ve thoroughly sanitized your instruments? I wouldn't want to catch anything. Honestly, the things one has to endure these days… Let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. Everything is thoroughly sanitized. Let’s start with your vision. Could you please stand approximately 20 feet away from the chart and read the smallest line you can see clearly?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I hope this isn't one of those ridiculous charts with tiny, indistinguishable letters. My eyesight has always been perfectly adequate. E…P…F… honestly, the lighting in here isn’t helping. Is this the best you can do?
DOCTOR: I apologize for the lighting, Ms. Julie. We’ve had some issues with the fixtures. Alright, and now let's try covering your left eye, and read the chart again with just your right eye.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is rather tedious. F…P…T…oh, honestly, these letters are simply atrocious. It’s…difficult. Are you sure this chart is accurate? It’s hardly a scientific endeavor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's uncover your left eye and cover your right eye now. We'll see how your left eye does.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I’m beginning to suspect your methods are…subpar. I…can’t make out many of the letters. They’re just…blurs. I’m telling you, this chart is the problem. It’s simply not adequate. Are you sure you’re a qualified professional?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Julie. It sounds like there may be some vision difference between your eyes, and some difficulty with clarity. It's good we're assessing this. Now, let’s move on to your hearing. I’m going to place some headphones over your ears and play some tones at different pitches and volumes. Please let me know when you can hear the tone, and indicate how clearly you hear it. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. But please be quick about it. I haven’t got all day. And I trust those headphones are properly sanitized as well? Honestly, the germs one encounters these days… Do try to be efficient, Doctor. I have a very busy schedule, you know. And please, no excessively loud noises. I’m a surgeon; I need my hearing intact.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Julie. Everything is thoroughly sanitized, and we will keep the volumes at a comfortable level. I'll start with your right ear. Now, please raise your hand when you hear a tone in your right ear.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I can barely hear a thing. Is this machine even working? It’s just…silence. Or perhaps a very faint buzzing. It’s difficult to say. I suspect my assistant may have damaged my hearing with her incessant chatter. Honestly, the woman never stops talking! Is it over yet? I can’t say I’m finding this particularly informative.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Julie. It does seem there’s some hearing loss in your right ear. Let’s try the left ear now. Now, please let me know when you hear a tone in your left ear.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, this is quite pointless. I…can barely detect anything. A faint…hum, perhaps? It’s hardly conclusive. I suspect this entire process is…flawed. Honestly, I fail to see the value in subjecting myself to this…ordeal. Is it over yet? I have patients waiting.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Julie. It appears there is significant hearing loss in both ears. Based on the quick vision and hearing screening, and your description of your symptoms, it would be beneficial to schedule a comprehensive audiological evaluation with a specialist and a full eye exam with an ophthalmologist. This will give us a clearer understanding of the extent of the loss and the best course of action. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, Doctor. More appointments? More tests? I haven’t got time for this. I’m a surgeon, you know. I perform surgeries. Very well. If you insist. But I expect a prompt referral, and I expect it to be to a highly reputable specialist. I won’t have just anyone poking around in my ears and eyes. And please, no unnecessary delays. I have a schedule to maintain, you understand. Is that clear? Now, can I finally leave? I have patients waiting.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Julie, perfectly clear. I will arrange a prompt referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly respected audiologist, and Dr. Marcus Bellwether, an ophthalmologist with excellent reviews. I'll have my assistant send over the referral information and scheduling details before you leave. I’m also going to write you a note excusing you from work for a couple of days to allow for these appointments. In the meantime, try to avoid loud noises and get plenty of rest. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No questions. Just…get it done. And ensure the specialists are punctual. I have a very busy schedule, you understand. I haven’t got time to waste waiting around in sterile waiting rooms. Now, if you’ll excuse me… .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Julie. My assistant will be right with you to arrange the referrals. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon. .
