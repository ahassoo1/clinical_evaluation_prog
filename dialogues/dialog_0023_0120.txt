DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Villarreal. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don't have a lot of time. It's about…having a baby. I want to make sure it doesn't, you know, take too long. My sister had problems, and honestly, I just want to get it over with, quickly and easily. Is that possible?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, "quickly and easily" isn't exactly a medical guarantee, Ms. Villarreal, but we can certainly discuss optimizing your chances for a straightforward pregnancy. Let's start with some details. You mentioned your sister had problems – can you elaborate on those?
PATIENT: Honestly? It was a whole mess. Something about…hormones? And tests? I wasn’t really paying attention to the details, to be frank. It was stressful for everyone. I just remember a lot of poking and prodding and then… IVF. Look, I don't want to end up like her. I'm not getting any younger, you know? Is there anything you can do to avoid all that? I have good insurance, so… cost isn’t as much of an issue, but still. Time is precious.
DOCTOR: Alright. While I understand your desire to avoid a complicated journey, “hormones” and “tests” is rather vague. We need specifics to assess your individual risk. Let's start with your medical history. Have you had any difficulty conceiving previously?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I've… well, I was married, obviously. And it happened. First try, pretty much. That was… a while ago. Since my husband… passed, I haven’t really…tried. Until now. So, I don't have a history of problems. I just want to make sure it stays that way, you know? I don’t want any surprises. This isn’t my first rodeo, doctor.
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, with all due respect, saying it "wasn't your first rodeo" doesn’t provide me with any useful clinical information. A previous uncomplicated pregnancy doesn’t guarantee another one. Things can change. We still need to perform a thorough evaluation. Have you had a physical exam recently?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Look, I’m a busy woman. I run a lab, for goodness sake. I don’t have time for a “thorough evaluation” of every little thing. I just want to know if I’m…good to go. You know, basic check, make sure everything's working, and then…let me get on with it. Is that really too much to ask? And honestly, I find this whole process rather…condescending. It was easy before, why can’t it be easy now?
DOCTOR: Ms. Villarreal, with all due respect, responsible medical care requires a proper assessment, even if previous experiences were straightforward. I understand your frustration, but dismissing essential steps based on past convenience is… unwise. Let's compromise. I will order a basic panel of blood tests – hormone levels, complete blood count, and a few others to get a baseline. But I will need you to allow me to perform a brief physical exam – blood pressure, weight, and a pelvic exam. That is non-negotiable. Do you agree to that?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Honestly. Look, I highly doubt it's necessary. But…fine. Fine. Just…get it over with. Quickly, please. I have things to do. But don’t expect me to be happy about it. And no unnecessary chatting, alright? Just…do the test.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed. The nurse will be in shortly to take your vital signs and draw some blood. Then, I'll perform the exam. Please undress from the waist down and lie on the examination table. I’ll explain each step as briefly as possible. Let’s try to be efficient, as you wish.
PATIENT: .
