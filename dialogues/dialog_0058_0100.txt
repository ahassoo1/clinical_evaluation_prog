DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um... well, it's about a test, I think. Something they need me to do. It's all a bit fuzzy, honestly. Medicare sent something... about needing to check for... things? I mostly just drive big machines, you know? Not much call for remembering paperwork in that line of work.
DOCTOR: Right. A test. Well, Medicare does send a lot of things. Let’s try to narrow it down. Do you recall what kind of test it was supposed to be?
PATIENT: Gosh, no, not really. It had something to do with... well, with making sure I'm alright, I guess? I think it was a drug test, maybe? Something about being safe when I'm operating the equipment. They said it was routine. Honestly, all these forms… they just get lost in the shuffle. I’m Lytisha, by the way. Sometimes I forget to introduce myself properly. Old habit, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, routine tests are important, Lytisha. It could be a drug test, given your profession, but Medicare also sends out reminders for things like mammograms, colonoscopies… standard preventative care. Just to be sure, do you have any of the paperwork with you?
PATIENT: Paperwork… Let me see… Oh dear. This bag is a disaster zone. Bills, coupons, a half-eaten granola bar… Nope, no official-looking papers. I thought I brought it… maybe it’s at home? I really don’t keep track of these things, I’m afraid. Is it okay if we just… do the test? If that’s what it is? I trust you folks know what you’re doing.
DOCTOR: Well, ideally, we’d have some documentation before proceeding. But… alright. Let's start with a basic review of your health history. It's important to know what we're working with, regardless. So, Ms. Hughston, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. I had… something with my back, years ago. From all the bouncing around in the machinery, you know? The doctor gave me pills, and it got better. I don’t really… go to the doctor much. Honestly, if it doesn’t stop me from working, I tend to ignore it. And I think I had high blood pressure at one point, but it seems alright now. I try to eat healthy… most of the time. Does that help? It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: "Something with your back"... and "high blood pressure at one point." Right. Okay. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes, actually. Years ago, when I was younger, I had my appendix out. That was… a long time ago. And… I think I had a small thing removed from my skin, on my arm. Just a little bump, nothing serious. They numbed it up and… poof, it was gone. It’s all very hazy, honestly. I don’t remember much about either of them. Mostly just the recovery time, and wanting to get back to work!
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family… That’s… sad, actually. My husband, Jean-Paul, he passed away a few years back. Heart trouble. And my mother… she had something with her memory, towards the end. Not good. I don't really know much about what caused it, just that she needed a lot of care. My father was a strong man, a fisherman. He lived a long life, but… I don't know about any other illnesses in the family, to be honest. It wasn't something we talked about much. Does that make sense? I’m sorry I’m not more helpful.
DOCTOR: It’s alright. We can work with what we have. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Um… Well, there’s this. The lady at the pharmacy said it was good for my joints. They ache sometimes, you know, from all the vibration. I just take one every so often, when they bother me. It doesn't have a label, I think I threw it away. And… oh! Sometimes I take something for sleep, if I’m really restless. A little blue pill. But I don't take it very often. I mostly just try to tire myself out, you know? Hard work usually does the trick. Is that… okay? I really don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: “A little blue pill” and something “for your joints” with no labels?
PATIENT: Yes, I know, it’s terrible. I really should be more organized. My daughter used to tell me to keep a list, but… well, things slip my mind, you know? I just… I don’t really pay attention to the names. They just help, you know? The pain, the restlessness… I trust the people at the pharmacy, I guess. They wouldn’t give me anything dangerous, would they? Would they? I just want to be able to keep working. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Hughston, before we proceed any further, I'm going to need a more complete medication list. And frankly, taking unlabeled pills is extremely dangerous. We need to understand what you’re putting into your system. We’ll have to put a hold on any testing until we have that information. I’m going to have the nurse draw some blood to get a baseline and we can schedule a follow-up appointment. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. A hold on the test? And blood? Yes, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. It’s just… I have deadlines, you know? Work is… important. But… you’re the doctor. You know best. Okay. Blood tests and… a list. I’ll try my best. It might take me a few days to remember everything, though. I really do apologize for the mess. It’s just… my mind isn’t what it used to be. .
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly. We’ll get this scheduled. And Ms. Hughston, please make every effort to compile that list. It’s crucial for your safety. I’ll see you at your follow-up.
