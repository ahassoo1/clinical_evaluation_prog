DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Weichers. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Um... well, I’ve been coughing up… some blood. It scared me, so I thought I should come see someone. Not a lot, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Weichers. Coughing up blood – even a small amount – is certainly something we need to investigate. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It started maybe… a week ago? At first, it was just a little bit, like, when I coughed really hard. But yesterday, it was more. It’s… bright red. And it happens when I cough, mostly. Sometimes when I… clear my throat too, I think. I haven't felt sick otherwise, if that makes sense. No fever, no chills, just… the blood.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Weichers. So, a week of intermittent bright red blood when coughing, and occasionally when clearing your throat, with no other symptoms like fever or chills. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the cough itself?
PATIENT: Um… it's not a bad cough, really. Not painful. Just… a regular cough, I suppose. A little bit dry, maybe. Not much phlegm, and when there is phlegm, it’s… clear. Or white. Nothing colored, except for the blood, of course. I don’t… wheeze, I don’t think. It doesn’t feel like a cold cough, you know? More… just a tickle in my throat sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Ms. Weichers. A dry, non-productive cough, occasionally with clear or white phlegm, and the presence of bright red blood. Now, let’s move on to some other questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Not recently. I had a little cold back in… March, maybe? But it was very mild, and it went away quickly. Nothing since then. I’ve been feeling pretty healthy, honestly, except for this. I try to eat well and get enough rest. I’m a physical therapist, so I stay active too. It’s just… this blood is worrying me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Weichers. Physical therapists generally have a good awareness of their bodies. So, no recent illnesses since March. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, chest pain, or weight loss associated with this cough?
PATIENT: No shortness of breath, no. And no chest pain at all. I haven’t lost any weight, I don't think. Maybe a tiny bit, but I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. My clothes still fit the same, if that helps. I haven’t been feeling tired either, so… I really haven't felt sick, just… concerned about the blood. It's a little frightening.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Weichers. It is always best to investigate these things. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions, such as asthma, bronchitis, or any other lung problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't. I've always been pretty healthy, really. My family… my parents, they had high blood pressure, but nothing with their lungs. I haven't had asthma or bronchitis, never been diagnosed with anything like that. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I don't have any allergies either. I don’t take any regular medications, just… sometimes ibuprofen for a headache.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Weichers. No pre-existing conditions, no allergies, and only occasional ibuprofen use. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never been hospitalized, thankfully. I broke my arm when I was a little girl, but that was it. They set it in a cast and that was all. Nothing serious. I’m… not a fan of hospitals, to be honest. I prefer to stay healthy and avoid them if possible. That's why I'm here, you know? To make sure everything is okay.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It's always best to be proactive about your health. So, no surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let’s move on to your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not smoke. Never have. My husband… he used to smoke a little, years ago, but he passed away five years ago and he quit a long time before that. But I've never smoked. I don't like the smell of it, and I try to stay healthy. It's not good for you, you know? I’m very careful about what I put into my body.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Weichers. I'm very sorry for your loss. So, no smoking history, either personally or with significant exposure. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, are you experiencing any other symptoms that haven't been mentioned?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. I've been trying to think about it, but I can’t recall anything else. Just the cough, and the blood. And the worry, of course. I haven’t noticed any night sweats, or fever, or chills. No pain anywhere else. Just… this. I hope it's nothing serious. It's just… frightening to cough up blood. I am a little nervous, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Ms. Weichers, and it’s perfectly reasonable to feel that way. We will do our best to determine the cause of this. Now, I'd like to perform a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, check your oxygen saturation, and examine your throat. This will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. I would like to know what's happening, so yes, please. Please do the exam. I hope you can find out what's causing it. It’s just… unsettling. I want to get back to my work, and to feeling normal again. Just… please be gentle, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Weichers. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your lungs and heart with the stethoscope. Your blood pressure is 128/76, which is normal. Your pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, if you could take a deep breath for me, please. I’m listening to your lungs now. I do hear some mild wheezing on exhale, but it’s very subtle. No significant crackles or rhonchi. Your heart sounds are regular, with no murmurs. Now, could you open your mouth, please?
PATIENT: Okay. Here you go, Doctor. It doesn’t hurt, does it? I'm trying to relax, but I'm a little tense. It’s just… I don't like being poked and prodded, if you understand. And the thought of something being wrong is unsettling. Is the wheezing… bad? Is that what’s causing the blood? I just want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: No, this isn't causing any discomfort, Ms. Weichers. Your throat appears slightly red, but no visible lesions or significant swelling. The slight redness could be from irritation, perhaps from the coughing. The mild wheezing I heard is also subtle, and it isn’t necessarily indicative of a serious problem, but it does warrant further investigation. Your oxygen saturation is 98% on room air, which is excellent. Based on this initial examination, the wheezing and throat redness are present, but there are no other immediate findings. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. If that will help you find out what's causing the blood, then please do. A chest X-ray and a blood count… yes. I trust your judgment. Is it… a lot of blood for the blood count? I don’t like needles, you know. And I worry about… what it might show. But I understand you need to find out what’s going on, so please proceed. How long will it take? And will I have to wait long for the results? I have patients tomorrow, and I don't want to cancel on them if I don't need to.
DOCTOR: It’s just a standard blood draw, Ms. Weichers – a few vials. It will only take a few minutes, and the phlebotomist is very skilled. As for the results, the blood count usually comes back within a few hours. The X-ray results can take a bit longer, typically a couple of hours, depending on the radiologist’s availability. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they are available. We can discuss them then, and I will let you know if we need to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity. Would you like me to have a nurse draw the blood now, or would you prefer to do it later?
PATIENT: Um… perhaps I should just get it over with now, if it’s quick. I'd rather not think about it all day. And avoiding strenuous activity… that's good advice. I have a few lighter patients tomorrow, so I can adjust my schedule. Yes, please, let’s get the blood drawn now. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything so clearly, and for being so patient with me. I really appreciate it. I am a little nervous, but I feel… better knowing you're looking into it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I’m happy to help. And you are absolutely right to want to get it done quickly. I'll have the nurse come in and draw the blood now. She’ll explain the process and answer any questions you have. Nurse, could you please come to room three to draw a blood sample from Ms. Weichers?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I hope it doesn’t hurt too much. I haven’t had blood drawn in years.
DOCTOR: The nurse is very skilled, Ms. Weichers, and she'll do her best to make it as comfortable as possible. Just let her know if you’re feeling any discomfort. We’ll get through this. While we wait, is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. Just… the blood draw, and then hopefully some answers. I think that's all for now. I am a little anxious, but I trust your judgment. And I appreciate you being so kind and patient. It's… comforting to know you're taking this seriously. I guess I'll just wait for the nurse, then. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I am glad I can provide some reassurance. Please don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns while we wait. I will be right here.
PATIENT: .
