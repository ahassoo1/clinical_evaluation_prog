DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cantoran. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don’t have all day. I just… I’m tired. Really tired. And I’ve been… eating things. Weird things. Dirt, mostly. I don’t know why. It just… happens. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: "Dirt," you say?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt! Clay, really. From the yard. Don’t look at me like that! It’s not like I want to. It just… feels… right? I don’t know how to explain it. And it’s not helping the tiredness, obviously. It's been getting worse for... well, I don't remember exactly when it started. A few months, maybe? Longer? Honestly, I lose track.
DOCTOR: Right. A few months of… consuming clay, accompanied by increasing fatigue. And you say you've been losing track of time… Have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? I… I dunno. My hands ache sometimes. And I get kinda… short with people. My neighbor asked if I needed help with the lawn and I practically yelled at her. Which wasn't nice. But she was being nosy! Look, I just want to feel normal again, okay? I used to be able to… well, I used to do things. Now I just… nap. A lot. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Irritability and hand pain… alongside the fatigue and… unusual dietary habits. It could be a number of things. I'll need to ask a few more questions, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Ugh, more questions? Fine. My stomach… it feels a little off sometimes. Not really pain, just… unsettled. And… yeah, I go to the bathroom differently now. It's… harder. Constipated, I guess that’s the word. Is that important? Honestly, doctors always ask about that stuff. It's embarrassing. And I don't see what it has to do with eating dirt!
DOCTOR: Constipation... yes, that is relevant. And while I understand your… frustration, these details help us determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. Now, have you noticed any changes in your skin or nails recently?
PATIENT: Skin and nails? Seriously? What am I, a dermatologist? I… I guess my skin's been kinda dry. And my nails… they break easy. But that's always been the case. I work with computers all day. It messes with your hands, you know? I don't pay attention to little things like that. I just want to feel better, not get a beauty lesson. Look, is there a test you can just do to find out what's wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s not a beauty lesson, Ms. Cantoran. These are all potential symptoms. Alright, let's move on. Have you had any unusual cravings for things besides clay?
PATIENT: Ugh, are you still on the dirt? Look, I don’t know! Maybe? I eat a lot of ice. That's… weird, right? And I used to like pickles. Really strong pickles. Does that count? I don’t know what I’m supposed to be craving, I just… eat. When I feel like it. It's not like I plan this stuff! It's just… a feeling. And then I eat something. Can we just get this over with? I have errands.
DOCTOR: Yes, the ice and pickles are relevant. Pica, the craving for non-food items, and unusual food cravings can sometimes indicate a deficiency. Let’s run some blood tests. We’ll check your iron levels, vitamin D, and a complete blood count. That should give us a starting point. I’ll also want to check your thyroid function. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Ugh, tests? Of course. Look, I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. Maybe penicillin? I had a bad reaction once, a long time ago. But honestly, I can’t remember. I don't keep track of these things. Just… don't give me anything that'll make me feel worse. And can we hurry this up? I really need to go. It's just… exhausting being here. I'm tired just talking about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies, but we’ll be cautious. We’ll take a blood sample now, and I'll order the thyroid panel. It will take a few days for the results to come back. In the meantime, try to avoid consuming any clay. It's unlikely to be helping. Is there anyone who can help you with errands if you’re feeling particularly fatigued?
PATIENT: Avoid the clay? Easier said than done! It’s… a habit, okay? And no. No one. My husband… he passed a few years back. I do things on my own. Always have. I don't need help. Just… get the tests done. And let me know when they're ready. I have to go now. This has been… draining. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab technician will be in shortly to draw your blood. We’ll contact you with the results as soon as they’re available. Here’s a requisition form for the lab. Try to rest, Ms. Cantoran. And if your symptoms worsen, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic.
