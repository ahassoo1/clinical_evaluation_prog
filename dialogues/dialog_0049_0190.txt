DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Snerling. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been feeling unsteady, like I might fall. It’s been happening for a little while now, but it feels worse lately. I… I don't quite recall when it started, exactly.
DOCTOR: Unsteady, you say. And you’re having trouble pinpointing when this began?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. It’s… frustrating. Things just aren't as clear as they used to be, if that makes sense. I think it was after… after my husband passed, but everything feels a bit hazy around then. I apologize for not being more specific. I do have insurance, if that's helpful. Private insurance.
DOCTOR: I see. Grief can certainly manifest in… unexpected ways. But we need to rule out other causes for your unsteadiness. So, let’s try to be as precise as possible. When you say unsteady, can you describe how you feel?
PATIENT: Hmm… it's not a dizziness, exactly. More like… my feet aren’t quite under me. Like I’m walking on a boat, perhaps? Or… sometimes it’s just a wobble, a feeling I could tip over. It happens when I’m walking, usually, but sometimes even when I’m standing still. It’s… disconcerting. I work with heavy machinery, you see, so it’s rather concerning. Rotary drills, for oil and gas. It requires… a steady hand.
DOCTOR: Rotary drills… that is concerning, yes. Okay. And does anything seem to trigger this feeling?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… I don’t believe so, not that I’ve noticed. It seems to come and go. Sometimes it’s worse after a long day at work, naturally. But even on days when I haven’t been particularly strenuous, it happens. I wish I could be more helpful. It’s… I just don’t remember things as well as I used to. I think standing for long periods makes it a little worse, though. Would that be helpful?
DOCTOR: Alright. Standing for long periods… that’s something. And you mentioned working with heavy machinery. Any falls, or near falls, associated with this unsteadiness?
PATIENT: Thankfully, no falls. I’ve been very careful. There have been a couple of… close calls, where I had to steady myself against something. I immediately stop what I’m doing, of course. I’m very mindful of the danger. My crew… they’ve noticed it, I think. They haven't said anything directly, but I can tell. It's… embarrassing, to be honest. I pride myself on my work.
DOCTOR: Okay. No falls, but near misses. That’s important. Now, let’s go through some basics. Any history of medical problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I had… a bout of the flu a few years back, but nothing serious. I don't recall any… chronic illnesses. My husband always handled the doctor's appointments, if I’m being truthful. He was very meticulous about those things. I'm relatively healthy, I believe. I try to eat well, though it’s difficult with the work schedule. I do take a daily multivitamin. Does that… count as a medical thing?
DOCTOR: A multivitamin is… something. Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any. I… I haven't really required medical attention much in my life. My husband… he always said I was a sturdy one. I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. I wish I could provide more concrete information. It’s just… difficult to grasp everything at the moment. Everything feels a little… distant.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your family history, then. Any significant medical problems in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father… he had some trouble with his heart later in life. But beyond that… I don't really know. My family isn’t… particularly forthcoming about medical things. It was… considered rather private. I’m afraid I can’t be much help on that front either. I do remember my grandmother… she had some trouble walking when she was very old, but that was quite a while ago.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure and heart trouble in the family. Noted. Now, any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I’m aware of. I can eat anything, take most medications without issue. My husband always double-checked, of course, but I don’t recall him ever finding anything I was allergic to. I… I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. But again, I apologize for not being certain. It’s… frustrating to feel so unsure of things.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’d like to check your balance, your reflexes, and listen to your heart and lungs. Just a routine check to get a better picture of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to cooperate. I do hope it sheds some light on this unsteadiness. It’s rather unsettling to feel so… precarious. Please, proceed.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just step onto the table here, please. First, I’m going to check your blood pressure. 130 over 80. A little elevated, but not overly concerning. Now, let’s check your pulse. 72, regular. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This might be a little startling. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I want you to stand with your feet together, and close your eyes. Okay, a little unsteady, as you described. Now, walk heel-to-toe for a few steps. A bit of a wide-based gait, some difficulty maintaining balance. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Alright. Your blood pressure is a little high, and your balance is definitely affected. I’d like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying causes for this unsteadiness, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. We'll also consider a referral to a neurologist for further evaluation.
PATIENT: That… sounds thorough. Blood work and a neurologist… I appreciate you taking this so seriously, Doctor. It’s… reassuring. I do hope it’s nothing too serious. I rely on my balance for my work, you see. What kind of blood work are we talking about? And… how long does that usually take to get the results? I have a schedule to maintain.
DOCTOR: We’ll run a complete metabolic panel, a thyroid panel, a vitamin B12 level, and a CBC – that’s a complete blood count. These tests will help us identify any potential deficiencies or underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your unsteadiness. The results typically take 2-3 business days to come back. I’ll have my assistant schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss them once they’re available. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a temporary work note restricting you from operating heavy machinery until we have a clearer understanding of what’s going on. It’s better to be safe than sorry. We'll also do a Romberg test to further assess your balance. You show some instability in the Romberg test, which indicates a potential issue with your proprioception – your sense of body position. This further supports the need for a neurological evaluation. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Proprioception… that’s a mouthful. And a neurological evaluation… what does that entail? Will it be… unpleasant? I apologize for asking, Doctor, but I’m rather anxious about all of this. I… I just want to be able to work. And I worry about what this might mean. The thought of not being able to continue my job… it’s… unsettling. Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Any exercises or precautions I should take?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Snerling. It’s perfectly normal to be worried about this, especially given the nature of your work. A neurological evaluation typically involves a more in-depth assessment of your reflexes, balance, coordination, and sensation. It may also involve imaging studies, such as an MRI or CT scan, to get a clearer picture of your brain and spinal cord. I assure you, it’s not typically unpleasant. It’s simply a more thorough examination. In the meantime, I would advise you to avoid any strenuous activity, especially operating heavy machinery. Focus on maintaining a stable diet and staying hydrated. There are some balance exercises you can try at home, but I would prefer you to wait until after the neurological evaluation before starting any formal exercise program. We need to understand the underlying cause of your unsteadiness before recommending any specific exercises. I'm going to give you a referral to Dr. Alistair Chen, a neurologist I trust. His office is located at… He's very experienced in diagnosing and treating balance disorders. I'll also provide you with a copy of your blood work results and the notes from this visit to share with him. Do you have any further questions about the referral process or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Dr. Chen… alright. I’ll write that down. Thank you for the referral, Doctor. And for explaining everything so thoroughly. It does… ease my mind somewhat, knowing there’s a plan. I believe that answers my questions for now. Though… I apologize if this is a silly question, but will this affect my insurance coverage? The neurological evaluation, the blood work… I worry about unexpected costs.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Snerling. And not a silly question at all. Let me have my assistant verify your insurance coverage details for both the neurological evaluation and the blood work. She'll contact your insurance provider and let you know what your out-of-pocket costs will be, if any. We have a billing department that can also assist you with any financial concerns. I’ll make a note to have them prioritize that request for you. I want to assure you that we’ll do everything we can to ensure you have a clear understanding of your costs upfront. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any further questions or concerns. We're here to help. Do you have any other requests before we conclude today's consultation?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. You’ve been very helpful, Doctor Nestingen. I appreciate your patience and understanding. I will contact Dr. Chen’s office and schedule an appointment. And I’ll wait to hear from your assistant regarding the insurance coverage. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Very well. You’re welcome. Have a good day, Ms. Snerling.
