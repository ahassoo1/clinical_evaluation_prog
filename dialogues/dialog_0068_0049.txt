DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Schneer. Or… is it Mr. Schneer?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, doctor. It’s… uh… just Betty, I suppose. People call me Betty. Mr. Schneer was… a long time ago. Don't rightly remember much about that now. It’s a bit fuzzy, see?
DOCTOR: Right, Betty. My apologies. I sometimes… misremember things myself these days. So, Betty, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it’s my ears, doctor. They just… aren't what they used to be. Things are getting muffled, you know? Like talking underwater. I have to ask folks to repeat themselves a lot. It’s embarrassing, really. I don't hear the television good either.
DOCTOR: Muffled hearing… I understand. And this has been happening for… how long now, would you say?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. Seems like… a while now. Maybe a year? Or two? It didn't bother me much at first, just thought folks were mumbling. But it’s gotten worse lately, definitely. Hard to say when exactly it started, though. My memory… it ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: A year or two… alright. And has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. Definitely gradual. Not like a pop or anything. Just… slowly fading away, like an old photograph. One day I noticed I was turning the TV up a bit louder, and then a bit louder again… and then I realized I just wasn’t hearin’ things like I used to.
DOCTOR: Alright, gradual onset… that’s helpful. Now, Betty, have you noticed any ringing in your ears, or any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Ringing… hmm. Sometimes, yeah. A little bit. It's not constant, more like a… faint whistle now and then. Not painful, though. Just… annoying. And no pain, no. Just hard to hear, mostly. It's a dull feeling, like somethin's blockin' the sound.
DOCTOR: A faint whistle, intermittent… alright. And have you been exposed to any loud noises recently, or in the past—like machinery, construction, or even loud music?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. Back when I was workin', I sure was! I worked in a shoe factory for… oh, I don't know, forty years maybe? Lots of noisy machines clackin' away all day. Sewing machines, cutting machines, the works! It was a loud place, that's for sure. I never thought much about it at the time, but… maybe that had somethin’ to do with it?
DOCTOR: Shoe factory… prolonged exposure to noise. That’s a significant factor. Now, Betty, let’s do a quick exam of your ears. I’ll just take a look and see what I can observe. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds fine to me, doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. My ears are probably full of dust from all those years in the factory anyway!
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lean forward a bit… Let me take a look. Hmm… There's a bit of cerumen—earwax—in both ears. It doesn’t look like anything severe, but it could be contributing to the muffled hearing. The tympanic membranes—that’s the eardrum—look… a little dull. I don't see any signs of infection or fluid, thankfully. Now, I’m going to do a quick hearing test, just to get a better idea of how things are. It's a simple one, doesn't take long. Okay?
PATIENT: Alright, doctor. Sounds good. Earwax, huh? I figured as much! A bit of everything probably got in there over the years. A hearing test… I suppose that's a good idea. I'm happy to do whatever you think is best. Go right ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright, Betty. I’m going to put these headphones on you. I’ll play some tones at different pitches and volumes, and I want you to press the button every time you hear something. Even if it’s very faint, press the button. Don't worry if you don't hear everything, that’s perfectly normal. Just focus on listening. Okay, good. Good. Now a bit louder… Alright, Betty, that’s all. Thank you. Hmm… the results show some mild to moderate hearing loss in both ears, particularly at higher frequencies. This is consistent with noise-induced hearing loss, and it’s also in line with what we’ve discussed.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn't too bad. A bit of beepin’ and boopin’, but nothin’ scary. Mild to moderate, you say? Noise-induced… That factory, I reckon. Always figured all that racket couldn't be good for me. What does this mean, doctor? What can we do about it?
DOCTOR: Alright, Betty. It means that your hearing has been affected by the noise exposure over the years, which is fairly common. The good news is that it's not severe, and there are things we can do. The most likely cause is a buildup of earwax, contributing to the hearing loss, so I recommend we start with a gentle earwax removal. Then, we can discuss the possibility of hearing aids if the hearing loss continues to bother you after that. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Earwax removal sounds good to me, doctor. Get rid of all that gunk, maybe I'll hear a bit better. Hearing aids… well, I don't know. I've always been a bit leery of those. But let's try the earwax removal first, see if that helps. I don't want to go jumpin' to conclusions. How does that work, the earwax removal? Is it painful?
DOCTOR: It's a very simple procedure, Betty. I’ll use a special instrument to gently remove the earwax. It’s usually not painful at all—some people describe a slight pressure or tickling sensation, but generally, it’s quite comfortable. I’ll use warm water and a low-pressure suction device. It only takes a few minutes per ear. We can do it right here in the office today if you’re comfortable with that. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Well, if it's not painful and it might help, I suppose I could try it. Doing it today would be convenient, I don't want to have to make another trip. Warm water… sounds alright. You think it'll make a difference? I mostly miss hearing the television, and talkin' with my friends. It's hard to keep up sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand, Betty. It can be frustrating. I’m hopeful that removing the earwax will improve your hearing enough to make a noticeable difference, especially for everyday conversations and the television. It won't necessarily restore your hearing to perfect, but it can often provide significant relief. Alright, then let’s proceed. I’ll have the nurse prepare the equipment. We'll start with your right ear, then move to the left. I’ll explain everything as we go. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, doctor. You've explained everything pretty clearly. Just… get it over with, I suppose. I trust you. Let's just see if we can get me hearin’ a bit better. I miss a good chat.
DOCTOR: Alright, Betty. That's all I ask. We'll take it slow and steady. Nurse, could you please come in and assist with the earwax removal for Mrs. Schneer?
