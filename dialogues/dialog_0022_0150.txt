DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteyenberg. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let's get straight to it. I want to have a baby. And I want it to be…easy. No complications. I’m not getting any younger, you know. I heard you were…competent.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Shteyenberg. It’s perfectly reasonable to want a straightforward and healthy pregnancy, especially as you consider timing. We’ll certainly do our best to make that happen. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, history. Well, I’ve been generally healthy, if that’s what you want to know. Divorced, which is probably relevant, since…well, you can imagine. Medicare covers everything, naturally. I don’t…really do detailed medical reports. Is this going to take long? I had a very…particular schedule planned for today.
DOCTOR: I understand you're busy, Ms. Shteyenberg. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. Just a few key questions will help me get a better picture of your overall health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I take care of myself. I mean, I repair bicycles all day, that’s physical work! It keeps me fit. My ex-husband, now he had problems. A weak constitution, always complaining… Honestly, I suspect half of his ailments were just attention-seeking. Are we getting anywhere with this or are you just trying to fill out paperwork?
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Ms. Shteyenberg. Physical activity is excellent, and it’s good to know you’re generally healthy. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. And no hospital visits, unless you count a bad flu once, but that was ages ago. Really, I’m quite robust. I don’t understand why this is taking so long. I was hoping for a quick assessment and maybe a…plan of action. I don’t want to spend my entire afternoon here recounting irrelevant details. Are you going to ask about my childhood next?
DOCTOR: I apologize if it feels like I'm asking a lot of questions, Ms. Shteyenberg. It's just important to gather a complete picture. Knowing your past medical history, even if it seems unrelated, can help us ensure a healthy pregnancy. Okay, let's move on. Are there any allergies I should be aware of—to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. I'm Hungarian, you know, we have… hearty appetites. I can handle spice, I can handle anything. No reactions to any medication I've ever taken – and I haven't taken much, frankly. I prefer to stay healthy naturally. Look, are we going to discuss fertility specifically or just…my life story? I need to know if this is going to be a productive appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shteyenberg. Let’s focus on fertility. Do you currently take any medications, including vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, sometimes. When I remember. And occasionally a pain reliever if I overdo it with the bicycle repairs, but that’s it. Really, I’m very low-maintenance. I don’t need a lot of…interference. Are you planning to run a lot of tests? Because I have a very busy schedule. I would prefer minimal disruption.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin occasionally and pain relievers as needed. That’s helpful to know. Now, I understand you're hoping for a straightforward process. To start, I’d like to ask a few questions about your menstrual cycle. Could you tell me roughly when your last period was?
PATIENT: Oh, that. Honestly? I don’t track it meticulously. I’m not a teenager, doctor. It comes and goes. Roughly…I suppose it was a few weeks ago? Maybe four? It’s…irregular, sometimes. Life gets in the way, you know? I don’t live my life around a calendar. It's hardly a precise science, is it? Are we getting closer to actually doing something?
DOCTOR: Okay, roughly four weeks ago, and somewhat irregular. That’s good to know. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a quick physical exam and order some routine blood work. The blood work will help us assess your overall health and hormone levels, and the exam will help me get a better understanding of your current condition. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Finally. Yes, fine. Get on with it. The less time I spend sitting here answering pointless questions, the better. But please be quick. And don’t tell me about every single detail of what you’re doing. I don’t need a running commentary. Just…efficiently assess my suitability for…gestation. Is that too blunt? Frankly, I’m losing patience.
DOCTOR: Not at all blunt, Ms. Shteyenberg. I understand your desire for efficiency. We’ll keep it concise. If you’ll just change into the gown, we'll start with a basic physical exam. I’ll explain what I’m doing as we go, but I’ll keep it brief.
