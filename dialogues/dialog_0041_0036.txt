DOCTOR: Hi Kiwane, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. My name is Kiwane Barban. I am here for… a check-up before the insurance starts. A physical, yes? I have Medicare, and they said I need this done first. It is… important for the paperwork, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, that makes sense. A pre-insurance physical – absolutely, we can do that. It is important to get everything sorted for the paperwork. You mentioned Medicare, and I see here you’re 28 years old, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Twenty-eight years. Though, honestly, I do not see why age is so important for a simple check-up. Is there a problem? I feel perfectly fine. Mostly.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Kiwane. It’s just standard information we collect. “Mostly” is good to hear, though. Can you tell me a little more about that “mostly”?
PATIENT: Well… it is nothing serious, I assure you. Just… sometimes my back aches. From work, you understand. I lift heavy things all day. It is… food processing. Not glamorous, but it pays the bills. It is usually fine with rest, but sometimes… after a long shift… it is unpleasant. Nothing a little… lying down cannot fix.
DOCTOR: Okay, so back pain related to your work in food processing. Lifting heavy things, that makes sense. Is it a sharp pain, or more of a dull ache?
PATIENT: It is… not sharp. More like… heavy. A weight is on my back. And sometimes it goes down my leg a little. Not all the way, just… the top part. It is annoying, mostly. I do not understand why you ask so many questions about it. It is just my back.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I seem to be asking a lot of questions, Kiwane. It's just important to get a good understanding of what’s going on so we can make sure everything is okay. Knowing exactly where the pain is and what it feels like helps me rule things out. You said it goes down your leg a little. Can you point to where exactly on your leg you feel it?
PATIENT: Hmm. Right here. Not in the knee, not in the foot. Just… up here. And it does not happen every time. Only when I have been lifting a lot. Or if I bend over quickly. It is… inconvenient. I do not have time for pain, Doctor. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, upper thigh, near the hip, and related to lifting or bending. That’s helpful. Do you feel any numbness or tingling in your leg, or your foot, at all?
PATIENT: No, no tingling. No numbness. Just… discomfort. A soreness. Like I have been working too hard. Which, of course, I have. Is this going to take long, Doctor? I have to get back to work eventually. They are short-staffed.
DOCTOR: No, we’re getting there. I just want to cover all the bases. Alright. Let’s talk about other things, then. Have you had any other aches or pains anywhere else in your body?
PATIENT: No. My back is the only problem. I eat okay, I sleep okay, I work too much. That is my life. I do not understand why you need to know about every little thing. Do you ask everyone this many questions? I suspect you are trying to find something wrong just to… make work for yourself.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Kiwane. I assure you I'm not trying to find something wrong just to create work. We ask everyone the same questions to get a complete picture of their health. It's important to rule out anything serious and make sure we’re not missing anything. It’s standard medical practice. Okay. How about this: have you ever had any serious illnesses or injuries in the past?
PATIENT: No. Nothing serious. I had the usual childhood things. Chickenpox, maybe. I do not remember. And I broke my arm once, when I was very young. But that healed fine. Nothing else. I am a healthy man, Doctor. Just tired. And my back aches. You are asking too many questions. Is this part of the insurance thing? Will this paperwork ever end?
DOCTOR: I apologize again for the lengthy questions, Kiwane. It is partly for the insurance, yes, but mostly it's to ensure I have a good understanding of your health history. So, no other serious illnesses or injuries?
PATIENT: No. None. I told you. I am… durable. I work hard. I do not get sick easily. And I certainly do not have time to be sick. Now, can we please finish with this? I need to go back to work, or they will be very angry. It is a busy time. The paperwork, the insurance… it is all very stressful. Is there anything else? Because I am losing patience.
DOCTOR: Okay. No other medical issues to report. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam, just to check things out. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your back. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. As long as it is quick. I do not want to be here all day. Just… listen and look. And then I can go? Please. My back is fine. I already told you. But if you must look… do not take too long. It is just a back. Not a complicated machine.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could just lie down on your stomach for me, please?
PATIENT: This is not very comfortable. Hurry up, please. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart and lungs sound clear. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes! That hurts. There. And there. Not sharp, but… unpleasant. See? I told you my back is bothering me. You are finally listening. It hurts when you push on it. Now can you tell me what it is? Is it serious? I need to know if I can keep working.
DOCTOR: Okay. It does seem like there’s some tenderness along your spine. It doesn’t feel like anything acutely fractured or dislocated, but there’s definitely muscle tightness and some discomfort. It's difficult to say definitively without some imaging, but it could be a muscle strain or a minor sprain. Could you try to bend forward and touch your toes for me?
PATIENT: I cannot reach my toes. Not even close. It hurts too much. See? I am not a flexible man. I told you. Is that enough evidence? I need a doctor's note, if you want to know. For work. They will not believe me otherwise. Just tell me if I can keep working, and what I need to do. Now.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’ve likely strained your back muscles from the heavy lifting at work. While I can't definitively rule out anything without imaging, it doesn’t present as an emergency. I recommend taking it easy for a few days. Avoid heavy lifting as much as possible. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can help with the pain and inflammation. And applying ice or heat to your back can also provide some relief. Do you have any allergies to pain relievers?
PATIENT: No allergies. Ibuprofen is fine. I have used it before. But… taking it easy is not an option. I have to work. They need me. What if it gets worse? What if I permanently damage my back? Will I be able to work at all then? This is not helpful, Doctor. I need a solution, not… advice about resting. Do you think I need… an X-ray? Or some stronger medicine? Something to get me through the shift.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Kiwane. It’s good that you haven’t had any allergic reactions to ibuprofen. Given your concerns about working and the possibility of it getting worse, I would recommend an X-ray to rule out any underlying issues, like a fracture. It will give us a clearer picture of what's going on. I can write you a prescription for a short course of muscle relaxants to help with the pain and spasms, but those won’t fix the problem, and they can cause drowsiness. I also think it would be beneficial to see a physical therapist. They can teach you proper lifting techniques and exercises to strengthen your back and prevent future injuries. Would you like me to write you a prescription for the muscle relaxants and an order for the X-ray?
PATIENT: Yes. Please. The X-ray and the medicine. I suppose. If it will make them happy. And… physical therapy. If I have time. Though I doubt I will. Just… get it done quickly. I need to go back to work. I am losing money every minute I am here. And… can you write a note for my employer? Saying I saw a doctor? Something vague. About a back problem. They do not need details. Just… a note. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here are the prescriptions for the muscle relaxants, and the order for the X-ray. You can get those filled at the pharmacy, and schedule the X-ray at the imaging center down the street. And here’s the note for your employer. It states you’ve seen me for a back problem and are under my care. I strongly encourage you to follow up with a physical therapist. And please, be mindful of your back at work. Avoid heavy lifting as much as possible, and use proper lifting techniques. If the pain worsens, or if you experience any numbness or tingling in your legs, please come back immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you. I suppose. Now, if you will excuse me… I need to go. Hopefully this will be enough to get them off my back.
