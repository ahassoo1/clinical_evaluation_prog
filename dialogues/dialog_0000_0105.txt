DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kochubey. So, you're here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Um, right. The surgery. I… I think it’s about getting ready for the surgery. My wife helped me set this up, honestly. I don’t really remember all the details. It’s… a weight loss surgery, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Kochubey. It is weight loss surgery. Bariatric surgery, specifically. Scheduled for next month, as I see here. And you’re right to be here for a pre-operative assessment. Though, honestly, relying on your wife to “set it up” isn’t ideal. You need to be fully informed about what you’re agreeing to. Now, let’s start with the basics. Tell me, what specifically are you hoping to achieve with this surgery?
PATIENT: Well, I… I want to feel better, I guess. It’s hard to do things. Just… everyday things. I get tired easily, and my knees hurt a lot. My wife says I snore really loud too, which… I don’t remember much about that. I just want to be able to keep up with my grandkids, you know? That’s a big part of it. I want to play with them without getting winded. I don't really know what else to say, to be honest. It all happened so fast.
DOCTOR: “Feeling better” is rather vague, Mr. Kochubey. We need specifics. Okay. Tired easily… how long has that been going on?
PATIENT: Um… a long time, I think. Years, definitely. It’s just gotten worse recently. I used to be able to do more around the house, but now… even walking to the mailbox feels like a big deal. I don’t know… maybe the last five years? It’s hard to say exactly. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: It’s… something. Five years of progressive fatigue. And the knee pain – is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, mostly. It’s worse when I’ve been on my feet a lot, or if it’s cold outside. It’s a dull ache, usually. Not like a sharp pain. Sometimes it’s so bad I have to sit down. My wife gets me a cane sometimes, but I don't like using it. Feels old, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried anything for the pain?
PATIENT: Just… over-the-counter stuff. Ibuprofen, mostly. It helps a little, but not for long. And I don’t really want to take too much, I hear it’s bad for your stomach. My wife keeps telling me to see a doctor, but… well, I just haven’t. Until now, I guess. I just put it off.
DOCTOR: I see. Ibuprofen… self-treating for years. Right. Let’s move on. Do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of. I had my gallbladder out a long time ago, but that was years and years ago. And… I think I had high blood pressure once, but it went down when I started walking more. Well, trying to walk more. I don't really go to the doctor much, so… I wouldn’t really know if anything was wrong. My wife would know better. She always worries about these things.
DOCTOR: “Went down when you started walking more”?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor told me to walk more, and I tried. For a little while. And my wife took my blood pressure a few times, and it seemed better then. It was a long time ago, though. Maybe ten years ago? I really don't remember all the details. It was just a quick check-up. I just… I don't like going to the doctor. It always makes me anxious.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kochubey, you need to be more forthcoming. Relying on your wife’s blood pressure readings from ten years ago is not a medical history. Do you have any current medications you are taking?
PATIENT: No, nothing regular. Like I said, just ibuprofen when my knees bother me. Sometimes I take something for heartburn, but that’s only when I eat something spicy. It's… an antacid, I think? The pink kind. Do I need to remember the name? My wife buys it. She’s good at keeping track of these things. I’m sorry, I’m just not very good at remembering stuff.
DOCTOR: “The pink kind.” Right. And any allergies?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything that I can remember. Maybe a little itchy when I get mosquito bites, but that’s it. I think my wife said I was allergic to penicillin when I was a kid, but that was a long time ago. I don’t even remember taking it. Is that important?
DOCTOR: “A little itchy when you get mosquito bites” is not an allergy, Mr. Kochubey. And a possible penicillin allergy from childhood is important. We'll note that. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. My father smoked, and it gave him a lot of trouble. I always said I wouldn't touch it. And I don't drink much, either. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. Nothing regular. My wife doesn't really like it when I drink.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Um… well, my father, like I said, he had trouble with his lungs. From the smoking. And my mother… she had diabetes, I think. She was always tired, and she had to watch what she ate. And I think my brother has high blood pressure, but I haven’t seen him in years. It's hard to remember all the details. We don’t really talk much anymore.
DOCTOR: “Hard to remember all the details.” Mr. Kochubey, this is a pre-operative assessment. It requires accurate information. Now, before we proceed, I’m going to need your explicit consent to review any records your wife may have. It seems she is holding most of the relevant medical history. Do you agree to that?
PATIENT: Oh. Yeah, that's… that's fine. Whatever she has is probably more accurate than anything I can tell you. She’s always been good with that sort of thing. Yes, please. Review her records. That would be great. I just… I want to make sure everything goes okay with the surgery, you know? I trust her.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse retrieve any records your wife has provided. In the meantime, I’m going to conduct a brief physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go. Just let me know if I need to do anything. I’m not very good with medical stuff, as you can probably tell.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale. Your heart rate is slightly elevated, and there’s some diminished breath sound in the lower lobes. Any history of shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… hmm. Not really, not usually. Maybe when I’ve been doing a lot of walking, or if it’s really hot outside. But nothing I’ve ever thought to mention to a doctor. I just slow down when I get tired. I don't push myself too hard. Does that make sense? Is that bad?
DOCTOR: There’s some tenderness in the upper quadrants… and your abdomen is slightly distended. Any recent weight gain or loss?
PATIENT: Um… well, I've been gaining weight for years, honestly. It's just been getting harder and harder to lose it. I don’t really keep track of it, but I’d say I’ve probably gained at least ten pounds in the last year. Maybe more. That’s why I’m here, right? To lose some of it?
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal. Now, let me take a look at your knees. There’s crepitus and limited range of motion in both knees. Do you experience any swelling or locking in your knees?
PATIENT: Swelling… sometimes. When I’ve been on my feet a lot. And… locking, not really. More like… stiffness. It’s hard to bend them in the morning, or after I’ve been sitting for a long time. It takes a few minutes to loosen up. It doesn’t hurt all the time, but it’s definitely uncomfortable. They just… aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on this preliminary examination, and frankly, the limited information I’ve been able to gather, there are several concerns. Your elevated heart rate, diminished breath sounds, abdominal distension, and knee issues all require further investigation before we can proceed with surgery. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a chest X-ray, and knee X-rays. I also recommend a consultation with a cardiologist and a rheumatologist. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Whoa… that’s a lot. A cardiologist… and a… what was the other one? A rheuma… something? I understand… I think. It just… sounds complicated. Does this mean the surgery is off? I really want to get this done. I just… I want to feel better. Can we still do it?
DOCTOR: It doesn’t necessarily mean the surgery is off, Mr. Kochubey. It means we need to ensure you are a suitable candidate and that there are no underlying conditions that could compromise your safety. We're being thorough. The cardiologist will assess your heart health, and the rheumatologist will evaluate your knee issues. Until we have those results, I cannot authorize the surgery. I understand your desire to feel better, but safety is paramount. The nurse will schedule those appointments for you. In the meantime, please try to maintain a healthy diet and engage in light exercise, as tolerated. And I strongly recommend you have your wife present during your follow-up appointments. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Um… I guess not right now. It’s just… a lot to take in. My wife will definitely be there. She’s good at asking questions. I just hope everything turns out okay. Thank you, doctor. For everything. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
