DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astores. I’m Dr. Vanochten. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Dorman. Well, it’s this… weakness. It’s getting worse, you see. Been happening for a while now, but lately, it’s… harder to do things. Harder to walk, mostly. And my hands… they aren’t as strong as they used to be. It’s a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dorman. Weakness, getting progressively worse, mainly affecting your walking and hand strength. And it's been worrying you. Can you tell me when you first noticed this weakness starting?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me think… It wasn’t sudden, you see. It was… gradual. I’d say… maybe a year ago? Perhaps a little more. It started with just feeling a bit tired after walking, like my legs were heavy. I didn't think much of it at first, thought it was just getting old. But it hasn’t gone away, and now… well, now it’s harder to ignore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly a year ago, starting with fatigue in your legs after walking, and now progressing to noticeable difficulty. Is this weakness the same on both sides of your body, or is it worse on one side than the other?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. I think… it’s a little worse on my left side. Not a lot worse, but if I really focus on it… my left leg feels weaker, and my left hand… I drop things more often with that hand. It's subtle, though. Not something everyone would notice, I reckon. I just… feel it.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little more pronounced on the left side. Do you have any pain associated with this weakness, Dorman?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not really. That’s what’s so strange about it. It's not like a hurting feeling, it's just… things don’t work like they used to. It's more of a… heaviness, sometimes. And a bit of… clumsiness. But no pain, thankfully. My wife, Leilani, she worries enough as it is. I don't want to give her another thing to fret over.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, just weakness, heaviness, and clumsiness, primarily on the left side. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes… my vision gets a bit blurry. Not all the time, and it comes and goes. And I get tired easily, even when I haven't done much. More tired than usual, you see. And… oh! Sometimes I feel a bit dizzy. Not falling-down dizzy, just… a little bit off-balance. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain. Leilani says I sometimes slur my words a bit, but I don’t always notice.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision, fatigue, dizziness, and your wife has noticed some slurred speech. We’re building a good picture here, Dorman. Now, have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: No, not recently. Last cold I had was… oh, goodness… maybe last winter? Nothing major, just a little sniffle and a cough. Nothing like the flu, thank goodness. I try to stay healthy, you see. Leilani makes sure of that! Lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. But this weakness… it didn’t start after a cold or anything like that. It just… started.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent illness preceding the onset of weakness. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… yes, there is. I have… multiple sclerosis. That’s what the doctor told me years ago. It's been… quiet for a long time, though. I haven’t had any… flare-ups, as they call them, for many, many years. I thought it was… well, I thought it was just old age catching up with me. But now… I'm wondering if it’s coming back. I take no medicines for it, you see. The doctor said there wasn’t much they could do.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of multiple sclerosis, which has been quiet for many years. And you're not currently taking any medication for it. That’s very important information, Dorman. Do you recall when you were originally diagnosed with MS?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It was a long time ago. I was… maybe in my late 40s? Perhaps early 50s. It was in Honolulu, you see. I was working as a trainer for the football team then. The doctor did some tests… lots of poking and prodding… and that’s when he told me. It’s been… a long time. I don't remember all the details now. Just that he said I had MS and… well, to take it easy. That's why I'm a bit surprised it’s coming back after all this time.
DOCTOR: Okay, diagnosed in your late 40s/early 50s. Now, have you ever had any surgeries, Dorman?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… Yes, actually. I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was… goodness, probably 50 years ago or more. Other than that… no, not that I recall. Just the appendix. Nothing major, you see. It was a long time ago, and I healed up just fine. I've been pretty healthy otherwise, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendectomy many years ago. Let’s talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family with a history of MS, or any other neurological conditions?
PATIENT: That’s… a good question. My mother… she had some trouble walking when she got older, but the doctor said it was just arthritis. She was very, very active though, even when she was old. As for MS… not that I know of. No one ever talked about it. My father’s side… I didn’t know him very well. He passed away when I was young. So, not that I’m aware of. It might have been in the family, but no one ever said anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of MS or neurological conditions. And finally, before we move on to an exam, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I can eat anything, take any medicine. Leilani always checks, she worries about that too! I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Thank goodness for that, at least. So no, no allergies. I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve asked a lot of good questions.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Thank you for that information, Dorman. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to get a better idea of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Please, go ahead. I’ll just sit here, and do whatever you need me to do. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, great. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. I’ll also do a quick neurological exam. Just follow my instructions as best you can. Let's start with your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… Good. Now another one… and out… Okay, everything sounds clear so far. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes… Could you please relax your legs for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Relax my legs… like this? Just let them hang? Alright. Go ahead, Doctor. I'll try to stay as still as possible. It’s a bit hard sometimes, you see, with the weakness. But I’ll do my best.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I'm going to check your strength. Could you please squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I’ll try to squeeze as hard as I can. There. Is that alright? I'm trying, Doctor, but it's a bit hard. My left hand… it doesn't feel as strong as my right.
DOCTOR: Alright, I notice that. We’ll document that. Now, let's try some coordination tests. Could you please touch your finger to your nose with your eyes open?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. Like this? It's a bit shaky, Doctor. My left arm… it doesn’t move as smoothly as my right. It’s hard to explain, but it feels… off. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. And finally, I'm going to check your gait, which means I'd like you to stand up and walk a few steps for me. Please walk normally, and I’ll observe how you move. Do you need any assistance standing?
PATIENT: No, thank you. I can stand on my own. Like this, Doctor? It's a bit… slow, I reckon. I have to think about each step. My left leg feels… unsteady. I don’t want to fall.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Dorman. Please, have a seat. That was very helpful. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings – the diminished reflexes on your left side, the weakness in your left hand, the slight clumsiness with coordination, and the unsteady gait – it does seem that your MS is likely contributing to these symptoms. It's good that you've been symptom-free for so long, but it's not uncommon for MS to have periods of remission and relapse. Now, to get a clearer picture, I'd like to order an MRI of your brain and spinal cord. This will allow us to see if there's any new activity in your central nervous system. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An MRI… Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it will help to understand what’s going on, then yes, I am comfortable with that. You mentioned new activity? Does that mean it’s getting worse? I’m a bit worried now, to be honest. It’s been so long… I was hoping it was just old age. But if it is the MS… what does that mean?
DOCTOR: It's understandable that you're worried, Dorman. The MRI will help us determine if there is new inflammation or changes in your brain and spinal cord. New activity doesn’t automatically mean it’s getting significantly worse, but it does help us understand the current state of your MS. Based on your symptoms and history, it seems most likely this is a relapse. We can then discuss treatment options to manage the relapse and potentially slow down the progression of the disease. There are several medications available that can help, and we can tailor a plan specifically for you. Before we proceed with the MRI, do you have any metal implants or pacemakers?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. No metal implants, no pacemakers. Nothing like that. Just my old bones, I’m afraid! So, no, nothing to worry about with the MRI. What happens next? Do I need to do anything to prepare? And… what if the MRI shows something bad? I’m trying to stay positive, but it’s hard not to worry, you see. It's been so long since I had to think about all this.
DOCTOR: Okay, good, no metal implants. Before the MRI, you’ll need to remove any jewelry, glasses, and anything with metal. The technician will give you detailed instructions. As for what happens if the MRI shows something concerning, we’ll discuss the results thoroughly. If there is new activity, we’ll consider treatment options like corticosteroids to reduce inflammation, and potentially disease-modifying therapies to slow the progression of the MS. I want to reassure you that we have several effective treatments available, and we’ll work together to find the best plan for you. It's important to remember that MS affects everyone differently, and there’s a wide range of possible outcomes. In the meantime, I'm going to write a referral for the MRI and also a prescription for physical therapy. The physical therapist can help you with strength, balance, and coordination exercises. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Dorman?
PATIENT: Physical therapy sounds like a good idea. Strength and balance… yes, I could certainly use that. Yes… one question. You said "disease-modifying therapies." What does that mean, exactly? Will it cure the MS? I know it's a long shot, but… is there any chance of getting back to how I was before? Before the weakness started?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Dorman. Disease-modifying therapies, or DMTs, are medications that aim to slow down the progression of MS and reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. They don’t currently offer a cure for MS, unfortunately. Think of them as trying to control the disease activity, rather than eliminating it entirely. As for getting back to how you were before, that’s a difficult question to answer. It depends on the extent of the damage that has already been done, and how well you respond to treatment. With physical therapy and appropriate medication, many people with MS are able to maintain a good quality of life and continue to function independently for many years. We’ll closely monitor your progress and adjust the treatment plan as needed. I will also provide you with some information about MS and support groups in the area. It can be very helpful to connect with others who are going through similar experiences. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish, Dorman?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and answer all my questions. I was very worried at first, but I feel a bit better now, knowing what’s going on and what we can do about it. Thank you again. I’ll see you after the MRI, then?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Dorman. I’m glad I could help ease your worries. Yes, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment after your MRI to discuss the results and create a treatment plan. My nurse will help you with that before you leave. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care, Dorman, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
PATIENT: It was nice to meet you too, Doctor. Thank you again for your help.
