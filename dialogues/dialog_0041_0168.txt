DOCTOR: Hi Esthela, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. It’s… Esthela Pandolfi, yes. Well, it's a rather delicate matter, truthfully. I’m seeing someone, and I thought it prudent to have a… check-up, shall we say, before things progress further. One must be certain, you understand. It’s not something one takes lightly at my age.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Being proactive about your health is very smart. It sounds like you're thinking about sexually transmitted infections, or STIs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, Doctor, must you be so… blunt? It’s not that I suspect anything untoward, but one simply wants to be thorough. And frankly, I wouldn’t dream of discussing such… intimate details with someone I’ve barely met. It's more about peace of mind, really. Ensuring everything is as it should be, before… well, before committing to anything serious. I have standards, you see. Very high standards.
DOCTOR: Of course, I apologize if I was too forward. You're absolutely right to want to be thorough and ensure everything is as it should be. “Peace of mind” is a perfect way to put it. So, to be clear, you're looking for a general health check-up, with a focus on screening for potential infections, just to be safe before starting a new relationship?
PATIENT: Precisely. A general assessment, you might say. And perhaps a little reassurance. One can never be too careful, Doctor. Especially not these days. I simply want to be certain I'm… well, presenting the best possible version of myself, and that there are no… unwelcome surprises. It's about respect, really – respect for myself and for the person I’m seeing. And a certain level of… propriety.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. That's very sensible. Alright, we can certainly do a thorough check-up. To start, can you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? I suppose I’ve always been relatively healthy. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox – all that. No serious conditions, thank goodness. My mother always emphasized a good diet and plenty of rest. And I've been a loyal Medicare patient for several years now, so I'm sure everything is on record. But I did have a rather unpleasant bout of the flu last winter. Kept me bedridden for a week, it did. Otherwise, quite robust, really. I don't smoke, I rarely drink, and I try to maintain a reasonable level of activity. Though my knees aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. The record does show the flu diagnosis from last winter. Any other significant illnesses or hospitalizations I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. A touch of arthritis in my hands, but nothing debilitating. And I had my gallbladder removed… oh, goodness, must be twenty years ago now. It was a rather minor procedure, really. I was back on my feet in no time. Everything else has been quite… unremarkable, truthfully. I pride myself on maintaining a healthy lifestyle, Doctor. It’s terribly important, you see. One doesn’t want to be a burden on anyone. Especially not at my age.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal twenty years ago, and arthritis in your hands. That’s good to know. Have you had any surgeries besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Just a minor tonsillectomy when I was a child, but that was ages ago. Really, Doctor, I’ve been quite fortunate in terms of my health. I’ve always been careful about what I eat and how I live, and I’ve been diligent about seeing my doctor for regular check-ups. I suppose that's why I’m in such good condition now. Though, of course, one can never be too cautious. Especially not when one is considering… a more permanent arrangement.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. It sounds like you’ve done a wonderful job taking care of yourself. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, just a few little things. I take a daily multivitamin, of course. And I take something for my arthritis, a small pill. Ibuprofen, I believe. Just when my hands are particularly achy, you understand. Nothing serious. And sometimes I take something for indigestion, when I eat something… rich. But that’s infrequent, really. I try to avoid relying on medication whenever possible. I prefer natural remedies, when I can. Though, one must be pragmatic, you see. Sometimes a little assistance is necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin daily, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and antacids as needed for indigestion. Roughly how often would you say you take the ibuprofen and antacids?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, not very often at all. The ibuprofen, perhaps once or twice a month, if that. When the weather is particularly damp, you see. It aggravates my joints. And the antacids… even less frequent. Maybe once every few months, after a particularly indulgent meal. I'm generally very careful about my diet, so I rarely experience indigestion. I truly don’t rely on them, Doctor. I simply like to be prepared, you understand. One never knows when a little relief might be necessary. Especially when one is… entertaining guests.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, not a single one. I've always been quite fortunate in that regard. I can eat anything and everything, without any ill effects. And I've never experienced an allergic reaction to any medication, thank goodness. I truly believe a healthy lifestyle contributes to a robust immune system, you see. I pride myself on being resilient, Doctor. I simply don't have time for allergies or sensitivities. Especially not now. One has to maintain a certain level of… composure, you understand. Especially when one is… making important decisions.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. Alright, just a few more questions. Now, let's talk a little about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no, absolutely not. I find the very idea… distasteful. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol. Perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on a special occasion, but that’s it. And recreational drugs? Heavens no. I find them utterly reprehensible. I simply don't associate with that sort of behavior. I pride myself on maintaining a respectable lifestyle, Doctor. And frankly, I wouldn't dream of jeopardizing my health with such… vices. Especially not now. One has to be… exemplary, you understand. Especially when one is… building a future.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And finally, do you have any sexual partners currently?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, that is… rather a personal question, isn’t it? Let us simply say that I am… exploring a potential relationship. A gentleman caller, if you will. It is early stages, you understand. And I felt it prudent to have a check-up, as we discussed. One must be… responsible, you see. Especially when one is considering… a long-term commitment. I wouldn't expect you to delve into the specifics, Doctor. It's simply… a matter of precaution. A safeguard, if you will.
DOCTOR: Of course, I apologize if I overstepped. You're absolutely right to prioritize your health and be responsible. So, to clarify, you’re newly dating, and that’s why you’re interested in STI screening?
PATIENT: Precisely. It’s not a matter of… distrust, you understand. It’s simply a matter of due diligence. And frankly, I expect the same level of… consideration from him. It's about mutual respect and… peace of mind. One doesn't want to embark on a new chapter with… uncertainties. And frankly, at my age, one has to be particularly careful. It’s not something one can simply… dismiss. One must be… thorough, you see. Especially when one is… envisioning a future together.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's perfectly understandable. Well, let's proceed with a physical exam, then. It will be fairly standard, just to get a baseline and ensure everything is as it should be. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is perfectly agreeable. I trust your professional judgment, of course. Though, perhaps we could avoid… unnecessary exposure. I'm rather particular about my modesty, you understand. I’m sure you can appreciate that. And I would prefer to be… fully clothed whenever possible. A thorough assessment is important, naturally, but discretion is also… paramount. Especially when one is… a woman of a certain age.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can absolutely respect your preferences and minimize exposure. I’ll explain everything as I go, and we’ll tailor the exam to your comfort level. We’ll start with your blood pressure and pulse, then listen to your heart and lungs. I'll also check your abdomen and reflexes. I will only perform an examination if you are comfortable with it. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… reasonable. Blood pressure and pulse are perfectly acceptable. Listening to my heart and lungs is also… agreeable. And checking my abdomen, if it’s not too… invasive, is also acceptable. As for reflexes… I suppose that’s less objectionable than some things. I simply want to be… comfortable, you understand. And I trust you to be… professional and discreet. Especially when one is… entrusting you with such personal matters. I think that will suffice for now. We can reassess later, if necessary.
DOCTOR: Very good. Let's start with your blood pressure, then. Just relax your arm and breathe normally. Your blood pressure is 138 over 82. That’s slightly elevated, but not cause for immediate concern. We can monitor it over time. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart and lungs sound clear and healthy. No abnormalities detected. Now, let's check your abdomen. Can you lie down on your back for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is… reassuring to hear. I do tend to get a little anxious at medical appointments, so perhaps that elevated reading is simply due to nerves. I’ll try to relax more. I am… prepared, Doctor. Proceed when you are ready. Though, do be gentle, if you would. My abdomen is… rather sensitive. And please, maintain a professional demeanor. I trust you to do so. It’s simply… a matter of respect, you understand. Especially when one is… entrusting you with such a delicate examination.
DOCTOR: Okay, your abdomen feels soft and there are no masses or tenderness. Everything seems normal here. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are normal. Everything seems to be in good working order. Based on this brief exam, everything appears to be normal. However, to rule out any potential STIs, I recommend a blood test and a urine sample. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is… a sensible precaution. A blood test and urine sample are perfectly acceptable. I would feel much more… at ease knowing we have addressed that potential concern. I simply want to be… thorough, you understand. And I trust your professional judgment. Though, perhaps we could discuss the… specifics of the testing procedure? I would prefer to be… fully informed before proceeding. And I would appreciate it if you could maintain a… discreet and respectful demeanor throughout the process. Especially when one is… entrusting you with such personal matters. It’s simply… a matter of politeness, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course. Absolutely. Let me explain everything in detail. The blood test will involve a small sample of blood being drawn from your arm. It will be sent to the lab to screen for common STIs like syphilis, HIV, and gonorrhea. The urine sample will also be analyzed for gonorrhea and chlamydia. The entire process is relatively quick and painless. There may be a slight pinch when the blood is drawn, but it should only last a few seconds. We’ll send the samples to the lab, and the results should be available within a few days. I will contact you as soon as they are available. Do you have any questions about the procedure?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that explanation is… quite thorough. It sounds… manageable. And I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything in such detail. I suppose… the slight pinch is… tolerable. As long as the process is quick and… discreet. Though, I do have one… stipulation. I would prefer to have the results… communicated to me personally. A phone call, perhaps? I would prefer not to have them… left on a voicemail or… discussed with anyone else. It’s simply… a matter of privacy, you understand. Especially when one is… entrusting you with such personal information. It’s a delicate matter, Doctor, and I trust you to respect my… sensibilities.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I completely understand. I will personally call you with the results, and I will not leave a message or discuss your results with anyone else. Your privacy is my utmost priority, and I will treat this information with the strictest confidentiality. We’ll have the lab technician come in to draw the blood and collect the urine sample. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is… acceptable. A lab technician is perfectly fine. As long as they are… professional and discreet, of course. And I trust they will maintain the same level of… confidentiality as you. I suppose… let us proceed. The sooner this is… completed, the sooner I can have… peace of mind. It’s a delicate matter, Doctor, and I appreciate your… understanding and discretion. Especially when one is… entrusting you with such personal matters. It’s simply… a matter of respect, you understand.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will let the lab technician know to be especially mindful of your preferences. They will be in shortly. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that is… all. You have addressed all of my concerns, and I feel much more… at ease now. I appreciate your… patience and understanding. And I trust that everything will proceed… smoothly. I simply want to be… thorough, you understand. And I appreciate your… discretion and professionalism. Especially when one is… entrusting you with such personal matters. It’s simply… a matter of respect, you understand. I believe that is… all for now.
DOCTOR: Very good. I’ll let the lab technician in now. They will explain the process to you. If you have any questions or concerns at any point, please don’t hesitate to ask. I’ll be right here if you need me. Thank you for coming in today, Esthela. I hope you have a good rest of your day.
