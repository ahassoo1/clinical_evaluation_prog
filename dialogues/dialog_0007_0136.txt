DOCTOR: Hi Lucia, welcome. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Thank you. Um… it’s my… how you say? Belching. I belch a lot. It’s… embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Okay, belching – excessive gas. I understand it can be quite bothersome and embarrassing. And it's good you came in to get it checked out. Let's try to figure out what's going on. How long has this been happening, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe… two months? I think so. It started slow, just a little after I eat. But now… almost all the time. Not always, but… a lot. It’s worse when I’m nervous, I think.
DOCTOR: Two months, and it's been gradually getting worse. And you've noticed it's particularly bad when you're feeling anxious?
PATIENT: Yes. When I have to talk to people… or if I am late for something. Little bit stressed, you know? It’s… not good. I try to not eat so much before I have to do things, but… it doesn’t always help.
DOCTOR: Okay, so stress seems to be a definite trigger. And you’ve tried adjusting your eating habits a bit. Can you describe what the belching feels like?
PATIENT: It’s… just normal belching, I guess? Like when you drink something fizzy too fast. But it happens even when I don’t drink anything fizzy! It doesn't hurt, just… loud. And it feels like there’s too much air in my stomach. Sometimes I feel… full, even if I haven’t eaten much.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's not painful, just frequent and associated with a feeling of fullness and bloating. No nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not sick. Just… the belching. And sometimes a little… I don’t know the word… uncomfortable in my stomach. Like it’s too big. Not bad uncomfortable, just… aware of it, you know? Like something is there.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a sense of fullness and awareness of your stomach. And it's been happening for about two months now, worsening over time, and related to stress. Let's talk about what you’ve been eating. Anything specific that seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don’t think so. I eat… normal Cuban food. Rice, beans, chicken, sometimes pork. I like fried plantains… maybe those? But I eat them all the time and it doesn’t always happen after. I drink a lot of water. And coffee. A lot of coffee.
DOCTOR: Okay, a typical Cuban diet, lots of water, and quite a bit of coffee. Coffee could definitely be a contributing factor. It can stimulate acid production and sometimes contribute to bloating. Do you have any other symptoms – heartburn, indigestion, changes in your bowel movements, weight loss?
PATIENT: No heartburn. No… what you say? Indigestion? No. My stomach just… feels normal, except for the air. And no, I haven’t lost any weight. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I work long hours… I’m an industrial engineering technician, so it’s busy. But not sick-tired, just… work-tired. Bowel movements are normal, I think. Sorry, it’s… private.
DOCTOR: No worries, it’s all part of getting a good understanding of what’s going on. So, no heartburn, no indigestion, normal bowel movements, and just general tiredness from work. Let's quickly go over some basic medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications or food?
PATIENT: No allergies. Never had one. I can eat anything. I'm pretty sure. And I don't take any medicine. Just… sometimes a little pain reliever for my back, if it hurts. But not often.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, and you don’t take any regular medications. Good. Have you had any previous surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never. And no serious illnesses. I get colds sometimes, like everyone, but nothing… big. Just normal things. I’m usually pretty healthy. I think. This belching is just… strange.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries, no serious illnesses, and generally healthy. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your stomach, and I'll feel your abdomen, just to make sure everything feels normal. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best. I trust you, Doctor. Just… be gentle? My stomach is a little sensitive right now, I think. From all the… air.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m not feeling any tenderness or masses. Your bowel sounds are normal – I can hear them moving. It doesn't seem like anything acutely concerning is happening. Based on what you've told me, and the physical exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing excessive gas, possibly related to your diet and stress levels. Coffee can definitely contribute to this. It's not something that's immediately alarming, but it's definitely bothersome. I’m going to recommend a few things. First, try keeping a food diary for a week, noting what you eat and when, and when the belching occurs. This can help us identify any specific triggers. Second, try reducing your coffee intake gradually. Third, consider some stress-reduction techniques, like deep breathing exercises or mindfulness. There are lots of free resources online. Finally, an over-the-counter medication like simethicone could help reduce the gas. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. I can try that. A food diary… okay. Less coffee will be hard, but I can try. And I will look up those… breathing things. Simethicone… I will ask the pharmacist. So… it’s not something serious? Just… too much air?
DOCTOR: That's right. Based on everything, it doesn't sound like anything serious. It’s likely related to gas buildup, and we can usually manage that with dietary and lifestyle changes. I want you to monitor your symptoms, though. If you develop any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, or blood in your stool, please come back immediately. Those could be signs of something more serious. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You made me feel much better. I was worried it was something… bad. I will try those things you said. And… less coffee. Maybe.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lucia. I'm glad I could reassure you. Remember, I'm here if you have any concerns. I’ll write down these recommendations for you, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to see how you're doing. Sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. A follow-up… good. So I can tell you if the food diary helps? And if the… breathing things work? Thank you again, Doctor. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We can discuss your findings from the food diary and how you're coping with stress during the follow-up. Here's the paper with the recommendations. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions before your appointment. Take care, Lucia. And good luck with the coffee reduction!
