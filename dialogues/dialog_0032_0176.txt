DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. I am Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. Now, I understand you’re here today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. Well, it’s…the hiccups. They just won’t stop. It’s been over two days now, and it’s really starting to bother me. It’s not like normal hiccups, you know? They come and go, but they’re constant mostly.
DOCTOR: Two days, you say…and you describe them as constant, rather than intermittent. That is unusual. Could you elaborate on that a bit?
PATIENT: Unusual is… a good way to put it. It's not like a hiccup, then quiet, then another. It’s more like… a feeling in my chest, and it makes me… jerk. And then a hiccup. But even when I don’t actually hiccup, I feel the jerk. It’s exhausting, honestly. And it's… uncomfortable. Sort of like a little flutter, but stronger, and in the wrong place. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A "jerk" with or without the actual hiccup…and a fluttering sensation. Interesting. And where precisely do you feel this "flutter," Ms. Redeye?
PATIENT: It's...hard to explain. It's mostly right here, in the center of my chest, kind of low. And sometimes it feels like it goes up into my throat a little bit, but not always. It’s not painful, exactly, just… annoying. And a little scary, if I’m honest. I've never had hiccups feel like this before.
DOCTOR: I see. And has anything specific occurred in the two days preceding this onset?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. No, not really. It wasn't after anything stressful or anything. Just…woke up Tuesday morning, and they were there. I had a normal dinner Monday night – some grilled fish and vegetables. Didn’t drink anything unusual. I went to bed, everything was fine. Then Tuesday morning… hiccups. And they haven't really gone away since. I had a glass of water with breakfast, like always. Nothing out of the ordinary, I promise you. It’s what’s so strange about it!
DOCTOR: Alright. No inciting event…fish and vegetables. I see. And just to clarify, Ms. Redeye, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside these hiccups?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. No pain, no fever, no shortness of breath. Not feeling dizzy or nauseous. Just… the hiccups. And that weird fluttering feeling, of course. I've been eating normally, sleeping okay, although it’s a bit hard to get comfortable with them, you know? I haven't noticed anything else being off at all. I really don’t understand what could be causing this.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I'm going to perform a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay. Alright. Sounds good, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to do anything special. It's just… I don't usually get sick, so this is all a bit new to me.
DOCTOR: If you could take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Heart sounds are regular, rate approximately 72. No murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No guarding or rebound tenderness. No significant findings on initial examination.
PATIENT: Well…that's good to hear, I guess. But… if everything sounds okay, why am I still hiccuping? Is there anything else you can check? It feels like something is wrong, even if you can't see it. I just…I really want this to stop. It’s starting to drive me crazy.
DOCTOR: While the physical examination hasn’t revealed any immediate cause, persistent hiccups—especially those lasting over 48 hours—do warrant further investigation. It is unlikely to be a serious issue, but we need to rule out any underlying causes. Let me access your EHR…Ah, you have not had a recent CBC or CMP. We’ll start there, to assess your overall blood work. And, given the location you describe, an EKG would be prudent to rule out any cardiac irregularities, although I suspect it's not that. It’s best to be thorough, Ms. Redeye. We'll draw some blood and schedule the EKG.
PATIENT: Okay, that… that sounds good. Blood work and an EKG. Thorough is good, I suppose. I just… I hope it's not anything serious. And I hope it doesn't take too long to figure out. I have a commitment next week that I really can't miss, and I can’t be hiccuping then! Is the blood draw going to be painful? I’m not good with needles.
DOCTOR: It's highly unlikely to be anything serious, Ms. Redeye. Most hiccups resolve on their own. The blood draw is generally well-tolerated. A small pinch, and then it’s over. The phlebotomist is quite skilled. I’ll write the orders now, and you can proceed to the lab and EKG department. I’ll review the results as soon as they are available.
PATIENT: Okay. A pinch. I can handle a pinch. Lab and EKG department. Right. Thank you, Doctor Pipkorn. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this, even if it seems… silly. I just want to feel normal again. Can I get a copy of the orders to give to the lab and EKG people?
DOCTOR: Here you are. Everything is listed there. The lab and EKG technicians will guide you. Once those are completed, please return to the clinic for follow-up, and we'll discuss the results. And try to relax, Ms. Redeye. Excessive anxiety will not assist the resolution of your condition. .
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you. I will try to relax. .
