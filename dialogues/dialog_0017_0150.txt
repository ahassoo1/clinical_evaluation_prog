DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I am Dr. Blim. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, I don't have a lot of time for this. I'm 51, and I want to be very clear – I don't want any…complications. I want to get pregnant, and I want it to be easy. I've heard things, you know? Friends having trouble, all sorts of…procedures. I'd like to avoid all of that, if possible. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: “Easy” is rarely a word I associate with reproduction, Ms. Shteynberg. However, we can certainly discuss your options and assess your baseline health to maximize your chances of a successful pregnancy. Now, let’s start with a bit of background. Have you been trying for a specific amount of time?
PATIENT: Trying? No. Not actively trying. I just…assume things should still work. I’m in good shape, I keep myself fit. I cycle, obviously. I haven’t exactly been…scheduling anything. I just thought I'd come get a check-up before it becomes a problem, unlike some people. Is that a reasonable thing to do, Doctor? Or do I need a detailed timetable of…activity to satisfy you?
DOCTOR: It is prudent to assess your reproductive health beforehand, Ms. Shteynberg, though a detailed “timetable” isn’t necessary. However, your assumption that things “should still work” requires some evaluation. We need to determine if there are any underlying factors that could hinder conception. Have you ever been pregnant before?
PATIENT: Yes, once. A long time ago. It…didn’t work out. My husband at the time…well, that’s beside the point. It was…complicated. And frankly, I don’t enjoy revisiting unpleasant memories. Does that one pregnancy being…unsuccessful change anything? I’m not interested in dwelling on the past, Doctor. I’m focused on the future.
DOCTOR: A prior pregnancy, regardless of outcome, does provide some useful information. However, we will focus on your current health. Do you know if you have any medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid issues – anything at all?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I keep myself very healthy, as I said. I eat well, I exercise… I’m not one of those people who’s constantly at the doctor’s office complaining about every little ache and pain. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a bit insulted you're even asking. I wouldn't be here if I thought I was unwell. Are you suggesting I'm…old and falling apart?
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I am simply gathering information to provide you with the most appropriate care. Age is a factor in fertility, and it's my responsibility to assess all potential variables. Now, let’s move on. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Good heavens, no. I don't believe in poisoning my body with all those…chemicals. A bit of vitamin D in the winter, perhaps. And maybe a pain reliever if I really overdo it on the cycling, but that’s infrequent. Herbal supplements? Don't be ridiculous. I prefer…natural methods. Honestly, Doctor, you seem to be implying I'm some sort of…hypochondriac. I assure you, I am perfectly capable of maintaining my own health.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Absolutely none. I’ve eaten everything, been everywhere. I’m very…robust, Doctor. I don't spend my life wrapped in cotton wool. Honestly, are you going to ask me about my childhood next? This is becoming quite…tedious. I came here for a straightforward check-up, not a life story interrogation.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, while I appreciate your…robustness, a thorough medical history is essential. Now, let's discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, infertility issues?
PATIENT: Oh, now we’re getting to the unpleasant stuff. My mother…she had some problems, yes. But it was a long time ago, and frankly, it's not something I like to talk about. Cancer, I think. And my aunt…some sort of hormonal thing. But it was all very complicated, and I wasn't particularly close to either of them. It’s hardly relevant, Doctor. I am not my mother or my aunt. Are you attempting to find something wrong with me? This is quite…distressing. I think I’d like to stop here. Perhaps this wasn’t such a good idea after all.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shteynberg. I can perform a basic physical exam to assess your overall health. It will include blood pressure, heart and lung auscultation, and a pelvic exam to check the reproductive organs. I must advise you, however, that without a more complete history and potential lab work, I cannot provide a definitive assessment of your fertility potential. Would you consent to the exam?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I came here for information, not an…invasion. I’ve clearly wasted my time. You seem determined to find something wrong with me, and frankly, I find your entire approach rather…condescending. I think I’ll manage my own reproductive health, thank you very much. I don’t need a doctor to tell me what’s wrong with me. Goodbye, Doctor. .
