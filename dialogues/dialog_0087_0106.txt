DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, finally. It took long enough to get an appointment. This foot of mine is just dreadful. It's been bothering me for… oh, goodness, a good while now. A sore, really. A nasty one. And it won't heal. It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be very frustrating when something doesn’t heal as it should. Could you tell me a little more about this sore?
PATIENT: Frustrating doesn’t begin to cover it. It's on my foot, naturally. The… left one, I believe. And it's quite deep. It started as a little thing, a blister, maybe? From my shoes, I expect. But it just… got worse. I’ve tried creams, you know, the ones you get at the store. Didn't do a thing. Honestly, I don’t know why I bothered.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a sore on your left foot that started as a blister and hasn't responded to over-the-counter creams. Do you recall when this first started – even a rough estimate would be helpful?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… I'm not good with dates, never have been. Let me think… it must be… oh, at least six months. Maybe more. It was before the holidays, certainly. Before Christmas, anyway. Yes, definitely before Christmas. Last Christmas. So… six months? Perhaps seven? I do know it's been long enough to be very irritating.
DOCTOR: Alright, approximately six to seven months. And you've been applying over-the-counter creams during that time?
PATIENT: Yes, for a while. The… Polysporin, I think it was? And some other one. The ones my daughter brought over. She means well, that girl, but she always thinks she knows best. Anyway, I put them on for a few weeks, maybe. Didn't seem to do a lick of good, so I stopped. What’s the point of wasting money, I always say?
DOCTOR: That's fair. And has anything else changed with the sore recently?
PATIENT: Well, it's gotten… smellier, if you must know. And it sometimes… weeps. A little bit. Not a flood, mind you, but a dampness. And my granddaughter says it looks… red. I don’t pay much attention to it myself, to be honest. I just want it gone. It's embarrassing, wearing sandals and everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cannington. The odor, weeping, and redness are concerning. Have you noticed any pain associated with the sore?
PATIENT: Pain? Well, yes, of course there’s pain! What did you expect? It’s an open sore! It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… throbbing. Especially when I walk. And if anything rubs against it. I try to avoid that, naturally. But sometimes it's unavoidable. Especially when I’m… doing things.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any fever, chills, or redness/swelling around the sore itself, extending beyond the immediate area?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I haven't felt feverish. Chills, no. Though it is often cool in the house. My husband always liked it that way, bless his soul. And swelling… hmm. I haven’t really looked at it closely, to be honest. Why would I? It's just… there. I suppose there’s a little puffiness around the edges, but I wouldn’t call it swelling. Not like a bee sting, certainly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'd like to take a quick look at your foot if that's alright. It will help me get a better understanding of what's going on. I have gloves and everything, of course. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Well, finally. I was wondering when you were going to look at it. Yes, go ahead. But don’t be too rough. It’s quite tender, you know. And please, don't take too long. I have things to do this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington. I'm just going to take a look now. I see some redness and drainage around the sore, and the skin is a little soft. Your pulses are a bit weak, but present. It appears there may be some underlying infection. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, goodness. Let me think… I used to be allergic to bee stings, when I was a girl. But that was a long time ago. And I think I had a reaction to some sort of… ointment, years ago. But I can't remember what it was. My daughter keeps all my medication list. She’s very organized. And bossy. Do you know her? She brings me here.
DOCTOR: I understand. Knowing about the bee sting allergy is helpful. We will be careful. It sounds like your daughter is very involved in your care. Given the appearance of the sore and your description, I suspect there’s an infection present. To get a better idea of what we’re dealing with, I’d like to order a culture of the wound to identify the specific bacteria causing the infection. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… culture? What does that involve? Will it hurt? And what will it tell you? I don’t like things poked and prodded, you know. And I don’t want anything expensive. Medicare doesn’t cover everything, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s a very good question, Ms. Cannington. A culture involves taking a small sample of the drainage from the sore with a swab. It will sting a little bit, but it's very quick. It won't take long at all. It helps us identify the type of bacteria causing the infection so we can choose the right antibiotic to treat it. It’s covered by Medicare, and it’s important for getting you feeling better. It’s a standard test, and we’ll get the results back in a few days. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Well… a few days isn’t too long, I suppose. And if it’s covered by Medicare… alright. But be gentle, mind you. I don’t want any fuss. And please, don’t keep me waiting. I have a luncheon to attend next week.
DOCTOR: I'll be as gentle as possible, Ms. Cannington. Okay, all done. Now, while we're waiting for the culture results, I recommend keeping the wound clean and dry. We can provide you with some special dressings to help with that. I'm also going to prescribe a course of oral antibiotics to start today, just to get ahead of the infection. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Antibiotics, alright. As long as they don’t have any… side effects. I read about those side effects. Terrible things. And don’t prescribe anything that will interact with my blood pressure medication. My daughter keeps track of all that, too. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Cannington. I will be very careful to prescribe an antibiotic that won’t interact with your blood pressure medication. I'm going to prescribe cephalexin 500mg three times a day for seven days. It’s generally well-tolerated, but common side effects can include nausea or diarrhea. If you experience either of those, please call the office. I’m also going to send a prescription to your pharmacy for special wound dressings and a topical antibiotic ointment to use in addition to the oral medication. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Cephalexin… alright. I suppose. As long as it doesn't make me sick. And what do I do with these dressings? I’ve never used anything like that before. My daughter usually handles all this.
DOCTOR: The wound care nurse will go over the specifics with you before you leave, but it’s fairly straightforward. It involves gently cleaning the wound with mild soap and water, applying the topical ointment, and then covering it with the dressing. We'll make sure you have everything you need and clear instructions before you leave. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to check on your progress and review the culture results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A wound care nurse, you say? Well, that’s something, I suppose. More people poking and prodding. But if it gets this thing healed… alright. One week. I can remember that. Christmas is coming up, so I have to be able to walk! Alright. Let’s just get this over with.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I will have the nurse come in to speak with you about the wound care instructions. In the meantime, do you have any other questions or concerns for me?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just get this thing healed, that’s all I ask. And tell that nurse to be gentle. I’ve had a long life, and I don't need any unnecessary discomfort. And make sure Medicare is covering everything! My daughter will be asking.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Cannington. We’ll do everything we can to get you feeling better with as little discomfort as possible. The nurse will be in shortly. We'll verify all insurance coverage before you leave. Thank you for coming in today. If anything changes or if you have any concerns before your appointment next week, please don’t hesitate to call the office. .
