DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Saying my cholesterol is a little high. Hyper… something, the paper said. I don’t really understand all that stuff, but it sounded like I should come talk to someone. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: Okay, a letter from the lab regarding your cholesterol. Hyperlipidemia – that’s the word you’re likely seeing. It simply means you have higher than optimal levels of cholesterol in your blood. It’s very common, and often manageable. To get a better understanding, let’s talk a little bit about your health history. First, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions before, like diabetes or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life actually. I’ve had the usual colds, of course, and a broken wrist when I was a kid – fell off my bicycle. But nothing serious. No diabetes, no heart problems… the doctors always said my heart was strong. I do remember one doctor mentioning something about my blood pressure being a little high, maybe ten years ago? But they said to watch my salt intake, and it went down on its own. I haven’t had it checked in a while, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know – a generally healthy history is excellent. And the past issue with your blood pressure is helpful information. We'll definitely want to check that today. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, I haven’t. Never had any surgeries. Not even my tonsils out! I always thought I was lucky to avoid all that. I did have a really bad toothache once, and needed a root canal, but that doesn’t count as surgery, does it? Just a lot of drilling, and then a crown. Everything's fine now, though. No problems with my teeth anymore.
DOCTOR: No, a root canal doesn’t count as surgery. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, like I said earlier. And she had some heart trouble later in life, I think. She was in her eighties when it started, though. My father… he was healthy as a horse, really. Never sick a day in his life, until the very end. He died of old age, mostly. I have a brother, but I haven’t seen him in years. I don’t really know much about his health. He lives in Australia, you see. We don't talk often. Is it important to know about him?
DOCTOR: It's good to know about anyone in your immediate family, but it sounds like your mother’s history of high blood pressure is the most relevant. We'll keep that in mind. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I work as an aerospace engineer, so I mostly sit at a desk all day. It's not very active, I'll admit. I try to walk when I can, but it's hard when you're designing rockets, you know? I live alone, so I cook most of my own meals. I try to eat healthy - lots of vegetables, some fish, not too much meat. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, though. And I have a bit of a sweet tooth… I like chocolate. I don't smoke, and I rarely drink hard liquor. Does that make sense? I’m not a big partier, if that's what you mean.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Geho. It gives me a good picture. So, desk job, generally healthy diet, enjoying some wine and chocolate… all very relatable. Do you happen to know your approximate height and weight?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I always have to know those for things! I'm… let me think… almost six foot tall, actually. Five foot eleven and three-quarters, to be precise. And I weigh… around one hundred and twenty-four pounds. I’ve always been quite tall and thin, really. Not much of an appetite, even as a child. Is that okay? Does that matter?
DOCTOR: That's good information. Your height and weight give us your Body Mass Index, or BMI, which is a useful number. And being tall and thin… that’s helpful context. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I’ve eaten all sorts of things over the years – spicy food, shellfish, nuts… everything. I can take medicine without any trouble, too. Penicillin, ibuprofen, you name it. Never had a rash, or any breathing problems, or anything like that. I did get stung by a bee once, when I was little, but that was just a little bit of pain and swelling. Nothing serious. Does that count?
DOCTOR: No known allergies – excellent. A bee sting doesn’t count, thankfully. And finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – or any supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don't take anything regularly. Not even vitamins, really. I used to take a multivitamin for a while, but I stopped. I figured if I was eating healthy, I probably didn’t need it. I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s maybe once or twice a month. And sometimes I’ll use a topical cream for my hands, because they get dry in the winter. But that’s about it. Nothing prescribed by a doctor, though. I really try to avoid taking too many pills, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Geho. Thank you for providing all of that information. It gives me a good understanding of your overall health picture. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look at your hands and feet. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I always like getting things checked out, just to be sure. It's better to know, you know? So, heart and lungs, blood pressure… go ahead. Just let me know if anything feels… weird.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could take a deep breath for me… and hold it… good. Now exhale slowly. I’m listening for any unusual sounds. Your heart rate is regular and normal. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 142/88. That's slightly elevated, but not drastically so. We'll want to monitor that over time. Your hands and feet look good. No signs of swelling or anything concerning. Overall, physically you appear to be in good health. I will order a full lipid panel to confirm the initial lab results. I’d also like to repeat a blood pressure reading today, after a few minutes of rest.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… reasonable. Slightly elevated blood pressure, you said? That doesn't sound too terrible, does it? I’ve been a little stressed lately, with work. Maybe that's it? A full lipid panel… that’s another blood test, right? Is it a lot of tubes? I don’t really like needles, to be honest. And repeating the blood pressure… that makes sense. I just want to make sure everything is okay, you know? So, what happens next? Do I need to fast for the blood test? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to be a little anxious about blood tests, and yes, slightly elevated blood pressure can definitely be due to stress. We’ll see what the repeat reading says. The lipid panel requires a standard blood draw—just one or two tubes. You will need to fast for at least nine to twelve hours beforehand. That means no food or drink except water. It's important for an accurate reading. The results usually take about three to five business days to come back from the lab. Once I have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I’d recommend trying to manage your stress as much as possible. Things like deep breathing exercises, yoga, or spending time in nature can be very helpful. Do you have any questions about the fasting or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: Okay, nine to twelve hours of fasting. I can do that. I usually skip breakfast anyway, so it’s not too bad. I just need to remember not to have any coffee with breakfast the day before, right? And no snacks in the evening, either. Deep breathing exercises… I’ll try to remember that. I do like walking in the park, when I have time. That helps me relax. So, the blood test will tell us how high my cholesterol really is? And then you’ll tell me what to do about it? Will I need to take medicine? I'm really hoping I can avoid that. Is there anything I can do now to lower it, besides skipping food and walking? Like, foods to eat, or foods to avoid? I like to be proactive, you know?
DOCTOR: Exactly. The blood test will give us a precise measure of your cholesterol levels – HDL, LDL, and triglycerides. Then we can discuss the best course of action. Whether or not you need medication depends entirely on the results and your overall risk factors. We will explore lifestyle modifications first. You’re right to be proactive! There’s a lot you can do now. A heart-healthy diet is key. Focus on foods high in soluble fiber – like oats, beans, apples, and citrus fruits. Lean proteins – fish, poultry, and beans – are good choices. Limit saturated and trans fats – found in red meat, processed foods, and fried foods. And, sadly, reduce your intake of chocolate, as delicious as it is. Regular exercise is also beneficial – aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity most days of the week. And managing stress, as we discussed, is important too. We can talk more specifically about dietary changes at our follow-up appointment. I can also provide you with some resources – websites, pamphlets – that offer helpful information. Do you have any other questions before we wrap up for today?
PATIENT: Okay, so oats, beans, apples, lean protein… less chocolate. It sounds like a lot, but I can try. I do like apples. And I’ll try to walk more, even if it's just around the park. And I'll definitely avoid red meat. I don’t eat a lot of it anyway. Resources – that would be great! Websites or pamphlets… anything to help me remember all of this. And when should I schedule the follow-up appointment? After the blood test results come back, you said three to five business days? Should I call the office? Is there a specific time that works best for you? I don't want to bother you if you're very busy. I just want to get this sorted out, you know? It's good to know what's going on, and what I can do to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: You're not bothering me at all! Your questions are excellent, and it's wonderful that you’re taking such an active role in your health. Once you’ve had the blood test, please call the office, and they can schedule a follow-up appointment with me. I generally see patients in the mornings and early afternoons. Let the scheduler know you’re following up on lipid results, and they’ll find a time that works best. I'll also have the nurse prepare a handout with information about heart-healthy diets and exercise. And I can provide you with a couple of reliable websites as well. I'm confident that we can develop a plan to help you manage your cholesterol and stay healthy. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Vodzak. You’ve been very helpful, and you explained everything so clearly. I feel much better now, knowing what’s going on and what I need to do. I really appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and answer all my questions. I’ll schedule the blood test and call the office to make an appointment. And I’ll try to eat more apples. Thank you again. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Geho. I’m glad I could help. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a wonderful day as well, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
