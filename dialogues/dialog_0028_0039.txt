DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Bohnett, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Lindsey Bohnett. But please, call me Lindsey. Everyone does. Though, goodness, it feels strange being called “Mr.” after all these years!
DOCTOR: Very well, Lindsey. And what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, the nurse, a lovely young woman, told me something about my cholesterol being… high? I don’t really understand all that medical stuff, to be honest. I just want to make sure I don’t, you know, end up needing a lot of fussing. I’ve been pretty healthy all my life, considering.
DOCTOR: "High cholesterol," yes. It’s… not ideal. Though, at your age, many things aren’t. We'll need to get a better understanding of how high, and for how long. Do you have any idea when you last had blood work done before today?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. That’s a good question. Probably… when I retired, maybe? About fifteen years ago? It was just a general check-up then, nothing specific. My wife, bless her heart, always kept track of these things. It’s been a bit harder since she passed, keeping up with appointments and such. I mostly just go when something feels… off.
DOCTOR: Fifteen years... alright. And aside from the nurse mentioning the cholesterol, what is feeling "off" now?
PATIENT: Well, nothing really feels off, and that's the confusing part! I've been feeling… my usual self, I suppose. Maybe a little more tired than usual lately, but honestly, at my age, isn’t everyone a little tired? I still get out and about, do my gardening, visit with the grandkids… I just don't want something brewing that I don't know about. It’s better to be safe than sorry, that’s what I always say.
DOCTOR: Gardening… how strenuous is that activity?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not too bad. Nothing like I used to do when I was younger, of course! I mostly stick to weeding and planting. A bit of light digging, nothing major. It’s mostly bending and kneeling, if anything. I do enjoy it, keeps me moving, you know? It’s a good way to spend a morning. I have a small vegetable patch and a few flower beds. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any pain with these activities?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. That's what’s so odd. Sometimes my knees get a bit creaky when I stand up, but that’s just old age, I think. Not related to the gardening, not really. Just… the usual aches and pains. I’ve never had any chest pain or shortness of breath, or anything like that. Just the tiredness, and the nurse saying my cholesterol was high. It’s a bit unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's review your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions – diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, anything at all?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not really. Nothing major, anyway. I had a bout of pneumonia when I was a young man, but that was a long time ago. And I used to get terrible migraines, but those stopped years ago, thank goodness. My wife always said I had a weak constitution when I was younger, but I think she just worried too much. Nothing the doctors ever really diagnosed, if that makes sense. Just… little things here and there.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… yes, actually. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager. And a hernia operation… oh, must be twenty years ago now? Something like that. And… I think I had a mole removed from my back a few years back, but it was nothing serious, the doctor said. Small things, really. Nothing like a heart bypass or anything like that! I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any family history of heart disease, stroke, or diabetes?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My father… he had a weak heart, I think. He didn't take care of himself, smoked too much, drank too much. He had chest pains on and off for years, and eventually… well, he passed away when I was still a young man. A heart attack, I believe. My mother… she lived to be 95, very healthy for her age, but I don’t recall any specific heart problems on her side of the family. My wife’s side… I don't know much about their medical history, to be honest. They weren’t much for talking about these things.
DOCTOR: Right. And what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Well, that’s the funny thing. Hardly any, really. Just a low-dose aspirin every day, the doctor suggested it a few years back, just as a preventative measure, you know? And sometimes, if my knees are really acting up, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But that’s it. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. I always thought a good diet and a bit of exercise were better than any medicine.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I used to be a beekeeper, and I was stung plenty of times, but never had a severe allergy. My wife was the one with allergies, pollen and dust and such. I always teased her about it. But me? No allergies. I'm pretty fortunate, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline, you understand. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your extremities.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. That sounds perfectly sensible. I’m happy to do whatever I can to help. Though I must say, I haven’t had a proper physical in… well, a very long time! But I’m not afraid, not at all. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Deep breath in… and out… Good. Heart sounds… regular, but slightly diminished. Not overly concerning at your age, but something to note. Lungs… clear bilaterally, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure… 140 over 85. A bit elevated. Pulses… present, but weak. Capillary refill… slightly delayed. Everything seems… within reasonable limits for your age. But the elevated blood pressure and weak pulses are things we need to address.
PATIENT: That doesn’t sound very good, does it? Elevated blood pressure… my wife always worried about that. She said it was a silent killer. Is it something serious? And what about these pulses being weak? Is that connected to the cholesterol, do you think? I just want to understand what’s going on, if you don’t mind explaining it in plain language. I'm not a doctor, you know!
DOCTOR: It's… not ideal, as I said. Elevated blood pressure means your heart is working harder than it should to pump blood throughout your body. If left untreated, it can lead to more serious problems, like heart attack or stroke. And weak pulses… they suggest that blood flow isn’t as strong as it should be, likely due to… a number of factors. Cholesterol is certainly a contributing factor, yes. It builds up in the arteries, narrowing them and restricting blood flow. We’ll need to run some further tests to get a clearer picture, but it’s likely we’re dealing with early stages of peripheral artery disease. Now, I'm going to order a complete lipid panel and a basic metabolic panel. We'll also need to do an EKG to check your heart rhythm.
PATIENT: Peripheral artery disease… that sounds… frightening. And an EKG? Is that… painful? I’m not worried about the tests themselves, mind you, just… the results. It's all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. You mentioned medication earlier… is that what we’re looking at here? Pills to lower the cholesterol and blood pressure? I was hoping to avoid that, if possible. I always believed in a healthy lifestyle…
DOCTOR: "Frightening" is… a bit dramatic, frankly. It's manageable, especially if we catch it early, which we seem to be doing. An EKG is painless, it simply measures the electrical activity of your heart. As for medication… yes, it’s likely we’ll need to start you on a statin to lower your cholesterol and potentially a blood pressure medication. I understand your preference for a healthy lifestyle, but at your age, sometimes lifestyle changes aren't enough. We will discuss potential side effects, of course. But it's about mitigating risk, and right now, your risk factors are elevated. I am sending the lab orders to the nurse now. She will explain the process and schedule the EKG. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Several. If I do need to take these medications… will I be on them for the rest of my life? And what about diet? Is there anything specific I should be eating or avoiding? My wife always made a lovely oatmeal, is that good for cholesterol? And… … what if the tests show something… worse? Something really serious? I just want to be prepared, you know? I’ve lived a long life, and I’d like to keep it that way, if possible.
DOCTOR: Likely, yes, you would be on the medication long-term. Managing cholesterol and blood pressure is an ongoing process. As for diet… oatmeal is okay, but it’s not a miracle cure. You should focus on a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, plenty of fruits and vegetables, lean protein, and whole grains. Avoid processed foods, red meat, and sugary drinks. It's all fairly standard advice. As for your other question… I'm not going to speculate about hypothetical scenarios. We will address any concerns when we have the test results. Worrying prematurely won't do you any good. The nurse will be in shortly to review the instructions and schedule your tests. I have several other patients waiting. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. It’s just… a lot to take in. I suppose I’ll just wait for the nurse, then. .
DOCTOR: Right. Very well. .
