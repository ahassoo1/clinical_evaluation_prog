DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor...Petrimoulx, was it? Look, I ain’t got all day, so let's get straight to it. I need a… a permission slip. For somethin' the fella at the shop told me I gotta get. Somethin' 'bout fixin' my face. He said you gotta clear me for it. It’s… cosmetic, I think he called it. I don’t rightly remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Honcoop, I understand. A permission slip for a cosmetic procedure. No problem at all, we can certainly look into that. To help me understand what's needed, could you tell me a little more about what the “fella at the shop” is planning to do?
PATIENT: Shop? Oh, the shop. Right. It’s… well, I work on them towers, you see. Radio towers, cell towers. Fix 'em, build 'em. And sometimes… sometimes things happen. A little mishap. This fella, Tyrone, he does… adjustments. He’s good with his hands, Tyrone is. Now, don't go askin' too many questions 'bout how the mishap happened. It weren’t nothin' serious. Just a… blemish. He says he can fix it, make it look good as new, but he needs you to say it’s alright. That's all. Honestly, I just wanna get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop, I appreciate you sharing that with me. So, to clarify, you had an injury while working on the radio towers, and a colleague, Tyrone, offers cosmetic repair. And Tyrone requires medical clearance from me before proceeding. Just to be thorough, and to ensure we're doing everything safely, could you describe this “blemish” in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I told you, I don’t rightly remember the details! It was… a scrape, I think. Or a…cut. Small! It weren’t nothin’ big. Happened a while back. A piece of metal… maybe? I was climbin’ the tower, and somethin’… grazed me. Tyrone said it left a mark. A little discoloration. He offered to… smooth it out. That's it. Why do you need to know so much? It's just a little cosmetic thing! I don't need a whole investigation.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop. It’s not about an investigation, it’s about making sure any procedure you undergo is safe and won’t cause complications. Even small cosmetic procedures can carry risks if we aren’t aware of the full picture. Let’s try this: where on your face is this mark located?
PATIENT: Right here. On my chin. It’s… small. Barely noticeable, really. Most folks don't even see it. Tyrone said he can fix it with… somethin' he mixes up. Don't ask me what. He's the expert, not me. Look, is this gonna take long? I got jobs to do, and folks dependin' on me. I ain't got time to sit here describin' every little scratch I ever got.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small mark on your chin. Thank you for pointing that out. I’m feeling a slightly raised area here, and the skin feels a little different than the surrounding tissue. Is it tender to the touch?
PATIENT: It… it ain't painful, exactly. More like… sensitive. It's been like that for a while. Old injury, like I said. Look, are you gonna give me this permission slip or what? Tyrone’s waitin’ on my word. He’s a busy man. I just wanna get this taken care of. Is it somethin' serious? You makin' me nervous now.
DOCTOR: It’s good that you mentioned it’s been sensitive for a while, Mr. Honcoop. That’s important information. Have you noticed any changes to this area recently?
PATIENT: Changes? What kinda changes? It's just… there. Been there for months, maybe a year. It itches sometimes. And… sometimes it feels a little warm. But nothin' major. Look, Doctor, I'm tellin' ya, this is a simple thing. Tyrone wouldn't offer to fix it if it was somethin' serious, would he? He's a good man. Honest. I'm startin' to think I shouldn't have even come in here. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration and that you trust Tyrone. However, my responsibility is to ensure your health and safety. Itching and warmth can sometimes indicate an issue that needs further investigation, even with what appears to be a small cosmetic concern. Let's go through a quick medical history. Have you had any other skin issues or unusual moles removed in the past?
PATIENT: Skin issues? Doctor, I work on radio towers! I get scrapes and bruises all the time. A little sunburn here and there. But nothin' serious. Moles? I don't even know what you're talkin' about. I ain’t one for fancy medical terms. Look, can we just skip all this and get to the permission slip? I really gotta go. I’m losin' money by sittin' here. I don’t understand why you need all this information for a little blemish. Tyrone says it's just a simple fix. He's been doin’ this for years. He knows what he’s doin’. Honestly, I think you're makin' somethin' out of nothin'. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your concerns about your time and your trust in Tyrone. However, I cannot ethically provide a permission slip without a more thorough understanding of your medical history and a proper assessment of this mark on your chin. Based on what you've described – the sensitivity, the itching, the warmth – and considering your history of outdoor work, I recommend we take a closer look at this area. I’d like to do a quick skin exam and possibly a small biopsy to rule out anything concerning. Would you be willing to let me do that?
