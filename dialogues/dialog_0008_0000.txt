DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Cumper. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s…it’s my legs. They just feel…weak. It started a few days ago, after I had a pretty bad cold. Not just tired legs, mind you, actually weak. Like they might give out on me. It's rather inconvenient, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness in your legs…and it started a few days after a cold. I understand it's inconvenient. Can you tell me a little more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, please. You think I wouldn’t be clear if I could? It's both of them, and it’s…difficult to explain. Like trying to walk through thick mud, even when I’m not in mud. It's not a pain, exactly, more like… resistance. And it’s worse after I’ve been standing for a bit. I had to practically drag myself out of bed this morning. It's just… unsettling. And frankly, I don't have time for unsettling. I have tours to run, people relying on me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so both legs, feels like resistance, worse with standing, and difficult to get going in the morning. And you mentioned tours – are you a tour guide?
PATIENT: Yes, obviously. What did you think I did, sit around knitting doilies all day? I’m a tour and travel guide. A good one, I might add. People depend on me to show them the real Honduras, not some watered-down version for tourists. It requires… stamina. Which, as you can see, I’m currently lacking. And I really don’t appreciate having to explain my profession. It’s…basic.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Ms. Firestone. I didn't mean to imply anything. Tour guide, understood. Stamina is important. Let's get some more information to understand what might be going on. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just…weakness. It’s not pins and needles or anything unpleasant like that, just…giving way. And it's both legs, which is what’s so concerning. It’s not like I tripped and hurt one, you know? It's symmetrical, if that means anything to you. I do pride myself on being observant, after all. It’s a key part of the job.
DOCTOR: Okay, symmetrical weakness, no numbness or tingling. That's helpful. And you said it started a few days after a cold. Did you have any other symptoms with the cold – fever, cough, body aches?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, a proper cold. Achy all over, stuffy nose, the usual. I didn’t bother taking my temperature, honestly. Who does that anymore? Just felt miserable for about three days, then the cold itself seemed to pass. And then my legs decided to stage a revolt. Honestly, it feels like one thing always leads to another these days. It's very…frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, achy, stuffy, typical cold symptoms. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, at my age, there’s always something. But nothing major. My blood pressure sometimes runs a little high, the doctor told me once, but it’s nothing I need to take pills for. He just said to watch my salt intake. And my knees ache sometimes, but who doesn't have knee problems? Otherwise, perfectly healthy. I’m a very active person, you see. I walk constantly.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional high blood pressure, watched salt intake, and some knee pain. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Just a tonsillectomy when I was a child, ages ago. And…a rather unpleasant gallbladder removal about fifteen years ago. Both done back in Honduras, not here. Other than that, no. I’m not one for letting doctors cut me open unless absolutely necessary. Honestly, it seems like half the time they just make things worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago. And no family history of any neurological conditions, muscle weakness, or similar problems?
PATIENT: Family history… honestly, you’d need a family tree the size of Honduras to keep track of it all. But as far as weakness… no. My mother was very sprightly until she was eighty, and my father walked miles every day. We’re generally a sturdy bunch, you see. Not frail and delicate like some people. I doubt it’s anything genetic. It’s probably just… a virus lingering, or something equally mundane.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of neurological issues. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. And occasionally, ibuprofen for my knees, when they really flare up. But I don’t take it regularly. Honestly, I try to avoid pills whenever possible. They always have such unpleasant side effects. I prefer to manage things myself, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I'm rather robust, you see. Honestly, if it doesn’t kill you, it makes you stronger. That’s my motto. I haven’t the time for delicate constitutions and endless lists of sensitivities.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let's do a quick physical exam. Can you stand up for me and walk a few steps?
PATIENT: Really? Now? Well, I suppose it's necessary. Fine. But don't expect a graceful performance. As I said, my legs aren't cooperating. There. Happy now? It's not exactly a sprint, is it? But it demonstrates the problem.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see what you mean. Your gait is a bit slow and hesitant, and I noticed some mild weakness in your ankles when you dorsiflex your feet. Reflexes are…a little diminished, but not absent. And do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Not exactly pain, Doctor. More like…tenderness. It's not sharp or throbbing, just…uncomfortable. It's hard to describe. And it's not localized to one spot, it's…general. The whole leg feels a bit… sensitive. Honestly, it feels like you're poking at something that's already irritated. Are you sure this is necessary? You're not making it any better, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tenderness on palpation, diminished reflexes. Given your recent cold and the weakness, I’m considering a few possibilities. It could be post-viral weakness, though the diminished reflexes are a bit concerning. It's also possible, although less likely, that this is a nerve issue. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, electrolytes, and vitamin D level – and possibly an MRI of your lower spine to rule out any nerve compression. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An MRI? Honestly, Doctor, it seems a bit extreme. I just had a cold. And now you want to stick me in a machine and poke around my spine? Really? I’m not convinced this is necessary, but… I suppose if it will rule things out. But if it turns out to be nothing, I expect a full explanation. And I don’t have time to spend all day in hospitals. I have tours to run, you know. What exactly will the blood work show? And how long will this all take?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Firestone. The blood work will help us rule out any underlying vitamin deficiencies or electrolyte imbalances that could be contributing to the weakness. The MRI is a precaution, just to be thorough and rule out any nerve compression in your spine. It is unlikely to be that, but given the diminished reflexes, we want to be certain. The blood work should be back in a couple of days. The MRI scheduling…I’ll have my assistant contact you with options. It can take a week or two to get an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend resting your legs when possible, avoiding strenuous activity, and we can discuss some gentle stretching exercises. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Stretching exercises… fine. Rest is difficult when one has a livelihood to maintain, but I'll try. A week or two for an MRI? Honestly, that's an eternity. Very well. But if I’m any worse in the meantime, I expect to be seen promptly. And I don't want to be kept waiting for hours. I have a schedule to keep, you know. Tell your assistant to find the earliest possible appointment. And if it’s not helpful, I’m not afraid to seek a second opinion. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Perfectly understood, Ms. Firestone. My assistant will prioritize scheduling your MRI for the earliest possible date. And of course, if your symptoms worsen, please contact the office immediately, and we will do everything we can to accommodate you. I'm also going to write you a referral to a neurologist, just to have them on standby for review of the MRI results. Here's the referral, and the instructions for the blood work will be emailed to you. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: A neurologist… wonderful. More doctors. Very well. No, I think that covers everything. Let's just hope this isn’t a waste of time. And tell your assistant to actually call me about the MRI appointment, not just send an email. I don’t spend all day checking my inbox. Thank you… I suppose. I have to go now. I have people waiting.
