DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, I’ve been getting… flushed. A lot. It started maybe a week ago, and it’s just… happening more and more. My face gets red, and I feel warm. Not a fever warm, just… warm.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Withycombe. "Flushed," you say – and it's been occurring for about a week, and is becoming more frequent. Could you describe when these flushing episodes happen?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? That’s a good question. It’s hard to say exactly. Sometimes when I’m talking, you know, just chatting with someone. Sometimes… when I eat something spicy. But not always when I eat spicy. And… sometimes it just happens, when I’m sitting, doing nothing. It doesn’t seem to follow a pattern. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. It sounds like it’s quite unpredictable. When you say “chatting with someone,” are you experiencing any anxiety or stress during those conversations?
PATIENT: Anxiety? Not really. I enjoy talking. I used to talk to my wife all the time. She… she passed away last year. So, talking… it’s nice. But no, not stressed. Sometimes I’m just telling a story, you know? Or… asking someone how their day is. Nothing… nothing important.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Withycombe. I’m very sorry to hear about your wife’s passing. Losing a loved one is incredibly difficult. It’s natural to experience a range of emotions, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. Now, focusing on the flushing, aside from the redness and warmth, do you notice any other symptoms during these episodes?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just red face, warm feeling. Sometimes my heart feels a little fast, but I don't know if that's just… me being a little worried about the flushing. It's hard to tell. No sweating, no dizziness, nothing like that. Just the red and the warm. It doesn't hurt, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, no sweating, no dizziness – just redness, warmth, and sometimes a slightly faster heartbeat. It sounds like it’s primarily those symptoms. Could you tell me a bit about your medical history, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: Medical history… hmm. Well, I used to get headaches a lot when I was younger. But those went away. And I had my appendix out when I was a boy, but that was a long time ago. Nothing major since then, really. I see a doctor every year for a check-up, but they never find anything wrong. I haven't been taking any medicine lately. Not for anything.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, headaches in the past that have resolved, and an appendectomy as a child. No current medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. None that I know of. I can eat anything, take any medicine… well, I don’t like taking medicine, but I haven't had a reaction to anything ever. My wife, she was allergic to peanuts, but I am not.
DOCTOR: Good to know. No known allergies. And your wife had a peanut allergy. Now, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s tricky. My parents, they’re both gone now. And I don’t know much about their families. They didn’t talk about it much. My mother, she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he smoked a lot. He died young, from… something with his lungs. But other than that, I don’t really know. I don't have many relatives close by.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Withycombe. That's understandable. So, history of hypertension in your mother and a smoking-related lung issue in your father. I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much and how often?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I like a little glass of wine with my dinner sometimes. Red wine, usually. Maybe three or four times a week. Just one glass, though. Nothing more. I don’t drink beer or anything else. Just a little red wine to relax. My wife liked it too, you know.
DOCTOR: Thank you. So, approximately one glass of red wine three or four times a week. And do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Never even tried it. My father, he smoked, but I didn’t like it. Smelled bad, and I knew it was bad for him. I always stayed away from it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No history of smoking. Now, one final question before we move on to a brief physical exam. Could you describe your typical diet?
PATIENT: Hmm… my diet. Well, I try to eat healthy. I like vegetables, chicken, fish. I cook most of my meals myself. I eat a lot of Indian food, you know, curries and rice. Not too much salt, I try to be careful with that. And I like fruit. I don't eat a lot of… fast food, or sugary things. Mostly just… regular food. I lost my appetite for a while after my wife passed, but it’s better now.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Withycombe. That gives me a good overview of your lifestyle. Now, if you’re comfortable, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I’m comfortable with that. Just… let me know if you need me to do anything special.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 92. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Skin appears normal, no rashes. I note some mild flushing to the facial skin. Based on what you’ve told me and this quick exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. Given the recurrent flushing, slightly elevated blood pressure, and your history, I'm thinking of things like rosacea, or potentially a medication-related cause, though you don't take any medications currently. Another consideration would be a vasomotor condition, which can be related to stress or changes in temperature regulation. It's also good to rule out any cardiac issues, even though the heart sounds normal now.
PATIENT: Wow. That’s… a lot. Rosacea? I don’t even know what that is. And a… vasomotor condition? Sounds scary. I just want to know what’s causing me to get red in the face. Is it something serious, Doctor? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Withycombe. It's completely natural to feel worried when you don't know what's going on. Let me assure you, most of these possibilities aren't immediately life-threatening. Rosacea is a common skin condition that causes redness, visible blood vessels, and sometimes small, pus-filled bumps on the face. It can be managed with topical medications and lifestyle adjustments. A vasomotor condition simply means a problem with the blood vessels’ ability to regulate temperature and blood flow, and can sometimes be triggered by stress or certain foods. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few blood tests. These will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions, check your kidney and liver function, and assess your thyroid levels. I’d also like to order a basic EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm further. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. Blood tests, EKG… alright. Will they be expensive? I… I don’t have insurance, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Mr. Withycombe. Not having insurance can be a significant worry. I will keep costs in mind and order only the necessary tests to get a clear diagnosis. I can also discuss options with the lab to see if they offer any financial assistance programs or a payment plan. The blood tests will likely cost around \$150-\$200, and the EKG around \$100-\$150. I can provide you with a detailed cost estimate before we proceed. In the meantime, I recommend keeping a diary of your flushing episodes. Note down what you were doing, what you ate, and any potential triggers you might identify. This can be helpful in narrowing down the cause. Do you have any questions about the tests or the diary?
PATIENT: A diary… yes, I can do that. Write down when I get red, what I ate… alright. \$150-\$200… that’s… a lot, but I guess I can manage it. I appreciate you keeping the cost in mind, Doctor. Thank you. So, just write down everything? What I was doing, what I ate, how I was feeling? Anything else? And… will I need to come back to talk about the results? How long will it take to get them?
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly. Write down what you were doing, what you ate, how you were feeling – any potential stressors, the temperature, anything that you think might be relevant. Don’t worry about being too detailed at first, just jot down the basics. The results typically take 3-5 business days to come back from the lab. Once I have them, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. We can then formulate a treatment plan based on the findings. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headache, or dizziness – please contact me immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Withycombe?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little better knowing we’re trying to figure it out. I will keep the diary, and I’ll write down anything new that happens. And I’ll call if anything… serious happens. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Withycombe. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Please don't hesitate to reach out if any questions or worries arise before your follow-up appointment. I will be in touch as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, and take care.
PATIENT: .
