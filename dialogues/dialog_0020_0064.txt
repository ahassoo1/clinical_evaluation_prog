DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. It’s good to meet you. I’m Dr. Beinborn. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Oh, um… well, my chest. It’s been… hurting. Not all the time, but enough that I thought I should come get it checked. It feels… tight, sometimes. Like someone is squeezing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain. That’s definitely something we want to take a look at. And you mentioned it's not constant, but a squeezing tightness… can you tell me a little more about when it happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It doesn’t happen when I’m resting, not usually. But if I’m… walking up the hill to the market, or carrying groceries… then it starts. It goes away if I stop and rest a little. Maybe ten, fifteen minutes. It’s… hard to say exactly. Sometimes it happens quicker, sometimes slower. It’s been going on… oh, maybe a month now? A month and a half?
DOCTOR: Okay, a month to a month and a half of chest pain that’s brought on by exertion—walking, carrying things—and relieved with rest. That’s helpful information. And you said it feels like a tightness?
PATIENT: Yes, tightness. And… a little bit heavy, too. Not a sharp pain, not like when you fall or something. Just… heavy and tight. It feels… right in the middle of my chest, mostly. Sometimes it goes a little bit into my left arm, but not always.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy, tight feeling in the middle of the chest, sometimes radiating to the left arm… Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Let me think… well, I get a little bit short of breath when it happens, maybe. But I'm not a young woman anymore, Doctor! I get short of breath going up the hill anyway! But… no, I don’t think so. No dizziness or anything like that. Just the chest feeling.
DOCTOR: That's fair enough. It’s good you’re aware of your baseline. So, just to confirm: chest pain with exertion, relieved by rest, sometimes with a little shortness of breath, no dizziness… Now, have you had this type of pain before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. Not like this. I’ve had… aches and pains, you know, old woman things. But this is different. This feels… worrying. I don’t usually worry, but… this feels different. I haven't had anything like it before, no.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you came in to get it checked out, and it's alright to feel worried when something new comes up. Let’s go through a little bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… High blood pressure, yes. The doctor told me years ago, maybe five years? I take a little pill for it, every morning. And… that's it, I think. No diabetes, no cholesterol problems that I know of. I had a bad gallbladder once, but they took it out. Years ago. That doesn't bother me anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a gallbladder removal in the past. Do you know what the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure is?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see… It's a white pill. Small. I get it from the pharmacy every month. I… I don’t know the name, Doctor. My husband gets it for me. I just take it with my breakfast. I’m sorry. I don't remember names very well.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Sherion. We can look it up in your records. Do you happen to remember where you usually fill your prescriptions?
PATIENT: Oh yes, the pharmacy in town. Ramirez Pharmacy. Old man Ramirez, very nice man. He knows everyone in town. He's the one who gives my husband the pills, and he reminds me to take them. He's very helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ramirez Pharmacy. Let me just pull up your records here… Ah, here we are. It looks like you’re on Lisinopril 20mg daily. And I see your last gallbladder removal was about 15 years ago. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, Lisinopril, that's it! Yes, that's the one. And… no, Doctor, nothing else. Just the Lisinopril. Sometimes I take a little pain reliever for my knees, when they bother me, but that's not every day. Just ibuprofen, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so Lisinopril daily and occasional ibuprofen for your knees. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I eat everything. My husband makes a wonderful arepa, even if it has a little bit of everything in it! I've never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can remember.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family history. Does anyone in your family have a history of heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother, she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had problems with his heart, when he was older. He was a very strong man, always working hard. He… he died when I was young. A heart attack, I think it was. And my brother, he has diabetes, but he doesn’t take care of himself very well.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure in your mother, heart problems in your father, and diabetes in your brother. That’s helpful to know. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor! No smoking, no drinking, no… anything like that. Never. My husband, he likes a little beer sometimes, but I don’t. We eat healthy, mostly. And we work in the garden. It keeps us busy.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very good. No smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your breathing sounds clear, but I do hear a slight murmur… it's not too concerning right now, but we'll keep an eye on it. Your heart rate is a little elevated, at 88 beats per minute. And your blood pressure is 140/90. That’s a little higher than we’d like. Now, I'm going to feel your pulse in your wrists and ankles. Your pulses are a bit weak, but present. Now, based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found here today, it sounds like you may be experiencing angina – chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. But we need to do some more testing to be sure. I want to order an EKG and a blood test to check your cardiac enzymes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Angina… that sounds… serious. Reduced blood flow… like my father? An EKG and a blood test… yes, Doctor. If that's what you think is best, then yes. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sherion. It’s good we’re taking this seriously. An EKG – that’s a simple test that measures the electrical activity of your heart. And the blood test will look for signs of heart damage. We'll do those right here in the clinic. It will take about 30 minutes to get the results. In the meantime, I want you to avoid any strenuous activity. Don’t walk up any hills, don’t carry anything heavy, and if you feel any chest pain, stop immediately and let me know. While we wait for the results, I’m going to prescribe a medication called nitroglycerin. It’s a spray that you put under your tongue if you experience chest pain. It helps to open up the blood vessels and relieve the pain. I'll also write you a referral to a cardiologist - a heart specialist - for a more thorough evaluation. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Nitroglycerin… a spray… Okay. Open up the blood vessels… That sounds… good. A cardiologist… yes, if you think it's necessary. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Thirty minutes… I can wait. And… thank you. For explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherion. I want you to feel comfortable and informed. I'm going to step out now to get the EKG and blood test ordered, and the nurse will be in shortly to get you set up. Just one more thing – if the chest pain becomes severe, doesn't go away with the nitroglycerin, or is accompanied by shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Don't hesitate. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Severe pain… doesn't go away… shortness of breath… emergency room. I understand. I will remember that. Thank you again. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s very important. I'll be back shortly.
