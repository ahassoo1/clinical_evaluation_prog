DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Latisia Finco. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, I'm here for... a check-up, I guess. For the team. They want me to get looked at before... before I try out. It's for baseball. Though, I don’t remember all the details. It’s been a while, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. A pre-participation physical for baseball. That's very good of your team to encourage that. It is important to make sure everything is in working order. And don’t worry about remembering details, we'll get through it together. Just tell me whatever comes to mind. So, to start, have you been feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Generally well… I suppose so. No complaints, really. Though my knees… they ache sometimes. Old injury, I think. It was a long time ago. Baseball, you know? Lots of running and… sliding. Can’t recall exactly when it happened, though. Old age, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee pain. We’ll definitely want to explore that further. And you're right, it’s not uncommon for old injuries to flare up. To help me get a better picture, can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Describe it… Hmm. It’s a dull ache, mostly. Comes and goes. Worse when it’s cold, or… before it rains, maybe? Not sharp, not like a sudden thing. Just… there. Makes it hard to get up sometimes. Especially in the morning. You know? It’s just… old. Like I said. I don’t bother with it too much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache that's worse with cold weather and in the mornings. That’s helpful. And it doesn't seem to be interfering with your daily activities too much right now?
PATIENT: Interfering? Not really. I mean, I don’t run marathons, you know? I still do some things. Not like I used to, of course. But I can still… get around. It just… reminds me I'm not a young man anymore. That's all. It’s a small price to pay.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. It’s sensible to be mindful of your body. Now, besides the knees, have you noticed any other pain anywhere else?
PATIENT: Hmm... Well, my shoulder sometimes feels a little stiff. The left one. I think I slept on it wrong a few nights ago. It’s not bad, though. A little bit of soreness, that's all. I just rub it, and it usually gets better. I don’t pay it much attention, to be honest. Old man stuff. Like the knees.
DOCTOR: Okay, some shoulder stiffness on the left side, which seems to come and go. And nothing else bothering you at the moment?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. I mean, I get tired sometimes. But who doesn’t? I’m not a spring chicken anymore, you know? Everything aches a little. It’s just… getting older. I don’t expect to feel like I’m twenty anymore. No complaints, really. I’m still here, aren’t I? That's what matters.
DOCTOR: That's a very good attitude, Mr. Bartok. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… Now that’s a question. Honestly, Doctor, it’s been a long time. And I don’t really remember much. I’ve been to doctors before, of course. But what for? It was all so long ago. I had… something with my stomach, maybe? Years ago. And I think I broke my arm when I was a kid. But that was a long time ago. Honestly, I'm not much help with this. It’s all a blur. I haven’t been really sick sick, if that makes any sense. Mostly just aches and pains. Like I said.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bartok. It’s very common to not remember details from years ago. We can work with what you do recall. You mentioned something with your stomach years ago… do you remember if you needed any hospital stays or surgeries for that?
PATIENT: No, no hospital stays. Definitely not. And no surgeries, either. Just… a doctor. He gave me some pills, I think. And I felt better. It wasn't a big deal. Just a stomach thing. Honestly, Doctor, I barely remember it. It was a long time ago. I don’t make a habit of going to doctors unless I absolutely have to. It’s all just a blur, like I said. You know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no hospital stays or surgeries. And you mentioned a stomach issue years ago, for which you received medication. We'll note that. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… Hmm. That's a tough one. My mother… she had something with her heart, I think. A long time ago. But I don’t remember the details. And my father… he was a strong man. Never really sick. As far as I know. There was an aunt, maybe, who had… something with her blood sugar. But honestly, I’m not very close to my family. I haven’t seen them in years. I don’t really know their medical history. Sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more help. It’s just… I don’t remember.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Bartok. You’ve given me what you recall, and that’s perfectly sufficient. Now, just one more question about your history before we move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. I eat everything. Never had a problem. I take a couple of pills for my… you know, aches and pains. But nothing serious. And I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Never. I eat shellfish, nuts, everything. I’m a pretty hardy guy, honestly. I don’t bother with allergies. Never have. It’s just… I don’t have them. You know?
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just get it over with, I suppose. I haven’t got all day, you know? But go ahead. I’m ready. As ready as an old man can be, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, your vital signs are within normal limits. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and I don’t hear any unusual murmurs. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes or crackles. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. It's soft, non-tender, and no masses are palpable. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little bit of… discomfort, maybe? But nothing major. It’s always a little tender, to be honest. I think it’s just… old age. Or maybe something I ate. It comes and goes, you know? It’s not a sharp pain, just… a little bit of pressure. Don't worry about it too much. I've always had a sensitive stomach. Like I said.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, your knees… I notice some crepitus with movement, and there’s some tenderness to palpation medially and laterally. Range of motion is slightly limited, and you express some discomfort with flexion. And finally, let’s check your shoulder. There's some mild tenderness with palpation of the left shoulder, but range of motion is mostly intact. No significant instability is noted. Okay, Mr. Bartok, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it seems you have some mild crepitus and tenderness in your knees, likely related to previous injury. And some mild tenderness in your left shoulder, possibly a strain. Does that sound right to you?
PATIENT: Sounds about right, Doctor. Old injuries, mostly. Like I said. The knees have always bothered me, especially when it’s cold. And the shoulder… I probably slept on it wrong. Nothing major, like you said. I’m not surprised, honestly. I’m an old man, what do you expect? It’s just… aches and pains. You know? I don't need any fancy treatments or anything. Just tell me if it's something I should worry about. That's all. I’m here for the baseball tryout, remember? I need to know if I'm fit enough to play. That’s all that matters.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. Based on my assessment, I don’t believe your knee or shoulder issues would prevent you from participating in the baseball tryout. However, it's important to listen to your body and not push yourself too hard. I recommend some gentle stretching and strengthening exercises for both your knees and shoulder to help maintain your range of motion and prevent further injury. To be on the safe side, I'd like to order some X-rays of your knees to rule out any significant arthritis. And if the shoulder pain persists or worsens, we may consider an MRI to assess for any rotator cuff issues. How does that sound?
PATIENT: X-rays and MRIs… Sounds like a lot of trouble, Doctor. Honestly, I’m not sure it’s necessary. I’ve been playing baseball for years, and I’ve always had aches and pains. It’s just part of the game. But… if you think it’s necessary, I suppose I can do it. I don’t want to cause any problems for the team. But I’m telling you, it’s probably nothing. Just old age. But alright, do what you think is best. Just don’t keep me waiting too long. I’ve got things to do, you know? And I need to practice for the tryout. What do I need to do to get these X-rays done?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bartok. I understand your concerns. We can schedule the X-rays for your knees at the imaging center across the street. I’ll give you a referral order. They’ll need your insurance information. The results will be sent back to me within 24-48 hours. As for the MRI, let’s hold off on that for now and see how your shoulder responds to some gentle stretching and rest. If it doesn't improve within a week, we can revisit that option. Here's the referral for the X-rays. And I'll write you a prescription for some over-the-counter pain reliever, like ibuprofen, to help manage any discomfort. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen… alright. That’s good. I’ve used that before. No, I don't think so, Doctor. I think you’ve covered everything. Just let me know if anything comes up on the X-rays. And I’ll try to take it easy on the shoulder. I really just want to get back to baseball. That's all. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I appreciate it. I guess I'll be going now?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bartok. We’ll get those X-rays scheduled and I’ll review the results as soon as they come in. If anything concerning is found, we'll discuss it in detail. And please, listen to your body and don’t hesitate to call if you experience any worsening pain or new symptoms. Here’s a sheet with instructions on how to prepare for the X-rays and some basic stretching exercises for your shoulder and knees. I wish you the best of luck with your baseball tryout. Take care, Mr. Bartok.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. Goodbye.
