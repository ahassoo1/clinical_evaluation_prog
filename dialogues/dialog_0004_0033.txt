DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, really, Doctor, must we go through all of this? It's... it's rather inconvenient, you know. My vision, it's gone blurry, and I can barely hear a thing. It just happened. Honestly, I haven't the time for lengthy explanations.
DOCTOR: "Inconvenient," you say. Well, Ms. Julie, while I appreciate your… directness, a little more detail would be helpful in determining why your vision and hearing have suddenly changed. Saying it “just happened” doesn’t give me much to work with. Let's start with the vision. When did you first notice the blurriness?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t recall precisely. A few days ago, perhaps? It's all a bit of a muddle, you see. I have a very busy schedule, and I don't spend my time focusing on such… trivial matters. It's just… everything looks hazy. And rather unpleasant. Is that all there is to it?
DOCTOR: "Trivial matters?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, forgive me if I don’t share your enthusiasm for cataloging every minor discomfort. I’m a surgeon, you know. I deal with important things. Not… fading eyesight. It's probably just stress. I've been exceptionally busy at the hospital. Really, is there no quicker way to ascertain if it's something serious?
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, with all due respect, dismissing a sudden change in vision – especially in someone your age – as “just stress” is… imprudent. I need to perform a proper examination to rule out more serious causes. Before we proceed, are you experiencing any pain with your vision?
PATIENT: Pain? Good heavens, no. Just… inconvenience. And a rather unsettling blur. Honestly, Doctor, I assure you, I’ve endured considerably more discomfort in the operating room. Can we just… get on with it? I have patients waiting.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, while I understand your busy schedule, a hasty examination is not in your best interest. I need to gather a comprehensive history to ensure I don't miss anything important. Let's move on to your hearing. When did you first notice difficulty hearing, and is it in both ears or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, the hearing... it's all a jumble, really. It started around the same time as the vision, I suppose. Both ears, I think. Everything sounds muffled. Like speaking through cotton wool. Honestly, it's dreadfully annoying, but I can’t pinpoint an exact moment. Is that helpful? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: "Helpful" would be a precise timeline, Ms. Julie, but we'll proceed as best we can. Have you experienced any ringing in your ears, dizziness, or a feeling of fullness in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing? Goodness, no. Fullness… perhaps a little. It's hard to say. I suppose I haven't been actively listening for such things. I have a practice to run, Doctor. Honestly, is this truly necessary? It all feels rather… excessive. I assure you, I'm perfectly capable of assessing my own condition.
DOCTOR: Ms. Julie, with all due respect, a surgeon diagnosing themselves while experiencing new onset vision and hearing changes is… concerning. I'm going to need to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Have you had any recent illnesses, infections, or injuries?
PATIENT: Illnesses? Infections? Doctor, really. I maintain a very strict hygienic regimen. I am a surgeon, as I've mentioned. As for injuries… a minor fall a few months ago, perhaps? I tripped over a rug. Nothing serious, I assure you. I had it seen to. Can we please expedite this process? I have a surgery scheduled for this afternoon. .
DOCTOR: "Minor fall." And did you experience any head trauma during this fall, Ms. Julie?
