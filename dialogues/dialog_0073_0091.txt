DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. I’m Dr. Korrell. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, lately I does be feeling very thirsty. All the time, thirsty. And hungry too, even after I eat a good plate of food. It not making sense, you know?
DOCTOR: Thirsty and hungry… even after eating. Hmm. And how long has this been going on for, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Let me see… maybe about a month now? It start slow, like I just needed a little more water with me meals. But now… now I does be drinking a whole lot. And still thirsty! And I eat, I really do, but the hunger come back quick. It worrying me, Doctor.
DOCTOR: A month. Alright. And has anything else changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can think of, really. My husband, Roland, he say I does go to the bathroom more often, but I thought that was just from the water I does be drinking! Everything else same, same. I does still cook, still go to church on Sundays… nothing different, just the thirst and the hunger.
DOCTOR: I see. And you mentioned going to the bathroom more frequently. Is that during the day, at night, or both?
PATIENT: Mostly during the day, Doctor. I does find myself going to the bathroom a little more often after I drink. Not so much at night, thankfully. I still sleep alright, but I does wake up sometimes for a little drink of water. But mostly it's the daytime.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any blurry vision, any unexplained weight loss, or any fatigue – feeling unusually tired?
PATIENT: Blurry vision… no, not really. My sight is still good. Weight loss, no, I don't think so. Maybe a little, but I put that down to the heat, you know? It hot, hot, hot these days. And tired… well, I does get tired, but I'm sixty-three years old, Doctor! I get tired easy. Does that make sense? I don't feel more tired than usual.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Diabetes… hmm. My mother’s sister, she had it, yes. Auntie Esme. She had to take injections, I remember that. She wasn’t too happy about it. A long time ago, though. I don’t know if that matter. Is that what you thinking, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s something we need to consider, Ms. Zicarelli. Given your symptoms and your aunt's history, we'll need to do a few tests. I’d like to check your blood sugar levels. Would you be agreeable to a simple blood test?
PATIENT: A blood test? Yes, yes, that alright. If it could find out what wrong, I happy to do it. I just want to feel normal again, you know? All this thirst and hunger… it worrying me. What does it involve, Doctor? Is it painful?
DOCTOR: It’s a very simple blood draw, Ms. Zicarelli. A small prick of a needle, really. You likely won't even feel it. We'll need a sample to check your glucose levels, and perhaps a few other things to get a clearer picture. Let's go ahead and get that done, and then we can discuss the results. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood.
PATIENT: A small prick, you say? Alright. I suppose I can handle that. I not too fond of needles, but if it help… yes. The nurse will be in, you say? Okay, I’ll just sit here and wait then. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent. While we wait for the results, let’s just quickly go through a few other things. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of, Doctor. Never had a problem with any medicine before. Roland, my husband, he does give me something for my arthritis sometimes, but I never react bad to it. Just a little sleepy, that’s all. I can’t remember the name of it, though. It’s a white pill. Is that important? Knowing the name? I don't think so. I never have any swelling or trouble breathing, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any other medications, besides the arthritis pill?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Just that one for my arthritis when it’s really bad. I try to manage it with heat and massage mostly. I don't like taking too many pills, you know? They does always have side effects. Roland keeps telling me to go to a specialist, but I don't like the idea of more doctors.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your past medical history, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Past medical history… well, I had the flu a few times, of course. And I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, climbing a mango tree. Silly thing to do, now that I think about it. And I had a bad case of the shingles a few years back, that was very painful. Other than that… nothing much, Doctor. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. I never been a sick person, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And regarding any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I had my appendix out when I was young, maybe twenty years old. And I had a hysterectomy when I was thirty-five. That’s it, Doctor. Two surgeries. Nothing since then. I try to stay healthy, you know? Eat my fruits and vegetables, walk in the garden with Roland… that’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens no, Doctor! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Roland used to smoke a little, but he gave it up years ago, thank goodness. And drink… I does have a little glass of wine with my Sunday dinner sometimes, but that’s it. Just a small glass, to relax. Nothing more. I don’t need any trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, any family history of other significant medical conditions besides your aunt’s diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My father, he had high blood pressure. He was always complaining about headaches. And my mother, she had arthritis, just like me. Bad arthritis in her hands. Other than that… not that I can remember, Doctor. My family mostly lived long lives, but they weren’t always healthy. It was different back then, you know? People didn't go to the doctor as much. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Zicarelli. That’s all the information I need for now. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood. We'll review the results as soon as they're available. It's likely we'll need to repeat some of these tests if the initial results are unclear. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. Just… when do you think I’ll get the results? I’m a little anxious, you know? And… will I feel any different after the blood test? Will it make me tired? I just want to know what’s wrong, so I can get back to normal.
DOCTOR: The results should be back within the hour, Ms. Zicarelli. As for feeling different, no, the blood test itself shouldn’t make you feel any worse. You might feel a slight pinch when the needle goes in, but that's all. We'll call you as soon as we have the results and schedule a follow-up appointment if needed. The nurse will be with you shortly. .
