DOCTOR: Hello Bradlee, welcome. I’m Dr. Kamahele. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. I think… I’m here about getting surgery? For, you know… weight loss. My wife helped me set this up. Honestly, I don’t remember all the details. It’s been a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, weight loss surgery. That’s perfectly alright, Bradlee. It's very common to feel a bit lost in the details, especially with everything going on. Don’t worry, we’ll go through it together. First, let’s just talk a little bit about why you're considering surgery. Could you tell me a bit about your weight journey?
PATIENT: My… weight journey? Hmm. It’s always been a bit of a struggle, I guess. I used to be more active, but… things changed. I don’t really remember when exactly. Work, mostly. Long hours. Not a lot of time for… anything, really. And then there’s the food… my wife is a wonderful cook, but… well, it's easy to get into bad habits, you know? I just… got bigger. It’s hard on my knees, mostly. And I get tired easily. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Bradlee. Long hours, stress, delicious food… those things can definitely make it difficult to maintain a healthy lifestyle. And it's very common for weight to impact your knees and energy levels. You mentioned it’s hard on your knees and you get tired easily. Could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, my knees… they ache, especially if I stand for a long time. I work in a store, so that’s… pretty much all day. And going up stairs? Forget about it. It’s just… painful. As for the tiredness… I just feel worn out all the time. Even after a full night’s sleep, I don’t feel rested. It makes it hard to… well, do anything, really. Play with my grandkids, even. That’s the hardest part. I miss that.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds incredibly frustrating, Bradlee. And wanting to be able to play with your grandkids is a wonderful reason to want to make a change. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I think the doctor said something about my cholesterol being a little high a while back? But nothing… serious, I don’t think. No diabetes, no… high blood pressure. I’ve had a few aches and pains, but I just figured that was from being on my feet all day. I honestly don’t go to the doctor very often. My wife usually handles all that. She'll know more about it, if that helps.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Bradlee. We can definitely look through your records. And it's helpful to know your wife is involved. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… I think I had my appendix out when I was a kid? A long time ago. And… maybe a tonsillectomy? I don't really remember. Hospitalized… not really. Just the usual… flu shots and stuff. Nothing major, I don’t think. Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix and tonsils, that’s good to know. Let's talk about your family. Is there a history of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, or any other health problems in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom… she had some problems with her heart, I think. And my dad… he was a bit overweight, yeah. And my brother… he has diabetes. I think. It's been a while since we talked. My wife knows more about the family history, honestly. She's always been good with remembering those things. She keeps track of everything. I just… try to take things one day at a time, you know? It’s hard to keep track of all that.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Bradlee. It sounds like there's a family history of heart problems and diabetes, which is helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And very rarely any alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And definitely no drugs. Never been interested in any of that. My wife would kill me if I did!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Bradlee. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Uh… let me see. I take a little something for my cholesterol, I think. A small pill. And sometimes, when my knees are really bothering me, I take ibuprofen. That’s about it. Nothing else, I don’t think. My wife handles most of that too, so she’d know for sure. She keeps a list of everything. I’m terrible with names and pills, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, cholesterol medication and ibuprofen as needed. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. Maybe a little bit of a stuffy nose sometimes during allergy season, but nothing serious. I wouldn't say I have any real allergies. My wife always asks me, but I always tell her no. She worries a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Go ahead. Just… try not to poke too hard on my knees, okay? They’re a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Of course, Bradlee. I'll be very gentle. Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148/92. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, let's take a look at those knees. Okay, there's some mild swelling on both knees, and tenderness to the touch, especially on the inner side. Your range of motion is a little limited, but not severely. It sounds like there’s some osteoarthritis present, which is common with weight-bearing activities and increased weight. Now, I'd like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health and rule out any other underlying conditions. This will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid test. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… about right. They usually ache a bit afterwards. Blood work… yeah, okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. My wife will probably want to know all the results anyway. She’s very… thorough. Just… let me know when I need to come back for those. I don't really like needles, but… I'll do whatever it takes.
DOCTOR: Of course, Bradlee. We’ll get that scheduled for you as soon as possible. It's a quick process, and the lab technicians are very good at making it as comfortable as possible. While we wait for the results, let’s discuss your options for weight loss surgery. There are several different types of procedures, each with its own risks and benefits. We'll need to consider your overall health, your lifestyle, and your personal preferences to determine the best course of action. Have you already done any research on the different types of weight loss surgery?
PATIENT: Not really. My wife did some looking online, I think. She mentioned something about… a sleeve? And a bypass? But honestly, it all sounded very complicated. I just kind of nodded and let her do the talking. I get overwhelmed easily when it comes to medical stuff. I just want something that will help me get back to playing with my grandkids. That’s all.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Bradlee. It is complicated, and it's easy to get overwhelmed. The two procedures you mentioned are the sleeve gastrectomy and the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. The sleeve gastrectomy involves removing a large portion of your stomach, leaving a smaller, tube-shaped “sleeve.” This restricts the amount of food you can eat and reduces the production of a hormone that makes you feel hungry. The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass involves creating a smaller stomach pouch and connecting it directly to the small intestine, bypassing a portion of your stomach and duodenum. This also restricts food intake and reduces hormone production. Both procedures can be very effective for weight loss, but they also have risks and potential complications. To help me determine which procedure might be right for you, I’d like to get a more detailed medical history and conduct a thorough physical exam. We’ll also need to discuss your lifestyle and your goals for weight loss. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hmm… that sounds… a lot. Honestly, Doctor, all those big words… it’s making my head spin. I guess… I trust your judgment. Whatever you think is best. I just… I want to be able to run around with my grandkids again. And maybe not get so winded walking up the stairs. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Absolutely not, Bradlee. That's not too much to ask at all. And you're right to trust my judgment. I'll take the time to explain everything in a way that you understand, and we'll make a decision together. For now, let's focus on getting those blood work results back. Once we have those, we can discuss your options in more detail. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Uh… I guess… how long will the surgery take? And… will it hurt? I’m not good with pain. And… will I be able to eat anything afterwards? My wife makes a wonderful lasagna…
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Bradlee. Let’s start with the surgery itself. The length of the surgery varies depending on the type of procedure and the individual patient, but it typically takes between one and three hours. As for pain, we’ll do everything we can to manage it. We’ll give you pain medication before, during, and after the surgery, and we’ll monitor your pain levels closely. Most patients experience some discomfort in the first few days, but it’s usually manageable with medication. And finally, you’ll definitely be able to eat again, but it will take some time to adjust to your new stomach size. We’ll start you on a liquid diet, then gradually introduce soft foods, and eventually work our way back to a normal diet. You may need to make some changes to what you eat, but you’ll still be able to enjoy your wife’s wonderful lasagna – just in smaller portions. We’ll have a registered dietitian work with you before and after the surgery to help you with meal planning and portion control. Does that answer your questions?
PATIENT: Yeah… that sounds… okay. Smaller portions of lasagna… I can live with that. Okay. So… blood work, then we talk more. And a dietitian. Got it. I think… I think that’s all my questions for now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you. I guess I’ll wait to hear from your office about the blood work.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Bradlee. I'm glad I could help. And don't hesitate to call if you think of anything else. My staff will be in touch to schedule your blood work and follow-up appointment. In the meantime, try to focus on taking care of yourself and getting some rest. We’ll get through this together. Have a good day, Bradlee.
