DOCTOR: Alright, Jase, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's… my stomach. It's been, well, not good. I keep getting diarrhea. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it's just… persistent. I think that's the word? I honestly don't remember exactly when it started, just that it has been a while.
DOCTOR: Persistent, okay. “A bit now” isn’t very specific, unfortunately. Can you give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Ugh, you’re right. Sorry. Let me think… Maybe a couple of months? It comes and goes, but it’s always there, you know? Like, a few good days, then a bad day, then okay again… but never fully gone. I feel like I’m always worried about it flaring up. Honestly, it's hard to keep track, it just… blends together.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a couple of months of intermittent diarrhea. And when you say "flaring up," what does that look like?
PATIENT: Well, when it’s bad… a lot. Like, several times a day. And it’s… watery. Not solid, definitely. And sometimes I get cramps, really bad ones, in my stomach. Makes it hard to… well, you know. And I feel really tired afterwards. Just… drained. I think I lost a little weight, but I haven’t actually weighed myself recently. My husband might know.
DOCTOR: Okay, watery diarrhea, cramps, fatigue… Has there been any blood in the stool?
PATIENT: Oh… um. I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. It’s… I try not to look, if I’m being honest. It’s unpleasant. Does that make sense? I just… quickly clean up and try to forget about it. I’m really sorry I don't have a better answer.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s understandable you wouldn’t want to look. But it’s important information. Okay, let's move on. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I’ve tried to figure that out. I don’t think so, really. I mean, sometimes after I eat, but I eat pretty much the same things all the time. Maybe dairy? I have a glass of milk with breakfast, but I’ve always had milk… I'm really not sure. It feels random, to be honest. It’s just… there. And then it's not. Then it is again. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Random, okay. And what about anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Um… nothing really. Not that I’ve found. I try to drink a lot of water, and that helps a little with feeling tired, but it doesn’t stop the… issue. Sometimes just resting helps, but that’s not a solution, you know? I just… wait it out. It’s kind of frustrating, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain besides the cramping?
PATIENT: No fever, no. Sometimes I feel a little… queasy, but I haven’t actually been sick. No vomiting. Just the cramps and the… everything else. And the abdominal pain is just… from the cramps, I think. It’s not like a constant ache or anything. It comes and goes with the cramps. Honestly, I'm starting to feel silly, I can't really explain it well. I'm not very good at describing things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s talk about your medical history. Any previous medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… well, my doctor told me a while back that I might have something with my stomach. Something about not being able to handle certain foods… I can’t remember the name of it. I think it started with an “I”? It’s been a long time, and I don’t really remember all the details. My husband might know better. And I have the usual, like… high blood pressure, but it’s controlled with medication. Other than that, not really. Does that help? I’m sorry I’m not being very useful.
DOCTOR: An “I”… Irritable Bowel Syndrome, perhaps?
PATIENT: Maybe? That sounds… vaguely familiar. I think she said something about needing to be careful with what I eat. And that it could cause… flares? I honestly don’t remember. It was a long time ago, and I was really stressed about work at the time. I didn’t really listen properly, I think. I just took the medication and tried to avoid anything that seemed to make me feel bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Um… sometimes I take something for the cramps. Something over the counter. Like… Imodium, I think? When it's really bad. But I don't take it very often, because it doesn't always help. And… oh! Sometimes I take a probiotic, my friend recommended it for stomach issues. I'm not sure if it's helping, though. I started taking it a few weeks ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, Imodium as needed, probiotic recently started… Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat a lot of different foods, and I’ve taken all sorts of medications over the years without any problems. I think. I’m really trying to remember everything, but it’s hard. My brain just feels… foggy sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your abdomen, and feel around a bit. It won’t be anything unpleasant, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. That sounds… fine. Hopefully it will give us some answers. I'm just… worried it's something serious, you know? I keep thinking about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just lie flat on your back, arms at your sides. I’ll start with auscultation. Normal bowel sounds… slightly hyperactive, but nothing concerning. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. A little discomfort in the lower left quadrant, but not sharply painful. No rebound tenderness, no guarding. Okay. Everything seems relatively normal, but we need to rule out a few things. I’m going to order a stool sample analysis to check for infection or parasites. And a complete blood count, just to check your overall health.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… good. A stool sample, right? Is that… difficult? I'm a little embarrassed to ask. And the blood test, that's just a normal prick of the finger, right? I'm not good with needles, but I can handle it, I think. I just... want to figure out what's going on. This has been going on for so long.
DOCTOR: The stool sample is straightforward. The lab will provide you with a collection kit and instructions. It's not pleasant, no, but necessary. And yes, the blood test is a simple prick of the finger. A small sample will be all that's required. I'll have the nurse explain the procedures to you in detail. We'll review the results once they’re available, and then we’ll discuss further treatment options. In the meantime, try to stay hydrated and avoid any foods that you suspect might be triggering your symptoms. Honestly, it sounds like a mild case of Irritable Bowel Syndrome. We’ll confirm with the tests, but dietary changes are likely to be the most effective solution.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. Dietary changes. That’s… something I can try. And the nurse will explain everything? That’s good. I appreciate that. I just… I was really worried it was something serious. Thank you, Doctor. I'll go speak to the nurse now, then?
DOCTOR: Yes, go ahead. The nurse is right outside. Try not to worry too much. And remember, it’s likely just IBS. Now, where were we…
PATIENT: .
