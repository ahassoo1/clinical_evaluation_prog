DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kobler. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… pleasant to meet you too. Um, well, it’s my breathing. It feels… shorter, lately. And my mouth and eyes are very dry. It’s been going on for a little while now, I think. I’m not very good with remembering dates, sadly.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath and dryness in your mouth and eyes… and you said this has been going on for “a little while.” I understand remembering dates can be tricky. Let's try to get a better idea of when it started, even roughly. Was it before or after the summer started, for example?
PATIENT: Hmm… before the summer, I believe. Yes, definitely before it got very warm. It wasn’t… sudden, you see. It sort of… crept up on me. I was… divorced not long ago, and I’ve been doing a lot of writing since then. Perhaps it’s… stress? Though I don’t feel particularly stressed. It’s just… a thought.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that, Ms. Kobler. Life changes can certainly impact our health, even if we don’t consciously feel stressed. It's good you're considering that. And writing is a wonderful outlet. Now, let’s focus on the breathing. Can you describe how it feels short?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. Not like I’ve been running, and then I’m out of breath. It’s more… like I can’t get a full breath. Like something is… stopping me, a little bit. Even when I’m just sitting. It doesn't hurt, exactly. Just… insufficient. And it makes me thirsty all the time, which is why I noticed my mouth being dry too. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. "Insufficient" is a helpful way to put it. So, it’s not exertion-related, it's present even at rest, and is accompanied by increased thirst and dryness. Do you notice it happening more at any particular time of day, or in specific situations?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. It seems… fairly constant. Maybe… a little worse when I’m concentrating on my writing. But I do a lot of writing, so it’s hard to say if that’s the cause. I often lose track of time when I’m immersed in a story. Perhaps I’m just not noticing it as much at other times? I really am not sure. It's… frustrating to not know. Do you think it could be… my sinuses? I have always had trouble with them.
DOCTOR: It could be related to your sinuses, Ms. Kobler, though the constant nature and dryness make that less likely as the sole cause. We’ll need to explore other possibilities as well. Let’s move through a quick review of your systems. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or ankles?
PATIENT: Swelling… no, not that I’m aware of. I wear boots fairly often, so it would be difficult to tell, perhaps. They're quite snug. But I haven’t noticed anything unusual when I take them off. No pain or redness either. Just… regular boot-shaped feet, I think.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Alright. How about your heart?
PATIENT: My heart? Um… it beats, I presume. I haven’t noticed anything… irregular. No fluttering, or pain, or anything like that. I suppose I’m not very observant of such things. I mostly notice it when I’m… emotionally moved by a scene I’m writing. Does that count?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And yes, that certainly counts. It’s good you’re aware of how your body feels in different situations. Let's talk about any fevers, chills, or night sweats you may have experienced recently. Even a mild temperature can be significant.
PATIENT: No, none of those. No fever, no chills, and certainly no night sweats. I sleep quite soundly, actually. Though I do have… vivid dreams. But I wouldn’t call them sweaty dreams. Perhaps that's too much information. I apologize. I tend to… ramble when I’m nervous.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Ms. Kobler. It's helpful for me to get a complete picture. Vivid dreams aren't necessarily a concern. Now, let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, like asthma, allergies, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Um… I don't think so. Not that I recall. I was… quite healthy as a child. My grandmother always said I had a robust constitution. I did have… a bad bout of the flu once, when I was very young. But that’s the only thing I can think of. And no allergies, as far as I know. I live quite remotely, and haven’t been exposed to many… allergens. I did have a minor injury to my ankle, years ago. But it healed completely.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chronic conditions, a childhood illness, and a past ankle injury. What about any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no hospitalizations. I've been very fortunate in that regard, I suppose. I… tend to avoid doctors when possible. It's not that I dislike them, exactly. It’s just… I prefer to manage things myself, if I can. Though clearly, I can't manage this breathing issue alone. That’s why I’m here.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in when you did. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, lung problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: That’s… difficult. I didn’t know my father very well, and my mother… she didn’t talk much about her family. She was a very private person. I know she had… some sort of stomach trouble, when she was older. But beyond that, I’m afraid I don’t have much information. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, lived to a very old age. But I don’t know anything about her health either. It’s… a bit of a mystery, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Kobler. It's common to have limited information about family medical history. Let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I do not smoke, drink, or use any recreational drugs. I find… solace in my writing. And fresh air. And strong tea. Those are my vices, if you can call them that. I’ve never been tempted by such things, truthfully. I prefer a clear head, for the stories, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And finally, do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't. I haven’t taken many medications in my life, so I haven’t had the opportunity to have any allergies. I once had a… mild reaction to a bee sting, years ago. But it was just local swelling. No trouble breathing or anything like that. Just a bit of discomfort. I do get drowsy from chamomile tea, if that counts. But it's a rather pleasant drowsiness, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kobler. Thank you for providing all of that information. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, check your oxygen saturation, and take your blood pressure. This will give me a better understanding of what's going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Please, proceed. I’m… ready whenever you are. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have a story waiting to be written, you see. But I understand my breathing is more important, at the moment.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll be as quick as possible. Please have a seat and lean forward slightly. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… Okay. Your breathing sounds a little… diminished on both sides, but not significantly wheezy or crackly. Now let me listen to your heart. Your heart rate is regular, but a little… fast. Blood pressure is 130/80. Now, let's check your oxygen saturation. Oxygen is 94%, which is a little low, but not critically so. Do you feel any dizziness when you stand up quickly?
PATIENT: No, not usually. I am rather… careful when I stand. I don't like sudden movements. It makes me… disoriented. But I haven't experienced any dizziness, no. Though… now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit… fatigued lately. Just a general… weariness. But I attributed that to the writing. And perhaps a lack of sunshine. I've been indoors quite a bit, working on the story. Is that… concerning?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re observant of these changes, Ms. Kobler. The fatigue and slightly low oxygen saturation, combined with the diminished breath sounds, are things we need to investigate further. I’m not immediately alarmed, but we need to rule out a few possibilities. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. The X-ray will help us visualize your lungs and heart, and the blood count will check for things like anemia or infection. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible. Yes, please, order those tests. I trust your assessment, Doctor. I’d rather know what’s going on, even if it’s… unpleasant. Where would I go to have those done? And how long will it take to get the results? I have… a deadline, you see. Though I’m sure my story can wait, if necessary.
DOCTOR: Of course. The X-ray and blood count can be done at the Rural General Hospital, just down the road. They should be able to fit you in tomorrow morning. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back, but I’ll call them directly to expedite the process as much as possible. I’ll also have the lab fax the results to my office. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of albuterol inhaler. It's a bronchodilator that can help open up your airways, just in case. I would also recommend you stay well-hydrated and avoid any strenuous activity until we have the test results. And if you start experiencing any chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or a fever, please head to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds… clear. An albuterol inhaler, stay hydrated, avoid exertion, and watch for emergencies. I can manage that. Thank you, Doctor. And… what does this mean, if you don't mind me asking? Is it something serious? I know you probably can’t say for sure until the tests come back, but… a general idea would be helpful. I tend to… worry, you see. Even though I pretend to be stoic.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Ms. Kobler. Based on what we’ve discussed, the diminished breath sounds and low oxygen saturation could indicate a few things. It could be something as simple as a mild infection, like bronchitis, or it could be something more significant, like asthma or early signs of pneumonia. Less commonly, it could be related to heart problems, which is why we're getting the X-ray. The blood count will help us rule out infection and assess your overall health. It's too early to say definitively what's going on. The tests will give us a much clearer picture. I want to assure you I'm not immediately concerned about anything life-threatening, but it’s important to investigate these symptoms thoroughly. We'll discuss the results as soon as they come in, and then we can create a plan to get you feeling better. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of before prescribing the inhaler?
PATIENT: No, I do not. I haven’t had any negative reactions to medications, as far as I know. No allergies. I appreciate your… thoroughness, Doctor. And your reassurance. It’s… comforting. I suppose I should go and schedule those tests now? At the Rural General Hospital? I’m ready, whenever you think I should. I just… want to get this sorted, you see. So I can return to my story.
DOCTOR: Yes, please go to the Rural General Hospital as soon as possible. Tell them I referred you, and they should be able to prioritize your tests. The sooner we have the results, the better. I'll be in the office all week, so please call my office as soon as you have the results, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment. Here’s my card with the office number. In the meantime, try to get some rest, stay hydrated, and avoid anything that makes your breathing worse. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you experience any concerning symptoms. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don't believe so. You’ve been very… patient and informative, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. And your reassurance. I suppose… that will be all, for now. Thank you, again. I will call as soon as I have the results. I hope I haven't taken up too much of your time. It's just… my breathing. It worries me, you see. But I trust you to help me sort it out.
DOCTOR: You haven't taken up any time at all, Ms. Kobler. It’s my job to help, and I’m glad you came in. Don’t worry, we’ll get to the bottom of this. And remember, if anything changes, or you feel worse, don’t hesitate to call. Have a good day, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
