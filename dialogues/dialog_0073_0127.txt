DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schaust. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit hard to explain, really. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally. And my eyelids… they feel heavy, and they’re drooping a bit, I think. It’s been happening gradually, over the last few months, but it's definitely getting more noticeable.
DOCTOR: Weakness and drooping eyelids… “gradually,” you say?
PATIENT: Yes, gradually. It didn’t happen overnight, thankfully. At first, I just thought I was tired, you know? A bit run down. But it hasn’t gotten better with rest, and… well, it’s starting to worry me. It makes me look… sleepy, I suppose. And it's getting harder to keep my eyes open for long periods.
DOCTOR: "Sleepy," alright. And is this weakness… all over, or in specific parts of your body?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… it's more noticeable in my arms and legs. Like, lifting things feels harder than it used to. And I get tired quicker when I'm walking, even just short distances. It’s not… crippling, or anything, but it's definitely there. It’s… frustrating, to be honest. I used to be quite active.
DOCTOR: Frustrating, yes, I can imagine. And how would you rate this weakness, on a scale of one to ten, with ten being the worst it could possibly be?
PATIENT: Oh, um… a scale of one to ten. Hmm. Let me think. It’s definitely not a ten, not even close. Maybe… a four? Five on a bad day? It’s not debilitating, like I said, but it is impacting things. I wouldn't want to try any heavy lifting right now, that's for sure. It's more of a constant… drag, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this weakness and eyelid drooping?
PATIENT: Let me see… other symptoms. Hmm. I’ve been a bit more… clumsy, I guess? Dropping things more often than usual. And I’ve noticed my speech feels… a little slurred sometimes, especially when I’m tired. Not all the time, but it’s happened a few times, and my ex-wife definitely pointed it out. She always notices everything. And, actually, now that I think about it, my vision has been a bit blurry lately too. It's hard to say if that's connected.
DOCTOR: Blurry vision, speech changes, clumsiness… This is becoming… more involved. Have you had any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: No, not really. I had a bit of a cold back in February, but that was it. Nothing major. No fever or anything like that. Just a normal cold. And I haven't been traveling anywhere, or been exposed to anyone who was sick, that I'm aware of. I keep to myself mostly, to be honest. Especially since the divorce.
DOCTOR: And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a tough one. My mother had… well, she had some sort of muscle problem when she was younger, I think. It wasn’t really talked about much. She passed away when I was quite young, so I don't know a lot of the details. My father… he was healthy as a horse, I think. Never sick a day in his life. He’s still alive, but we don't really talk much either. Not a close family, unfortunately. I'm not sure if that muscle problem my mother had is relevant, though. I wouldn't know what it even was.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I’m not. I try to avoid medication if I can. Never really been one for pills. Just the occasional headache tablet, if needed. Nothing regular, though. And no supplements or anything like that either. I generally try to eat healthy, but I haven’t been doing so well lately, to be honest. Everything’s been a bit… stressful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schaust. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I want to check your reflexes, strength, and eye movements. It’ll just be a few simple tests. Please follow my instructions.
PATIENT: Okay, yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you need me to do, Doctor. Just let me know. I’m a bit nervous, if you don't mind me saying. All this talk about muscle problems… it’s worrying me.
DOCTOR: Okay. Reflexes are… slightly diminished, but not significantly. Now, can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? Is that enough? I’m trying to squeeze as hard as I can, but my hands do feel a bit… weak, honestly. It's harder than it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Leg strength is… also diminished. Not dramatically, but noticeable. Now, let me check your eye movements. Follow my finger with your eyes, but keep your head still.
PATIENT: Okay, I’m following it. Is this alright? It’s a little… blurry, and it’s hard to keep my eyes focused. And my eyes are feeling quite tired now, to be honest. It feels like they’re… fighting me, a little. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your eye movements are slightly irregular. Based on what you've told me, and this brief examination, it's difficult to say definitively, but your symptoms are concerning for a possible neuromuscular disorder. However, it could be a variety of things. We need to rule out some other possibilities first. I'm going to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. I also want to check your vitamin D levels, as deficiency can cause muscle weakness. And I will be referring you to a neurologist for a more in-depth evaluation. It’s important to get this checked out properly. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. A neurologist… and blood tests. That sounds… serious. A neuromuscular disorder… that’s… frightening. Is it… is it something terrible? What are the possibilities? And how long will it take to get these tests done? I'm rather worried now, to be honest. I just want to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schaust, I understand your anxiety, but it’s important not to jump to conclusions. “Neuromuscular disorder” is a broad term. It could be something relatively benign, or it could be something more serious. We won't know until we have the results of these tests. As for possibilities… well, there are many. It could be myasthenia gravis, a condition that affects the communication between your nerves and muscles. Or it could be a vitamin deficiency, as I said. Or something else entirely. It’s simply too early to say. The blood tests should be back within a few days. I’ll schedule the neurology appointment as soon as possible, but it may take a few weeks to get in to see a specialist. In the meantime, I advise you to avoid strenuous activity and get plenty of rest. And, frankly, I recommend you stop searching for information online. It will only increase your anxiety. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s everything, Doctor. Though… thank you. For explaining everything, even if it is… worrying. I suppose I’ll just have to wait for the tests. And… try not to panic. Just… one small thing. Will these tests be expensive? I… I don't have insurance, you see. It’s a bit of a worry. I barely managed to pay for this appointment.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schaust, I understand your financial concerns. The blood tests will cost approximately $300. As for the neurologist appointment… that will vary depending on the specialist, but expect to pay around $400-$500. I can provide you with a list of neurologists who offer a sliding fee scale, based on income. There are also some local charities that may be able to assist with medical expenses. I can provide you with their contact information. But frankly, getting a diagnosis is the most important thing right now. We need to figure out what’s going on, regardless of the cost. I'll have the receptionist give you those details when you check out. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. For everything. I… I hope it’s nothing too serious. .
