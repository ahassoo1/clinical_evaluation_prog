DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I'm Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh, well, my sister... she got sick. Real sick. Cancer, they said. And my mother… she had something bad too, a long time ago. I just… want to make sure I’m okay. You know? I don’t feel bad now, but… it’s in the family. I want peace of mind.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schwer. It's very thoughtful of you to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of cancer. It’s good you're coming in to discuss this. Let's go over some things to get a better picture of your overall health. To start, can you tell me a little more about your mother's illness?
PATIENT: Um… it was a long time ago. I was just a boy. I think it was… something with her stomach? She was always tired, and then she lost a lot of weight. They took her to the hospital, but… it didn't end well. I don't really know what kind of sickness it was, just that it was… bad. They didn’t talk about things much back then. Sorry, I'm not very helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Schwer. It’s perfectly understandable that you wouldn't remember all the details, especially if it was a long time ago and a difficult experience. And no need to apologize, we'll gather as much information as we can. And it’s good to know it involved her stomach. Now, regarding your sister… do you know what type of cancer she was diagnosed with?
PATIENT: They said… lung cancer. She smoked for a long time. A long time. She's… she's getting treatment now. Chemotherapy, I think. She looks very tired. It's hard to see. I just... I don't smoke, never have, but… does that mean I'm safe? Is lung cancer something that runs in families even if you don't smoke?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Schwer. It’s good you've never smoked. While smoking is the biggest risk factor for lung cancer, there is a genetic component, meaning family history can play a role, though it’s not a direct inheritance like some diseases. To get a better sense of your risk, let's talk a little bit about your overall health history. Have you had any significant illnesses or hospitalizations yourself?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I had the flu a few times, like everyone. And I broke my arm when I was a kid, falling out of a tree. But… nothing serious. I go to the doctor for a check-up every year, usually. They say my blood pressure is a little high sometimes, but they haven’t given me any pills or anything. Just told me to watch my salt. I eat a lot of salty food, I’ll admit. And I don’t exercise much. I mostly sit at my desk all day. I sell things… wholesale goods. It’s a desk job.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, generally healthy, some slightly elevated blood pressure that’s been monitored, and a less active lifestyle. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Never had a bad reaction to anything. They gave me some penicillin when I was little, I think, for a sore throat. And I took some aspirin for headaches now and then. But… nothing bad ever happened. I can usually take anything they give me. I don't remember ever having to tell a doctor about allergies.
DOCTOR: Good. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements regularly?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Just… coffee. Lots of coffee. I need it to stay awake at work. But that’s it. No pills, no vitamins, nothing. I don't really believe in those things much. I just try to get by.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer. Thank you for that information. Now, to get a clearer picture of your current health, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Just a basic check of your blood pressure, heart, lungs, and a feel of your abdomen. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know I’m okay. Blood pressure is probably high, like they said. But the rest… I don’t know. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 145 over 90. Not alarmingly high, but something we should keep an eye on. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits, but we need to investigate further given your family history. I’d like to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. The blood work will give us a baseline of your overall health, and the chest X-ray will help us assess your lungs. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood work and an X-ray… okay. Will it be expensive? I’m on Medicare. And… when will I get the results? I’m a little nervous.
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, Mr. Schwer. Medicare should cover the majority of the cost, though there may be a small co-pay depending on your plan. We’ll verify that with them before proceeding. The lab results and the X-ray report should be back within 3 to 5 business days. Once I have them, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. We can go over everything, and I’ll answer any questions you have. In the meantime, is there anything else you’re experiencing – any unexplained weight loss, persistent cough, fatigue, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I'm a little tired sometimes, but that’s just from working too much. And I’m always a little bit overweight, but that’s from eating too much too. No cough, no weight loss… just… normal. Like I said, I feel okay. I’m just worried about… you know. The cancer. But… no, nothing wrong feels wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer. That's good to hear. We'll proceed with the blood work and chest X-ray as planned. I’ll have my nurse schedule those for you before you leave today. She’ll also give you some instructions on how to prepare for them, if necessary. I want to reassure you that we’re taking your concerns seriously and doing everything we can to ensure your health and peace of mind. While a family history of cancer is something to be aware of, it doesn't necessarily mean you'll develop the disease. We're taking a proactive approach to assess your risk and address any potential issues early on. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better just talking about it. And getting it checked out. I appreciate you taking the time. I guess just… get the tests done, and then come back?
DOCTOR: .
