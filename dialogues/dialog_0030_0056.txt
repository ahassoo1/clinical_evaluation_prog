DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, well. A pleasure, I suppose. Though I rarely find doctors… helpful. It’s about my work, naturally. It’s… taxing. Simply taxing. I’ve been a teacher for… a very long time. A long time. And it’s… wearing on me. I suspect it’s quite obvious. I’d rather not dwell on the details, if we’re being frank. Is there a form I need to fill out? Because I haven’t much time, you understand.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your frankness, Mr. Schlatterer. And yes, there is a brief form outlining your medical history and current medications, but we can certainly get through that quickly. It helps me to understand the bigger picture. However, let’s focus on what’s bringing you in today – this taxing work you mentioned. Could you elaborate a little on what “taxing” means?
PATIENT: Elaborate? Honestly. It means… it means the students are… less discerning these days. Less respectful. And the paperwork! Mountains of paperwork. It used to be about the books, about fostering a love of learning. Now it’s all… bureaucracy. And the administration… don’t even get me started. They want… results. As if one can simply manufacture intelligence. It's demoralizing, that's what it is. Demoralizing. Is that sufficient detail? I haven't the energy for a lengthy recitation of my grievances.
DOCTOR: That certainly sounds… challenging, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s understandable that dealing with those kinds of pressures would be demoralizing. And it’s good you’re recognizing that it’s taking a toll on you. When you say it’s “taking a toll,” can you tell me specifically how you're feeling?
PATIENT: Feeling? Oh. Well. I’m… tired. Constantly tired. Even after a full night’s sleep, which is increasingly rare, I might add. And… irritable. My ex-wife… she always said I was irritable. Perhaps she had a point. I find myself… snapping at colleagues. It's uncharacteristic, really. And… I haven’t been sleeping well, as I mentioned. Tossing and turning. Thinking about… everything. Honestly, it’s all rather unpleasant. Do you need me to list every symptom? I assure you, it’s a comprehensive catalogue.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Schlatterer, a comprehensive catalogue isn’t necessary at all. Tiredness, irritability, and difficulty sleeping are all very important things to tell me. These could be related to stress, but we want to rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Hmm. Now that you mention it… I suppose it’s diminished. Not drastically, you understand. I still eat. But I don’t enjoy it as much. Food… tastes rather bland, these days. And I’ve lost a little weight, I suspect. Though my tailor insists it’s merely the cut of my suits. He’s a rather optimistic fellow. I wouldn't say I'm wasting away, but it's noticeable. It's all connected, you see? The stress, the sleeplessness, the lack of appetite… it’s a vicious cycle.
DOCTOR: You’re right, it does sound like a cycle, Mr. Schlatterer. And it's good you're aware of that. Diminished appetite and some weight loss are things we need to investigate further. Now, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical history? Good heavens. That’s… a lengthy undertaking. I’ve lived a long life, you know. Let me see… I had a bout of pneumonia in my youth, nothing serious. And my back… my back has always been troublesome. Old war injury, they said. Though I was never actually in combat. Administrative work, mostly. And… I had my prostate checked, annually, for a time. Standard procedure. Honestly, I can't recall anything particularly noteworthy. I’m generally a healthy specimen, despite everything. I suspect this is all… nerves. Just nerves.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schlatterer. That’s helpful. And it's good you've been diligent about those prostate checks. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. There was… a tonsillectomy, when I was a boy. A rather unpleasant experience, I recall. And… oh, yes. A hernia repair, many years ago. Very routine, the doctor assured me. And… that’s it, I believe. Nothing major. I’ve been remarkably fortunate, all things considered. I pride myself on my constitution. Honestly, I'm not sure why I'm even here. It's probably just a temporary malaise.
DOCTOR: Thank you. It's good to know your surgical history. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Just a small dose of lorazepam, occasionally. For… the sleeplessness. As I mentioned. The doctor prescribed it a few months ago. Said it would help me relax. It does… somewhat. And a multivitamin, naturally. One must maintain one’s health. And… that’s it. I’m not one for pills, you understand. I prefer a good book and a quiet evening. Honestly, I suspect the lorazepam is making things worse.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. It’s good to be aware of everything you’re taking, even something you take occasionally. You’re right to be mindful of potential side effects. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… a depressing topic, frankly. My mother suffered from… melancholia, they called it. A rather vague diagnosis. Spent much of her life in a sanatorium. My father… he was a robust fellow. Lived to a ripe old age, but suffered from… gout, I believe. And my sister… she had high blood pressure. Nothing particularly noteworthy. A rather unremarkable lineage, all things considered. Honestly, I don't see what any of this has to do with my current predicament.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Schlatterer. Even seemingly unremarkable family history can be helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that even mean? Am I being interrogated? Look, I was married, briefly. A disastrous affair, best forgotten. I have a few… acquaintances, mostly colleagues. I don’t socialize much. Prefer my own company, and my books, naturally. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke. I lead a rather… solitary existence. Is that what you wanted to know? Honestly, I find these questions rather intrusive.
DOCTOR: I apologize if the questions feel intrusive, Mr. Schlatterer. We ask these questions to get a complete picture of your health and lifestyle. It helps us to understand potential contributing factors. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. None. I’ve never had an allergic reaction to anything in my life. Remarkably resilient, I am. Though I find certain modern authors… quite irritating. But that’s hardly an allergy, is it? Honestly, I’m starting to feel rather… fatigued. Is there a conclusion to this… assessment? I have appointments, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Schlatterer, we’re almost finished with the assessment. Thank you for answering all my questions so thoroughly. Based on what you’ve told me – the tiredness, irritability, difficulty sleeping, diminished appetite, and some weight loss – it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms of depression. It's important to remember that depression isn’t a sign of weakness, and it’s very treatable. To be certain, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam and order some blood work. The blood work will help rule out any other underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Depression? Me? Preposterous. I'm a highly rational individual. I spend my days surrounded by literature, by knowledge! I haven't the time for… emotions. Blood work? A physical exam? Honestly, it sounds… unnecessary. I suspect this is all a waste of time and resources. Still, if it will expedite the process… very well. But I assure you, the results will be unremarkable.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. I understand your skepticism. Let’s proceed with the physical exam, then. It's a routine check and will allow us to gather more information. First, I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Very well. Though I doubt it will reveal anything of consequence. Honestly, the indignity of it all… . Just get it over with. And please, be gentle. My veins aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Just relax your arm. I’m getting a reading of 148 over 88. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but that could be due to anxiety or simply the fact that it's being measured in a clinical setting. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me.
PATIENT: Anxiety? Perhaps. Though I maintain my composure admirably, all things considered. My heart… is perfectly sound, I assure you. I’ve never had a moment’s trouble with it. Though I do get a slight… flutter, occasionally. But that’s merely indigestion, I suspect. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, but I do hear some mild wheezing in your lungs. It's subtle, but it’s worth noting. Now, I’d like to take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Your ears look clear. Now, let me take a look at your throat… Say "ah."
PATIENT: Throat’s perfectly fine. I haven’t had a sore throat in decades. Though it does feel a bit… dry. Probably the air conditioning. Honestly, I find this entire process… demeaning. Are we nearly finished? I have a very important book waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Your throat is slightly red, but there are no visible signs of infection. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes. Please sit back and relax. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that can be normal at your age. Based on my examination, Mr. Schlatterer, your symptoms, and your medical history, I still believe depression is a strong possibility, but we need to rule out other causes. The blood work will help us with that. Would you be willing to proceed with the blood tests?
PATIENT: Diminished reflexes… of course. Everything’s diminished at my age. Honestly, it’s all rather predictable. Blood tests… Very well. Get it over with. But I’m telling you, it’s a waste of time. And I expect a full report, promptly. I haven’t the patience for prolonged uncertainty. Lead the way.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. The lab is just down the hall. A phlebotomist will draw a small sample of blood. It will only take a few minutes. Once the results are back, we’ll review them together and discuss the best course of action. If you'll follow me, I'll take you to the lab. And please, don't hesitate to let me know if you're feeling unwell at any point.
PATIENT: Very well. Lead on. But I warn you, I’m not fond of needles. And I expect a comfortable chair in the waiting room. This entire ordeal is… excessively inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. I’ll make sure there’s a comfortable chair waiting for you. And I understand your apprehension about needles. The phlebotomist is very skilled and will make the process as quick and painless as possible. Here we are. The phlebotomist, Sarah, is expecting you. She’ll explain everything. I'll be just outside if you need anything. Please, take your time.
PATIENT: Needles, you say? How… delightful. . Get it over with. But be warned, if I faint, it’s on your head.
DOCTOR: 
PATIENT: .
