DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, a friend suggested I come talk to someone about…well, about staying safe. She said there’s a pill you can take to help prevent HIV, and I figured it couldn’t hurt to learn more. I’m Helaina, by the way.
DOCTOR: Yes, Helaina, that’s perfectly alright. It's very proactive of you to consider all your options. Your friend is right, there is medication available – it’s called PrEP, pre-exposure prophylaxis. It’s very effective at preventing HIV. Before we talk about whether it might be right for you, though, I need to understand a little more about your situation. Just to start, have you ever been tested for HIV before?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. A few times, actually. Last one was… let me think… maybe two years ago? It was through a program downtown. Everything came back negative then, thankfully. I don’t really remember the name of the place, though. It was a while back.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Two years ago is… relatively recent, but we'll want to confirm those results if possible. Do you happen to remember who ordered the test, or have any paperwork from that visit?
PATIENT: Ugh, paperwork… no, not a chance. I’m terrible with keeping things. Honestly, Doctor, I just went, they took some blood, told me I was clear, and that was that. I didn’t think much past that, I guess. It was just… a check-up thing. I don’t remember anyone’s name. I’m so sorry, I really wish I could be more helpful. Is it a problem? Do I need to find that information?
DOCTOR: No, don’t worry about it. It’s not ideal, but we can proceed without it for now. We’ll just need to do another test today to be absolutely sure. Now, can you tell me a bit about your current health and lifestyle?
PATIENT: Okay, good. That’s a relief. Um… current health… I’m generally okay, I think. I have a little bit of arthritis in my knees, it acts up when it’s cold. And my blood pressure is… sometimes a little high, but I don’t take anything for it. Lifestyle… I work as a parking attendant downtown, mostly outdoors. It’s a lot of walking, a lot of being on my feet. I’m single, haven’t been with anyone seriously in… a long time. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Helaina. Thank you for sharing that. The arthritis and your work environment are good to know. And thank you for being open about your relationship status. It's important information when discussing preventative measures like PrEP. Now, just to be thorough, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything. I've taken antibiotics a few times when I’ve been sick, but nothing major. I don’t take any regular medications, like… for blood pressure or anything. Just the occasional pain reliever for my knees, and that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. That’s helpful. And do you have any family history of significant medical conditions – things like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had diabetes, later in life. And my father… he had heart problems, I think. He passed away when I was pretty young, so I don’t remember a lot of the details. My brother is healthy as far as I know, but we don’t talk much anymore. Does that help? It’s hard remembering all that stuff, honestly. Things happened a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Helaina. Thank you. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember everything. We’re just trying to get a general picture. Now, before we discuss PrEP further, and to make sure it's a good fit for you, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m just trying to get all the information I need, so if a check-up helps, then go ahead. I don’t have any appointments after this, so I’m not in a rush.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'll just listen to your heart and lungs. Then I’ll check your blood pressure, just to get a baseline. After that, a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. And finally, I’ll feel your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I sometimes get a little nervous around doctors, but I’m trying to be brave. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything.
DOCTOR: You're doing wonderfully, Helaina. No need to be nervous at all. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Okay, let's start with your heart. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, normal S1 and S2. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rales, or rhonchi.
PATIENT: Okay, good. That all sounds… good, right? I don’t really know what any of that means, but if you say it’s good, then I trust you. I get a little anxious when I hear “lungs” and “heart,” to be honest. My father… well, never mind. Just go ahead with the blood pressure, please. Hopefully, it’s not too bad. I’ve been a little stressed lately.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. We’ll take it one step at a time. Your father’s health is something we can discuss later if you'd like. It’s perfectly alright if you’re not ready to talk about it now. Okay, just relax your arm. Blood pressure is 142/88. That’s slightly elevated, but not alarming. Stress can definitely contribute to that. We’ll keep an eye on it. Now, let’s just take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat.
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Stress, definitely. Work is… hectic, sometimes. People are rude, and the sun is awful. Go ahead with the ears, nose, and throat. I hope I don’t have a cold or anything. I really don’t want to get sick. Especially not now. I just want to get this information and… see if this PrEP thing is right for me.
DOCTOR: Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Nasal passages are clear, slight congestion but nothing significant. Throat is clear, no redness or swelling. Everything looks good in there, Helaina. No signs of illness. Just a little bit of congestion, likely from the sun and stress. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses detected. Okay, all done with the physical exam. Everything seems to be within normal limits. Now, let’s talk about PrEP. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Okay, good. That’s… reassuring. I always worry about getting sick. I’m not a young woman anymore, you know? No, I don’t think so… not yet. You said it prevents HIV, right? Like… if I take the pill, I won’t get it? Is it like birth control? Are there side effects? And… is it expensive? Those are probably silly questions, but I just want to know everything before I make a decision.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, PrEP is a medication to prevent HIV. When taken consistently, it’s highly effective – over 99% effective when used correctly. It works by stopping the virus from establishing an infection. It’s not like birth control. It doesn’t protect against other sexually transmitted infections, and it doesn’t prevent pregnancy. You’ll still need to use condoms to protect against other STIs. As for side effects, most people don’t experience any. Some people report mild nausea, headache, or fatigue, especially when they first start taking it, but these usually go away within a month. We’ll monitor you closely to make sure you’re tolerating it well. And you’re right to ask about cost. PrEP can be expensive, but there are programs available to help with the cost, especially if you have Medicare. I have a team member who specializes in insurance and financial assistance, and they can help you navigate those options. We can discuss that after this consultation. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Okay, that makes a lot of sense. So, it's like… a shield, but only for HIV. I still need to be careful. And the side effects… I can probably handle a little nausea. I get seasick easily, so I'm used to feeling a little sick. Medicare… that's good. I don't know what I'd do without Medicare. I wouldn't be able to afford anything. So, if Medicare covers it, and there are programs to help… that's a good sign. What if… what if it doesn't work? Like, is there a chance I could still get HIV even if I'm taking the pill?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask about that, Helaina. While PrEP is highly effective, it’s not 100% foolproof. There is a small chance of contracting HIV even while on PrEP, but it’s rare – less than 1 in 100 people who take it consistently. The most common reason for failure is inconsistent use. It’s important to take the pill every day, as prescribed, to maintain a protective level in your system. Regular check-ups and STI screening are also crucial. Also, if you were to experience a high-risk exposure – for example, a condom breaks, or you have unprotected sex – it’s important to seek medical attention immediately. We can discuss post-exposure prophylaxis, which is a short course of medication that can help prevent infection if taken within 72 hours. Does that answer your question?
PATIENT: Okay… so, consistency is key. Take it every day, like my vitamins. And if something happens… I need to come see you right away. It just seems… complicated. I mean, I'm not a young woman anymore. I don’t really… have a lot of experience with all this. And honestly, it feels a little scary. Taking a pill every day to prevent something… it just feels… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, Helaina. It is a commitment, and it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. And you're right - it's not something everyone has experience with. It's brave of you to even consider it. And it is a commitment, and yes, taking it every day is important. But we can work together to make it manageable. We can set reminders, discuss strategies for staying consistent, and address any concerns you have along the way. It's also important to remember that you're doing this for yourself, to protect your health and well-being. And you're not alone - I'm here to support you every step of the way. If you'd like, we can start with a trial period. We can prescribe a one-month supply of PrEP, and you can see how it goes. If you find it too difficult, or you experience side effects you can't manage, we can always discontinue it. No pressure at all. What do you think?
PATIENT: A trial period… that sounds… good. Less overwhelming. And knowing I can stop if it's too much… that helps. Okay. Let's try it. Just a month. And if it doesn’t work out… no harm done. But… can you remind me again about the cost? And… what if I forget to take it? Will something terrible happen? I worry about forgetting things these days. My memory isn't what it used to be. It’s the arthritis medication, I think. Or maybe just getting older. Either way, I’m always afraid I’ll forget something important.
DOCTOR: Excellent. A one-month trial period is a perfect way to start. Now, let's address your concerns about cost and forgetting. The cost of PrEP can vary depending on your insurance coverage and the pharmacy you use. However, with Medicare, the cost is usually significantly reduced. My team member, Sarah, specializes in navigating these programs. She can review your coverage, identify any available discounts, and help you find an affordable option. I’ll have her reach out to you after this consultation. As for forgetting, it’s a common concern, and there are several strategies we can use. Setting daily reminders on your phone is a great start. You can also link it to an existing routine, like taking it with your arthritis medication, as you mentioned. There are also pill organizers and apps that can help you track your medication. And if you do forget a dose, don’t panic. Just take it as soon as you remember, within 24 hours. It’s more important to stay consistent overall than to worry about one missed dose. We'll discuss this in more detail during your follow-up appointment. Does that ease your concerns a bit?
PATIENT: Yes, that helps a lot. Talking to Sarah… that sounds good. And linking it to my arthritis medication… that’s a good idea. I take that every morning, without fail. Okay. I think I’m ready to try it. Just a month. And I’ll talk to Sarah about the cost and setting reminders. One last thing… what if… what if my partner doesn’t want me to take it? It's a long story, but he’s… old-fashioned. And he doesn’t really understand things like this. Will he need to know? It feels like a private matter.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Helaina. And you are absolutely right to consider this. It’s perfectly normal to feel apprehensive about discussing this with a partner, especially if they have different views. You are not obligated to disclose anything you're not comfortable sharing. PrEP is a personal health decision, and you have the right to make it independently. However, it's important to be aware that if you engage in sexual activity with a partner who is unaware of your HIV status or your use of PrEP, it could put them at risk. Open communication is always best, but ultimately, the decision of whether or not to disclose is yours. We can discuss strategies for having a conversation with your partner if you choose to do so, but we can also respect your privacy if you prefer not to. I can also provide resources for couples counseling if you think that might be helpful. Does that answer your question?
PATIENT: Yes, that does. It’s good to know I don’t have to tell him. He can be… difficult, and I don’t want to cause a fight. I think I’ll just keep it to myself, for now. Okay. So, let’s just get the prescription, and I’ll talk to Sarah about everything else. I think that’s all I need for today. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I was really scared, but I feel much better now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Helaina. I’m glad I could help. It’s perfectly alright to be scared, and you’ve been very brave to come in and discuss this. I’ll write the prescription for a one-month supply of PrEP now. And I'll have Sarah reach out to you shortly to discuss cost and strategies for staying consistent. Here's the prescription. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And I look forward to seeing you for your follow-up appointment. Take care, Helaina.
