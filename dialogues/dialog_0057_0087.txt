DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Sieh. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think? The usual. Honestly, I don’t really keep track of these things anymore. My memory… it’s not what it used to be. Is that what I’m here for? Just to get some blood drawn? Let's just get it over with, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Croonquist, no problem at all. It sounds like you’re due for your routine check-up and labs. While it is good to stay on top of those, even with a busy schedule or if remembering details is difficult, it’s helpful for me to get a little more information just to make sure we’re covering everything. Could you tell me a little bit about any health concerns you've been having lately?
PATIENT: Health concerns… hmm. Not that I recall. Everything feels… about the same, I suppose. A little creaky in the mornings, but that’s just old age, right? I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. I really don't think I have anything specific bothering me. Is this going to take long? I've got… things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, “about the same” is good to know. And yes, a little creakiness is very common with age! It's good you've come in now, though. We just want to make sure everything is as it should be. Just to be thorough, let’s go through a quick review of systems. This just means I’ll ask you a few questions about different parts of your body. It helps me get a broader picture. Starting with your heart – have you noticed any chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, not really. Palpitations… sometimes my heart feels like it’s doing a little flutter, but I always figured that was just from too much tea. Shortness of breath… only when I try to climb the stairs these days, but who does that anymore? I take them slow. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a complicated case. Just get the blood work done, alright? Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Croonquist, that’s not too much to ask at all. I understand your frustration. I promise, I’m trying to be quick and efficient. The tea explanation for palpitations is reasonable, and it's good you're pacing yourself with the stairs. Okay, let’s move on. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… it comes and goes, I guess. Some days I eat like a horse, others I don’t want much at all. Weight… I haven’t stepped on a scale in years. Definitely gained some, but who hasn’t? I used to be a lot thinner, back when I was… doing things. I don’t even remember what. It’s all a blur these days. Can we just skip this part? It feels like a lot of pointless questions.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Croonquist. We can certainly move along. It is a lot of questions, and it sounds like you're understandably feeling a bit overwhelmed. Just one quick question then – have you been having any trouble with your bowel movements or bladder function?
PATIENT: Ugh. Now you’re asking about that? Look, Doctor, I’m an old man. Things don’t work like they used to, alright? Let’s just say there's a little… irregularity. And I go to the bathroom more often than I’d like. Is that enough information? Can we please get to the blood work now? I really don't want to talk about this anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Croonquist, absolutely. We can definitely move on to the blood work. I apologize if those questions were unpleasant. It’s just part of a routine check-up, and I want to make sure I have a complete picture of your health. Before we head over to the lab, could you quickly tell me about any medications you are currently taking, or any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Medications… hmm. Let me think. I take a little something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. I get it refilled every few months. Other than that… nothing, not really. As for allergies… I used to be allergic to cats, but I haven't been around a cat in decades. Honestly, I don’t even remember if I still am. My memory is terrible, you know? Just the blood pressure pill. That's all I can remember.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small white pill for blood pressure. We’ll double-check the name with your pharmacy later to be sure. No known allergies beyond a possible cat allergy from many years ago. Good. Alright, Mr. Croonquist, let’s go ahead and get that blood work done. It will take about fifteen to twenty minutes. After that, I’ll take a look at the results and we can discuss them. Do you have any questions before we head over?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Just… get it over with, alright? The sooner this is done, the better. I've got things to do, you know? Important things. I just… want to go home.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Croonquist. Let’s go ahead then. I’ll have the phlebotomist ready for you. It will be over before you know it. This way.
PATIENT: Fine. Let's just get it done.
DOCTOR: Okay, the phlebotomist, Sarah, is very good. She’ll explain everything to you. She may ask you a few questions to confirm your identity. Just relax, and let me know if you feel lightheaded or uncomfortable at any point. I’ll be right outside if you need anything. Sarah: "Good morning, Mr. Croonquist! Dr. Sieh mentioned you’d like to get this done quickly and comfortably, and we’ll certainly do our best. Come on in and we'll get started."
PATIENT: .
