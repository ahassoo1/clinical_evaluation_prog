DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, I just moved here… recently. And I need to, like, get set up with a doctor. It’s for… Medicare, I think? My husband said something about a social healthcare visit… I don't really remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. Welcome to the area, and welcome to our clinic. A "social healthcare visit" sounds like your initial wellness exam with Medicare – a good way to get everything started. We'll go through a full check-up and make sure you're all set up. Just to confirm, your name is Emileigh Bonck, and you're 21 years old, correct?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Emileigh Bonck. Twenty-one… I think? Time kinda… blurs sometimes. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly okay. No need to worry about that at all. Sometimes things do blur. We’ll take things at your pace. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a little bit about why you're seeking medical care today, specifically?
PATIENT: Um… not really seeking care, exactly. Like I said, just moved. No problems, not that I remember. I work… with machines. Mechanical stuff. My husband says I should get a check-up, just to be sure everything’s okay since I’m new to the area. He worries a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, this is more of a preventative visit, getting established with a primary care physician while you’re settling in. That’s excellent – being proactive about your health is wonderful. And you mentioned working with machines. Is that physically demanding work?
PATIENT: Sometimes. It’s… a lot of lifting, yeah. And bending. Small parts, lots of detail work. My hands get kinda sore sometimes, but it's… normal, I think? It’s not like, painful pain, just… tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Lifting and repetitive hand movements can sometimes lead to strain. We’ll definitely take that into consideration. Before we get to a physical exam, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, just to get a complete picture. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – anything at all?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of. I don't really… go to the doctor. Not usually. My husband says I had the usual kid stuff… chickenpox, maybe? But nothing… serious. I really don't remember. I had a bump on my head once, when I was little, but that's it. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It sounds like you haven't had many medical issues in the past, which is great! A childhood bump on the head isn’t something to be overly concerned about unless it caused any lasting symptoms – like headaches or dizziness. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve never had surgery. Nope. Definitely not. I don't like hospitals, so… I avoid them.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly fine. No surgeries – good to know. Now, could you tell me about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Um… family? My mom… she had… something with her heart, I think? My husband told me. And my dad… he was okay, mostly. Worked in a factory. I don’t really… know much about their health stuff, honestly. We didn't really talk about it. Is that bad? I'm not very good at remembering things.
DOCTOR: It’s not bad at all, Emileigh. It's very common for families not to discuss medical history in detail. Knowing even a little bit is helpful, and what you've told me is a good start. A family history of heart issues is something we’ll keep in mind. Now, let's talk about your current lifestyle a little bit. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! Oh, no. Definitely not. I don’t do any of that. My husband would kill me. I drink… tea sometimes. And coffee. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Tea and coffee don't count! That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I know of. I think… I had a rash once, from a bug bite, but that wasn’t an allergy, right? I haven't really had… reactions to anything. I try to avoid bugs. Is that a good answer? I'm not very good at this.
DOCTOR: That is a good answer, Emileigh. No known allergies – that's excellent. And a healthy aversion to bugs is perfectly normal! Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or even herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I don't like taking pills. I just… try to get enough sleep. And drink lots of water. My husband says that’s good for everything. Does that count as medicine?
DOCTOR: That absolutely counts as good preventative care! Sleep and water are the best medicine. Alright, Emileigh. It sounds like you’re generally healthy, which is wonderful. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline and make sure everything looks good. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, okay. That’s fine. Just… please be gentle? I don't like doctors very much. Is it going to hurt?
DOCTOR: Of course, Emileigh. I will be as gentle as possible. I’ll explain everything as I go, and please stop me at any time if you feel uncomfortable. This won't be painful, just a few quick checks. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please sit back and take some deep breaths for me?
PATIENT: Okay… deep breaths. Like this? Is this right? I'm not very good at relaxing.
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, Emileigh. Just breathe normally, even if they're a little shaky – that's alright. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from your anxiety. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh! That’s… snug. Is it supposed to be that tight? I don't like feeling restricted.
DOCTOR: It is a little snug, I apologize. It needs to be tight enough to get an accurate reading, but I’ll loosen it as soon as we’re done. Your blood pressure is 130/85. That’s slightly elevated, but we’ll keep an eye on it. It can be affected by anxiety as well. Now, I'm going to take a quick look in your ears and throat. Could you open your mouth and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: Ah… Is there something wrong? I don't see very well. It’s kinda dark in here, and I feel a little dizzy.
DOCTOR: Your ears look clear and your throat is a little red, but nothing concerning. It could just be a mild irritation. Now, I’m going to quickly check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh! That tickles! Is it supposed to do that? My legs kinda feel… wobbly now.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly normal! It’s checking your reflexes, and it's good that they’re responding. It’s a good sign. Your reflexes are normal on both sides. Finally, I’d like to quickly palpate your abdomen, just to check for any tenderness.
PATIENT: Oh… that’s kinda weird. Is something wrong? Does it hurt? I just… I don't like people touching my stomach. Is it almost over?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Emileigh. I’m just checking for any tenderness. You're perfectly within your rights to let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. It doesn't feel like there's any pain, just some slight tension. Okay, we're almost done. That completes the physical exam. Everything seems within normal limits, though your blood pressure is slightly elevated and your muscles are a little tense, which could be related to anxiety. We'll keep an eye on both of those. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, good. It's over. Um… what does "slightly elevated" mean? Is it bad? And… why are my muscles tense? I didn’t even realize they were. Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Those are both very good questions, Emileigh. “Slightly elevated” blood pressure just means it’s a little higher than the ideal range, 120/80. It’s not immediately cause for alarm, but we want to monitor it. Stress and anxiety can definitely cause blood pressure to go up temporarily. We can recheck it at your next appointment. As for your muscle tension, that's very common with anxiety. Your body responds to stress by tensing up. It’s like when you’re startled – your muscles clench. It can cause aches and discomfort. It’s often something that improves with relaxation techniques and managing stress. Do you feel particularly stressed or anxious lately?
PATIENT: I don’t know. Maybe. Moving is stressful, I guess. And… I just feel kinda lost sometimes. Like I don’t remember things very well. It’s hard to explain. My husband says I worry too much. But I can’t help it. It’s just… always something. Will something be wrong with me?
DOCTOR: It sounds like you're going through a lot of changes right now, Emileigh, and it's completely understandable to feel lost and anxious. Moving is a major life event, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. And the fact that you’re aware of feeling this way is a good thing. Based on the exam today, I don't think anything is wrong with you, per se. Your physical health seems to be okay, but your body is responding to stress. The muscle tension and slightly elevated blood pressure are likely related to that. We can start with a few simple things. I’m going to recommend some relaxation techniques – deep breathing exercises, maybe some gentle stretching. There are also some resources I can give you for managing anxiety. And we’ll recheck your blood pressure at a follow-up appointment in a month. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Relaxation… okay. And a follow-up appointment… yeah, that sounds good. Resources for anxiety… are they, like, for people who are really anxious? I don’t want people to think I’m crazy. I just want to be normal. Will it… will it help?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel anxious, Emileigh. Everyone experiences anxiety at some point in their lives, and seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. The resources I'll give you are for anyone who wants to learn strategies to manage stress and anxiety – they're not just for people with severe anxiety. They include things like deep breathing exercises, mindfulness techniques, and information about healthy coping mechanisms. I understand your concern about being judged, but please don’t worry about that. Your health is our priority, and we’re here to support you without judgment. I'm going to recommend a website called the Anxiety & Depression Association of America – ADAA. It has a lot of helpful information. I'll also print out a few handouts on deep breathing exercises. And we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for one month from today to check your blood pressure and see how you’re doing. How does that sound?
PATIENT: ADAA… okay. And handouts… yeah, that sounds good. One month… that’s okay. Is it… is it okay if I call if I’m really worried before then? Just… if I can’t sleep or something? I just want to make sure everything is okay.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emileigh. Please, don’t hesitate to call if you're feeling overwhelmed before your follow-up appointment. Our nurses are always available to answer your questions and provide support. They can offer advice and help you determine if you need to be seen sooner. Here’s the number. Don't hesitate to reach out. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You were very nice. And… you didn't think I was crazy. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. It was my pleasure. And you definitely weren’t crazy! It takes courage to reach out for help, and I'm glad you did. I'll see you at your follow-up appointment in one month. In the meantime, take care of yourself and don’t hesitate to call if you need anything. .
