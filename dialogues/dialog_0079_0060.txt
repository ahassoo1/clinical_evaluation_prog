DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you are 24 years of age. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, good morning. Look, it’s…family history, mostly. My mom’s side, specifically. Lots of…problems. Heart stuff, mostly. And cancer. It’s just… looming, you know? I want to make sure I’m not headed that way. I figure if I just get checked out, I can… relax a little. It's probably nothing, but… better safe than sorry, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, "better safe than sorry" is a sensible approach. Though, frankly, anxiety about family history is… common. It's often disproportionate to actual risk. Nevertheless, we can certainly perform a thorough evaluation. To start, let's focus on the “heart stuff” you mentioned. Can you elaborate on what exactly your mother's side has experienced?
PATIENT: Ugh, okay. Well, my grandmother – my mom’s mom – died young. Relatively young, anyway. Early sixties. Heart attack, they said. Then my aunt, my mom’s sister… she had some kind of valve problem. Needed surgery. And my uncle… he has high blood pressure. Really high. Always on medication. It’s just… a parade of issues. They all seem to eat terribly too, which… doesn’t help, I guess. Though, I try to eat pretty well myself. Mostly.
DOCTOR: I see. A family history of premature coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, and hypertension. Yes, that is something we need to investigate. It's good you are proactive about your diet. Now, when you say “valve problem,” do you recall what specific type of valve issue your aunt experienced?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. I was pretty young when it happened. I just remember my mom being really stressed and then…a lot of recovery. I think it was something with…leakage? Or narrowing? I don't know the specifics. She never really talked about it much. It was just…a big thing. A lot of hospital visits. I wasn't very involved, I guess.
DOCTOR: Vague recollections are… not uncommon. Alright, we can proceed without that specific detail for now. Let's move on to the “cancer” you mentioned. What types of cancer have been present in your family?
PATIENT: Okay, cancer… that’s… more complicated. My great-aunt, on my mom's side, had… lung cancer. Smoker, obviously. Then, my cousin – my mom’s nephew – was diagnosed with leukemia a few years ago. He’s in remission now, thankfully. But the biggest thing… my grandfather, my mom’s dad… he had prostate cancer. That was…pretty bad. It spread. It was… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Lung cancer, leukemia, and prostate cancer… a concerning pattern, certainly. And the metastasis in your grandfather is… relevant. Now, in addition to these specific cancers, has anyone else in your family been diagnosed with any type of cancer, even a less aggressive form like skin cancer?
PATIENT: Ugh, you know what? My uncle, the one with the high blood pressure? He had a…basal cell carcinoma, I think. On his nose. They just…cut it out. It didn't seem like a big deal. But… that's about it, I think. My mom's constantly getting checked for things, but… so far, so good, thankfully. She’s terrified, though.
DOCTOR: Basal cell carcinoma is generally a localized issue, as you say. Alright. Let’s briefly discuss your own medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, whatever. But nothing major. I’ve broken a bone or two, playing sports, but… that’s it. No surgeries, no chronic illnesses, nothing. I’m generally…a healthy guy. Just…prone to worrying, I guess.
DOCTOR: No significant past medical history. That's… encouraging. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. I’m… not a fan of hospitals, to be honest. Even getting blood work makes me nervous. But I understand it’s necessary if I want to… figure things out. I just wish there was a way to know… without all of it, you know?
DOCTOR: Aversion to medical intervention is… understandable. Very well. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I try to avoid taking anything if I can help it. I drink a lot of water, I try to eat well, I exercise… I figure that's better than popping pills. A multivitamin sometimes, if I remember, but… that's about it. I’m pretty strict about not putting unnecessary things into my body.
DOCTOR: No current medications or supplements. Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I mean, I get hay fever in the spring, but that's just… normal, right? Not an actual allergy. Nothing serious, anyway. I've never been rushed to the hospital or anything for an allergic reaction. I'm pretty lucky in that regard, I guess.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Good. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. None of that. Never have, never will. I don't even like being around people who do. It's… unhealthy. Bad for you. I'm a pretty clean-living guy, as I've probably mentioned. It just seems… foolish. And risky.
DOCTOR: Very good. Now, and this is perhaps a delicate question, but it is important for a complete medical assessment: Are you sexually active, and if so, with whom?
PATIENT: Ugh. Look, I’m divorced. It’s been a few years. I’m… not currently in a relationship. And I haven’t been… active, let’s say, for a long time. It’s really none of your business, to be honest. Can we just skip this question? It feels…invasive. I’m here because of my family history, not my… personal life.
DOCTOR: Mr. Theriot, while I understand your discomfort, a thorough medical history requires addressing all relevant factors. Sexual history can indicate potential risk for certain infections, regardless of current status. However, if you are truly unwilling to disclose this information, we can proceed without it, though it will inevitably impact the comprehensiveness of your assessment. Let me assure you, everything is strictly confidential. But it's crucial to understand this represents a limitation to a complete evaluation. Now, before we proceed, let's briefly touch on your current living situation. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Fine. I live alone. Apartment. I… work a lot. Long hours. It’s… isolated. That’s all. Really. It's not like I'm out partying or… anything. Just me, my work, and trying not to think about everything that could go wrong. Happy now? Can we please move on to the tests? I want to know if I’m going to drop dead from a heart attack, not… whether I'm being sexually responsible.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your family history – premature coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, hypertension, and multiple cancers – a comprehensive workup is certainly warranted. We will begin with a physical examination, followed by blood work to assess your lipid panel, complete blood count, and basic metabolic panel. Depending on those results, we may also need to consider an electrocardiogram, and potentially further cardiac imaging. I would also recommend a baseline prostate-specific antigen test, given your grandfather’s history. Now, if you could please disrobe from the waist up, we can begin the examination.
