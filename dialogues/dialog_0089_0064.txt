DOCTOR: Hi Sherion, it's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my chest... it’s been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me a little. It feels like... a tight squeezing, you know? Like someone is hugging my chest too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tight squeezing sensation in your chest. That does sound concerning, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started maybe… three weeks ago? It was just a little bit at first, when I was walking up the stairs. But the last few days it’s been happening even when I’m just sitting and watching TV. I remember it was August 1st when it really bothered me. I was making dinner.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it's been progressively worsening over the last three weeks, with a noticeable increase since August 1st when you were making dinner. Does anything specific seem to trigger it, besides walking up stairs and, now, just resting?
PATIENT: Well… I think maybe when I get a little upset? My grandson, little Mateo, he’s a handful, you know? He was visiting and… well, he drew all over the new wallpaper. It made me a little… frustrated. And that's when it felt bad, that squeezing. But not every time I’m upset. Just sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so emotional stress can be a factor. That's helpful to know. Can you describe the pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It’s not a sharp pain, Doctor. It's… heavy. Like a weight on my chest. And it sometimes goes up to my left arm, a little bit. Not all the way, just… a dull ache. It doesn’t go to my back, though. And it's always on the left side.
DOCTOR: Alright, heavy, squeezing, left-sided chest pain radiating to the left arm—but not your back. And it started about three weeks ago, worsening recently with the incident on August 1st and potentially with emotional stress. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this chest pain?
PATIENT: Let me see… oh! Yes, I have been getting a little short of breath, but just when I walk. I live on a hill, you see, and walking up to the mailbox is harder now. And sometimes I feel a little dizzy, but just for a second. Not a lot. I also feel tired, but I'm an old woman, Doctor! So, who knows if that's anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath with exertion – walking uphill specifically – and occasional dizziness. The fatigue…we'll keep that on the list, but it's good you recognize that could be related to other things. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I have… let me think. The doctor told me I had high blood pressure, maybe ten years ago? I take a little pill for it every day. And my sugar was a little high once, but the doctor said it wasn't diabetes, just pre-diabetes, he called it. He told me to watch my sugar. Otherwise, no, I don’t think so. I’ve been pretty healthy for an old woman, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of hypertension, managed with medication, and a past finding of pre-diabetes. Do you remember what medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… it’s a little white pill. I think it starts with an ‘A’? A…amlodipine? Is that right? I get it from the pharmacy every month. And I take one every morning with my breakfast. I'm pretty good about my pills, you know. My husband helps me remember. He's a good man.
DOCTOR: Okay, amlodipine for hypertension. Good, that’s helpful. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. I’ve eaten everything! Colombiana, you see, we eat everything. I’ve never had a problem with any pills or food. My mother always said I had a strong stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! Yes. A long time ago, when I was younger, I had my gallbladder out. And… I was in the hospital for a little bit when I broke my arm, maybe twenty years ago? But that was just for a few days. Nothing else, not really.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal in the past and a short hospitalization for a broken arm. Do you have any family history of heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything else like that?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My father, he had… problems with his heart. He was sick for a long time, and the doctor said it was his heart. He was always tired. And my brother, he had high blood pressure, just like me. He took pills for it, too. And my mother, she had sugar problems. Not diabetes, but she had to watch what she ate.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a family history of heart problems, hypertension, and pre-diabetes. That’s very helpful information. Okay, Sherion, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to check your blood pressure and pulse. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherion, I listened to your heart and lungs. Your breathing sounds clear, but I did hear a slight murmur. It's not necessarily cause for concern, but we'll want to investigate it further. Your blood pressure is 150/90, which is a little elevated, and your pulse is 88 beats per minute. I'm also going to check your oxygen saturation, just to be sure. Your oxygen saturation is good at 96%. Now, I'd like to get a quick EKG done to check your heart rhythm, and then we’ll order some blood work. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. An EKG and blood work, okay. I trust your judgment. Is the EKG… uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: No, Sherion, the EKG isn’t uncomfortable at all. We'll just attach a few small stickers to your chest, arms, and legs to read your heart’s electrical activity. It doesn’t hurt, and it only takes a few minutes. I'll explain everything as I go. Just relax, and try to lie still. It's a very quick and simple test. Afterwards, we’ll do a quick blood draw to check your cholesterol, sugar levels, and other important markers. Does that all sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… much better when you explain it like that. Stickers and a quick blood draw. Okay, I can do that. Just tell me when to breathe. You are very kind, Doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherion, we've finished the EKG and the blood draw. It will take about 30-45 minutes for the lab results to come back. While we wait, is there anything else you’d like to tell me about your symptoms, or any other concerns you have?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, sometimes I feel a little bit of pain in my jaw when I'm walking, but I thought that was just my teeth. Old age, you know. And I also have been feeling a little bit more tired than usual, even when I’m not walking. I do try to walk every day, but lately… it’s been harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, jaw pain and increased fatigue, in addition to the chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, and the recent elevated blood pressure. That’s good you mentioned the jaw pain, that's something we'll want to keep in mind. We’ll see what the lab results tell us, but based on your symptoms and family history, I want to rule out any potential heart issues. While we wait for the lab results, I want you to take it easy. Avoid any strenuous activity, and if you experience any worsening chest pain or shortness of breath, call 911 immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Take it easy, no hard work, and call 911 if the pain gets worse. I will. Thank you for taking such good care of me, Doctor. I appreciate it. You are very thorough. Is there anything I can do to help? Like, fill out forms or something?
DOCTOR: Alright Sherion, the lab results are back. The EKG shows some minor changes, and your cholesterol and blood sugar are a little high. Given your symptoms - the chest pain, shortness of breath, jaw pain, fatigue, family history, and these lab results - it’s important to investigate further. I'm going to order a stress test and a cardiac consultation with a cardiologist. The cardiologist will be able to assess your heart function more thoroughly and determine if any further treatment is necessary. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a low-dose aspirin to help prevent blood clots, and I want you to start a heart-healthy diet. I’ll also give you a referral to a cardiac rehabilitation program. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A stress test and a cardiologist? That sounds… serious. But I trust you, Doctor. If that's what you think is best. A low-dose aspirin and a healthy diet, okay. I can try. What kind of diet? And what does the stress test… involve? I’m a little scared, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that you’re scared, Sherion, but we're being proactive. A stress test is a relatively simple procedure. You’ll walk on a treadmill while we monitor your heart rhythm, blood pressure, and breathing. It helps us see how your heart responds to exercise. As for the diet, we’re looking at reducing saturated fats, cholesterol, and sodium, and increasing fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. We have a nutritionist who can help you create a meal plan. I’m going to give you some information on heart-healthy eating, the stress test procedure, and a list of local cardiologists. I want you to know we’ll be with you every step of the way. We'll schedule the stress test as soon as possible and get you in to see a cardiologist. Do you have any immediate questions about any of that?
PATIENT: A treadmill… okay. And less fat, more vegetables… that sounds… hard. Will I be able to still eat my arepas? I love my arepas. And the cardiologist… are they nice? I don't want a scary doctor. This is a lot to take in, Doctor. Thank you for explaining it all, though. You are very patient.
DOCTOR: That's a perfectly reasonable question, Sherion. And yes, you can still enjoy your arepas! Everything in moderation. We'll focus on making healthier choices overall, and finding ways to enjoy your favorite foods in a balanced way. As for the cardiologist, Dr. Ramirez is excellent. She's very kind and compassionate, and she takes the time to explain everything thoroughly. I'll make a note to recommend her specifically. I’m going to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the results of the stress test and your cardiologist appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or any new symptoms, please call 911 immediately. I’m also going to give you a prescription for a low-dose aspirin. Do you have any other questions for me before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's all for now. You've been so helpful, I really appreciate it. A low-dose aspirin, eat healthy, and see the nice doctor Ramirez. And call 911 if something is wrong. Okay. Thank you for taking such good care of me, Doctor Roseburrough. You are a very good doctor. I'll see you in two weeks, then. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Sherion. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we’re in this together. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. I'll see you in two weeks. And please, take care of yourself. .
