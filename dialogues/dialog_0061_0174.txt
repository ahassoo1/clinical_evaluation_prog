DOCTOR: Talofa lava, Nani. It’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. Well, to be frank, I haven't been myself lately. A bit… low, you could say. It’s been going on for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked. I haven’t much time, if you don't mind a quick consultation.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nani, I understand. “Not yourself” and feeling “low” – that's a good place to start. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. When you say “a little while now,” can you give me a rough idea of how long?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… perhaps six months? Maybe a little more. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly, things just… faded, gradually. It started after my grandson moved away, I believe. Though, life has its ups and downs, doesn't it? I don’t want to bore you with details.
DOCTOR: No, please, don’t feel like you’re boring me at all. Knowing the timeline and what was happening around the time it started is really helpful. Six months is good to know. And it’s perfectly normal for big life changes like a grandson moving away to affect us. Okay, just pulling up your chart here… So, when you say “faded,” can you tell me a bit more about what that feels like?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a sadness, not exactly. More like… a dullness. Like looking at the world through grey glass. I used to enjoy my garden, my book club, even just a nice cup of tea. Now… it all feels a bit pointless. I still do them, mind you, but the joy is… diminished. I still keep busy, you see. I don’t want to become a burden. Is that making any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Nani. A loss of enjoyment in things you used to like – that's very helpful to know. It sounds like you're still functioning and keeping busy, which is wonderful, but the feeling behind it isn’t the same. Okay. And has anything else changed recently besides your grandson moving away?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not that I can readily recall. My health… well, it’s what you'd expect for my age, a few aches and pains, nothing serious. My divorce was… a long time ago. I try not to dwell on the past. Oh! My friend Beatrice had a fall last month, that was upsetting. But other than that… no. Nothing that stands out, really. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. These things happen.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. We'll keep those things in mind. Your chart shows you have a history of hypertension, managed with medication. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Dr. Adebayo handles that. I take my pills regularly, haven’t missed a dose in years. It’s usually well-controlled. Though, I have noticed my sleep hasn’t been the best lately. Perhaps it’s related? I do try to stay active, though. I walk in the park most mornings, if the weather permits.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Consistent medication adherence is excellent, and staying active is fantastic. The sleep disturbance is definitely something we should explore. Can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Well, I don't fall asleep easily, and when I do, I wake up several times during the night. I wouldn't say I'm restless, just… aware. Thinking, mostly. Old memories, worries… things like that. I used to be a sound sleeper, could sleep through anything. Now, a little noise, a small discomfort, and I'm wide awake. It’s getting quite tiresome, to be honest. And it exacerbates this… dullness, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds really frustrating, Nani - difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and those thoughts keeping you up. And you mentioned this "dullness" feels worse when you're not sleeping well. Has this impacted your appetite at all?
PATIENT: It has, yes. I haven't much of an appetite lately. I force myself to eat, mostly for the sake of it. My daughter keeps bringing me lovely meals, but I just don’t have the same enjoyment. Everything tastes… bland, somehow. I used to love Nigerian cuisine, the spices, the flavours… now, it’s all just… fuel. I'm losing weight, I believe. Though I haven't weighed myself recently, to be honest. It’s not something I dwell on.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nani, thank you for sharing all of this with me. Loss of appetite, changes in taste, and some unintentional weight loss… These are all important pieces of the puzzle. Just to recap, you’ve been feeling a general sense of “dullness” or low mood for about six months, which started around the time your grandson moved away. This is accompanied by sleep disturbances, decreased appetite, and a loss of enjoyment in things you used to find pleasurable. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your general health, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any changes in your concentration or memory?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. As for concentration… it's not what it once was. I find myself rereading sentences, forgetting small things. Nothing major, mind you. Just… a little more absent-minded than usual. I used to be very sharp, could remember dates, names… Now, it takes a bit more effort. It’s frustrating, to be frank. I don't want to become a… a bother, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Nani. It’s completely normal to experience changes in concentration and memory as we get older. But it's good you're noticing it and sharing it with me. Now, have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness or sadness, or have you had any thoughts of harming yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not. I have no desire to harm myself. Hopelessness… perhaps a little, at times. Just a feeling that things won’t get better. But I am a strong woman, Doctor. I’ve overcome many challenges in my life. I’m not one to give up easily. It’s just… tiring, you see? This… grey feeling. It’s all rather inconvenient, to be honest. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: I hear you, Nani. It sounds incredibly frustrating, and wanting to feel like yourself again is a very valid goal. Okay, based on what you’ve told me, and considering your age and medical history, I suspect you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes for your symptoms, like thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies. I’d like to order some blood tests to check those things. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. If it helps determine the cause, then yes, please do. Blood tests are… a minor inconvenience, really. I trust your judgement, Doctor. As long as it doesn’t take too long, I suppose. I have a bridge club meeting on Wednesday.
DOCTOR: Okay, we'll get the lab order sent over quickly. The tests shouldn’t take long, and we'll make sure to schedule the results review before your bridge club meeting. While we wait for the results, I also recommend we explore some strategies to manage your symptoms. Have you ever considered talking to a therapist?
PATIENT: A therapist? Hmm. I've never… I suppose I’ve always dealt with things myself. Talking to a stranger… it sounds rather… unsettling. I’m not sure I’d be comfortable sharing my personal feelings with someone I don’t know. I appreciate the suggestion, Doctor, but I think I’d prefer to see what the blood tests reveal first.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Nani. We can absolutely start with the blood tests and see what they tell us. It's important to feel comfortable with any treatment plan. In the meantime, would you be open to discussing some simple lifestyle changes that can sometimes help improve mood, like regular exercise and maintaining a social connection?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Exercise I already do, a walk in the park most mornings. And I see my daughter regularly, and my book club is on Tuesdays. Social connection… I suppose I have that covered. I don’t need much encouragement in that regard, thank you. Look, Doctor, I appreciate your concern, but I’m a practical woman. I don’t want a long list of things to do. If the blood tests reveal something, then let’s address that. Otherwise… I’m not sure what else can be done. I haven't much time left, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Nani. We'll focus on the blood tests for now. I’ve sent the order to the lab, and they should be able to get you in quickly. The results usually take a few days. Before you go, is there anything else you’d like to discuss or any questions you have for me?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s all. I just hope it's something simple. I’m not one for fuss, you see. Just get to the bottom of it, and let me get on with my life. Thank you for your time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nani. We’ll get those results to you as soon as possible. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. It was lovely meeting you.
