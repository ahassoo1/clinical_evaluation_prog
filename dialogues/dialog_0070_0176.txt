DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Redeye. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s these hiccups. They just won’t stop. It’s been… over two days now, and it’s really starting to bother me.
DOCTOR: Over two days, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. Since, let me think… the evening of July 31st. I was at a friend’s barbecue, and they started shortly after I had a fizzy drink. I didn’t think much of it at first, you know? Hiccups happen. But they just… haven’t gone away. It's a bit ridiculous, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be quite bothersome when hiccups persist. So, they began shortly after consuming a fizzy drink at a barbecue on the evening of July 31st. Have you tried anything to get rid of them since then?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes! Everything people told me. Holding my breath, drinking water upside down, a spoonful of sugar… even getting someone to scare me! My friend tried that one, it didn’t work, sadly. Nothing has touched them. That’s why I came. It’s starting to make it hard to sleep, and work is… difficult when you keep interrupting yourself.
DOCTOR: I see. You’ve certainly tried the common remedies. And it’s affecting your sleep and work, which is certainly concerning. Now, besides the hiccups themselves, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying them?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I haven't felt sick, no fever or anything. I’m a little tired, but that’s probably from not sleeping properly. My stomach feels… a bit bubbly sometimes, but I think that’s just from trying all those weird drinks to make them stop. No pain or anything like that, thankfully. It's just… the hiccups. Relentlessly.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no pain, and the stomach bubbling you attribute to the remedies. That's helpful to know. Now, can you describe the hiccups themselves?
PATIENT: Oh, well… they're just normal hiccups, I suppose. You know, the little jerks, the 'hic' sound. They come pretty frequently, maybe every few minutes. Sometimes they come in bursts, one right after the other, and then a bit of a break. They’re not painful, exactly, just… annoying. And they feel pretty strong, like a good forceful hiccup, not little weak ones. I guess that’s the best way to describe it.
DOCTOR: Alright, frequent, forceful hiccups, occurring in bursts. And they've been ongoing since the evening of July 31st. Now, let’s briefly go over your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I get a bit of indigestion sometimes, but nothing serious. The doctor told me years ago my blood pressure was a little high, but it’s usually fine if I watch my salt intake. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy, honestly. I try to eat well and stay active. I manage events, so I'm always on my feet. No allergies, and I haven't had any major surgeries. Just the usual bumps and bruises from the job!
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. So, occasional indigestion, previously noted slightly elevated blood pressure managed with diet, no known allergies or surgeries. And you manage events, which keeps you quite active. Are you currently taking any medications for your blood pressure, or for anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: No, I don't take anything regularly. The doctor said to just keep an eye on my salt and try to relax, which is hard when you're planning events! He checked my blood pressure a few times a year, but it was always okay. I don’t even take vitamins or anything like that. I really try to avoid medication if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Well… my mother had some heart trouble when she got older, but she lived to be 85, so it wasn’t too bad. My father was fine, as far as I know. No history of anything major like, you know, stomach problems or anything that would cause hiccups like this, that I’m aware of. Mostly just the usual things – arthritis and things like that. We didn’t really talk about medical history much, if I’m honest. It wasn't really our thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart trouble in your mother, but no significant gastrointestinal issues or other conditions that might relate to prolonged hiccups. Now, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. I find the smell dreadful. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but nothing excessive. Maybe a couple of times a week. And as I said, I try to eat healthily, mostly salads and grilled fish. I enjoy my food, but I don't overdo it.
DOCTOR: Alright, non-smoker, occasional wine consumption, and a generally healthy diet. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, let me ask one final question. Do you recall any recent travel or exposure to anyone who might be ill?
PATIENT: No, not at all. I haven’t travelled anywhere recently. Just local events. And no, I haven’t been around anyone who’s been sick, as far as I know. The barbecue was just friends, all people I see regularly. No one mentioned feeling unwell, and everyone seemed perfectly healthy. It really is just these pesky hiccups. I'm starting to feel a bit silly coming here for hiccups, but they won't stop!
DOCTOR: You’re not silly at all, Ms. Redeye. Prolonged hiccups can be quite disruptive and, in some cases, indicate an underlying issue. It’s good you came in to get them checked out. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I'm happy to do whatever it takes to get rid of these things. Please, go ahead. It's starting to feel a bit ridiculous explaining it all, but I'm glad you're taking it seriously.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here, and I’ll begin. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Slightly hyperactive bowel sounds. Everything appears normal on initial examination. Do you experience any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt at all. Just feels… normal. A bit of pressure, but no pain. Honestly, everything feels pretty normal. It’s just the hiccups! It’s so frustrating. You can probably feel them happening now, can’t you? hic There. See? It’s like a little jolt. It’s really quite annoying. hic
DOCTOR: Yes, I can certainly feel the diaphragmatic spasm. It’s quite pronounced. Given the history and the physical exam, it’s unlikely there's a serious underlying cause, but to be thorough, I’d like to order a few basic blood tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. This will rule out any electrolyte imbalances, kidney issues, or thyroid abnormalities that could be contributing. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. If it will help figure out what’s going on, I’m happy to do it. I just want these hiccups to stop. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like I'm living in a cartoon. hic It’s ridiculous! So, blood tests, you say? Is there anything special I need to do to prepare? And will I be able to get the results quickly? I have an event to manage next week and… well, explaining this to my clients is not something I’m looking forward to. hic
DOCTOR: No, nothing special needed to prepare for the blood tests. Fasting is not required. And we typically get the results back within 24-48 hours. I will call you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, since we’ve ruled out anything obvious with the physical exam, and while we await the blood test results, I'm going to suggest a trial of baclofen. It’s a muscle relaxant that can sometimes help to calm the diaphragm. We’ll start with a low dose – 10 milligrams three times a day – and see if it provides any relief. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No allergies at all. Never had a reaction to anything. Baclofen, you say? Ten milligrams three times a day? That sounds… manageable. I’m happy to try anything at this point. Honestly, I’d take a magic potion if you offered it! hic So, just to be clear, that’s ten milligrams, three times a day, while we wait for the blood test results. And you’ll call me when those are back? Is there anything I should be avoiding while taking the baclofen? Like, driving or… anything? hic
DOCTOR: Exactly. Ten milligrams three times a day. And yes, I will call you as soon as the results are available. Regarding the baclofen, it can sometimes cause drowsiness or dizziness, so it’s best to avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until you know how it affects you. Also, avoid alcohol while taking it. And, if you experience any unusual side effects, such as confusion or muscle weakness, stop taking the medication and contact the clinic immediately. I will also give you a prescription for a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI, to try for a week. Sometimes hiccups are caused by acid reflux. It won't hurt to try it along with the baclofen, if you have no objections. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, no driving or alcohol, and watch out for drowsiness or dizziness. And call if anything weird happens. Proton pump inhibitor too, for the acid reflux. That makes sense, I suppose. I do get heartburn sometimes. hic No, I think that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. I appreciate it. Honestly, just the fact that you’re taking it seriously is a relief. hic I feel a bit silly explaining all this, but I really do appreciate you listening. I’ll pick up the prescriptions and start taking everything as directed. Just… please, please, let this work! hic Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Redeye. It’s my job to listen and help. And you're not silly at all. Prolonged hiccups can be quite debilitating. We’ll see how the baclofen and PPI work, and if they don’t provide relief within a few days, we can consider other options. Here are the prescriptions, and a brief summary of the instructions. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions. I’ll be in touch as soon as the blood test results are available. Get some rest, and try not to worry too much. And, hopefully, we'll get these hiccups under control soon. Have a good day, Ms. Redeye.
PATIENT: .
