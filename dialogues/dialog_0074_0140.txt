DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right. Yes. Well, it’s… something in my mouth. It’s quite bothersome, actually. White patches. My wife suggested I come. She worries too much, honestly. But it is unpleasant.
DOCTOR: I see. White patches in your mouth. That certainly can be unpleasant. And it's good you came in to have it checked out, even if it was at your wife’s suggestion. Could you tell me a bit more about these patches?
PATIENT: Well, they’re… on my tongue, mostly. And inside my cheeks, a bit. They don’t hurt, exactly. More… irritating. Like a film. And the taste... it's off. Everything tastes strange. It’s been going on for… oh, I don’t know. A week, perhaps? It’s not something I spend much time thinking about, you understand. I have… important things to attend to.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s easy to put things off when you have other priorities. So, these white patches are primarily on your tongue and the inside of your cheeks, and they’ve been present for about a week. You describe them as irritating, not painful, and you've noticed a change in your sense of taste. To help me get a clearer picture, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside these patches?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just the… taste thing. And maybe a little… tired. But who isn’t tired these days? No fever, no swelling, nothing dramatic. Look, is this going to take long? I have a rather important meeting this afternoon. I don't have time for… extensive examinations, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns about time, Mr. Schieber. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. Just to be thorough, and to rule out other possibilities, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly. I’m a reasonably healthy man. I work hard. Faller, you know. It’s physically demanding. I don’t sit around complaining about every little ache and pain. I haven’t been to a doctor in… years. I don’t have any… conditions. No, nothing. And my wife handles all the insurance paperwork, so I couldn’t tell you if I wanted to. Frankly, I find the whole thing a bit… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Schieber. It's good to know you're generally healthy and active. Even for healthy individuals, it's helpful to have a basic understanding of past medical experiences. Have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Absolutely not. Hospitalizations… well, there was that time I broke my arm when I was a boy, falling from a tree. A simple fracture, nothing serious. Fixed it right up. Other than that, no. I don’t do hospitals. They're full of germs, you know. And inefficiency. Honestly, I’m wasting my time here. Are we getting anywhere with this… mouth thing?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a simple arm fracture as a child, otherwise no surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s helpful to know. Now, just to complete the picture, could you tell me a little about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Family history? Now we’re getting to things I really don’t know! My parents are… were… both reasonably healthy. They worked hard, like I said. No fancy illnesses, no… genetic predispositions, as far as I’m aware. My brother has… high blood pressure, I think? But that’s just because he eats too much salt. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not a medical encyclopedia. I came in for a problem in my mouth, not a genealogy project. Can we please focus on that?
DOCTOR: You're right to bring me back to the matter at hand, Mr. Schieber. It’s important we address your concerns efficiently. Alright. Let's move on to your current habits. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? Absolutely not! Do I look like the type? I work outside, Doctor. Fresh air is essential. And no, I don’t indulge in any of those… unhealthy habits. I take care of myself. Though, admittedly, I do enjoy a good strong coffee in the mornings. Several, actually. But coffee isn’t exactly a vice, is it? It helps me stay focused. Unlike some people.
DOCTOR: No, coffee isn't a vice. I drink it myself! Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much and how often?
PATIENT: Alcohol? Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Or a beer with colleagues after a long day. Nothing excessive. I’m not a… a drinker. Socially, you understand. It’s good for… camaraderie. A glass or two, on a Friday or Saturday. Certainly nothing that would interfere with my work. Really, Doctor, I’m a perfectly responsible adult. I don’t need a lecture on moderation. Are we getting anywhere with this mouth business yet? I’m starting to lose valuable time.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Schieber, this isn't a lecture. It's just part of a thorough assessment. Now, one last question regarding your habits: are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter, or any herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Absolutely not! I pride myself on avoiding those things. Chemicals, you understand. Unnatural. I don't believe in relying on pills for every little ailment. If I get a headache, I rest. If I’m tired, I sleep. I certainly don’t go running to the pharmacy for every sniffle and sneeze. And no, I don’t take any of those… herbal remedies either. Complete waste of money. Honestly, Doctor, I'm a remarkably self-sufficient man. Now, can we please get to the examination? This is getting ridiculous. I have a meeting. A very important meeting.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schieber, and I apologize for the delay. You are remarkably self-sufficient, it seems. Alright. Let’s take a look at your mouth. Could you please open wide for me?
PATIENT: Get it over with quickly, if you would. This is quite uncomfortable. And try not to poke around too much. I have important things to do.
DOCTOR: Hmm. I see the white patches you mentioned. They are primarily on your tongue and the inside of your cheeks. They don't seem to be easily scraped off, and there’s no visible redness or swelling. Your gums look healthy, and your tongue doesn’t appear to be particularly swollen. Based on what I’m seeing, it could be a few things. One possibility is a condition called oral thrush, a fungal infection. Another possibility is something called leukoplakia, which is often associated with irritation. And, less commonly, it could be something else. To be certain, I'd like to take a swab of the patches and send it to the lab for analysis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A swab? Really? More time wasted. Look, can’t you just… give me something for it? A mouthwash, perhaps? Something I can pick up at the pharmacy? I don't have time for lab tests and waiting. Honestly, this is becoming quite inconvenient. Is it contagious? My wife would be furious if I gave her something. And I have a very important client meeting. Can’t you just tell me what it is and give me something to make it go away? This is ridiculous. I’m a busy man, Doctor. A very busy man. And frankly, I’m starting to feel like I’m being deliberately delayed.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schieber. I truly do. And I apologize again for the inconvenience. While I appreciate your desire for a quick solution, it's important to have a clear diagnosis before starting any treatment. Simply prescribing a mouthwash without knowing the cause could mask the symptoms and potentially delay appropriate care. However, given your concerns and your busy schedule, I can offer a compromise. I will write you a prescription for a topical antifungal mouthwash, which can be helpful for both thrush and some cases of leukoplakia. It’s a relatively mild treatment and generally has minimal side effects. However, it is crucially important that you understand this is not a definitive solution. If the patches don't improve within one to two weeks, or if they worsen, you must come back for a follow-up appointment so we can perform the swab and get an accurate diagnosis. And to answer your question, while oral thrush can be mildly contagious, it’s usually spread through close contact. Good hygiene—avoiding sharing utensils and frequent handwashing—can minimize the risk. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Fine. Yes, that will do. A mouthwash. As long as it doesn't require another visit. And it better work quickly. I don’t have time for this. Just write the prescription. And make sure it’s something I can pick up easily. I have a meeting, remember? A very important meeting. This has been a complete waste of my time. Honestly, the inefficiency is appalling. Now, if you’ll excuse me… I have to get going.
DOCTOR: Here you go, Mr. Schieber. This is for Nystatin oral suspension. You can pick it up at most pharmacies. Be sure to follow the instructions on the label carefully. As I mentioned, if it doesn’t improve within one to two weeks, or if it worsens, please schedule a follow-up appointment so we can investigate further. I understand your time is valuable, and I apologize again for the inconvenience. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: No, thank you. Alright, Mr. Schieber. Get well soon, and I wish you all the best with your meeting. Have a good day. .
