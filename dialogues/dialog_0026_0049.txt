DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Finco. It's nice to meet you. Now, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Well now… it’s somethin’ with my ears, I reckon. Things just ain’t as clear as they used to be, ya know? People mumble a lot these days, or maybe it’s just me. It’s hard to say, really. I mostly just… don’t hear things like I used to.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's quite common, Mr. Schneer. It is possible people mumble, but hearing can change over time, too. So, it sounds like you're experiencing some hearing loss. Can you tell me how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. A long time, I suppose. Maybe a few years now? It didn’t bother me much at first, just when the TV was quiet, ya know? But it’s been gettin’ worse lately, I think. My niece, she keeps sayin’ I need to get it checked out. She’s a worrier, that one. Hard to say exactly when it started, though. My memory ain’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Schneer. It’s very common to have trouble pinpointing exactly when changes started. A few years is helpful to know, though. And it's good your niece is looking out for you. So, it’s been gradually worsening over those few years. Is it worse in one ear than the other, or is it about the same?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I… I don’t rightly know. I don’t think so, maybe? They both feel kinda… muffled, like someone put cotton in ‘em. It’s hard to tell, really. I mostly just turn the TV up louder. Does that make sense? I don’t feel like one’s worse, but I couldn’t swear to it. I don’t pay much attention to these things, ya know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Schneer. It sounds like it’s affecting both ears somewhat equally. And turning up the TV is a common way to cope. Now, besides difficulty hearing, have you noticed any other things?
PATIENT: Other things? Like what, dear? Sometimes… sometimes I get a ringin’ in my ears. Not all the time, just now and then. It’s kinda high-pitched, like a tea kettle whistlin’. But it doesn’t last long. And… oh, and sometimes things sound a bit echoey, like I’m in a big room. But that doesn’t happen much either. I don’t know if that’s the same thing, though.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Mr. Schneer. The ringing – what we call tinnitus – and the echoey sound are both things that can be associated with hearing changes. It sounds like you’re describing a fairly typical presentation. Now, have you ever been exposed to loud noises at work, or during hobbies?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. At the shoe factory, there was always a racket. All them machines clatterin’ and bangin’ all day long. It was a noisy place, alright. I worked there for… oh, I don't even remember how long. A long time. And sometimes, on weekends, I used to go to dances with a band. They were pretty loud too, now that I think about it. Not like those rock and roll bands the young folks listen to, but loud enough. I never thought much about it at the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some noise exposure both at work and during hobbies. That's good information. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I got a bit of arthritis in my hands, makes ‘em a bit stiff, ya know? And the doctor told me a while back my blood pressure was a bit high, but I take a little pill for that every day. Aside from that… nothin’ much, I reckon. I’m pretty healthy for an old fella, all things considered. I used to be a bit overweight, but I lost some weight last year when I wasn’t feelin’ so good.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and high blood pressure, which you’re taking medication for. And some weight loss last year. Do you recall what caused the weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that was a bit of a spell. Didn’t have much of an appetite, just didn't feel like eatin’. The doctor said it was probably just somethin’ I ate, told me to take it easy and drink plenty of fluids. It went away after a bit, thankfully. I don't remember much else about it, to be honest. It was a while ago now, and I was pretty tired at the time. Mostly, I just remember not feelin' like myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, a temporary loss of appetite with a recovery. That’s good to know. Now, do you take any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I think… no. Just the little white pill for my blood pressure. And sometimes I take somethin’ for my arthritis when my hands are really achin’, but that’s just now and then. It’s an over-the-counter one, ya know? Not somethin' the doctor prescribed. Just somethin' I picked up at the drugstore. I don't take a lot of pills, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, just the blood pressure medication regularly and an over-the-counter pain reliever for arthritis as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… Not that I know of. I’ve never had any trouble with medications before, as far as I can remember. And no food allergies, either. I eat pretty much anything. I used to be a bit sensitive to the cold, but that’s just gettin’ old, I reckon. Not a true allergy, ya know? I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, Mr. Schneer, before we move on, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That’s a tough one. My mother… she had a bit of trouble with her eyesight when she got older, needed glasses. And my father, he had a bit of a cough most of his life. I don't really know much about the rest of my family, to be honest. We weren't very close. I was an only child, and my parents… well, they didn’t talk much about their families. I don't think there was any deafness in the family, as far as I know. But I couldn't swear to it. My memory just isn't what it used to be, ya know?
DOCTOR: Okay, some vision trouble in your mother and a cough in your father. That's helpful to know, even if it’s limited information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look in your ears. It shouldn’t take long.
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don’t mind a bit of pokin’ and proddin’. Just let me know if you see anything interestin’. I ain’t afraid of a little examination. I’ve had plenty of those in my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds regular, a little quiet though. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Your lungs sound clear, but the sounds are a bit faint. Now, let’s take a look at your ears. Alright. Your ear canals are a little narrow with some earwax. And your eardrums appear a bit dull and retracted. This is common with age, but it could also be contributing to your hearing difficulties. I can see some cerumen that may be blocking the canal.
PATIENT: Oh my. Is that bad, Doctor? I figured they might be a bit dirty, but I didn't think much of it. I don't go stickin' things in my ears, ya know? Never been one for that sort of thing. So, what does that mean? Is it fixable? I just want to be able to hear my TV again, ya know? And maybe hear my niece when she’s talkin’. She worries about me somethin’ fierce.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, Mr. Schneer. Earwax is normal and protects your ears. But when it builds up, like it has in your case, it can block the canal and affect your hearing. It’s quite common. And yes, it’s definitely fixable. We can remove the wax. It’s a simple procedure. We can either use ear drops to soften it up and let it fall out on its own, or I can gently remove it with a small instrument. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve seen during the exam, it sounds like you likely have a combination of age-related hearing loss and wax buildup. Would you be comfortable trying ear drops first?
PATIENT: Ear drops sound alright, Doctor. As long as it ain’t too painful. I don't like a lot of fuss, ya know? Gentle is good. And if that don't work… what then? Will I have to see a specialist? My niece would have a fit if I had to go to a specialist. She's always tellin' me to get everything checked out. She means well, bless her heart. But I’d rather just get it fixed here if possible.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schneer. Ear drops are usually very well-tolerated and painless. You'll put a few drops in your ears for a few days, and then we’ll check to see if the wax has softened enough to remove. It’s a very gentle process. If the ear drops don't work, then we could consider a referral to an audiologist – a hearing specialist. They have specialized tools to remove stubborn wax and can perform a more thorough hearing test to assess the extent of your hearing loss. But let’s try the ear drops first and see how you do. We can start with that and avoid a referral if possible. I’m going to write you a prescription for the ear drops, and I’ll give you instructions on how to use them. I want you to use them for five days, then schedule a follow-up appointment with me so we can check your ears and see if we need to take the next step. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Five days, then come back. That sounds reasonable, Doctor. As long as it don’t take too much effort. My memory ain’t what it used to be, so I’ll have to write it down right away. And thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease, ya know? I just want to hear again. That’s all. Now, how much do I owe ya?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I'm glad I could help put your mind at ease. And don't worry about remembering – the receptionist will schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave, and they’ll remind you. As for the cost, let me finish writing up the prescription and I'll have the receptionist handle the billing. It will depend on your insurance coverage, but we'll make sure you understand all the costs before you leave. Just to recap, you'll use these ear drops twice a day for five days, and then we’ll see you back here for a follow-up. Do you have any questions for me before I finish up?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very nicely. Oh, wait! Will these drops make my ears feel funny? Like all plugged up or somethin’? I don’t like feelin’ all stuffed up. I get a bit anxious when things feel strange in my ears. Just warn me if it’s gonna feel weird, alright? That’s all I’m worried about, really.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Mr. Schneer. You might feel a slight fullness or a bit of a tingling sensation in your ears after you put the drops in, but it shouldn't be uncomfortable. It's usually very mild and goes away quickly. Some people describe it as a slightly cool sensation. It shouldn't feel painful or make you feel stuffed up. If you do experience any discomfort or if it feels like your ear is blocked or painful, stop using the drops immediately and contact the office. But it’s very rare for that to happen. Here is your prescription. And please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. I want you to feel comfortable and confident with this treatment. We’ll get you hearing better in no time. Now, let me have the receptionist schedule that follow-up appointment for you.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything. I feel a bit better now, knowin’ what to expect. Tell her to make it for a mornin’ appointment, if possible. Mornin’s better for me, ya know? My memory’s a bit sharper then. Well, alright then. I guess I’ll let you get back to work. Thank you again, Doctor Finco.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I'm glad I could help. And I’ll make sure the receptionist schedules you for a morning appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please take care, and we'll see you soon. .
