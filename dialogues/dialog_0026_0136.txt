DOCTOR: Good morning, Lucia. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Finco. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... I keep... belching. It's embarrassing, really. It just happens. A lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, belching… that can be bothersome, yes. And understandably embarrassing. Let's see… Lucia Fogelstrom, age 38… Alright. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm... when it started? I don't really know exactly. Maybe a few weeks ago? It’s hard to say for sure. It didn't start suddenly, it was… slow. I just started noticing it more and more. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, yes. Slow onset is helpful to know. A few weeks, gradual… Okay. And are the belches happening all day, or are they more frequent at certain times?
PATIENT: Mostly after I eat. Like, a little while after. Not right when I finish, but maybe… thirty minutes, an hour later? Sometimes when I'm just sitting, too, but less. Food makes it worse, for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, after eating, particularly thirty minutes to an hour afterward… and less frequent when just sitting. Do certain foods seem to trigger it more than others?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. I think… bubbly things? Like soda, or sparkling water. And maybe… beans? Yeah, beans definitely. I love beans, but… they don't love me, it seems!
DOCTOR: Well, beans can be a bit notorious! So, bubbly drinks and beans seem to be triggers. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the belching?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… the belching. Sometimes my stomach feels a little full, maybe? But I don’t feel sick, or anything like that. No pain, no heartburn, nothing. It's just… annoying. And I worry it bothers people.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no pain, no heartburn, no nausea – just the belching and occasional feeling of fullness. Alright. And just to get a better picture, Lucia, have you had any changes in your diet recently, other than noticing the effect of bubbly drinks and beans?
PATIENT: Not really, no. I eat pretty much the same things. Rice, chicken, vegetables… I try to eat healthy. I haven’t added anything new, or taken anything away. Maybe a little more fruit in the summer, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistent diet, a little more fruit recently. And are you taking any medications currently, Lucia?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take anything. I try to stay away from medicine if I can. I get headaches sometimes, but I just… drink water and rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications. And do you have any allergies to food or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. My mom always said I had a strong stomach! Maybe this is… proof?
DOCTOR: Well, a strong stomach is a good thing! No known allergies. Okay. Now, just a few quick questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like GERD or IBS, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I haven’t really been to the doctor much. I try to take care of myself, you know? I haven't had any big problems, until… well, the belching!
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been lucky. Nothing like that. Just… little things, you know? Colds, the flu… normal stuff. But no surgeries, ever.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family? Um… my mom is okay, she's a little older now. My dad… he passed away a few years ago. And I have a brother, he lives in Miami. He's healthy too, as far as I know. No one in my family has… belching problems! It seems to be just me.
DOCTOR: Okay, healthy mom and brother, father passed away. No family history of similar issues. And what about your social habits?
PATIENT: Social habits? What do you mean? Do you mean… do I drink or smoke? No, I don't do any of that. I like to spend time with friends, but mostly we just talk, or go for walks. Nothing too crazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, non-smoker, doesn’t drink, enjoys walks and socializing. Alright, Lucia. It sounds like you've been experiencing excessive belching for a few weeks, which is worse after eating, particularly with bubbly drinks and beans. No other significant symptoms, no underlying medical conditions, and no relevant family history. It's possible this is related to diet and swallowing air. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want it to stop! I hope it’s not something serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, if you could lie down on the exam table, that would be great. I'm just going to listen to your abdomen. Try to relax and breathe normally. Okay… I’m not hearing anything abnormal. Your abdomen is soft and doesn't appear to be tender. Your bowel sounds are normal. Okay. Everything sounds normal so far. It’s likely this is a functional issue, meaning there isn’t an underlying disease causing it. We can try some dietary modifications and lifestyle changes. I recommend avoiding carbonated beverages and gas-producing foods like beans, cabbage, broccoli, and onions. Try eating smaller, more frequent meals and chewing your food slowly. Also, avoid chewing gum and drinking through straws, as these can cause you to swallow more air. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. I can try that. No more soda, no more beans… it’ll be hard, but I can try. Eating slower… that’s a good idea, I always eat too fast. Is there anything else? Like… medicine? Or something to help right away?
DOCTOR: There are over-the-counter medications like simethicone that can help reduce gas, but they’re usually just a temporary fix. It’s more important to address the underlying cause, which in your case seems to be diet and lifestyle. We could try a trial of a low-FODMAP diet, but that can be quite restrictive and requires careful planning. For now, let's focus on the simple changes – avoiding carbonated drinks, gas-producing foods, eating slower, and avoiding gum and straws. If these changes don't improve your symptoms within a couple of weeks, we can revisit the possibility of a more structured diet or further investigation. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… better than a really hard diet, for sure. A couple of weeks… I can do that. No soda, no beans… it’s a start. I just hope it works. It’s embarrassing, you know? Do I need to come back then? In two weeks?
DOCTOR: Yes, let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to see how you’re doing. We'll assess if the changes have helped, and if not, we can discuss other options. And please, don't feel embarrassed. These things happen, and we're here to help. I'm scheduling you for August 16th at 10 am. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfect. August 16th at 10 am. Thank you, Doctor. I really appreciate it. I feel a little better now, just knowing what to try. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Lucia. I’m glad I could help. Just remember to stick to those changes, and don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I’ll see you on August 16th.
