DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. Dr. Blim. Please, have a seat. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you. It is… my breathing. I have been… wheezing, yes? It makes it hard to get air sometimes. It started a few weeks ago, I think. Not so bad at first, but… more now.
DOCTOR: Wheezing, you say. A few weeks, progressing… Very well. Now, Mrs. Kilton, can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. When I walk… up the stairs, it is worse. And… when I try to do my exercises. I like to walk every day, you see, but now… I have to stop and rest. It feels… tight in my chest. Not pain, exactly… just… difficult. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Difficult is…not a clinical term, Mrs. Kilton. But I understand you’re experiencing shortness of breath exacerbated by exertion. Do you have any other symptoms accompanying this… tightness?
PATIENT: Other… symptoms? Let me think. Sometimes… a little cough. Not much, mostly when I lie down. And… I feel more tired than usual. I used to have so much energy, but now… I need a nap in the afternoon. No fever, though. I check. And no… chills, or anything like that. Just… tired and… breathless. Is that helpful, Doctor?
DOCTOR: A cough and fatigue… typical. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, bronchitis, or any other respiratory condition?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. When I was a little girl, I had… some sicknesses, like everyone. But nothing with my lungs, or… breathing. I have always been… strong. I work very hard, and keep fit. This is new. I have never had this before. My husband… he used to get colds, but I never did. He is gone now, though. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your surgical history, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Surgical… hmm. Let me see. When I was young, I had my tonsils out. A long, long time ago. And… when I broke my arm, playing volleyball. That needed a cast. But nothing else, Doctor. Nothing serious. I have been very lucky, I think. Mostly just bumps and bruises from being… active.
DOCTOR: And your family history?
PATIENT: Family… my mother, she had… some problems with her heart, when she was old. She was very tired a lot. And my brother… he smoked, many cigarettes. He had… trouble breathing, at the end. But my father, he was very strong and healthy. He lived a long life. Is that what you need to know, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, Mrs. Kilton, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, not that I know of. I can eat anything. And… I have never had a bad reaction to medicine. I take a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. But nothing else regularly. I am a very simple woman, Doctor. I don’t take many pills.
DOCTOR: And what medications do you take for your arthritis, Mrs. Kilton?
PATIENT: Just… the small white pills. I get them from the… the pharmacy. The one near the market. It helps with the pain in my hands. I think… naproxen? Is that right? Sometimes ibuprofen, if it's really bad. My daughter helps me with them. She knows all the names. I am not good with remembering names, Doctor. I just take them when I need to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's perform a brief physical examination. Please take a deep breath.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you need. I am ready. Is it cold? I always get cold easily.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 22 breaths per minute. Auscultation reveals some bilateral wheezing, more pronounced on the left side. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly distant. Oxygen saturation is 93% on room air, which is… acceptable, but not optimal. No edema noted in the extremities.
PATIENT: Wheezing… bilateral? What does that mean, Doctor? And 93%… is that bad? I feel… a little dizzy sometimes. Is that from the low… oxygen? And what about my chest? You said something about… distant? I hope it is nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kilton, bilateral wheezing simply means the sound is present in both lungs. It indicates some narrowing of the airways. 93% oxygen saturation is…suboptimal. While not immediately life-threatening, it warrants attention. As for “distant” heart sounds, it suggests some fluid around the heart, though it’s likely minimal at this point. Based on your symptoms and this preliminary examination, it appears you may be experiencing an exacerbation of… possible COPD, although a definitive diagnosis requires further testing.
PATIENT: COPD? What is COPD? Is that… serious, Doctor? And… fluid around my heart? That sounds very bad. I don't understand. I just have trouble breathing when I walk! Will I… will I need to go to the hospital? Please, tell me what is happening. I am getting very scared.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kilton, please try to remain calm. COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. It’s a common condition, particularly in individuals with a history of smoking, though it can occur without it. It causes a progressive narrowing of the airways, leading to shortness of breath, wheezing and fatigue. The fluid around your heart is a minor finding at this stage, and likely related to your overall condition. We need to rule out other possibilities, such as pneumonia or heart failure. I will order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. I also recommend a pulmonary function test to assess your lung capacity. For now, I will prescribe you a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler and a mild oral steroid to help open your airways and reduce inflammation. A referral to a pulmonologist is also advisable for long-term management.
PATIENT: Inhaler… steroids… pulmonologist… That is… a lot, Doctor. I don't even know what a pulmonologist is. And I have never used an inhaler before. Will it… will it make me feel better? And what if… what if it is something very bad? I just want to be able to walk again without getting so tired. Is that too much to ask? Please, can you explain it to me slowly? I am an old woman, and I am getting very confused.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kilton, a pulmonologist is a specialist in lung diseases. They will be able to provide a more thorough evaluation and develop a long-term treatment plan. The inhaler delivers medication directly to your lungs to help open your airways and ease your breathing. It’s very simple to use; the nurse will show you how. As for your concerns about a “very bad” diagnosis, we are simply being thorough. It's important to rule out all possibilities. The blood tests and X-ray will give us more information. For now, focus on using the inhaler as prescribed and taking it easy. If your symptoms worsen—increased shortness of breath, chest pain, or a high fever—go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I'll have the nurse print out instructions for using the inhaler and a list of local pulmonologists. Do you have any further questions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I think I understand. Or… I think I’ve heard everything. The inhaler… the tests… the specialist… It’s just… a lot to take in. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining it to me. I suppose I will just… wait for the results. And try to remember everything. I hope… I hope it is not too bad. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mrs. Kilton. The nurse will be with you shortly. And please, try not to worry unduly. We will get to the bottom of this. .
