DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Um, well, I’ve noticed a lump… a mass, I guess… in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amy, that’s good of you to come in and get it checked. A lump in the lower abdomen definitely warrants a look. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s… hard to describe. It doesn't really hurt, not usually. It’s just… there. I noticed it maybe a month or so ago. It feels… firm, but not rock hard, if that makes sense. I haven’t noticed it getting bigger or smaller, at least not that I’ve been able to tell. It’s… around here, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Below the navel, firm but not rock hard, present for about a month, and no noticeable changes in size. That gives me a starting point. Has anything changed recently that might be related?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can think of, really. My appetite’s been normal, no weight loss or gain. Bowel habits are regular, no changes there either. I haven't had any fever or chills, and no pain, like I said. Honestly, it just… appeared. I’m a choreographer, so I’m pretty active, but no new injuries or strains. It’s a bit of a mystery.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No associated symptoms like changes in appetite, weight, bowel habits, or fever. And you’re active with your choreography, no recent injuries. Let's talk a little bit about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. I had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. Nothing major. And I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, about… fifteen years ago, I think. Other than that, I’ve been pretty healthy, thankfully. My wife, Sarah, keeps me in line with healthy eating and regular checkups.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Appendix out fifteen years ago, otherwise healthy. And a supportive wife keeps you on track – excellent! Do you have any family history of cancer, or any other significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother had high blood pressure, and my grandfather on my father's side had diabetes, but nothing… nothing like cancer, as far as we know. My father’s side of the family is… well, we don't really have much contact with them. My mother’s side is pretty healthy overall, mostly just typical age-related things. We don’t have a strong history of serious illness, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no significant family history of cancer. High blood pressure and diabetes on your mother and father's sides, respectively. And you mentioned limited contact with your father’s side, so the history there is unclear. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No medications currently, Doctor. Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache, but that's it. And no allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve had no reactions to any medications in the past, and Sarah always double-checks everything before I take anything new, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No medications, no allergies, and a cautious wife – that’s excellent. Okay, Amy, now I’d like to do a physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll need to listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll gently feel around to get a better sense of this lump. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Alright, Amy, I’m listening to your abdomen now. Your bowel sounds are normal – good. Now, I'm going to gently feel around. Can you tell me if you feel any discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that doesn’t hurt. Just… a little pressure, I suppose. It's not painful, not at all. It feels… well, it feels like the lump itself, really. It’s firm, and it’s definitely… there. It doesn’t seem to be getting worse with the pressure, though.
DOCTOR: Okay. It’s firm, not tender to palpation. It’s approximately… two centimeters in diameter, located midline, just below the umbilicus. It’s somewhat mobile, but not entirely. It doesn’t appear to be fixed to the underlying tissues. No guarding or rebound tenderness. Based on what you've told me and the exam, Amy, it's difficult to say definitively what this is without further investigation. It could be a number of things – a lipoma , a hernia, or something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order an abdominal ultrasound. It’s a non-invasive imaging test that will allow us to visualize the lump and see what it’s made of. How does that sound?
PATIENT: An ultrasound sounds… sensible, Doctor. I’m happy to do whatever you recommend. I’d rather know what it is, one way or another. So, yes, an ultrasound sounds good. Will you schedule that for me here?
DOCTOR: Yes, I can schedule that for you right now. Alright, I’ve scheduled you for an abdominal ultrasound at the imaging center across town on August 8th at 10:00 AM. They’ll need your insurance information, which I've already sent over. Do you have any difficulty getting transportation to and from the imaging center?
PATIENT: August 8th at 10:00 AM is perfect, thank you. And no, thankfully, Sarah has already offered to take me and pick me up. She’s very good about these things. So, transportation isn’t an issue. What should I expect during the ultrasound? Will I need to do anything to prepare?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No special preparation is needed for the ultrasound, Amy. You can eat and drink normally beforehand. They will likely ask you to lie down on a table, and a technician will apply a gel to your abdomen and move a probe over it. It’s painless, but you may feel a little bit of pressure. The whole thing should take about 30-45 minutes. Once we have the results of the ultrasound, we can discuss them and decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, if you experience any changes in your symptoms – such as pain, tenderness, redness, or if the lump grows rapidly – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, that all sounds very straightforward, thank you, Doctor. Thirty to forty-five minutes, normal eating, and contact the clinic if anything changes. I think that covers everything. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me and explain everything so clearly. I think I’m all set for now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Amy. I’m glad I could help. I’ll be sure to review the ultrasound results as soon as they come in and give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment. It was nice meeting you, and please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns. .
