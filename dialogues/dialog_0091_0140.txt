DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it's… rather unpleasant, to be frank. It’s a bit embarrassing to discuss, but I suppose that’s what I come to doctors for. It's a problem in my mouth. A white coating, you see. It's quite bothersome. I’d like to get it sorted quickly if possible; I have commitments.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schieber. It's perfectly alright; these things happen, and we’ll do our best to get to the bottom of it. You mentioned a white coating in your mouth. Could you describe it to me in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Detail? Honestly, Doctor, it looks like… cottage cheese. That’s the best way to put it. Small, white patches. Mostly on my tongue, I think. It doesn’t hurt exactly, but it’s… uncomfortable. And it’s certainly not aesthetically pleasing. I assure you, I maintain a very good standard of hygiene, so I’m quite baffled by it. Are you going to examine it now, or…? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you describing it so clearly, Mr. Schieber. "Cottage cheese" is a very helpful comparison. And I understand your concern about your time. Yes, I would like to take a quick look, if that's alright with you. It will help me to get a better understanding of what we're dealing with. Would you please open your mouth for me?
PATIENT: Very well. But please be quick about it. I really don't enjoy having people poke around in there. And try not to use those cold metal instruments, if you can help it. It's… startling.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schieber. I’ll be as gentle and efficient as possible. I see the white patches you’ve described. They appear to be primarily on your dorsal tongue, and some on the buccal mucosa as well. They are slightly raised, and I don't see any evidence of open sores or bleeding at this time. Do you notice any pain when you eat or drink, especially anything acidic or spicy?
PATIENT: No, not pain precisely. A slight… burning sensation, perhaps. Mostly with citrus fruits. And coffee. Black coffee, specifically. I take it very strong, you understand. It’s… invigorating. But it does seem to exacerbate the problem. I’ve been trying to cut back, but it’s difficult. It's a habit, you see. A good habit. Is it… serious? Because I have a rather important business meeting next week. I can’t afford to be unwell.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about your meeting, Mr. Schieber. The burning sensation with citrus and coffee is helpful information. Given your description, and what I’m observing, it’s possible this could be oral thrush – a fungal infection. However, other conditions can present similarly. To be certain, and to rule out other possibilities, I would like to take a swab of the affected area. It’s a quick and painless procedure, and we can send it to the lab for analysis. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A swab? Honestly, Doctor, is that absolutely necessary? I told you I maintain impeccable hygiene. It seems rather… demeaning, to be subjected to a swab. Are you implying I’m… unclean? I assure you, I brush and floss diligently. And I use a very good mouthwash. Perhaps it’s just a temporary irritation. Couldn't we try… something else first? A prescription, perhaps? Something to soothe it? I’d really prefer to avoid any invasive procedures.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Schieber, and I apologize if my suggestion came across as implying anything about your hygiene. That was certainly not my intention. I assure you, even with excellent oral hygiene, fungal infections can occur, especially in individuals with certain underlying conditions or medication use. The swab is the most accurate way to determine the cause of this condition. Without a definitive diagnosis, prescribing medication could be ineffective or even worsen the problem. However, I respect your wishes. Given your aversion to the swab, and your commitment to your meeting, we could try a topical antifungal medication as a trial. But please understand that this is not ideal. If it doesn't improve within a week, we will need to revisit the possibility of a swab for a proper diagnosis. Are you willing to try this approach with that understanding?
PATIENT: Very well. A trial seems… reasonable. As long as it doesn't interfere with my schedule. And it mustn't have any… unpleasant side effects. I have a reputation to maintain, you see. I wouldn't want any visible reactions. What sort of medication are we talking about? And how often must it be applied? I trust it’s something discreet. And quickly effective.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schieber. We'll prioritize a discreet and quickly effective option. I'm thinking of prescribing Nystatin oral suspension. It's a commonly used antifungal medication, and it's relatively mild with minimal side effects – occasionally a slight upset stomach, but nothing visible. You would apply it directly to the affected areas of your mouth three to four times a day for seven days. It's a liquid, so it's easy to apply. I'll write you a prescription to take to your pharmacy. I will also recommend you avoid acidic foods and drinks, like citrus fruits and coffee, as much as possible during this week, as they can irritate the area and hinder the medication’s effectiveness. Does this sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable. Though I make no promises regarding the coffee. A man needs his coffee, Doctor. But I will attempt to moderate my intake. Seven days, you say? And no visible side effects? Good. Now, is that all? I have a call to make. I trust this prescription will be sufficient. I do hope I won't have to return. A waste of my valuable time, frankly.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Schieber, this is all for now. I have written the prescription for Nystatin oral suspension. Please follow the instructions carefully and avoid acidic foods and beverages as much as possible. As I mentioned, if your symptoms do not improve within seven days, or if they worsen at any point, please schedule a follow-up appointment, and we will revisit the possibility of a swab for a more definitive diagnosis. I understand your time is valuable, and I hope this resolves the issue quickly and efficiently. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Schieber.
PATIENT: Very well. Thank you.
