DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Hmm… what brings me in… well, it’s about… starting a family, I think. My… someone I care about and I are thinking about having a baby. I thought it was a good idea to… check things first, you know? Make sure everything is okay. It’s been a long time… a very long time since I thought about these things.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of you, Mr. Verrall. It’s always a good idea to get a check-up before starting a family, especially after a long time. It’s great you're thinking ahead. So, to get a better understanding, let's start with some general questions. Could you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Overall health… that’s a… a good question. I work, you know? Sales… traveling a bit. Not too bad, I suppose. I try to eat okay, when I can. It's… difficult on the road sometimes. I don’t get sick often, but I’m not as young as I used to be. Is there something specific you want to know? I forget things easily, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. We'll take things slowly. No need to worry about forgetting things – I’ll help guide the conversation. When you say you try to eat okay, could you describe a typical day of eating for you?
PATIENT: A typical day… hmm. Well, if I’m traveling, it’s usually… whatever I can find at the airport or a quick restaurant. Sandwich, maybe. Coffee, definitely coffee. Sometimes a salad if I’m lucky. If I’m at home… I try to cook. Pasta, mostly. Or… chicken. Nothing fancy. I don’t drink much alcohol, and I don’t smoke. Never have. But like I said, traveling makes it hard to eat well. Do you need to know exactly what I eat? It's… a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: No, "a bit blurry" is perfectly fine for now, Mr. Verrall. It’s helpful to get a general idea. And it's good to hear you don't smoke and don't drink much. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Let me think. High blood pressure… I think the doctor mentioned something about that a few years ago, but it wasn't too bad. He said to watch my salt intake. Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. Heart problems… no. I had… the flu, a couple of times. And I broke my arm when I was a boy. Does that count? I've had… regular check-ups, but I don’t really remember what they told me. It’s been a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially some history of elevated blood pressure, and you’ve had the flu and a broken arm. We'll look into that blood pressure further. It’s not uncommon to forget details from past check-ups. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think… No, I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. Maybe… I had my tonsils out when I was very young, but I barely remember it. And… I had a wisdom tooth pulled, but that doesn’t really count as surgery, does it? No… no real surgeries. I’ve been pretty lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so tonsillectomy as a child, but no other surgeries. That’s good to know. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Family… that's a difficult question. My… my parents are both gone now. And I don’t have… many relatives close by. My mother… she had… something with her heart, I think. She was sick for a long time. My father… he worked very hard, and… he died young. I don't remember exactly what he died from. Cancer… maybe an aunt had cancer, but I’m not sure. It’s been a long time, and… I wasn’t very close to my family. It’s a bit blurry, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. It’s very common not to have all the details of family medical history. It sounds like there might be some history of heart issues and potentially cancer, but we don’t need to be definitive about it right now. Now, let’s talk about allergies and medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat all sorts of foods. No trouble with… pollen or dust or anything like that. Medications… I don’t take any regularly. Sometimes I take something for a headache, but that’s it. Just… over-the-counter stuff. Nothing prescribed by a doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies and no regular medications. That’s helpful. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… What does that mean exactly, Doctor? I work, like I said. I travel. I… watch television sometimes. I don’t have any hobbies, really. I like to… read the news. It's not a very exciting life, I suppose. I try to get enough sleep, when I can. It's… hard with the traveling.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall. We’re just trying to get a complete picture. So, you travel for work, read the news, and try to get enough sleep. Do you exercise regularly?
PATIENT: Exercise… not really. I walk a bit at the airport, maybe. But that’s about it. I used to… play football when I was young, but that was a long time ago. I don't have much time for exercise now. It’s… difficult to fit it in.
DOCTOR: Okay, so limited exercise. That’s good to know. Now, Mr. Verrall, before we proceed, I want to confirm some information from your chart. It says here you are 66 years old, your height is 168 centimeters, and your weight is 141 pounds. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. 66… yes. 168… about right. And 141… yes, that sounds like my weight. It's… been a bit up and down lately, with the traveling. But yes, those numbers are… correct.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Thank you for confirming. Now, Mr. Verrall, to get a better understanding of your overall health and to help determine if there are any potential concerns before starting a family, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's… fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… a very long time, so… yes, go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here, we'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your abdomen. It shouldn’t take too long. Okay, just relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 145/90. We'll want to monitor that. And your pulse is 78, which is within the normal range. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Your heart sounds regular, but there's a slight murmur. We might want to do an EKG to get a better look at that. Your lungs sound clear, thankfully. Now I'll listen to your abdomen. It seems soft and non-tender, but there's some mild fullness.
PATIENT: Mild fullness…? Oh. That’s… probably just the pasta, Doctor. I do like my pasta. A murmur… that doesn't sound good, does it? I don't feel any pain, though. I haven’t been feeling sick or anything.
DOCTOR: It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, Mr. Verrall. Murmurs are common, and many are harmless. But it's always best to investigate further. The fullness is likely related to your diet, as you mentioned. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes. They seem normal. Finally, I'll just take a look in your ears and throat. Everything looks clear in your ears and throat. Overall, Mr. Verrall, your exam is mostly normal, but we do need to investigate the slightly elevated blood pressure and the heart murmur further. I'd like to order some blood work and an EKG. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… and an EKG…? That sounds… complicated, Doctor. Is it expensive? I don’t have… insurance, you see. I’m a bit worried about the cost. But… if you think it’s important, I suppose I can manage.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Mr. Verrall. It's a valid concern. We can discuss options to make it more affordable, and I can also connect you with resources that may offer financial assistance. The blood work will help us assess your overall health, including your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. The EKG will give us a more detailed look at your heart and help determine the cause of the murmur. It’s important to rule out any potential concerns before starting a family. The cost for the blood work is approximately $150, and the EKG is around $200. We can also discuss payment plans. Would you like me to proceed with ordering these tests?
PATIENT: $350… That’s… a lot. But… yes, I suppose I should do it. If it’s important for… for the baby, then I will. I don’t want to… risk anything. Yes, please. Order the tests. And… thank you for being understanding about the cost, Doctor. It's a worry.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verrall. I'm happy to help. I'll get the orders sent to the lab and schedule you for an EKG. The lab is just down the hall, and they take walk-ins. We'll need to schedule the EKG for later this week, as it requires a technician to be available. I'll also give you a requisition form for the blood work and a separate appointment card for the EKG. Once we have the results, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Do you have any questions about the tests or the process?
PATIENT: No… I think I understand. Walk-in for the blood work, appointment for the EKG… and then we’ll talk again. I don’t think I have any questions right now. I'm… a bit overwhelmed, to be honest. But thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verrall. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed, especially with a lot of new information. Take your time, and don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll have the nurse give you a handout about preparing for the blood work. Once again, thank you for coming in today. We’ll get through this together.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help. Bye bye.
