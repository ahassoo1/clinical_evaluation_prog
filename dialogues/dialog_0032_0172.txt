DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I am Dr. Pipkorn. Please, have a seat. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, dear, it's all rather…unnecessary. A formality, I suppose. My husband insisted. New to the area, you see. Medicare requires these…visits. I haven’t been ill, not properly. Just…checking in. Is that sufficient?
DOCTOR: While I understand your reluctance, Ms. Engelhaupt, routine check-ups are important, even in the absence of acute illness. They allow us to establish a baseline and monitor your overall health. However, if you insist, we can certainly proceed with a basic assessment. To begin, could you describe any changes you have noticed, however small, since relocating?
PATIENT: Changes? Really, doctor. At my age, everything is a change. The light is different, the air smells peculiar…people speak so loudly these days. It’s unsettling. And the grocery store doesn't carry my brand of tea. That's a change, isn’t it? I suppose my bones feel…older. Though that’s hardly news. Is there a quicker way to get through this?
DOCTOR: Ms. Engelhaupt, while I appreciate your… candor, these observations aren’t particularly helpful for a medical assessment. I'm attempting to ascertain if you've experienced any physical changes – new pains, fatigue, changes in appetite or weight, anything of that nature. Let's try this: Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss or gain recently?
PATIENT: Weight…oh, goodness. How would I know? My husband handles the scales. He says I’m…substantial. Always has. And frankly, I haven’t the energy to be worrying over ounces. It’s all rather vulgar, isn’t it? I eat when I’m hungry, and I try to avoid too much sugar. Now, are we nearing the end of this? I have a luncheon appointment.
DOCTOR: Very well. Since you haven't noted any significant changes, let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. It will be quite basic – checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a quick assessment of your reflexes. Please, if you could just sit back and relax. I'll start with your blood pressure. May I have your arm, please?
PATIENT: Honestly, all this prodding and poking. It’s hardly necessary, but if you must. Be gentle, dear. My circulation isn’t what it used to be. And do try to be quick about it. I haven't much patience for these things.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 148/85. That's slightly elevated, Ms. Engelhaupt. Now, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me... and exhale slowly. Again, please. Your heart sounds are regular, but I do detect a slight crackling sound in your lower lungs on both sides. Do you experience any shortness of breath, particularly when lying down or exerting yourself?
PATIENT: Crackling? Good heavens. I do feel a bit…winded sometimes, if I’m climbing the stairs. Though that’s to be expected, isn’t it? I'm not a young woman anymore. And the air in this house is rather…stuffy. Perhaps it’s just the dust. Honestly, I suspect my husband over-waters the ferns. Is that relevant? I really don't understand why all these questions are necessary. I’ve lived a long life without this… scrutiny.
DOCTOR: The crackling could indicate some fluid build-up in the lungs, which warrants further investigation. Given your age and the slight elevation in blood pressure, I recommend a chest X-ray and an EKG to rule out any underlying cardiac or pulmonary issues. I understand your reluctance, Ms. Engelhaupt, but these tests are standard procedure and will provide us with a clearer picture of your overall health. I’ll have my assistant schedule those for you. Would that be acceptable?
