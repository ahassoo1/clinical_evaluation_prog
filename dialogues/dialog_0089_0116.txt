DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. I’m Dr. Roseburroough. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Rose… Roseburroough, is it? Yes, a lovely name. Well, it’s these legs of mine. They just… ache. Mostly at night, you see. Wakes me right up sometimes. It’s been going on… oh, goodness. A while now. I can't rightly say how long. A good many months, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Bilstein. “A good many months” is helpful. And it’s mostly at night, waking you up. Is it both legs, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, both legs, dear. Though… sometimes one feels worse than the other. It’s hard to say which. They sort of take turns, I think. Or maybe I just notice one more when it’s really bad. Old age, you know. Things get… mixed up.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for things to feel different from day to day, especially with aches and pains. So, both legs, with the pain fluctuating. Can you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How to describe it… It's not a sharp pain, not like a broken bone or anything. It’s more of a… a tightening. Like a knot forming in the muscle. And it pulls. A deep, achy pull. Sometimes it feels like it’s cramping, like my muscles are trying to bunch up all on their own. It's… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tightening, achy pull, sometimes cramping... uncomfortable. Does anything make it better?
PATIENT: Well, now… that’s a good question. Sometimes… sometimes getting up and walking around helps a little. Just a bit. And… oh, I can’t rightly recall if this does anything, but my daughter, bless her heart, used to rub lotion on my legs. Perhaps that helped? It’s… everything gets muddled, you know. I'm not sure what truly eases it. A warm bath sometimes feels nice, but it doesn’t fix it.
DOCTOR: Alright, walking around a little helps sometimes, lotion possibly… and a warm bath feels nice. And what about things that make it worse?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me think… Sitting for too long, I suppose. If I’m sitting for a long time, watching television or… well, just sitting, it tends to get worse. And… cold weather. Definitely cold weather. Makes everything ache all over, but the legs especially.
DOCTOR: Okay, sitting for long periods and cold weather make it worse. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Now, that’s a new question. Let me see… I haven’t noticed any swelling, no. But… my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. I can't say for certain. I suppose my feet might be a little puffy sometimes, but I just assumed that was… old age again. I don't think it's noticeable swelling, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, no noticeable swelling, though perhaps a little puffiness. Now, Ms. Bilstein, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, if that’s alright. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, go right ahead, dear. My health… well, it’s been a long road. Let me see… I had a bit of trouble with my heart years ago, but the doctor said it was mostly sorted out. I take a small pill for my blood pressure, just one a day. And… oh, arthritis, of course. That’s in my hands mostly, but it can bother other joints too.
DOCTOR: Okay, some heart trouble in the past, blood pressure medication, and arthritis. What about any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Yes, I had my gallbladder removed many years ago. And… a hysterectomy, when I was younger. That’s about it, I believe. Nothing major in recent years, thankfully. I try to avoid hospitals whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, gallbladder removal and a hysterectomy. Now, thinking about your family… is there anyone else in your family who has arthritis, or any similar joint problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My mother had terrible arthritis in her hands and knees. Couldn't do a thing towards the end. And my sister, bless her soul, she had problems with her hips. Needed a new one, eventually. It runs in the family, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis and hip problems in your family. Now, what about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Social history… What does that entail? Well, I was married for a long time, to a very good man. He passed away about ten years ago. We didn’t have any children, just a lot of lovely memories. I live alone now, in my own home. I don’t get out much these days, but I have a daughter who visits when she can. She lives a ways away, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, you live alone, daughter visits when she can. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. Never smoked a day in my life. And I haven’t had a drink of alcohol in… well, goodness, probably fifty years. My husband wasn’t much of a drinker either. It just wasn't our thing. I prefer a nice cup of tea, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking or alcohol. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. Not that I know of, no. I haven’t had any bad reactions to the pills the doctor’s given me over the years. But… my memory isn't what it used to be. Perhaps I’ve forgotten something? It’s possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, but some uncertainty due to memory. And finally, what medications are you currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just the one, dear. For my blood pressure. It’s a small, white pill. I take it every morning with my tea. I think it’s… Lisinopril. Yes, that’s it. Lisinopril. I’ve been taking it for years, and it seems to be keeping everything alright.
DOCTOR: Alright, Lisinopril for blood pressure. Thank you, Ms. Bilstein, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam if that’s alright. I’ll need to check your legs, listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That sounds perfectly alright. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just be gentle, if you would. These old bones aren't as sturdy as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bilstein. Let’s start with your legs. Can you point to where you feel the most pain right now?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Right here… It’s not one particular spot, it’s more… all over back there. But it feels worse sometimes on this leg… It just feels tighter, you see. And achier.
DOCTOR: Alright. There is some tenderness to palpation in both calves, a bit more pronounced on the right as you mentioned. No swelling or redness noted. I’m listening to your heart and lungs now… deep breaths, if you would. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear. Now, let's take your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 142/88.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. That sounds… good, I suppose. I don't rightly know what those numbers mean, but if you say it's alright… Is that bad, dear? The blood pressure?
DOCTOR: It’s a little elevated, Ms. Bilstein. Not critically high, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. It could be contributing to your leg pain, or it could be unrelated. Given your history and symptoms, it sounds like you’re experiencing muscle aches, possibly related to age, arthritis, or circulation. I'd like to order some blood work to rule out any other causes. We’ll check your electrolytes, kidney function, and a marker called creatinine kinase, which can indicate muscle damage. I’m also going to order a simple X-ray of your legs to check for any bone issues.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work and X-rays… That sounds… a bit much, dear. But if you think it’s necessary… I suppose it’s best to be safe. My daughter always says I worry too much. Will it be painful? The X-rays? And the blood work… do they take a lot? I don’t like needles very much.
DOCTOR: It's alright to be concerned, Ms. Bilstein. The X-rays are completely painless – you’ll just stand or lie still for a few minutes while the machine takes pictures. The blood work will involve a small needle prick – it’s quick, and most people don't feel much more than a slight pinch. We’ll only need a small vial of blood. It’s all routine, and it will help us get a clearer picture of what’s going on. While we wait for the results, I recommend continuing with gentle exercise, like walking, and using warm compresses on your legs. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, can also help manage the pain. However, if the pain worsens or you develop any new symptoms, like swelling, redness, or difficulty breathing, please contact me immediately.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Gentle exercise and warm compresses… I can manage that, I think. And the pain relievers… I have some ibuprofen at home, I believe. It's just… I worry about falling. My balance isn't what it used to be. And this waiting… I don’t like being in limbo. But if you think it’s best, I’ll do it. When will I hear back about the results?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Ms. Bilstein. We can discuss fall prevention strategies as well. Perhaps a referral to physical therapy would be helpful to improve your balance and strength. As for the results, the lab should have them back within a few days, and my office will call you as soon as I’ve reviewed them. I’ll explain everything thoroughly at that time. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. I think you’ve covered everything. Just… thank you. For taking the time to listen, and for not dismissing my worries. It’s comforting to know someone is taking this seriously. I appreciate your patience with an old woman who forgets things easily. And, yes. Fall prevention… that sounds very wise. Perhaps I will ask about physical therapy when I hear back.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Bilstein. It's my job to listen and help in any way I can. And please, don't worry about forgetting things. It's perfectly normal. We’ll take things one step at a time. Let's get you scheduled for those blood tests and X-rays, and we’ll talk about physical therapy options when we have the results. My nurse will be in shortly to go over the paperwork and answer any questions you might have. Do you have any trouble getting home?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear. My daughter usually drives me. She’ll be here shortly to pick me up. But thank you for asking. I suppose… there’s nothing else. Just… a little worried, as always. But I trust you’ll take good care of me. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bilstein. You take care now. And don't hesitate to call if anything changes. It was a pleasure meeting you.
