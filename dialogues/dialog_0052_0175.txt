DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Way. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor Shely. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's my back, mostly. It’s been…painful, yeah, that’s the word. Not a sudden thing, it’s been building up for a bit now.
DOCTOR: I see. And when you say “building up,” can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, it started maybe a month ago? Just a little ache after I’d been standing for a long time, you know, like after gardening. I figured it was just my age, getting old. But it’s gotten worse. It’s not just after standing now. It’s…pretty much all the time, a dull ache. And sometimes, I get these sharp pains if I bend over.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that detailed description, Mr. Way. So, it began approximately a month ago with an ache after prolonged standing, primarily after gardening, and has progressed to a constant dull ache with sharp pains upon bending. To help me understand this more fully, could you pinpoint where exactly on your back the pain is located?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah. It’s…lower back, definitely. Right around here. Not right on the spine, but close. And sometimes it feels like it kinda goes around to my side a bit, you know? It's hard to explain exactly where it is, it kinda moves around.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Way. It’s common for back pain to be somewhat diffuse and shifting. So, lower back, slightly to the left of the spine, and occasionally radiating around to your side. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain currently?
PATIENT: Hmm…right now? I’d say…a four, maybe a five. It’s not crippling, I can still move around, but it's definitely there. It’s a constant reminder, you know? It gets worse with certain movements, that’s when it goes up to maybe an eight, but mostly it's around a four or five.
DOCTOR: Thank you. A baseline of four to five, increasing to eight with certain movements. Now, have you noticed anything that specifically relieves the pain?
PATIENT: Let me think… Lying down helps. Flat on my back, mostly. And sometimes, if I take a warm shower, that eases it a little. But it doesn’t last long, just for a bit. Really, nothing gets rid of it completely, just takes the edge off.
DOCTOR: I see. Lying flat and warm showers provide temporary relief. Now, let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever had back problems before – any injuries, surgeries, or other treatments for your back?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major, anyway. I pulled a muscle once, a long time ago, when I was younger, helping a friend move furniture, but that healed pretty quick. Just a bit sore for a week or so. Nothing like this, though. Never had any surgeries or anything. I generally stay pretty healthy, you know? I try to.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No prior significant back issues or surgeries. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, every morning. And sometimes, if I have a headache, I’ll take some ibuprofen, but that’s it. Nothing regular, nothing for the back pain specifically. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can.
DOCTOR: Okay, a multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen as needed. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always asks me that, and I always say no. She worries about things like that. I've never had any trouble, though.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your general health. Do you have any other medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, none of those. I had my cholesterol checked a couple of years ago, and the doctor said it was fine. I try to eat pretty healthy. I do get a little tired sometimes, but I figure that’s just getting older. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no diagnosed medical conditions, normal cholesterol levels a couple of years ago, and occasional fatigue attributed to age. Now, could you briefly describe your typical daily activity level?
PATIENT: Well, I’m retired now, so it’s not as much as it used to be. I do some gardening, like I said. I try to walk around the block most days, if the weather’s nice. I spend a lot of time reading, watching TV with my wife…pretty standard, you know? Not very strenuous. I used to be much more active, when I was working. But now it’s pretty relaxed.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Way. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Let me know if I need to do anything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take some deep breaths for me, please. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all major muscle groups in the lower extremities. Now, I’m going to assess your range of motion in your back. There is some limitation with forward flexion, and you report pain with bending to the left. No pain with extension. Finally, I’m going to perform a straight leg raise test to check for nerve involvement. Straight leg raise test is negative bilaterally. No radicular pain elicited. Based on the physical exam, I don't find any significant neurological deficits. There is some limitation in forward flexion and pain with bending to the left. It appears to be a mechanical issue, potentially a muscle strain or ligament sprain.
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense. Muscle strain…that’s what I was kinda thinking. I just didn’t know for sure. So, no broken anything or anything serious?
DOCTOR: No, the exam does not suggest a fracture or any serious underlying pathology. Based on your history and the physical exam, it is most likely a lumbar muscle strain or ligament sprain. Now, to confirm this and rule out other possibilities, I'd recommend an X-ray of your lumbar spine. It's a relatively quick and painless procedure. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. If that’s what you think is best, then yeah, let’s do the X-ray. Better safe than sorry, right? Will that take long? And, uh…how much will it cost? I don't have insurance, so I gotta think about those things.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible approach, Mr. Way. Yes, it’s always best to be thorough. The X-ray itself will only take a few minutes. The cost without insurance varies, but I will have the receptionist provide you with an itemized price list before proceeding. We can also discuss payment options if needed. Before we proceed with the X-ray, I want to briefly discuss some initial management strategies to help alleviate your pain. We can start with over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, as you’ve already mentioned you've used ibuprofen. I also recommend applying ice packs to your lower back for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day, especially in the first 24 to 48 hours. After that, you can switch to heat. Gentle stretching and low-impact exercises, like walking, can also be beneficial, but avoid any movements that exacerbate your pain. While we're waiting for the X-ray results, I would like you to monitor your symptoms. If you experience any new symptoms such as fever, weakness or numbness in your legs, difficulty with bowel or bladder control, or worsening pain that doesn't respond to over-the-counter pain relievers, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Okay, ice, then heat, ibuprofen, gentle walking…and watch out for those other things. Yeah, I think I can remember that. No fever, no weakness, no…trouble going to the bathroom, right? And call if the pain gets worse. That sounds…manageable. I guess I just gotta take it easy for a bit. Is there anything else I should be doing, like…specific stretches or exercises? Or things I should avoid? Like, is gardening totally out of the question for a while?
DOCTOR: Precisely, Mr. Way. You’ve summarized it perfectly. Regarding specific stretches, a gentle knee-to-chest stretch can be helpful, but only if it doesn’t exacerbate your pain. Lie on your back with your knees bent, and gently pull one knee towards your chest at a time. Avoid any twisting motions. As for activities to avoid, yes, gardening is best avoided for now, as it involves a lot of bending, lifting, and twisting. Any activity that significantly increases your pain should be avoided until your symptoms improve. Focus on maintaining good posture while sitting and standing, and avoid prolonged sitting or standing. I will provide you with a handout detailing these exercises and precautions. Once we have the X-ray results, we can discuss a more tailored treatment plan, which may include physical therapy or other interventions if needed. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. A handout would be great. I always forget things, so writing it down helps. Physical therapy…okay. I’m willing to try anything to get this pain under control. Alright, let’s get the X-ray done, then. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad to hear that. The X-ray technician is just down the hall, in Room 3. I will have the receptionist notify them that you are coming. She will also provide you with a gown to wear. Please let me know if you have any questions while you’re waiting. I’ll be here in my office if you need anything. Once the X-ray is completed, they will send the images directly to my computer, and I will review them as soon as they are available. We will discuss the results as soon as I have them, likely within the next hour. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor Shely. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I’ll go find Room 3 then.
DOCTOR: You are most welcome, Mr. Way. I am happy to help. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns while you’re waiting. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to discussing the X-ray results with you soon.
