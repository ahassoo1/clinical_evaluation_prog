DOCTOR: Alright, Nixon. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor Osterholm. Well, my left leg is… quite swollen. It’s been getting bigger for a few days now, and it’s a bit uncomfortable. I do have… a heart thing, the doctors told me. Something about it not beating right. Atrial… something. I forget the proper name.
DOCTOR: Atrial fibrillation, likely. It’s common with your… demographic. Swelling, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it! Atrial fibrillation. Thank you. And yes, my left leg. It’s mostly in the calf, I think. It feels… tight, and a little bit achy. Not terribly painful, but noticeable. It's definitely bigger than my right one.
DOCTOR: Right. And when did you first notice this swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… probably about four days ago. I noticed it after I was on my feet a lot, helping set up for the computer club’s event. It wasn’t too bad then, just a little puffiness. But it’s gotten worse each day since. I didn't think much of it at first, honestly.
DOCTOR: Computer club… right. Any redness or warmth to the leg?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. It doesn’t feel warm, and I haven’t seen any redness. It just… looks bigger. And it feels a bit heavier, if that makes sense. Like it's full of… something. I'm not sure if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: “Full of something.” Well. Let's have a look then. Could you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know if you need me to adjust anything. It’s a bit high for me, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Alright. Hmm. Yes, there is definite edema, as expected. And… slightly tender to the touch here, along the calf muscle. Can you point to where it hurts the most?
PATIENT: It's… right about there, Doctor. It's not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable when you press on it. Like a bruise, but without the colour. It feels a bit… deeper than a surface bruise, though. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Pulses are present, though slightly diminished. Let’s check your reflexes. Two plus. Normal. Alright. Tell me, have you had any recent injuries to your leg?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I haven't tripped or bumped it or anything like that. I walk a lot, to get to the university, but that’s about it. And I haven't been doing any extra exercise or anything that might have strained it. It just… started swelling. It's a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Worrying. Yes, well. Given your history of atrial fibrillation, and the unilateral swelling… it could be a blood clot. Though, the lack of significant pain is… atypical. We need to rule things out. I'm going to order a D-dimer test, and a venous ultrasound of your left leg. It's standard procedure.
PATIENT: A blood clot? Oh dear. That sounds… serious. A D-dimer test and… an ultrasound? What does that involve, Doctor? And will it take long? I have a lecture tomorrow morning, and I really shouldn’t miss it. Is it… painful? I'm not very good with needles.
DOCTOR: A D-dimer is just a simple blood test, a small prick to the finger or arm. The ultrasound uses sound waves, it doesn’t hurt at all. It’s just… a bit cold gel on your leg. The technician will run a probe over it. It takes about 20-30 minutes. We need to see if there's a blockage in the vein. Given your… condition, we can’t take chances. You’re right to be concerned. Let's get the blood draw done first, and then schedule the ultrasound for as soon as possible. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: No, I don't have any allergies that I know of. I've had injections before, for… travel vaccinations, and I was fine. A travel nurse gave them to me. And that sounds… reassuring about the ultrasound, at least. Just cold gel, you say? Good. Twenty to thirty minutes, you think? I suppose I can arrange things around that. Is there anything I should do before the ultrasound? Or… anything I shouldn't do? Like, should I walk less?
DOCTOR: No, no need to walk less. Just… try to keep your leg elevated as much as possible until the ultrasound. And don’t apply any lotions or creams to your leg. As for the blood draw, the nurse will be right in to get that done. We’ll have the results back within a few hours. Try not to worry too much. It's likely just… a strain. But we need to be certain. Do you have any… family history of blood clots?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. My grandfather, on my mother's side, he had something… in his leg, a long time ago. I think he was in hospital for it. But I don’t know what it was, exactly. It was… a very long time ago. My mother didn’t talk about it much. It was before I was born, I think. So, I suppose that could be relevant? I’m not sure. It was something about the blood, I believe. And a long stay in hospital. Does that help at all, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Right. A family history of clots… that’s… helpful to know. Okay. The nurse should be here shortly to draw your blood. After that, we’ll schedule the ultrasound. We’ll call you with the time. In the meantime, just elevate your leg and try to relax. And if you experience any sudden, severe pain, or shortness of breath, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Elevate my leg, relax, and go to the emergency room if I have sudden pain or trouble breathing. I will do that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it. I suppose I'll just wait here then, until the nurse arrives? Is there anywhere I can sit more comfortably? This chair is a bit… hard.
DOCTOR: You can sit over there, if you prefer. It's marginally better. The nurse is usually quite prompt. Just let me know if you need anything. And try not to… overthink it. It’s likely nothing serious. I’ve seen far worse. But it’s always best to be cautious. We’ll know more once we have the results back.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I shall try not to overthink it. Easier said than done, though, isn't it? I suppose I'll just sit here quietly and wait. And try to keep my leg up. I do hope it’s nothing too worrying. It’s just… inconvenient, more than anything, to miss a lecture. But, of course, my health is more important. .
