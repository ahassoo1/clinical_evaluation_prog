DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Mohamed Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it's… it's a bit embarrassing, really. I'm having trouble… going to the bathroom. Urinating, I think you call it. It’s just… difficult to start, and then it’s not a strong stream, you know? It’s been going on for… oh, maybe a couple of weeks now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Yadao, no need to be embarrassed at all. These things happen, and we're here to help. It’s good you brought this to our attention. So, you've noticed difficulty initiating urination, and then the stream isn't as strong as it used to be. And you said this has been going on for about two weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. About two weeks, maybe a little longer. It wasn’t sudden, it just… gradually got harder. And yes, starting is the worst part. Sometimes I have to… push a little, which doesn't feel right. I don’t know if that makes sense. I don't have any pain, though, not really. Just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Yadao. And it’s helpful to know there’s no pain. So, no pain during urination, and no pain afterwards either?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not before, not during, not after. It’s just… inconvenient, and a little worrying, to be honest. I used to be able to… well, you know. Go whenever I needed to, no problem. Now I have to think about it all the time. Is this… is this something serious, Doctor? I worry about things like infections, you know. My sister, she had a bad infection once… it was awful.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Yadao. It’s good you’re thinking about these things, and it’s wise to get it checked out. Infections are certainly something we'll consider. Let’s gather a bit more information to help me understand what might be going on. First, have you noticed any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in the urine… hmm. Let me think. No, not really the color, I don’t think. It looks pretty normal. But… now that you mention it, sometimes it smells a little stronger than usual, maybe? Not a terrible smell, just… noticeable. And I think… yes, I've gone to the bathroom more often lately, even when I don't really need to, you know? Just a little bit each time, though. Nothing huge.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the urine color appears normal, but you’ve noticed a slightly stronger odor and increased frequency, though the amount each time is small. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let's see… I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe thirty years ago now. And I had a hysterectomy, also a long time ago, must be forty years. Otherwise… I haven’t really been sick sick. I get the flu sometimes, like everyone does. I take a little medication for my blood pressure, a small dose. And… oh, I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, but it’s not too bad. I’m generally quite healthy, I think, for my age. I try to eat well, and I walk every day. Does that help? Should I tell you about my sister’s medical problems? She had… well, a lot of things.
DOCTOR: That’s very good information, Ms. Yadao. Thank you. We can certainly discuss your sister’s history later if it seems relevant, but let’s focus on you for now. So, gallbladder removal and hysterectomy in the past, some arthritis, and medication for blood pressure. What is the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have it written down here somewhere. Ah, yes. It’s Lisinopril. Just a small dose, 10 milligrams, once a day. My regular doctor prescribed it, about five years ago now. I haven't changed the dose since. And I take it every morning with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 10 milligrams daily. Good. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things, and I’ve never had any trouble. I used to be afraid of bees, but that's not an allergy, just… a fear. I’ve never had any trouble with penicillin or anything like that, either. I think I would know if I had an allergy, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: You would, yes. That's good to know. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, let’s quickly review your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not me. I used to live with my husband, God rest his soul, and he smoked a pipe, but I never touched a cigarette in my life. I maybe have a glass of wine with dinner once a month, if that. And I certainly don’t do any… recreational drugs! Never have, never will. I’m a very sensible woman, Doctor. I like my tea, and my walks, and my garden. That’s enough excitement for me.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Yadao. Very good. Now, with your permission, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. This will involve checking your blood pressure – just to confirm the medication is working as expected – and listening to your abdomen. I may also need to do a quick neurological exam. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Blood pressure is fine, I suppose. I always worry about it, but my regular doctor says it's usually good. And listening to my abdomen… that sounds okay too. A neurological exam? What does that involve? Just tell me what you're going to do, and I'll cooperate. I'm not afraid.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Yadao. A neurological exam is just a quick assessment of your reflexes and sensation. It helps us rule out any nerve-related issues. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 142 over 88. It’s possible it’s just a bit of anxiety from being in the clinic, or it could indicate that your medication needs adjusting. We'll discuss that with your regular doctor. Now, let’s listen to your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. Your abdomen sounds normal, and I don't feel any tenderness or masses. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. I'll lightly tap on your knees and ankles with this small hammer. Please relax your legs. Your reflexes are normal. Finally, I’ll just quickly check sensation in your feet. Can you tell me if you feel this when I touch your feet?
PATIENT: Yes, I feel that. And that too. Everything feels normal to me. A little cold, maybe, but that's just the cold gel, I suppose. Is everything alright, Doctor? You seem to be… thinking. Is something wrong? I do worry, you know. It's just… this trouble going to the bathroom. It's very upsetting.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask, Ms. Yadao, and I apologize if I seemed lost in thought. It’s just that based on your history and the physical exam, there are several possibilities we need to consider. The elevated blood pressure could be contributing to your symptoms, but it doesn’t fully explain everything. The lack of pain is reassuring, but it doesn't rule anything out. Given your age, and the gradual onset of difficulty urinating, the most likely possibilities are an enlarged prostate – even in women, there can be tissue that causes similar issues – or a weakened bladder. It could also be a urinary tract infection, though your lack of pain makes that less likely. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a urinalysis to check for infection and other abnormalities. I also recommend a post-void residual volume test – this measures how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I want to know what's going on. Urinalysis and… post-void residual volume test? What does that involve? Will it be uncomfortable? I do worry about tests, you know. But I understand you need to find out what's happening, so yes, I'm willing. Just tell me what I need to do. And… are these tests expensive? My Medicare… will it cover them? I worry about money too, you see. Everything is so expensive these days.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Yadao. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious about tests, and to worry about the cost. The post-void residual volume test is quite simple. After you urinate, we'll use a small, sterile device to measure the amount of urine remaining in your bladder. It's a little like providing a urine sample, but the technician will use a catheter - a very thin, flexible tube - to drain the remaining urine. It might feel a little uncomfortable – a brief sensation of pressure – but it shouldn’t be painful. We'll explain the procedure in detail before it’s done. As for the cost, Medicare should cover both the urinalysis and the post-void residual volume test. We’ll verify your coverage before proceeding, and our billing department will handle all the paperwork. They can also give you an estimate of any potential out-of-pocket costs. Now, I'm going to write the orders for these tests. Would you like me to explain anything further at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. A little uncomfortable, maybe, but not painful. And Medicare should cover it. That's good. Yes, that's very good. I appreciate you explaining everything so thoroughly, Doctor. It makes me feel much better. So, I just… urinate, and then a technician will… measure what's left. And then you'll know more. Is that right? And when will I get the results? I do worry about waiting. I just want to get this sorted out. It’s very upsetting, this trouble going to the bathroom. It really is. But thank you, Doctor. Thank you for listening.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Yadao. Yes, you've summarized it perfectly. You'll urinate as normally as possible, and then the technician will measure the residual urine. The lab usually gets the results back within a couple of days. I’ll review them as soon as they're available, and we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. I understand your anxiety about waiting, and I’ll do my best to get the results to you as quickly as possible. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, or significant pain, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You've explained everything so clearly, Doctor. I really appreciate your patience. It's just… worrying, you know? But I feel much better knowing what’s happening, and that you're taking care of it. Thank you again, Doctor. You’re a very kind man. And please, tell your technician I might be a little nervous. That's all. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Yadao. I’m glad I could ease your mind. I will certainly let the technician know, and they will be extra gentle and reassuring. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you soon.
