DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Uh... well, it’s this… team. The tryouts. For the… sports. It's a physical, right? They said I need a physical. My ex-wife, she made me get this scheduled. Something about… being sure I can still… do things.
DOCTOR: Right. A sports physical. Well, we certainly can do that for you. Though, at your age, it's always good to get a thorough check-up regardless of sports. So, just to clarify, you're trying out for a sports team?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it. A team. Look, I’m not one for all this… fuss. I used to be… very active. A long time ago. It’s just… something to do, you know? Keep busy. I don’t need a whole lot of… poking and prodding. Just tell me if I'm good to go. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, with all due respect, "just telling you if you're good to go" isn’t really how medical evaluations work. Even if it was just a simple sports physical, I need to ask some questions and do a proper exam to ensure your health and safety. It’s not about poking and prodding, it’s about responsible care. Now, let's start with a bit of your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Medical…history? Honestly, Doctor, that was a long time ago. I… I don’t really remember. I had the usual things, I guess. A cold now and then. Maybe the flu once. Nothing serious. My ex-wife, she always took care of all that. She had a doctor, and I just… went when she told me to. I don’t recall any… conditions. Is that good enough? Or do you need a list? Because I certainly don't have one.
DOCTOR: It’s… helpful to know. But “usual things” doesn’t give me much to work with, Mr. Bartok. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized…? Hmm. Let me think… There was that time with my knee. Years ago. Playing… something. Baseball, maybe? It hurt real bad, but I don't think I actually stayed in the hospital. They wrapped it up, gave me some pills… and I went home. That doesn’t count, does it? It was just a sprain, I think. A bad sprain. Definitely not serious. Why are you asking all these questions? This is supposed to be a quick checkup for a team!
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your frustration, but even a seemingly minor injury can have lasting effects. And it’s my responsibility to gather a complete picture of your health. Do you recall any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Now that’s… difficult. I think… maybe my appendix? A long time ago. When I was younger. But honestly, Doctor, it was so long ago, I can barely remember. Everything’s a bit… fuzzy. My ex-wife, she’d know. She kept all the records. I just… showed up when she told me to. Is this going to take all day? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, this is taking as long as it needs to ensure your safety. We can proceed in one of two ways. We can continue trying to piece together your history – which is proving difficult given your recollection – or we can proceed with a very thorough physical exam and some basic lab work to get a baseline assessment of your current health. However, please understand that without a more complete history, I may need to recommend further testing or a referral to a specialist to rule out any potential underlying issues. Which would you prefer?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, this is ridiculous. I just want to know if I can play some sports. Not… relive my entire life. Just do the exam. The poking and prodding. And tell me if I’m good to go. I don’t want any “further testing” or “specialists.” It’s a waste of time. And money. Just… get it over with. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Bartok. We will proceed with a thorough physical exam. However, I must reiterate that this exam is only a snapshot of your current health, and without a complete medical history, it may not be comprehensive. Let’s start with your vital signs. I’ll need to take your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then we’ll move on to a general examination – listening to your heart and lungs, checking your reflexes, and assessing your range of motion. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get on with it. The quicker the better. I have… things to do, you know. And please, be gentle. I'm not as young as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just relax your arm for me… Now, I’m going to take your blood pressure. It may feel a little tight, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Blood pressure is 148 over 92. Slightly elevated, but not alarming. Now, let's check your pulse. Pulse is 78 beats per minute, regular rhythm. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Heart sounds are regular, but I do hear some mild crackling in the lower lobes of both lungs… That could be indicative of some minor congestion, or simply fluid buildup. We’ll need to keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Reflexes are… diminished, but still present. That could be normal for your age, or it could indicate some nerve involvement. Finally, I’m going to assess your range of motion. Could you please try to touch your toes for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy? It’s not easy, you know. I haven't done that in… years. And my back… it's a little stiff. This is all very… unpleasant. Just tell me if I can play, Doctor. That’s all I care about.
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, based on this preliminary examination, I have some concerns. Your elevated blood pressure, diminished reflexes, limited range of motion, and lower back pain are all things that need to be investigated further. Frankly, I cannot clear you for sports without additional testing. At the very least, I recommend a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and an X-ray of your lower back to rule out any underlying issues. However, given your history – or lack thereof – and the findings of this exam, I strongly recommend a referral to a cardiologist and a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. I understand you want a quick answer, but your health is too important to risk. Proceeding with sports without addressing these concerns could have serious consequences. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Are you serious? A cardiologist? A neurologist? For wanting to play a little sports? This is ridiculous! I'm not an old man, you know. I'm perfectly healthy. It's just a little stiffness, a little… getting older. Look, I don't need any tests, or specialists, or… anything. This is a waste of time and money. I'm not paying for all this. Just tell me if I’m good to go, or I’m leaving. I have better things to do than sit here and be poked and prodded by a bunch of doctors. I think I’ve wasted enough of my time here. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Bartok, I understand your frustration, but I am ethically obligated to provide responsible medical care. I cannot, in good conscience, clear you for sports without addressing these concerns. I appreciate that you're reluctant to pursue further testing, but I strongly believe it's in your best interest. I can provide you with a list of specialists in the area, and work with you to find affordable options. However, if you insist on proceeding without further evaluation, I must document your refusal in your medical record and advise you against participating in any strenuous physical activity. I cannot be held responsible for any adverse events that may occur. Ultimately, the decision is yours. But I urge you to consider the potential risks before making a decision you may regret. .
