DOCTOR: Hi Philipp, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Condray. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… my heart, it feels… funny sometimes. Like it’s flapping. Not always, but… yeah. It’s been happening for a little while now. Maybe a month? It doesn’t hurt, just… weird.
DOCTOR: Okay, “funny” and “flapping” – I appreciate you describing it that way. A month, you said?
PATIENT: Yes. About a month. Maybe a little longer. It comes and goes. Some days I don’t feel it at all, and then other days… it happens a lot. Like, five or six times. It doesn't last long each time, maybe just a few seconds. But it’s… unsettling. My wife, she says I should come see someone.
DOCTOR: That’s good of your wife to encourage you to get it checked out. It’s always best to look into these things. So, when it happens, are you doing anything specific?
PATIENT: No, not really. I'm just… doing things. Sometimes I’m walking, sometimes I'm sitting. Sometimes even when I’m trying to sleep. It doesn't seem to matter. That's what's strange. I don’t think it’s from doing something hard. It just… starts.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it doesn’t seem to be related to exertion. That's helpful to know. Do you feel anything else when this happens?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. Maybe a little… lightheaded sometimes? But not every time. And it goes away quick. Not like I'm gonna fall down or anything. Just a little… woozy. Like when you stand up fast. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, lightheadedness sometimes, similar to standing up quickly. I want to get a good picture of what's going on, so let's go through a bit of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions before?
PATIENT: No, never. Nothing. I’ve been pretty healthy, always. I get a little cold sometimes, like everyone, but never anything serious. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Maybe ten years? Since my wife and I… well, never mind. Just a long time. I don't take any pills, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No prior medical conditions or medications. And you haven’t been to the doctor in about ten years. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. Nope. I eat everything. My wife always jokes I have a stomach like a goat. Nothing bothers me. I don't get rashes or… wheezing. Nothing like that. I'm pretty sure. I’ve never had a problem before.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Let’s talk about your family a little bit. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have had any heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. But he lived a long life. He was always working, always busy. My mother… she was healthy, I think. I don’t really remember. And my brothers… I haven’t seen them in a long time. I don’t know. Nobody ever talked about heart problems, really. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It can be important. High blood pressure in your father is something to note. Okay. And how about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Um… I work. I operate machines at the factory. It's not too hard, but it's all day. I try to eat okay. My wife cooks. I don’t drink much, maybe a beer sometimes on the weekend. And I don’t smoke. I used to, a long time ago, but I stopped. About… fifteen years ago. I don't do much exercise, though. I should, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you work at the factory, eat a generally healthy diet, occasional beer, quit smoking fifteen years ago, and could probably use more exercise. Let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you need to do. My wife said I should get checked out good. I hope it's nothing serious. I have things to do, you know? Work and… life. But I want to be healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your blood pressure is a little elevated – 142/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Your heart rhythm sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's a soft murmur, and not necessarily concerning on its own, but we should investigate further. Your lungs sound clear. Do you know if you’ve ever had a murmur before?
PATIENT: A murmur? No, never. Nobody ever said anything about a murmur. What is a murmur? Is that bad? It sounds… scary.
DOCTOR: It's okay, let's not get scared just yet. A murmur is just an extra sound your heart makes when it beats. It can be perfectly normal, especially in younger people. But because you're describing these palpitations and we’ve detected a murmur, I want to run a few tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I’d like to order an EKG – that's a simple test to check your heart's electrical activity – and a blood test to check your thyroid levels and rule out any other possible causes of palpitations. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: EKG and blood test… okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. My wife said to do whatever you say. I… I don’t really understand all this, but I trust you. Will it hurt? And… how long will it take? I have work tomorrow.
DOCTOR: It won't hurt at all. The EKG is completely painless – we just put some stickers on your chest, arms, and legs. The blood test is just a small needle prick. It should only take about 15-20 minutes to do both tests. I'll have the results back within a few days. In the meantime, if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no dizziness… I understand. Stickers and a needle… alright. A few days… that’s okay. So, just stickers and blood, then wait a few days. And if something bad happens, go to the hospital. Is there anything else I need to do? Or… anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: No, nothing else for now. Just try to relax and go about your normal routine. I'm going to write you a note for work explaining you have a doctor's appointment and may need to take some time off if the tests show anything that requires further attention. The nurse will come in and draw your blood and get you set up for the EKG. Do you have any questions for me before we get started?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You explained it all pretty good, Doctor. Thank you. Just… I hope it's nothing serious. I have things to do, you know? I appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll get to the bottom of this. We’re taking the right steps. Let me call the nurse to get things started.
