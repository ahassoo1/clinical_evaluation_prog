DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Minerd. Welcome. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Uh, well, it’s my face and legs, mostly. They’re… puffy. Been that way a bit now, I reckon. Not sure why, though. Seems to come and go. Don’t really bother me too much, to be honest. Just… noticeable, y'know?
DOCTOR: Okay, puffy face and legs… comes and goes, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's right. Some days I barely notice it, other days… well, my wife used to say I looked like a balloon. She had a good eye for things, always did. It's been worse since… well, since she passed, I suppose. Though I doubt that's got anything to do with it. Just a coincidence, probably.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not uncommon for things to feel… different after a loss. But we should still look into the puffiness itself, just to be sure. Can you tell me more about when you notice it being worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. Let me think. Seems like it’s worse in the evenings, maybe? After I’ve been on my feet all day at the shop. Welding, mostly. Lots of standing. And… hot work, you know? Makes you sweat. Though, to be fair, I always sweat. Big fella, I am… well, not big big, but… solid. It's hard to explain. Doesn't seem to matter what I'm eating, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so worse in the evenings after being on your feet all day, particularly with the welding. No noticeable connection to what you eat?
PATIENT: Nope. I eat pretty much what I always have. Meat and potatoes, mostly. Bit of fish on Fridays, used to go to the market with my wife. She liked the salmon. I wouldn't say I’m fancy, or anything. This is a nice clinic, though. Quiet. Not like the city hospitals, all hustle and bustle.
DOCTOR: We try to be comfortable here. Alright, let's try to get a bit more detail about the puffiness itself. Does it feel…painful?
PATIENT: Painful? No, not really. Not painful. More… heavy. Like my legs are full of water, or somethin'. Achy, maybe, at the end of the day, but that's just from standing so long. It's not like a sharp pain, or anything. Just… uncomfortable. I can still walk around, still do my work. It's just… a nuisance, really. A bit embarrassing, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Heavy, achy, mostly in the evenings… Alright. Have you noticed any changes in your urine?
PATIENT: Urine? Changes… what do you mean? Like… color? I haven't really looked, to be honest. Never really paid much attention to that sort of thing. Just… goes in the toilet, y'know? Is that bad? Should I be looking at it? I feel like an old fool now, asking these questions.
DOCTOR: No, no, it’s perfectly alright to ask questions. It’s good you’re asking. I just wanted to rule out some things. Let’s not worry about the urine right now. Do you have any other medical problems that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Medical problems… hmm. Well, my back's been a bit dodgy for years, from all the bending and welding. Old age, I suppose. And my knees… they creak like an old ship. But that's just… part of getting older, isn’t it? Doc said somethin' about my blood pressure once, years ago, but I can't rightly remember what he said. Didn’t seem important at the time. I don't take any pills, if that's what you're askin’. Never been one for medicines.
DOCTOR: Okay, back and knee pain, possible history of high blood pressure… No medications currently. Do you have any allergies to anything?
PATIENT: Allergies… not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. Fish, shellfish, meat, vegetables… never had a reaction to anythin'. Used to help my wife in the garden, lots of flowers and such. Bees buzzing around, never got stung. I think I'm alright, allergy-wise. Though, my wife used to say I was allergic to housework, but that’s a different story entirely.
DOCTOR: Alright. And, if you don’t mind me asking, is there any family history of medical problems?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother… she had a bit of trouble with her heart when she got older. Spent some time in the hospital. My father… he was a strong fella, lived a long life. Worked on the farm his whole life. Didn't really get sick much. My wife’s side… her sister had… somethin' with her legs, I think? Swelling, maybe? It was a long time ago, and I don’t really remember the details. She passed a while back now. It’s all a bit blurry, to be honest. Not much of a family man, always workin’.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just check your heart, lungs, and take a look at your legs. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Sounds fine. Just… try not to poke around too much, eh? My back’s been a bit sensitive lately. And… I don't like needles. Never been good with needles. But go ahead, if you need to. I suppose I gotta do what I gotta do.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll be gentle. And I’ll avoid needles unless absolutely necessary. Alright, just take some deep breaths for me… Sounds a bit fast, but nothing too concerning at the moment. Lungs sound clear. Now, let’s take a look at these legs… Hmm, there is some definite swelling, especially around the ankles and lower calves. It’s soft, not hard. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. Just… feels a bit tender, maybe? Like a bruise, but not painful. It's been worse some days, like I said. It comes and goes. Used to think it was just from standing too long at the shop, but… well, you’re the doctor, I suppose. You’re the one who knows these things.
DOCTOR: Pulses feel good, strong. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’m seeing here, it sounds like you might be experiencing some edema – that’s swelling caused by fluid buildup in the legs. There are a lot of potential causes, some more serious than others. Given your history, it could be related to standing for long periods, but we need to rule out other things. I'm going to order a simple blood test to check your kidney function and look for any signs of heart problems. It's routine, just to be on the safe side. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood test… Needles, huh? I knew it. Alright, alright. If you have to. Just… try to be quick, eh? And… don’t poke around too much. I bruise easily. What exactly are you lookin' for, anyway? Is it somethin' serious? You're makin' me nervous now. I just came in 'cause my legs were a bit puffy, and now you're talkin' about blood tests and heart problems...
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Minerd. It's always a little unsettling when things start to sound more complicated. The blood test is mostly just to rule things out. We're checking your kidneys, because they help regulate fluid balance, and your heart, to see if it's functioning as it should. It doesn't necessarily mean there's anything wrong, just that we want to get a clearer picture. As for the needle… I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. It's a small sample, and it’s over before you know it. While we're waiting for the results, I also recommend elevating your legs when you're resting, and wearing compression socks. They can help reduce the swelling. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Elevate my legs… compression socks… Sounds… uncomfortable. Well, I suppose I can try. My wife used to tell me to put my feet up. Said it was good for the circulation. Compression socks, though… never liked tight things. But alright. I’ll give it a try. As long as I don’t have to get poked and prodded too much, I guess I can manage. When will I get the results from these tests? And… is it gonna cost a fortune? I’m not insured, you see…
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Mr. Minerd. Let me check on the pricing for you. The blood tests will be around \$85. As for the results, they usually come back within 24-48 hours. I will call you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, please try to elevate your legs whenever you're resting, and let's see if we can get some compression socks for you. We'll start with these basic steps and go from there. If your swelling gets significantly worse, or if you develop any chest pain or shortness of breath, please go to the emergency room immediately. Is that clear?
PATIENT: \$85… well, that's not too bad, I suppose. Alright. Emergency room… chest pain, shortness of breath… noted. Look, doc, I appreciate you takin' the time to listen to an old fool like me. Just gettin' older, I reckon. Things start to creak and puff up. Compression socks, blood tests… I'll do what you say. Just… try not to keep me waitin' too long for those results, eh? And thank you again. I think that's all for now, isn’t it? I’d better be gettin’ home. Still got some work to do.
DOCTOR: You're not a fool at all, Mr. Minerd. It's my job to listen. And I’ll do my best to get those results back to you as quickly as possible. Here's a requisition for the blood test, and a note with instructions about elevating your legs and where you can find compression socks. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And thank you for coming in. Take care, and try to get some rest.
