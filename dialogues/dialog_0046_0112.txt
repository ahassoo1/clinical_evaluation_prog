DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MacVittie. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Um… well, it’s a bit awkward to talk about, honestly, but I’ve been going to the bathroom… a lot. Much more than usual, lately. It’s been… frequent, I suppose is the word. I’m not sure what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It’s perfectly alright, many things can cause changes in bathroom habits, and we’ll figure it out together. “Frequent” is a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, good. I was worried I sounded silly. Um… let me see. It’s not painful, thankfully. Just… constantly feeling the urge to go. Like, several times an hour, even when I haven't had much to drink. It’s been going on for… a couple of weeks, I think? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, to be honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, and you’re not silly at all for bringing this up. It’s good that it’s not painful. Feeling the constant urge even without much fluid intake is definitely something we need to investigate. A couple of weeks is a reasonable timeframe. Let’s try to get a clearer picture. When you do go to the bathroom, is it a full emptying, or just a small amount each time?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s… usually just a small amount, actually. I feel like I have to go, but then not much comes out. It’s… frustrating, to be frank. And then the urge comes back very quickly after. It feels like it never really goes away completely. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. MacVittie, and I appreciate you explaining it so clearly. That detail – small amounts with persistent urgency – is very useful. Now, have you noticed any other changes alongside this?
PATIENT: Other changes… Let me think. No fever, no pain… Oh! Actually, I have been feeling more thirsty than usual. And… now that you mention it, I seem to be drinking more water. Probably because I’m going to the bathroom so often. Does that count? I haven’t really noticed anything else… I’m sorry if I’m not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Ms. MacVittie! Increased thirst and drinking more water are definitely relevant. It sounds like your body is trying to compensate for something. Let’s move on to a quick review of your general health. Have you had any significant medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Significant medical conditions… Oh dear. That’s… difficult. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, a long time ago. And… I had a bad bout of pneumonia once, but that was years and years ago. Nothing recent, I don’t think. I had a divorce a few years back, but I don't know if that counts as a medical condition. I'm afraid my medical history isn't very exciting.
DOCTOR: Well, that’s alright. Appendectomy and pneumonia are good to know. Divorce definitely doesn’t count as a medical condition! Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else, like food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I don't think so. I've never had a reaction to anything, to my knowledge. I do get mosquito bites, but that's hardly an allergy, is it? I've always been quite lucky in that regard, I suppose. I'm not on any regular medications at the moment, either.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No known allergies and no current medications simplifies things. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family medical history… That’s… another tough one. My mother had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he had something with his heart, later in life. But I’m not really sure what. They weren’t really ones for talking about medical things, to be honest. I don’t have any siblings, so there’s no one else to ask. I’m sorry I can’t be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. MacVittie. It's common for family medical history to be incomplete. High blood pressure and a heart condition are good to know, even if the details are limited. To get a better understanding, I'd like to ask about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, none of those. I’ve never been a smoker. I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but very rarely. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I try to stay as healthy as possible, honestly. I walk most days, and I eat a fairly balanced diet. Perhaps that's why this is so puzzling.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. MacVittie. A healthy lifestyle makes this even more interesting. It’s good we’re ruling things out. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Your heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen. No masses detected. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. That’s… a little tender, yes. Not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. It’s sort of a dull ache, really. It’s not something I usually notice, but you’re right to ask. It’s definitely more noticeable when you press there. It’s… right about here, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for letting me know. That's helpful. Based on what you've told me and the findings from the exam, I’d like to order a urine analysis and a complete blood count. The urine analysis will help us check for a possible urinary tract infection or other abnormalities in your urine. The complete blood count will give us a broader picture of your overall health and rule out any signs of infection or inflammation. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly sensible, Doctor. Whatever tests you think are necessary. A urine analysis and a blood test… yes, that sounds good. How will I… provide the sample? And where will the blood test be done? I haven't had a blood test in years, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. For the urine analysis, you'll be given a sterile cup, and I’ll have you go to the restroom to collect a midstream sample. I’ll give you instructions on how to do that properly to ensure an accurate result. The lab is just down the hall, and a phlebotomist will draw a small amount of blood from your arm. It's a quick process, and they're very skilled. I'll have the results sent to me within 24-48 hours. Once I have them, I’ll review them and contact you to discuss the findings and develop a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake. And if you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Doctor. A midstream urine sample, blood test, increase fluids… and contact the clinic if I develop a fever or severe pain. I’ll remember that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It’s… reassuring to have a plan. When I go to collect the sample, will there be anyone to… show me the restroom? I don’t want to get it wrong.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll have the nurse, Sarah, escort you to the restroom and provide you with the cup and detailed instructions. She's very kind and helpful. Let me just write a quick order for the tests and I'll have Sarah come in to assist you shortly. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve answered everything so thoroughly, Doctor. I think I just need to… go and collect the sample, and then have the blood test. Thank you again for your time and patience. It's a relief to finally be getting to the bottom of this. I appreciate it very much.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. MacVittie. I understand it can be unsettling when you’re not sure what’s going on, and I’m glad we’re taking steps to figure it out. Sarah, could you please come in and assist Ms. MacVittie with collecting a urine sample?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I’ll wait for Sarah, then. It's good to know you're here.
