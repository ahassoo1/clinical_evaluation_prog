DOCTOR: Right, Liza Sugino, 47 years old. Hello, I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Dr. Osterholm. It’s nice to meet you. Well, I’ve been thinking about… mindfulness, or meditation, actually. I keep hearing good things, and I’d like to learn more about it, if that’s something you could help with? I'm hoping it might help with… well, just generally feeling a bit more calm, you know?
DOCTOR: Mindfulness?
PATIENT: Yes. I know it sounds… a bit New Age, maybe? But a friend of mine, she’s been doing it for a while, and she says it’s really helped her with stress. I work with the railway, fixing signals and switches – it can be a bit… demanding at times, and I find I get quite wound up. I was hoping you might have some resources, or know if it’s even a good idea for someone like me?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Sugino, I’m a doctor. I deal with actual medical problems. Stress is… well, everyone gets stressed. It’s not a condition I prescribe medication for, if that’s what you’re hoping. It sounds like you're looking for a hobby, frankly. But alright, let’s indulge this for a moment. What specifically are you experiencing physically when you say “wound up”?
PATIENT: Oh, I understand. No, I wasn't expecting medication! A hobby… maybe you’re right. Still, I thought it wouldn’t hurt to ask a professional. Physically… hmm. Well, my shoulders get very tense, right up to my neck. And I clench my jaw, I didn’t even realise I was doing it half the time until my friend pointed it out. Sometimes I get headaches, sort of a dull ache at the back of my head. And… honestly? My stomach feels a bit… unsettled a lot of the time. Not sick, exactly, just… not quite right. I suppose those are the main things. Does that… sound like anything?
DOCTOR: Those could be symptoms of… a lot of things. Muscle tension headaches are common, and stress can definitely upset your stomach. But honestly, Ms. Sugino, it sounds like you’re describing basic tension. Have you had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just those things. No dizziness, no numbness, no… anything else alarming. I get tired, of course, after a long day at work, but who doesn’t? I eat fairly well, I think, and I try to get enough sleep, though sometimes it's interrupted. I don’t smoke, and I only drink socially. I suppose I'm generally quite healthy, aside from… this tension. It’s just… persistent. And it’s starting to bother me, honestly. I feel like I’m constantly on edge.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s see… Your weight is a bit elevated, according to the records – 136 pounds at 5’3”. And your height… yes, 5’3”. Have you had a recent physical?
PATIENT: Yes, I had one about six months ago with Dr. Petrov, just a standard check-up. Everything was normal, he said. Blood pressure was a little high that day, but he said it was probably just because I was nervous about the appointment, and to keep an eye on it. We didn't discuss my… tension, I suppose, because I hadn't really started noticing it properly then. And yes, you’re right about my weight, I’ve always been a bit… solid. It runs in the family, unfortunately. But I’m not diabetic or anything, Dr. Petrov checked.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Sugino, it sounds like you’re fairly healthy, aside from being a little overweight. And perhaps a bit… anxious. I suspect your “tension” is simply that – anxiety manifesting physically. I'm not convinced mindfulness is going to resolve this. But alright. Let me quickly listen to your heart and lungs, just to be sure everything sounds normal. Then we can discuss some… lifestyle adjustments. It’s probably just a matter of managing stress better, honestly. If you’d like to lie down.
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Lifestyle adjustments… I suppose that makes sense. I'm happy to lie down if that helps. I’m just glad I asked, really. It’s good to rule things out, even if it is just… stress. It’s just… it feels quite constant, you know? And I’d like to get it under control before it starts affecting my work.
DOCTOR: Alright. Heart sounds normal, lungs are clear. Blood pressure is… 142/90. A little elevated, but not alarming, given your anxiety. I’d recommend… well, I’d recommend you focus on reducing your weight. That alone can significantly improve your blood pressure and reduce overall stress. And perhaps some… regular exercise. Walking is a good start. I’m not going to prescribe you anything. Honestly, Ms. Sugino, I think you need to work on self-care. Mindfulness isn’t a miracle cure.
PATIENT: Oh, I see. Yes, I know I should lose weight, I really do. It’s just… hard. And walking… I try, but I get distracted easily, and then I don’t bother. I suppose I’m not very good at self-care. Is there anything else I should be looking at? Any resources you’d recommend for… getting started with exercise, or maybe just… relaxing a bit? Even if mindfulness isn’t the answer, I’m willing to try something. Is there a website, or a class… anything at all? I just feel a bit lost, honestly.
DOCTOR: Lost?
PATIENT: Well… yes, perhaps that's a bit dramatic. But I don’t really know where to start, honestly. I’ve never really focused on… this sort of thing before. I work hard, I provide for myself, and I just… keep going. It’s just lately I’ve been feeling… overwhelmed, and this tension is making it harder. I suppose I was hoping you might have a suggestion, something practical. Even a local walking group would be helpful, if you know of one.
DOCTOR: Here. This is a list of local gyms and a website for basic exercise routines. And… there’s a community center that offers yoga classes. Honestly, Ms. Sugino, this is all readily available information. I suggest you pick something and commit to it. I’m not going to hold your hand through this. If your blood pressure remains elevated at your next check-up, then we can discuss medication. But right now, I think you just need to take some initiative. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you. That's… helpful. Yoga… I’ve never tried yoga before. I suppose I could look at the website. It’s just… it all feels a bit daunting. No, I don’t think I have any other questions, not right now. Thank you for your time. I’ll… try to commit, as you said. I appreciate the information. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Stop letting stress control you, Ms. Sugino. That will be all. .
