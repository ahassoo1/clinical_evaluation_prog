DOCTOR: Hi Noelani, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about, truthfully. It’s… pain. Down there. In… the groin, I suppose? It’s been happening on and off, and I haven’t quite figured out what’s causing it. It’s… difficult to explain. I don’t… I don’t really understand why it’s happening, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, no worries at all. It's perfectly alright to be a little embarrassed, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. "Down there" is perfectly fine – we deal with this all the time. So, it's pain in your groin area, coming and going. Can you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Well… it’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More of a… dull ache, mostly. Sometimes it feels like a heaviness. And… it seems to get worse when I’ve been… standing for a long time, I think? Or if I lift something. It’s hard to say for sure, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It's been going on for…oh dear, I can’t quite recall how long. A few weeks, maybe? Perhaps longer. It comes and goes so I don't always notice.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache and heaviness, worse with standing or lifting. A few weeks, coming and going. That gives me a little to work with. And you mentioned it's been hard to keep track of how long exactly – is this something new, or have you experienced similar pain before?
PATIENT: Oh… that's a good question. I… I don’t believe so. Not like this, anyway. I’ve had aches and pains, of course, being my age, but nothing… specifically there. And certainly nothing that comes and goes like this. It’s… unsettling, because I can’t pinpoint a cause. It just… started. I haven’t injured myself, not that I recall. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a bit confused about the whole thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so this feels like a new pain, not related to any injury. That's helpful to know. Now, just to get a better picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the pain?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No fever, I don't believe. No… swelling, that I’ve noticed. I haven't felt nauseous or anything like that. I have been a bit… tired lately, but honestly, Doctor, I’m always a little tired. It's hard to say if that’s connected. Oh! And… perhaps a little more frequent urination? But I drink a lot of water, so that might just be that. Is there something specific I should be looking for? I worry I'll forget to mention something important.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no swelling, no nausea. Increased tiredness, possibly more frequent urination, but you drink a lot of water. That’s good information, Noelani, don’t worry about forgetting things, we'll get through it. Now, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you had any major surgeries or serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Oh dear. My medical history… it's rather… fragmented, I’m afraid. I've seen doctors, of course, over the years. Routine check-ups, things like that. I had my appendix removed when I was young, a long, long time ago. And… I had a hysterectomy, maybe fifteen years ago? Perhaps more. It's all a bit hazy. No serious illnesses that I can recall, no. Mostly just… the usual aches and pains of getting older. Is Medicare covering this visit, Doctor? I want to be sure.
DOCTOR: Yes, Medicare should cover this visit. We'll double-check everything with your insurance just to be certain. Okay, so appendix removal and a hysterectomy fifteen years ago. Good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… that's a difficult one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe. And… my uncle, on my father’s side, he had some kind of cancer, many years ago. Lung cancer, I think? But that was in Colombia, so the records aren't very clear. My father… he passed away quite suddenly, a heart attack, I think. But he didn’t go to the doctor much, so we never really knew for certain. It’s… a bit of a mystery, truthfully. Everyone on both sides of the family seemed to just… accept their fate, you see. They didn't really talk about these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your mother, lung cancer in an uncle, and a father who passed away from a possible heart attack. Thank you for sharing that information, even though it's a bit fragmented. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. Never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My mother always said it was a terrible habit, and I… well, I agreed with her. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that's it. Nothing excessive. I spend most of my time in my workshop, you see. Woodworking keeps me busy. It’s… therapeutic.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Woodworking sounds lovely. Okay, and finally, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, Doctor, I’m not taking any medications regularly. Occasionally, I’ll take something for a headache, ibuprofen, that sort of thing. But nothing prescribed. And… allergies. I think I might be a little allergic to pollen, makes me sneeze a bit in the spring. But nothing serious. No known allergies to medications, no. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. Is it alright if I ask what you suspect might be the problem? I know you haven’t examined me yet, but… I'm a bit anxious, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Noelani. It’s perfectly alright to ask. It’s good you’re speaking up. Based on what you've told me—the dull ache in your groin, worsening with standing and lifting, the history of a hysterectomy, and no fever or other serious symptoms—it could be a few things. It's possible there's some muscle strain, or perhaps some referred pain from your lower back. Given your history of a hysterectomy, it's also important to rule out any issues related to that, although the long time since the procedure makes that less likely. To get a better idea, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll need to gently press on your abdomen and lower back to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. I appreciate you explaining everything. A physical exam sounds fine. I trust your judgment. I’m just glad we’re trying to figure out what’s going on. Please, go ahead. Just… be gentle, if you would? It’s a bit sensitive, you see. And… please tell me if you find anything concerning. I’d rather know, even if it’s not good news.
DOCTOR: Of course, Noelani. I will be very gentle. And I will absolutely let you know if I find anything concerning. Okay, I’m going to start by pressing gently here. Tell me if anything feels particularly tender or painful. Just let me know. Okay, I'm noticing some mild tenderness on the left side of your lower abdomen, but no significant masses or rebound tenderness. I'm also going to check your lower back. And… yes, there’s some muscle tightness in your lower back, particularly on the left side. It doesn’t seem to be acutely inflamed, but it's definitely tight. I'm not feeling any obvious signs of a hernia or other major problems. I'd also like to check your reflexes and range of motion in your legs, just to rule out any nerve involvement. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s a little uncomfortable. But… not terribly painful. Just… a dull ache, like I described. And yes, my back has been bothering me lately, now that you mention it. I thought it was just from bending over my workbench all day. Checking my reflexes is fine, Doctor. Go ahead. It’s all a bit worrying, you see. I just want to be sure it’s nothing serious. I need to get back to my workshop, you know. I have a commission to finish.
DOCTOR: I understand, Noelani. We'll work as quickly as we can. Okay, your reflexes are normal, and your range of motion seems good. There’s no significant weakness or pain with movement. Based on the exam, it sounds like you likely have some muscle strain in your lower back and abdomen, possibly aggravated by your work. The tenderness on the left side could be related to that. The history of the hysterectomy makes me want to be a little cautious, but the lack of other symptoms is reassuring. To be on the safe side, I'd like to order a urine test to rule out any infection, and an X-ray of your lower back to get a better look at the muscles and bones. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A urine test and an X-ray… yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. If it will rule things out, then I’m happy to do it. I trust your judgment. I just want to be able to get back to my workshop, you see. It’s… important to me. When can I expect the results? And… will the X-ray be painful? I’ve never had one before.
DOCTOR: I understand. Getting you back to your workshop is the goal. The urine test is quick and painless - just a sample in a cup. As for the X-ray, it's not painful at all. You’ll simply stand or lie down while a machine takes a picture of your back. There’s very minimal radiation exposure, and the benefits outweigh the risks. The lab should have the urine test results back within a day or two. The X-ray results may take a little longer, perhaps 3-5 business days, as the radiologist needs to review them. The clinic will call you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, I recommend taking over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed, and applying heat or ice to your lower back. Avoid heavy lifting and bending for a few days, and try to maintain good posture. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Ibuprofen, heat, and rest. I can manage that. And… I’ll wait for the call. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It’s… a relief to have a plan. I appreciate your time and… your patience with my forgetfulness. Is there anything else I need to do? Any paperwork? Or… should I just wait by the phone?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Noelani. And don't worry about the forgetfulness – it happens to all of us. I'm just printing out a lab requisition form for the urine test and a referral for the X-ray. You’ll take these to the lab and radiology center, respectively. The paperwork has the addresses and phone numbers. We’ll also send a copy of the referral to your primary care physician for their records. And no, you don’t need to do anything else right now. Just wait for the call. If you experience any worsening pain, fever, or difficulty urinating, please call the clinic immediately. I hope you feel better soon, and get back to your workshop quickly. It sounds like you enjoy your work very much.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor Amussen. You’ve been very kind. I will wait for the call, and I will be careful. And… yes, I do enjoy my work. It’s… my life, really. I think that’s everything. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you once more.
