DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure. Though I must say, this suburban location is…rather underwhelming. But never mind that. I’m here to inquire about getting one of these…medical marijuana certifications I’ve been hearing about. My daughter, bless her heart, thinks it might help with my…discomfort.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ranells. We can certainly discuss that. To determine if you might benefit from a medical marijuana certification, I'll need to understand a bit more about the discomfort you're experiencing. Could you tell me about it?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's hardly something one brags about. It's…age, really. Things just ache. You know. Joints, mostly. It’s not crippling, mind you. I manage. But it’s…persistent. And frankly, quite bothersome when one is trying to maintain a certain…standard of living. I don’t relish discussing this with just anyone, you understand. It’s a matter of…dignity.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Ranells. Maintaining one's dignity and quality of life is very important, and there's absolutely no need to feel embarrassed discussing this with me. It's my job to listen and help in any way I can. When did you first start noticing this ache, and where specifically are you experiencing it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s been…years, really. A slow creep, you know? Started, I suppose, in my knees. Then the hips joined in. Now it's…well, pretty much everywhere that isn’t actively being supported by bone. It’s worse in the mornings, naturally. Damp weather doesn’t help either. I wouldn’t say it prevents me from doing things – I still manage my duties, thank you very much – but it’s…a constant companion. A rather unwelcome one, I assure you. I haven’t really done anything about it, if that makes sense. Just…endured.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Ranells. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with this for quite some time. And it's good that you're still able to manage your daily activities. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, and to see if medical marijuana might be a suitable option, could you tell me a little more about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Honestly, Doctor, it’s rather extensive. I've lived a long life. I had the usual childhood illnesses, nothing remarkable. A bout of pneumonia in my forties, but recovered perfectly. My husband, God rest his soul, had…complications. That was rather trying, naturally. Beyond that…nothing of any great consequence. I’m not one for doctors, you see. Prevention is key, and I’ve always been quite careful. I haven’t been regularly…examined, if that’s what you’re getting at. I simply don’t see the point in dwelling on things that might be wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Ranells. It sounds like you've been very proactive about your health over the years, and that's admirable. Since you haven’t had regular examinations, do you mind if I ask about any surgeries you may have had, or any significant illnesses your family members have experienced?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Good heavens, no. I wouldn't dream of subjecting myself to a knife unless absolutely necessary. As for family… my mother had…arthritis, I believe. A mild case. My husband's side…well, they weren't particularly healthy people, if I'm honest. A lot of…weak constitutions. Heart problems, mostly. Nothing directly inherited, as far as I can tell. We weren’t a family prone to…ailments. More a family prone to…discretion. Really, Doctor, I don’t see how any of this is relevant. I’m here about this marijuana, aren’t I? Are you questioning my suitability?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Ranells. I apologize if my questions felt intrusive. It’s simply standard procedure to gather a complete history, to ensure we’re making the best possible decision for your health. Understanding your family history can sometimes provide valuable clues, but it’s certainly not a requirement. To move forward with discussing the potential benefits of medical marijuana, could you tell me what specifically you're hoping to achieve with it?
PATIENT: Very well. The point, Doctor, is pain relief. Simple as that. I don’t want to be…incapacitated. I simply want to be able to…function without this constant ache. My daughter, bless her, tells me it helps with sleep as well. Which is…a consideration. I'm a busy woman. I have duties. I cannot afford to be… fatigued. Honestly, I was hoping for a simple solution. A prescription, perhaps? Is that too much to ask? I don’t want to be…clouded, or…unproductive. I simply want to be comfortable enough to maintain my…standards.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Ms. Ranells. Relief from pain and improved sleep are certainly reasonable goals, and we can explore whether medical marijuana might be a suitable option to help you maintain your quality of life. Before we proceed, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Doctor, I pride myself on avoiding such things. A little liniment now and then, perhaps. And a vitamin D supplement during the winter months. But that’s it. I believe in natural remedies whenever possible. And common sense, of course. A warm bath, a good book, a sensible diet. Those are my medications. I've always been… cautious about putting things into my body. You don't know what kind of side effects they could have. Honestly, I don’t understand why everyone is so quick to reach for a pill. It’s quite… alarming, really. So, no. No medications. Absolutely none.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Ranells, and I respect your commitment to a natural approach. Now, given your history of aches and pains, and your preference for avoiding conventional medications, I would like to perform a brief physical examination, if you're comfortable with that. It will allow me to assess the areas where you’re experiencing discomfort and help determine the best course of action. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Doctor, with all due respect, I assure you, I am perfectly aware of where I am experiencing discomfort. It’s…age. It’s quite obvious. I'm not some fragile flower in need of…prodding. I came here for a certificate, not a…diagnosis. Frankly, it feels rather…patronizing. I’m a perfectly capable woman who knows her own body. Are you implying I’ve somehow misled you? I simply want to know if I qualify for this marijuana, not endure an unnecessary…inspection. Honestly, I’m beginning to regret this entire…endeavor. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Ranells, I understand your frustration and I sincerely apologize if I’ve offended you. It was not my intention to imply anything of the sort. The examination is simply a standard part of the evaluation process to ensure that we can safely and appropriately consider medical marijuana as a treatment option. However, I completely respect your decision. If you are not comfortable with a physical examination, that is perfectly acceptable. I will need to err on the side of caution and refer you to a specialist who can conduct a more thorough evaluation before I can issue a certification. Would you like me to provide you with a referral?
