DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you are 73 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, 73. Not feeling so young lately, I tell you what. Uh… well, it’s my family. Lots of… troubles. My mother, she… she had heart problems. And my brother, he had… something with his brain. I forget what they called it. I just… I want to make sure I’m okay. You know? I don’t want the same thing to happen to me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Schwer. It's quite common to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of illness. We'll certainly do our best to assess your current state. When you say "troubles," could you elaborate on what specific symptoms you are experiencing, if any?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Not much, really. Maybe a little tired sometimes. But everyone gets tired, right? And… my memory isn't what it used to be, but I’m 73! I forget where I put my keys, things like that. Nothing… serious, I don’t think. I just… worry. It’s hard to explain. Like a weight, you know? I don't feel sick, but… what if I am getting sick?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's understandable to feel apprehensive, particularly given your family history. Fatigue and occasional forgetfulness can be normal with age, but we need to rule out any underlying causes. Let's begin with a brief review of your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: High… high what? Oh, cholesterol! No, I don’t think so. The doctor, a long time ago, checked my blood, but he said I was fine. Just a little bit of… something with my water, he said. He gave me pills for it. But I stopped taking them. Too many pills, you know? I can't remember what the problem was, exactly. Just… water. And… I had my appendix out when I was a kid. That’s about it, I think.
DOCTOR: Right. “Something with the water”... We will need to clarify that at some point, Mr. Schwer. It’s important to know what condition that was, and why you were prescribed medication. Do you recall when you had your appendix removed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time ago. When I was… maybe eight? Nine? I was just a little boy. I remember the hospital, and the bandages. I was very sick for a week, but then I was okay. My mother took good care of me. She always did. It was… a long, long time ago. Before the TV was even good. Just black and white! You probably weren't even born then.
DOCTOR: Indeed. Well, let's move on to your family history, as you mentioned concerns about your mother and brother. You stated your mother had heart problems. Do you know specifically what type of heart problem she had?
PATIENT: Uh… she had… trouble breathing, mostly. And her legs would swell up. She was very tired all the time. The doctor said something about her heart getting… bigger. That’s all I really remember. She didn’t take care of herself, you know? She loved her sweets. Always eating cookies and cakes. I told her to stop, but… she wouldn't listen. My brother… he… it was his brain. He forgot things. A lot of things. He… he didn’t even know who I was, sometimes. It was very sad.
DOCTOR: I see. So, your mother had symptoms of heart failure, and your brother experienced cognitive decline. Do you know if your brother received a specific diagnosis, such as Alzheimer's or dementia?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. The doctors just said his brain wasn’t working right. He went to a… a special place. A home. With other people who… forgot things. It was very hard on my sister. She took care of him for a long time. She said he didn't recognize her at the end. I… I just didn’t want the same thing to happen to me. That's why I’m here. I want to be sure. I want to… remember things. Even if it's just where I put my keys.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer. It's good you’re being proactive. Now, let's discuss your current lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never. My mother, she used to smoke. Bad habit. I told her it would kill her. And… it probably did. Made her cough something terrible. No, I never smoked. And I don’t drink much either. Maybe a beer with dinner sometimes. But not every night. Mostly I just… watch TV. And worry.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your diet, Mr. Schwer?
PATIENT: Diet? Oh. Well, I try to eat good. I like vegetables. And… chicken. But… sometimes I have a sweet tooth. Cookies, like my mother. I know I shouldn’t, but… they taste so good. I try not to have too many. My sister makes a good apple pie, and she always sends me a slice when she visits. I can’t say no to my sister.
DOCTOR: Right. We've covered a fair bit now. Let’s proceed to a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and perform a simple neurological assessment to evaluate your memory and reflexes. This will give us a better baseline to work from. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… good. As long as you can tell me if something is wrong. I just… I want to know. You know? I want to be sure. My heart, my brain… everything. If I’m going to end up like my mother and brother… I want to know now. So I can… I don’t know… prepare. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Schwer, that is perfectly alright. We’ll do our best to provide you with a thorough assessment. Please sit back and relax. Blood pressure is slightly elevated at 142 over 88. Heart sounds are… regular, but somewhat diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation, though there’s some mild wheezing on expiration. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your memory and cognitive function. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date? Hmm… Let me see. It’s… August. Yes, August. But what day is it? I… I think it's the… second? Yes, August 2nd. Is that right? 2025, right? It is 2025, isn’t it? I get my dates mixed up sometimes. My sister always remembers. She’s got a good memory.
DOCTOR: Yes, you are correct. August 2nd, 2025. Now, can you repeat three words for me?
PATIENT: Three words? Oh… okay. Let me see. Uh… what are the words?
DOCTOR: Apple… table… penny. Now, try to remember those. I will ask you to repeat them in a few minutes. Let’s move on to a simple balance test. Please stand up and close your eyes.
PATIENT: Apple… table… penny. Okay. Apple, table, penny. Got it. Close my eyes? Oh… okay. But I get dizzy sometimes. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Just try to remain as still as possible, Mr. Schwer. I will be right here. Alright, you can open your eyes now. That was a bit unsteady, I must say. Now, can you please attempt to recite the three words I asked you to remember?
PATIENT: Three words… Oh, goodness. Let me see. Uh… apple… Yes, apple. And… table. But what was the third one? It’s on the tip of my tongue… It’s something shiny… Something you put in your pocket… Oh dear… I can’t remember. I’m sorry. It’s just… gone.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer. We have completed the initial assessment. Based on your history and the brief examination, there are some areas of concern. Your memory recall is impaired, and your balance is somewhat unstable. The elevated blood pressure also warrants attention. I believe further investigation is needed. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. I also recommend a CT scan of your brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. Finally, I’m going to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation. Do you have any questions regarding these tests?
PATIENT: Tests? So many tests… A CT scan of my brain? Oh dear… Is something wrong? Is it… like my brother? Is my brain not working right? What will these tests show? Will I know right away? I don’t want to wait… I just want to know… Am I going to forget everything?
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, please remain calm. These tests are simply to gather more information and rule out any potential underlying causes for your symptoms. It does not necessarily mean that you have the same condition as your brother. A CT scan will help us visualize your brain and identify any abnormalities. The blood tests will assess your overall health and rule out any other medical conditions that may be contributing to your memory problems. The results will take a few days to come back. Once we have them, we can discuss them in detail and develop a treatment plan. I understand your anxiety, and I assure you we will do everything we can to provide you with the best possible care. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to monitor your symptoms and avoid any strenuous activities. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood and schedule the CT scan. We will contact you as soon as the results are available. Do you have any immediate concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No… I guess not. Just… a lot to take in. All those tests… and waiting. Waiting is the worst part. My sister… I should probably tell her. She worries about me, too. Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate you listening. And trying to find out what’s wrong. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schwer. We will be in touch.
