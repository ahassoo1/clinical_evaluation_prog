DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It's a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s these pains in my side… they keep coming back. And with them, these… water infections, I think they call them. It’s been going on for a while now, and it’s getting a bit tiresome, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. Recurring pain and possible urinary infections – that does sound tiresome, indeed. Let’s try to get to the bottom of this. To start, could you tell me a little more about the pain?
PATIENT: Right. Well, it’s usually on my left side, lower down. Not always sharp, you understand, sometimes it’s more of a dull ache. It comes and goes, mostly, but when it is there… it’s uncomfortable. It can sometimes go around to my back a little too. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Left-sided pain, lower abdomen, sometimes radiating to the back… dull ache versus sharp pain, and the recurring nature of it. That’s helpful. And you mentioned these "water infections"—have you been formally diagnosed with urinary tract infections, perhaps by a doctor or with a urine test?
PATIENT: Yes, I have. A doctor back in Suva, a few years ago now, said that’s what they were. They did a test on my… well, you know, my water. And they gave me some tablets to take. It usually clears it up, but then it comes back again. It's happened at least four or five times, maybe more. I’ve lost track, to be honest. It’s been quite a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see a few notes here from your previous physician regarding urinary tract infections. That's good information to have. Now, when you have these infections, what symptoms do you experience besides the pain?
PATIENT: Well, I feel like I need to go to the toilet a lot. Even when there's not much there, you understand? And it burns when I… when I go. And sometimes… sometimes the water looks a bit cloudy, or there’s a bit of blood. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to notice. And I feel… tired, generally. Just weak and worn out. Does that sound right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that all sounds very consistent with a urinary tract infection. Frequent urination, burning sensation, cloudy or bloody urine, and feeling tired… those are typical symptoms. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Well, the doctor in Suva, he told me I have something wrong with my kidneys. Lots of little… pockets, he called them. Polycystic something-or-other. That's what he said caused the problems with the water and the pain. He didn't explain it all too well, I must admit. I'm not very good with medical terms. And I don't have any of the other things you mentioned - no high blood pressure, no diabetes. I'm generally quite healthy, apart from this.
DOCTOR: Okay, polycystic kidney disease. That's important information. It explains a lot, actually. That condition can certainly cause recurrent urinary tract infections and flank pain, as well as other complications. Do you recall if the doctor discussed any specific treatment plan for the polycystic kidney disease itself at the time?
PATIENT: No, he didn’t really. He gave me some antibiotics when I had the infections, and told me to drink plenty of water. That was about it, really. He said there wasn't much they could do about the kidneys themselves. I just kept going back when the infections flared up. It was a bit frustrating, to be honest. I felt like I was just putting a bandage on the problem, instead of fixing it. I haven’t seen a doctor regularly since I left Suva. It’s been a few years now.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It sounds like you've been managing the symptoms for some time without addressing the underlying condition. That’s not ideal. Okay, let's move on to your past surgical history. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been very lucky, thankfully. No broken bones, no operations… nothing like that. I've always been a bit cautious, I suppose. And I try to keep active, walk around a bit. Keeps me going, you know? So, no surgeries at all. Just the usual childhood illnesses, I expect, but nothing major.
DOCTOR: Good to know. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she had problems with her water when she got older. Not as bad as me, mind you, but she was always going to the toilet. And my father, he had… high blood pressure, I think it was. And his brother, he had something wrong with his heart. But no one, as far as I know, had these kidney problems. We’re a fairly small family, and we don’t see each other very often. It’s hard to keep track of everything.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine. I’ve had a few tablets over the years, for headaches or colds, but nothing serious. No swelling, no rashes, no trouble breathing… nothing like that. I’m a fairly simple man, you know? Not much bothers me.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva. Thank you for providing me with such a thorough history. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam to assess your condition. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go ahead, then. I'm ready when you are. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright? I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: Certainly not a bother at all. I'll explain everything as I go, and please, don't hesitate to tell me if you're experiencing any discomfort. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, but that could be due to anxiety, or simply the fact that you’re in a medical setting. Your heart and lungs sound reasonably good, although your heart sounds are a bit faint. Okay, and now your abdomen… I'm feeling for any tenderness or masses. There's some tenderness here, on your left side. Not severe, but noticeable. No other significant findings. Overall, the exam suggests some tenderness in your left flank, consistent with your reported pain.
PATIENT: Right. That tenderness… that's where I feel it most of the time. It’s good you found something, I suppose. Does that mean it is my kidneys? Or could it be something else? I’ve always worried about it being something serious. I’m not a young man anymore, you know. I'm starting to feel my age.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Mr. Espinueva. The tenderness in your left flank, combined with your history of recurrent urinary infections and the previous diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease, certainly points in that direction. However, tenderness alone isn’t definitive. Other possibilities, although less likely given your history, could include a muscle strain or a kidney stone. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. First, a urine analysis to check for infection and blood. Second, a complete blood count to assess your overall health and kidney function. And finally, an abdominal ultrasound to visualize your kidneys and rule out any stones or other abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever it takes to find out what’s going on. Urine test, blood test, ultrasound… go ahead and do them all. I'd rather know, even if the news isn't good. I've been putting up with this for too long, and it’s time to get it sorted out, one way or another. How long will it take to get the results? And will I need to come back again?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ve ordered the tests now. The urine analysis and blood tests should be available within a few hours, usually by the end of the day. The ultrasound will take a bit longer to schedule, as it requires an appointment with a radiology technician, typically within the next 2-3 business days. Once the results are available, we’ll review them together and discuss the best course of action. Depending on the findings, that may involve further testing, medication, or referral to a specialist, such as a nephrologist—a kidney specialist. Yes, you will need to come back for a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. I’ll have the receptionist schedule that for you once the ultrasound is booked. In the meantime, it's important to stay well-hydrated, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid any strenuous activity that could aggravate your pain. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That all sounds… thorough, Doctor. And reasonable. Stay hydrated, no strenuous activity… I can manage that. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, and for not dismissing my concerns. A lot of doctors these days don’t seem to have the time, you know. So, thank you. I'll wait to hear from the receptionist about the ultrasound appointment, then. And I'll keep drinking water. Alright, then. Thank you for coming in today.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Espinueva. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening of your symptoms or have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
