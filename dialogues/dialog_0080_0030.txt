DOCTOR: Hi Kerriann, it’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… a bit embarrassing, honestly. I’ve noticed a change in my body odor, and it’s worrying me. It’s not…normal for me, and I can’t figure out what’s causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, no need to be embarrassed at all. Changes in body odor can be concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked out. It’s definitely something we can explore. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about the change?
PATIENT: Okay, good. Well, it’s… stronger, I guess? Not necessarily bad, just… different. I always smelled kind of… earthy, if that makes sense? Like, a natural smell. Now it's more… sharp. And it seems to be getting worse over the last month or so. It’s not just after exercise either, it’s… pretty consistent, even when I’ve just been relaxing. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. “Sharp” and “consistent” gives me a better picture. And you said it started about a month ago?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly a month. Maybe a little longer? It was definitely noticeable by the beginning of July, I’d say. I was hoping it would just go away on its own, but it hasn’t. I thought maybe it was the heat, but it’s still happening even on cooler days.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other changes along with this – like changes in your sweating patterns, any skin changes where you typically experience odor, or any other new symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My sweating hasn’t changed, not really. It's the same as always, I don't feel any sweatier or less sweaty. And no skin changes, no rashes or anything like that. I haven’t really had any other symptoms, no fever or anything. Oh! Wait… I have been feeling a little more tired than usual lately, but I just thought that was because I’ve been working a lot. It's physical work, you know, floor laying.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. The fatigue is worth noting, especially with the physical work. Let’s talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions that you're aware of, like diabetes or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything. Just the usual aches and pains from the job, I suppose. I have Medicare, so I get regular check-ups, and everything’s always been fine. They haven’t ever told me about anything like diabetes or thyroid issues. I had my blood work done last year, and it was all normal then.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. I broke my wrist when I was a kid, maybe ten years old, but that’s it. I had to get a cast, but it healed fine. I’ve never been in the hospital for anything else, thankfully. I try to stay healthy, you know? It’s hard when you’re doing physical labor, but I do my best.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family… Hmm. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had… I think it was arthritis. Nothing major, nothing genetic that I’m aware of. I don’t really have a lot of family left, honestly. I mostly raised myself, so I don’t have a lot of medical history to go on. I'm originally from Ethiopia, and it’s hard to get that information now. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: I understand. That’s perfectly alright. Let’s move on to your current medications and any allergies you might have. Are you taking any medications currently, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No medications at all. I don’t like taking pills if I can avoid it, honestly. I try to stay natural. I might take ibuprofen occasionally for muscle aches, but that’s it. And no allergies, thankfully. Not to food, not to anything. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. Okay, Kerriann, this is helpful. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your thyroid gland, and take a look at your skin. It's just to rule out anything obvious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Go ahead. I hope it’s not anything serious. It’s just… unsettling, you know? To smell different after all these years.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It is unsettling when something changes. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and your thyroid feels normal, no enlargement or tenderness. Skin looks normal as well, no rashes or unusual markings. Your blood pressure is 130/80, and your pulse is 72 and regular. Now, just to be thorough, I'd like to order some basic blood work. It will help us rule out a few things that could be causing this change, like thyroid issues, kidney problems, or diabetes, even though you haven't experienced any typical symptoms. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. If it helps figure out what’s going on, absolutely. I’m happy to do whatever you need. It's just… nice to be taking it seriously, you know? I've been trying to ignore it, hoping it would go away, but it hasn't. So, blood work is fine. What do I need to do? Will I need to fast before?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It's good to get to the bottom of things. You will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the blood draw, so ideally, no food or sugary drinks after midnight tonight. You can drink water. I’ll give you a lab requisition form with detailed instructions. The lab is just down the hall, and they’re open 7am to 2pm tomorrow. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. While we're waiting for the blood work, I also want you to keep a detailed log of when you notice the odor, what you've eaten, and any activities you've been doing. Sometimes, specific foods or activities can contribute to body odor. It may seem tedious, but it can be incredibly helpful. Do you think you can do that?
PATIENT: Yes, I can definitely do that. A log… Okay, I’ll write it down. When I notice the smell, what I’ve eaten, what I was doing… Got it. It might be a little tricky to remember everything, but I’ll try my best. I’m used to keeping track of things for work, so I’m sure I can manage. That sounds like a good plan. I appreciate you taking this seriously, Doctor. It makes me feel a lot better.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad I can help. And remember, it’s important not to jump to any conclusions before we have the blood work results. There are many possible causes for changes in body odor, and we’ll figure it out together. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. I understand what I need to do - fast overnight, and keep the log. Honestly, just knowing that we’re looking into it is a relief. I was starting to get really worried. Thank you, Doctor Rosanova. I’ll see you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kerriann. I’m glad I could ease some of your worries. Don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good evening, and get some rest. We’ll talk soon.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Bye bye.
