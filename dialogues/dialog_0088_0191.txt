DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very kind of you to see me. Well, I requested an HIV test. I wanted to get checked, just to be sure, you understand. It's been on my mind lately.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It’s always a good idea to be proactive about your health, and getting tested is a responsible step. And just to confirm, you’re requesting an HIV test today?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. An HIV test. I… I don’t really know much about it, to be honest. I just feel it would give me peace of mind. Is it… is it a difficult test?
DOCTOR: No, it's not a difficult test at all. There are a few different ways we can do it. We can do a blood draw, or a quick oral swab. The swab is usually faster if you prefer. Before we proceed, can you tell me a little bit about why you're wanting to get tested now?
PATIENT: That’s good to know about the swab. A swab sounds… less intrusive, yes. As for why now… well, my husband and I… we haven’t been as careful lately, if you understand me. And I read an article… about the importance of knowing. It just made me think. I haven’t had a test in… a very long time. And I want to be certain. It’s a bit embarrassing to say, really.
DOCTOR: It's not embarrassing at all, Ms. Shaub. It’s very responsible of you to be thinking about this and getting tested. Thank you for being open with me. Just to be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. Never. I’ve always been very careful, truly. This… this recent lapse is the only reason I’m even considering this now. My husband and I… well, we’ve been married a long time. Sometimes you get… comfortable, you understand. It doesn’t mean anything, but… I want to be safe.
DOCTOR: I completely understand. It’s good that you’re addressing this now. Before we proceed with the test, are you currently experiencing any symptoms, like fever, fatigue, rash, or swollen lymph nodes?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that at all. I feel perfectly healthy, thankfully. That’s… that’s why I was hoping it was just my worry getting the better of me. But you always have to be sure, don’t you? I’ve been sleeping well, eating properly… I’m quite robust, if I may say so myself.
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Ms. Shaub. Robust is good! Okay. So, no current symptoms, no history of STIs… Let's proceed with the oral swab test then. It’s a quick and easy way to get started. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. The swab is much better than a blood draw, honestly. I’m ready when you are. Just… tell me what to expect. I don't like surprises, you see. What does it involve exactly?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'm just going to gently swab the inside of your cheek for about 30 seconds. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn't be painful. Then I’ll send the swab off to the lab, and it usually takes about a week to get the results back. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they are available. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That doesn't sound too bad at all. Thirty seconds… I can manage that. And a week… that’s reasonable. Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Please, go ahead, Doctor. I'm ready. It’s good to just get it over with, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Shaub, all done. That wasn’t too bad, was it?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at all! Barely felt a thing. You were very gentle. Thank you. Now we just… wait? Is there anything I should be doing while we wait? Avoid certain foods? It’s just my nature to worry, you understand.
DOCTOR: No, there's nothing specific you need to do or avoid while we wait for the results, Ms. Shaub. Just continue to live your life as usual. We'll call you as soon as we have the results back, typically within a week. In the meantime, do you have any other medical concerns you'd like to discuss today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s quite alright. Just the test results, thank you. I… I suppose that’s all. I’m glad I came. It’s good to be proactive, as you said. Thank you for being so kind and patient with an old woman like me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Shaub. It was my pleasure. And you are not an old woman! Taking care of your health is important at any age. We'll be in touch with the results as soon as we have them. Here’s my card if you have any questions before then. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Piet. I appreciate that very much. You have a good day as well. .
