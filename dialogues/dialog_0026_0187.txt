DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good morning. My chest... feels funny. And my heart... it goes fast sometimes. Doctor, I don’t have time for long talk, okay? Blood pressure is high, nurse said. I want fix, quick.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Sobkowic. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. “Funny” – can you describe that feeling a little more?
PATIENT: Like... tight. Squeeze. Not all the time, you know? Sometimes when I walk. Or after… big meal. I eat good food. My wife cooks. Very good cook. But then… boom. Fast heart. Tight chest. Is that bad? Just tell me yes or no. No need long explain.
DOCTOR: It could be, Mr. Sobkowic. It's good you’re getting it checked out. We need to figure out why it’s happening. Now, does this tightness ever radiate – meaning spread – to your arm, jaw, or back?
PATIENT: Radiate? What kind of question is that? You talkin' fancy now. My arm is arm. My jaw is jaw. No… no pain go anywhere. Just here. . Just… here. Look, I work hard my whole life. Emergency Management, you know? Important job. No time for pain travelin’ around!
DOCTOR: I apologize for the medical terms, Mr. Sobkowic. I just want to be thorough. So, the discomfort is only in your chest, correct?
PATIENT: Yes! Only chest. You write that down? Only chest. And my blood pressure… is it very high? Nurse gave me number, but I forget. Old man problems, you know? I need fix, not numbers.
DOCTOR: Yes, I have that noted. Let me quickly check your chart… Ah, yes. Your blood pressure was a little elevated in the waiting room – 150/90. That is a bit higher than we’d like. Now, have you ever been told you have high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… maybe. Long time ago. Different doctor. Different town. I move a lot with my job, emergency management. Always fixing things. Don’t remember every doctor. Probably. Maybe. Does it matter? Just fix it now. I have meeting this afternoon. Important people.
DOCTOR: It can matter, Mr. Sobkowic, because if it has been high before, we want to know how long and what, if anything, has been done about it. But we can certainly start with some tests today. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I take pills when I get sick. My wife gives me pills. She knows. She gives me everything. No allergies. Stop askin’ so many questions! You gonna poke me with needle now? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: No needles right away, Mr. Sobkowic. I promise. I just need a little more information. Have you been taking any medications regularly – even over-the-counter ones – lately?
PATIENT: Just… pills my wife gives me. For my… joints. They hurt sometimes. Old man problems. She buys them at store. Little blue pills. That's all. Don't ask me name. She handles all that. I just take them. Look, is my heart gonna explode? Is that what you're trying to find out? Because if it is, just tell me. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Sobkowic, your heart is not going to explode. We are simply trying to understand what’s causing your chest discomfort and fast heart rate. These little blue pills for your joints…do you know the dosage?
PATIENT: Dosage? What is dosage? How am I supposed to know dosage? She gives me two. Two pills every morning! Is that dosage? I don’t measure things. I fix emergencies! Not count pills! This is ridiculous. Just… do something! My chest feels funny again. . Hurry!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Sobkowic, let’s take a listen to your heart and lungs. It will help me get a better idea of what’s going on. Please take a deep breath for me. I hear some mild crackles in the lower part of your lungs, and your heart rate is a little fast, as you mentioned. It's good we're checking things out. Are you having any shortness of breath at all?
PATIENT: Shortness… sometimes. When I climb stairs. My house… lots of stairs. Old house. Very nice house. My wife likes it. But… yes. Little short of breath. And my ankles… they get puffy. Especially at night. Does that mean something? I don't want to end up stuck in bed! I have important job! .
DOCTOR: The puffiness in your ankles, along with the shortness of breath and crackles in your lungs, is concerning, Mr. Sobkowic. It could indicate some fluid buildup, potentially related to your heart. I want to order a few tests to get a clearer picture. We’ll do an EKG to check your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to look at your lungs. Would that be alright?
