DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… my sight, you see. It’s been getting worse. Not suddenly, mind you, but steadily. It’s becoming rather inconvenient, honestly. I do try to keep up with things, but it's proving… difficult.
DOCTOR: Inconvenient. Right. And how long has this… inconvenience been progressing?
PATIENT: Well, now, that's a tricky question. It’s not as if there was a day I noticed it, you understand. Perhaps… six months, maybe a year? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. I don’t make a habit of dwelling on such things, Doctor. It just… gradually became more noticeable. I’m a practical man, and I assure you, I’ve been trying to manage on my own for as long as possible.
DOCTOR: Six to twelve months. Vague, but acceptable. Is this a blurring of vision?
PATIENT: Blurring… yes, that's a good way to put it. It's not as if everything is a complete haze, but things aren’t… sharp anymore. Distant objects are the worst. And reading, of course. I used to be able to read a newspaper without any trouble at all. Now… well, it's rather frustrating. I haven't been reading much lately, to be frank. It's simply not worth the strain.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this blurring?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Now, let me think. No… no flashes of light, no floaters, nothing like that. I suppose… things seem a little dimmer overall. Not dramatically so, but if I’m being honest, I find myself turning up the lights more often. And… well, this might sound odd, but I’ve been bumping into things more frequently. Small things, mostly. Furniture, door frames… It's rather embarrassing, actually. I'm not usually so clumsy.
DOCTOR: Diminished brightness and increased clumsiness. Interesting. Now, are you diabetic, Mr. Alcorta?
PATIENT: Diabetic? Good heavens, no! I've always been a very… moderate eater. Plenty of protein, of course, and I avoid those sugary concoctions. No, Doctor, I assure you, I’ve never had a speck of diabetes. My health has always been quite… acceptable, all things considered. Though, I haven't exactly been to a doctor in… well, quite some time.
DOCTOR: As I suspected. Let's move on. Any family history of vision problems?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s… complicated. My mother’s side, they were mostly… practical people. Not much for doctors, you see. She herself had failing sight towards the end, but she dismissed it as “old age.” My father’s side… well, I didn’t know him very well. He was… absent. So, I can’t really say whether or not there’s a history of vision problems on either side. It’s not something we discussed much, if at all. Honestly, they weren’t ones for sharing medical details. It was considered rather… indelicate, you understand.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m going to need to conduct a brief examination. Please follow my instructions precisely. No unnecessary commentary. Sit facing that chart, if you would.
PATIENT: Very good, Doctor. Precision is my middle name, practically. Though I must say, this lighting is rather… poor. But I shall endeavor to follow your instructions, of course. Do tell me when you’d like me to begin.
DOCTOR: Begin now. Read the smallest line you can see. One eye at a time, please. Cover your left eye first.
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… I can make out the… the top letter, I believe. It’s… difficult. V… no, wait… it’s… E. Yes, definitely E. But it’s… faded. And the rest… they’re just… blurry shapes. Not distinct letters at all. I'm not certain I can decipher anything beyond that. Perhaps if the lighting were improved... but I shall persevere.
DOCTOR: Visual acuity 20/40 in both eyes, uncorrected. Not surprising. Now, I'm going to check your peripheral vision. Focus on this point here. Tell me when you can see anything in your side vision. Don't move your eyes.
PATIENT: Well, this is… peculiar. I seem to be able to see… a general lightness to either side, but… distinct shapes? No. I can't make out anything specific. It's as if my vision is… narrowing. Everything is coming into focus directly ahead, and the periphery is… fading. It’s quite disconcerting, actually. Is this normal, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Peripheral vision constricted. As expected. Now, I need to examine your eyes themselves. Please lean back. This will be uncomfortable. Keep perfectly still. I’m looking for optic disc pallor… and retinal changes. Hmm. Yes. As I suspected. Mild pallor of the optic disc. Retinal vessels are… attenuated. No hemorrhages or exudates. Right. That’s enough.
PATIENT: Attenuated vessels? Pallor of the… disc? Doctor, are you telling me something is seriously wrong? I must say, this is all rather alarming. I’ve always prided myself on my good health, and this… this sounds quite dire. Is there anything… anything I should be particularly worried about? I believe a clear explanation is warranted, Doctor. And if you wouldn’t mind, perhaps avoiding such… technical jargon would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Alcorta, I haven't got all day. The preliminary examination suggests you are exhibiting signs of primary open-angle glaucoma. It's a deterioration of the optic nerve, likely due to increased intraocular pressure. In simple terms, your vision is being damaged. It will continue to worsen without intervention. Now, the definitive diagnosis requires further testing – a visual field test and tonometry. And, frankly, given your lack of insurance, I strongly advise you seek care at a county facility. They have the resources. I’ll write you a referral to Delano County Hospital’s ophthalmology department. Consider this a matter of some urgency. Next patient.
PATIENT: County Hospital? Good heavens. I… I hadn’t anticipated this. This is… most inconvenient. I must say, Doctor, your bedside manner leaves something to be desired. And to simply dismiss me to a… a county facility without offering any further explanation or… reassurance… is rather appalling. But… I suppose I have little choice. Very well. I shall… consider your advice. Thank you… I suppose.
