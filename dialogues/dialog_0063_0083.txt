DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammer. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, let's not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Look, I don’t usually come to doctors unless I have to. It’s…a formality, really. My daughter insisted. She thinks I need…a little pick-me-up. A card, she said. From you. Something…encouraging. I just want the card, if that’s alright. Don’t need a whole examination.
DOCTOR: A “pick-me-up”?
PATIENT: Yes. A “get well” card, or… something positive. She said it would…help my spirits. Honestly, I’m fine. Perfectly fine. But she worries. A lot. It’s Medicare-approved, right? A card? I wouldn't want to cause trouble with…paperwork.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, this is a medical practice, not a greeting card shop. I am a physician, and my responsibility is to assess your health, not to provide…emotional validation through stationery. While I appreciate your daughter’s concern, simply writing a card without understanding your condition would be…unprofessional, and frankly, a misuse of medical resources. Now, are you experiencing any physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Well, now you’re being difficult. I told you, my daughter thought it would be nice. And frankly, you are wasting my time asking all these questions. I don’t have any symptoms! That’s why I’m here! To get a card and be on my way. Is this really so hard to understand? A simple “feel better” would suffice. I don’t need a life story written on it, just something polite.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I assure you, this is not a matter of difficulty, but of medical ethics. I cannot simply fabricate a positive assessment without knowing your health status. Now, let us try this one more time. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels, appetite, sleep patterns, or bowel habits?
PATIENT: Look, I eat when I’m hungry, sleep when I’m tired, and…well, you don’t need to know about my bowel habits, do you? This is ridiculous. I am a perfectly healthy man. I used to work with boilers, big machines! That takes stamina. I don’t need you asking me about…everything. Just write the card. Or don’t. I can tell my daughter you were…uncooperative. Is that what you want?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's at least conduct a brief physical exam. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs. It will take only a few moments. It's a standard procedure. Refusing a basic assessment is…unwise, Mr. Kammer. And frankly, it doesn't inspire confidence in your claim of perfect health. Please, have a seat and extend your arm.
PATIENT: Fine. But don't go poking around too much. I don't like doctors, you see. Always sticking things. And hurry it up. I have things to do, you know. A man doesn’t have all day to sit around in a doctor’s office.
DOCTOR: 140 over 90. Slightly elevated. 78, regular. Lungs are clear, but there's a slight murmur…difficult to assess without further investigation. Do you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness?
PATIENT: Dizziness sometimes, when I stand up too fast. Old age, probably. And chest…well, a little discomfort now and then. But nothing serious! Happens to everyone. I told you, I used to work with heavy machinery! Boilers vibrate, you know. Probably shook something loose. It’s nothing you need to worry about. Now, about that card...?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, “sometimes” dizziness and “a little discomfort” are not acceptable answers when assessing potential cardiac issues. Given your elevated blood pressure and the murmur I detected, I am recommending an electrocardiogram – an ECG – to rule out any underlying heart condition. It's a simple, non-invasive test. And frankly, ignoring these symptoms would be…negligent.
PATIENT: An ECG? Now you’re just trying to make money off me! I don’t need any fancy tests! I've lived a long life, I know my body. It’s probably just gas. And honestly, my daughter is going to be furious if I come home with a bill for all this…unnecessary poking and prodding. Just write the card, Doctor. A simple "get well soon" and I'll be on my way. This is becoming a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand your frustration, but I cannot, in good conscience, simply write a card while ignoring potential health concerns. An ECG is a standard diagnostic procedure, and it's not about making money. It's about ensuring your well-being. However… … given your insistence, and your… apparent resistance to medical advice, I will document your refusal of the recommended ECG. I will also strongly advise your daughter of my concerns. Now, I will write a brief note stating that I have assessed your general condition and found no acute issues, but recommend further evaluation. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Document whatever you want. Just…keep it short. And don’t tell my daughter I’m refusing anything. She'll fuss. Just write the card. A simple, polite card. "Wishing you good health," or something like that. And then I’m leaving. This has been…a very unpleasant experience.
DOCTOR: "To Early Kammer, Wishing you continued good health and well-being. Please consult with your primary care physician for any concerning symptoms. - Dr. Cherryl Jules." There. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to attend to. And, Mr. Kammer, I strongly urge you to reconsider discussing these concerns with your daughter. Good day. .
PATIENT: "Continued good health?" That's it? No encouragement? Never mind. It’s just a card. Thank you… I suppose. Don’t bother calling. I won’t answer. Doctors… always a bother. .
