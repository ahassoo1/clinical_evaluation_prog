DOCTOR: Good morning, Esthela. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Tosca. It's August 2nd, and I see you’re 44 years old. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, Esthela Pandolfi. It’s…well, it’s a bit delicate, actually. I’m dating someone, and I want to be…thorough. One must be careful, you understand. I want to make sure everything is as it should be, before things go any further. It's just common sense, really.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. That's very responsible of you. It's always best to be proactive about your health, especially when starting a new relationship. So, to clarify, you'd like a general health check-up with a focus on sexually transmitted infections and overall reproductive health?
PATIENT: Well, “general” feels a bit…understated, Doctor. I’m not simply looking for a quick assessment. I expect a comprehensive examination. And yes, the…STIs, as you put it, are a concern. Though I have been quite careful, one can never be too sure, can one? I'd also like to know if there's anything else I should be worried about, given my age. A woman must be vigilant, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Esthela. A comprehensive examination is exactly what we’ll do. We’ll cover a full medical history, perform a physical exam, and run the necessary tests to address your concerns about STIs and any other potential health issues relevant to your age. To start, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? I had chickenpox as a child, naturally. And a rather unpleasant bout of the flu a few years back, but I recovered, of course. I had my gallbladder removed in 2012, which was quite disruptive, I must say. Beyond that… honestly, I’ve always been quite healthy. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. I do take a daily vitamin, though. A good multi-vitamin is essential, you understand. And I'm on Medicare, naturally. Is that sufficient detail for now, Doctor? I wouldn't want to bore you with trivialities.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you, Esthela. Chickenpox as a child, flu a few years ago, gallbladder removed in 2012, daily multivitamin, and covered by Medicare. Just to confirm, have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I have never been diagnosed with anything of the sort. My blood pressure is perfectly normal, I assure you. I watch what I eat. And I exercise – well, I take brisk walks. I’m not one for strenuous activity, naturally. But I maintain a healthy lifestyle. My husband—my late husband—was quite particular about that, you see. He was a very health-conscious man. And I've kept up with his good habits, naturally. It would be quite uncouth to let things slide, wouldn’t it?
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Esthela. No history of chronic conditions, good blood pressure, and you maintain a healthy lifestyle. That’s very positive. Now, regarding your family history, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or any other major illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, family… well, it’s a bit…complicated. My mother lived to be 87, but she had a touch of arthritis in her later years. My father… he had a weak heart, unfortunately. He passed away when I was quite young. My brother… well, he didn’t take care of himself, naturally. He smoked, drank… a rather regrettable lifestyle, really. He had some problems with his lungs, if I recall correctly. Nothing… significant, as such. Just… unfortunate choices, you see. It’s hardly relevant to my health, is it? I've always been very careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mother with arthritis, father with a weak heart, and brother with lung problems due to lifestyle factors. Thank you. Now, Esthela, before we move on to the physical exam, I’d like to ask about any allergies you may have – to medications, foods, or anything else. And could you please tell me if you’re currently taking any medications besides the daily multivitamin?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I'm not one for allergies. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to dust, but nothing a good cleaning can’t remedy. And medications… just the vitamin, naturally. I do take an occasional ibuprofen for a headache, but that's hardly a regular occurrence. I prefer to rest and drink plenty of water, actually. I find that’s usually quite sufficient. I don’t believe in filling my body with unnecessary chemicals, you understand. It's simply not a good practice. Are we almost finished with these… questions, Doctor? I find them a bit… tedious, frankly.
DOCTOR: Almost finished with the initial questions, Esthela. Just a few more things to cover before we proceed with the physical exam. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Heavens. What exactly are you hoping to ascertain, Doctor? I assure you, I lead a perfectly respectable life. I’m a widow, as I mentioned, and I spend my time tending to my home and… well, cultivating a new companionship. I don’t partake in any… undesirable activities. I don't smoke, I rarely drink – a glass of wine with dinner on occasion, naturally. I haven't traveled extensively. Is that what you’re looking for? I find this line of questioning rather… intrusive, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Esthela. These questions are simply part of a standard medical evaluation, and help me get a complete picture of your overall health. It's important for me to understand your lifestyle to provide the best possible care. To clarify, you don't smoke, rarely drink alcohol, and are not currently employed. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Correct, Doctor. Though I prefer the term “retired”, naturally. I was a personal service manager, overseeing various… arrangements. It was quite demanding work, actually. And yes, I don't smoke, and as I said, a glass of wine occasionally. It’s hardly a vice, is it? Are we finally finished with this interrogation, Doctor? I must say, I’m rather looking forward to getting this…examination… over with. It's all rather unpleasant, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, Esthela, we are almost finished with the questions. Just one last thing. Before we move on to the physical exam, I’d like to ask if you’ve been sexually active recently?
PATIENT: Doctor, I must say, that is an exceedingly personal question. While I appreciate your thoroughness, I find that rather… forward. As I mentioned, I am cultivating a new companionship. It is…recent. And while I understand the necessity of these inquiries, I do expect a certain level of discretion, you understand. It’s a delicate matter. I’m not one to discuss my private affairs with…strangers, naturally. But yes, I am currently sexually active. Is that sufficient information? Please, let us move on to the examination now. I’m quite ready to be finished with this.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question was too forward, Esthela. You are absolutely right to expect discretion, and I will certainly respect your privacy. It's simply a necessary part of ensuring your health and wellbeing. Now, if you're comfortable, we can proceed with the physical exam. I'll start by checking your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and perform a general abdominal exam. We'll also need to collect a urine sample for testing. Would you like me to explain each step as we go, or would you prefer I just proceed?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. A brief explanation would be…reassuring. I confess, I’m not particularly fond of medical procedures. I much prefer knowing what to expect. And please, be gentle. I'm not as… robust… as I once was. Start with the vital signs, you said? Very well. Just… try not to make it too unpleasant, Doctor. And do inform me before you touch me, if you please. I have a rather… sensitive constitution.
DOCTOR: Of course, Esthela. I will explain everything as we go and proceed with utmost care. I’ll be gentle, and I will absolutely inform you before each step of the exam. First, I’m going to wrap this cuff around your arm to check your blood pressure. It will inflate briefly and tighten for a moment, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’m just looking for a reading to ensure it's within a healthy range. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that is… acceptable, Doctor. Though it does look rather… constricting. Please, do not tighten it too much. I have a rather delicate circulatory system, you see. And please, be swift about it. I do not enjoy being confined, even temporarily. Do proceed, but with caution, Doctor. With caution.
DOCTOR: Of course, Esthela. I’m being very careful. This is just a brief tightening – it won’t last long. Just relax your arm for me, if you can. Okay, your blood pressure is 138 over 82. That’s a little elevated, but not drastically so. We can monitor it during future visits. Now, I’m going to check your pulse. I'll just gently feel for your pulse here. Your pulse is 78 beats per minute, which is within the normal range.
PATIENT: Elevated, you say? Is that…cause for concern, Doctor? I do get rather anxious at times, perhaps that's it. And 78…that is normal, isn't it? I always thought so. Please, do not press so firmly. You're quite… vigorous, Doctor. And do try to be more… delicate, if you please. This is all rather unsettling, you see.
DOCTOR: It's a slightly elevated reading, Esthela, but it's not immediately concerning. As you said, anxiety can certainly contribute to that, and it’s a good baseline to monitor. I'll take it again later during the exam to see if it has come down. And I apologize for being vigorous. I will be much more gentle. Now, let's check your temperature. I’ll just place the thermometer under your tongue for a moment. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Are you alright with that?
PATIENT: Painless, you say? Everything is “quick and painless” until it isn't, Doctor. Very well. But please, be swift about it. I do not enjoy having foreign objects in my mouth. And do not press it too far back, if you please. I have a rather sensitive gag reflex. Do proceed… quickly. I find this entire ordeal rather… degrading, frankly.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Esthela, and I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Just relax your tongue for a moment. It will only take a few seconds. 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Perfectly normal. Now, if you're comfortable, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. I'll just place it on your chest and back to listen for any unusual sounds. It won't hurt, but you may feel a slight coolness from the metal. Would you like to sit up for this part?
PATIENT: Yes, sitting is preferable, Doctor. I find it…less invasive. And do be mindful of my…delicate skin, if you please. Do not press too hard with that… instrument. And do explain what you are listening for, if you must. I have always been a woman who appreciates clarity. Proceed, but with the utmost care, Doctor. The utmost care.
DOCTOR: Of course, Esthela. I will be very gentle. I’m just listening for regular heartbeats and clear lung sounds. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Good. Your heart sounds are regular. No murmurs or abnormal rhythms detected. Now, let’s listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Good. Your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling sounds detected. Everything sounds normal so far. Now, I’d like to just do a quick abdominal exam. I'll gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Are you alright with that?
PATIENT: Abdominal…exam? Doctor, are you certain that is necessary? I confess, I am rather… sensitive in that region. I have always been. And I do not enjoy being touched, particularly in that area. Is there absolutely no alternative? Please, explain precisely what you are looking for. And do not press too hard, if you insist. I have always been a woman who appreciates boundaries. Proceed… with extreme caution, Doctor. Extreme caution.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Esthela. It's a routine part of the exam, and it helps me get a complete picture of your health. I'm simply checking for any tenderness or abnormalities in your abdomen. It won't hurt, and I will be very gentle. I'll start by just visually inspecting your abdomen, and then I’ll gently press on different areas to check for any pain or resistance. Is that alright?
PATIENT: "Visually inspecting"... is that what you call it, Doctor? Very well. But do not linger. I find that… unsettling. And do not press on my abdomen, if you please. I have always been a woman who values her privacy. And do not expect me to reveal anything unnecessary. I have always been… discreet. Proceed… swiftly, Doctor. Swiftly. And remember… boundaries.
DOCTOR: Of course, Esthela. I will respect your boundaries and proceed swiftly. I’ll just do a quick visual inspection. Everything appears normal visually. Now, I understand your discomfort, and I won’t press on your abdomen if you're not comfortable. We can skip that part of the exam if you prefer. Would you like me to proceed with a urine sample collection instead?
PATIENT: Skip it, Doctor. Please, skip it entirely. I find the entire ordeal… distressing. A urine sample… yes, that is acceptable. It's… less invasive. And do ensure a modicum of privacy, if you please. I have always been a woman who values her dignity. Proceed with the sample, Doctor. And do be quick about it. This entire experience has been… thoroughly unpleasant, I must say.
DOCTOR: Of course, Esthela. I understand. I'll leave you some privacy in the restroom to collect the sample. There’s a specimen cup and instructions inside. Just knock on the door when you're finished, and I’ll come get it. Take your time. While you're collecting the sample, I'll just document our findings so far and prepare for the next step.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Esthela. Take all the time you need. I'll be right here when you're ready.
