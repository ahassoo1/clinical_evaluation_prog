DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Beinborn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, dear. Beinborn, you say? Fancy name. Well, honestly, I don't rightly remember why I'm here. My daughter, Camille, scheduled it. She's always fussing over me. Something about not wanting me to… well, I can't recall. Something the hospital wanted to do. Seemed a bit much, if you ask me. Doctors these days… always wanting to poke and prod.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Wynell. It's very common for things to slip your mind, especially at your age. And it's good of Camille to be so attentive. Let's see if we can figure it out together. You mentioned the hospital – do you recall when you were at the hospital, or what they were concerned about?
PATIENT: Oh, hospitals… dreadful places. Let me think… It was… last year, I suppose? Or maybe the year before? Time just… blurs. They were going on about something with my feet, I think. Said something wasn't right. But my feet feel fine. A little achy sometimes, naturally, I’m 83, not a spring chicken! But fine. They wanted to… cut on them, I believe. Camille nearly had a fit when I told her. Honestly, all this fuss…
DOCTOR: Okay, let me see what the records say… Ah, here we are. It looks like you were seen at St. Jude’s Hospital last November for peripheral artery disease, and they recommended a vascular consultation due to reduced blood flow in your feet. That would explain the aching you’re feeling, and why they mentioned cutting – sometimes, they need to improve circulation with a procedure. Does that sound familiar at all?
PATIENT: Peripheral…artery…disease? Goodness. Sounds serious. And cutting? No, still doesn't sound right. I told them, I said, “Doctor, I walk just fine! I go to church every Sunday, I keep my little garden.” They just kept talking about blood flow and… vessels. Honestly, I think they were trying to scare me. I’ve always been healthy. My mother lived to be 95, and she didn’t let any doctor tell her what to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Wynell. It’s good you’re active, and it's wonderful your mother lived such a long life. Peripheral artery disease doesn’t always mean you’ll need a procedure right away. It just means the arteries in your legs and feet are narrowed, which can reduce blood flow and cause pain, especially with activity. It’s good we're talking about this. Just to get a clearer picture, could you describe the aching in your feet?
PATIENT: Well, it's not a constant ache, dear. It comes and goes. Mostly when I've been on my feet for a bit. Like after church, or after I've been weeding the roses. It’s just… a tiredness, really. Not a sharp pain, you understand. More like… a heavy feeling. I put my feet up, have a cup of tea, and it usually goes away. I've managed just fine on my own for years. I don’t need anyone telling me what to do about a little tiredness.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Wynell. So, it’s more of a tired, heavy feeling that comes on with activity and improves with rest. And it doesn’t sound like sharp pain. I'd like to do a quick physical exam to check the circulation in your feet. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, examining, is it? Well… I suppose so. But don’t go poking around too much. I have sensitive feet, you know. And please, no needles. I hate needles. Honestly, the things they expect you to endure these days…
DOCTOR: Certainly, Wynell. No needles, I promise. Just a gentle examination. I’ll be checking your pulses and looking at the skin on your feet. Okay… Your pulses are a bit weak, especially on your right foot. And I notice the skin on both feet is a little pale and cool to the touch. There's also some thinning of the hair on your toes. That can be a sign of reduced circulation. It’s not alarming, but it does support what the hospital found.
PATIENT: Weak pulses… pale skin… Honestly, you’re scaring me now, dear. I just have a little tiredness! My skin has always been pale. I don't spend a lot of time in the sun, you know. And my hair… well, I’m 83! Hair thins as you get older! I always told Camille she worries too much. This is just… a natural part of getting old.
DOCTOR: You’re right to be concerned, Wynell, and I apologize if I’m causing you anxiety. I’m not trying to scare you. What I’m seeing could be simply a part of aging, as you say, and we want to rule out anything serious. The weak pulses and cool skin can be signs of reduced circulation, which is why the hospital recommended a vascular consultation. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a simple test called an Ankle-Brachial Index, or ABI. It’s non-invasive – it just involves measuring the blood pressure in your arms and ankles. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood pressure, you say? More tests… Honestly. Well… I suppose. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And as long as you promise no needles. I truly dislike needles. Camille would be furious if I refused, you see. She always says I need to listen to the doctors. Though, honestly, I’ve lived this long perfectly well on my own.
DOCTOR: No needles, I promise. And it won't take long – maybe 15-20 minutes. We can do it right here in the office. It will give us a better understanding of the blood flow in your legs and feet. While I set this up, could you tell me a little about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, I have a little bit of arthritis in my hands, makes it hard to open jars sometimes. And my blood pressure, as you say, runs a little high, but nothing a little chamomile tea can’t fix. I used to have a touch of the indigestion, but that’s mostly gone now. I was briefly seeing a doctor for some dizziness a few years back, but it just went away on its own, so I stopped going. Honestly, I don't like bothering with doctors unless absolutely necessary. They always want to give you pills for everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a little arthritis, slightly elevated blood pressure managed with chamomile tea, and a history of dizziness that resolved on its own. And no allergies to any medications, correct?
PATIENT: No, dear, no allergies. I’ve always been a strong constitution. My mother used to say I could eat anything. Though, I do try to avoid those… artificial sweeteners. They give me a funny feeling. And I try to stay away from too much salt, Camille worries about my blood pressure, you see. Honestly, the things one has to remember these days…
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Wynell. So, no allergies, avoid artificial sweeteners, and watch your salt intake. Alright, let's get this ABI test done. It involves wrapping a cuff around your ankle and arm to measure the blood pressure. I’ll explain each step as we go along. It shouldn't be uncomfortable at all. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels strange.
PATIENT: Alright, alright. As long as it doesn’t take long. And no poking and prodding! Honestly, I feel like a guinea pig in here. But do hurry, dear, I have my garden to tend to. The roses need pruning, you know. And Camille will be wanting me home for supper. She makes a lovely fish stew, but I’m not sure she puts enough spice in it. Honestly, the things one has to put up with…
DOCTOR: Just a little pressure now, Wynell. Okay, good. Now the arm… Everything is going well. This will give us a good baseline to work from. While this measures, do you take any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Camille makes me take a multi-vitamin, says I need my strength. And I take a little bit of calcium for my bones. She also gave me something for my memory, but honestly, I can't recall the name of it. It doesn't seem to be doing much good, does it? Honestly, the things they expect you to remember these days…
DOCTOR: Okay, a multi-vitamin, calcium, and something for your memory that we can try to identify later. Alright, the test is finished. Let’s take a look at the results… Hmm… The results do show some reduced blood flow in your right leg, which supports our initial findings. It's not severe, but it does suggest some degree of peripheral artery disease. That means the arteries are narrowed, reducing circulation. This is likely causing the tiredness and coolness in your feet.
PATIENT: Reduced blood flow… narrowed arteries… Honestly, you’re scaring me now, dear. I just have a little tiredness! I walk to church every Sunday! I prune my roses! I don’t need all this talk of… of disease! Honestly, I think I’m getting a headache. Can I go home now?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Wynell. I don’t want to scare you, and I apologize if I am. It's good you're active, and it's wonderful you can still walk to church and prune your roses! That means you’re doing a lot right. Reduced blood flow doesn't necessarily mean you need to stop doing those things. It just means we need to manage it to prevent it from getting worse. We have options, and we can discuss them slowly. Before we talk about those options, I'd like to recommend a consultation with a vascular specialist. They're experts in this area and can give you a more detailed assessment. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A specialist? More doctors? Honestly, I'm getting quite tired of doctors. And all this talk of assessment… What does that even mean? Honestly, I think I need a cup of tea. And a lie-down. I'm not sure I can handle another assessment. And what if they want to… cut on my legs? I just know they will. Camille will be furious if they want to cut on my legs. Honestly…
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Wynell. A consultation doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll need any procedures. It simply means a specialist will review your case and give you their opinion on the best course of action. They can explain everything in detail and answer any questions you have. They will be able to tell you if cutting is an option and if it is needed. It's true that cutting could be an option, but it’s not the only one. There are also medications and lifestyle changes that can help manage peripheral artery disease. Before we make any decisions, let's focus on getting you a consultation with the vascular specialist, Dr. Anya Sharma. I’ll give you her information, and you can decide if you’d like to schedule an appointment. There is absolutely no pressure. In the meantime, I'll give you some information about peripheral artery disease and things you can do at home, like elevating your legs and avoiding smoking. Would you like that?
PATIENT: Elevating my legs… I do that sometimes, helps with the tiredness. And I certainly don’t smoke! Never have, never will. My mother always said it was a dreadful habit. Information… yes, alright. Information is good. As long as it doesn’t have too many… medical words. Honestly, I don't understand half the things these doctors say. And if it mentions cutting, I’m throwing it away. Absolutely throwing it away. And Dr. Sharma… I’ll… I’ll think about it. Maybe. Camille will want me to go, I suppose. Honestly… this is all very tiring. Can I go home now? Really, I think I just need a nice cup of tea and a lie-down.
DOCTOR: Of course, Wynell. Absolutely. Let me print out some information for you, and I’ll make sure it’s easy to understand. I’ll also give you Dr. Sharma’s contact information. Here you go. And remember, there’s no pressure to do anything you’re not comfortable with. I'm glad you came in today. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Get some rest and enjoy your cup of tea. Have a good day, Wynell.
