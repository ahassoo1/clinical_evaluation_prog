DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Kingan, yes?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Lamark. Look, doc, I gotta be quick, if that’s alright. Got a tryout later.
DOCTOR: Of course, of course. We'll try to be efficient. Though, rushing through things isn’t ideal, naturally. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s for the tryout. The team wants a check-up before I can… well, try out. You know, make sure I don’t, uh, fall apart on ‘em. Mostly just gotta prove I’m healthy enough to play.
DOCTOR: Play… at your age?
PATIENT: Hey, age is just a number, doc. I keep myself in shape. Better shape than most folks half my age, honestly. What sport are we talkin’ about, by the way? Just so you know what kinda stuff to look for.
DOCTOR: The notes here are… sparse. No mention of a specific sport. Just a general request for a pre-participation physical. And frankly, your BMI is… concerning. Have you been told you’re underweight recently?
PATIENT: Underweight? Huh. No, not really. I mean, I’m lean, yeah. Always have been. Gotta be quick, right? Extra weight slows you down. What’s a… BMI? Is that bad? I just… eat what I need to get through practice. Never really worried about numbers.
DOCTOR: It's a measure of your body fat based on your height and weight. And yes, it is rather low. 18.4. Ideally, we want to see something in the 20-25 range. It can affect your stamina, your overall health… your ability to even complete this tryout, frankly. Let's start with a brief medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. Had the usual childhood stuff, you know? Chickenpox, measles… nothing major. Broke my arm once when I was a kid, climbing a tree. But that was ages ago. No surgeries, never needed ‘em. Been pretty lucky, I guess. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time. This tryout kinda forced my hand, you know?
DOCTOR: “No regular medical care.” Of course. Any family history of serious illness?
PATIENT: My dad… he had some heart trouble when he got older. Had to take it easy, couldn’t really… well, he passed away a few years back. Mom’s still around, she’s… mostly just aches and pains, old age stuff. Nothing serious, I don’t think. No one else really… I don’t know much about my grandparents, honestly. They lived back in Mongolia.
DOCTOR: Right. And currently, are you taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single one. I don’t believe in ‘em, if I can avoid it. Just try to eat right and get enough rest. Old-fashioned, I guess.
DOCTOR: “Avoids medication.” And any allergies?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. Dust, pollen, bee stings… I’m fine. Always have been. Really. I’m pretty tough, doc.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, “tough” doesn’t necessarily equate to “healthy.” Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. I need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take your blood pressure. Please remove your shirt and have a seat on the examination table. And try not to move around too much. We don't have all day.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. But I'm tellin’ ya, everything’s gonna be alright. Just gotta prove I can still go. Don't wanna waste any time, right?
DOCTOR: Heart sounds… somewhat rapid, but regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 130/80. Reflexes… a bit diminished, but within normal limits. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Generally, you're not in acute distress. However, your low weight and diminished reflexes are concerning. We need to run some blood work to get a better picture. I’m ordering a complete blood count and a metabolic panel.
PATIENT: Blood work? Seriously? Look, doc, is this gonna disqualify me? This tryout is important. I don’t have time for a whole bunch of tests. Can’t you just tell me if I’m good to go? I feel fine. Really.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kingan, I understand your urgency. However, I cannot ethically clear you for strenuous physical activity without a proper assessment. Your weight is significantly below what is considered healthy, and your diminished reflexes warrant further investigation. It could be something minor, or… it could be something more serious. I need to rule out any underlying medical conditions before I can give you the go-ahead. I'm not trying to be difficult, I'm trying to protect your health. The blood work will take a few days. In the meantime, I strongly advise against participating in any strenuous activity.
PATIENT: A few days? That's it… the tryout will be over by then. Look, can’t you just… give me something for it? An energy boost, something to make me stronger? I’ve done this before, doc. I’m tough. I can handle it. Please. This is really important to me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely not. I am a medical professional, not a… supplement dispenser. I will not provide you with anything that could potentially harm your health. And frankly, your insistence on ignoring my advice is… concerning. I strongly recommend you refrain from participating in this tryout until we have the results of your blood work. I will have the lab send the results to me directly, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Here is a requisition form for the lab.
