DOCTOR: Bula vinaka, Early! It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Kimm... it’s a bit silly, really. I just… I was hoping you could write me a little card. A “get well” kind of thing. You know, for… morale. My ex-wife, she doesn't… care much for my feelings, and a card from you might… help. It’s important it looks official, you understand? Not just… scribbled on a napkin.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You'd like me to write a note, something official-looking, to boost your spirits. That's perfectly alright, Early. We want to support your wellbeing in any way we can. Before I do that, though – and just so I have a complete picture – are you experiencing any health concerns at all right now?
PATIENT: Health concerns? Doctor, with all due respect, I’m a stationary engineer. I operate boilers. I’m a strong man. I don’t have health concerns. I just want a card. Are you suggesting I’m… imagining things? This is about a little encouragement, not a diagnosis. I keep the machines running, you know. Important work.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Early, that came out wrong. It's standard practice for me to ask about your overall health when you come in for a visit, even if the primary reason isn’t a specific illness. It helps me understand the whole picture, and ensure everything is as it should be. So, let me rephrase. Aside from wanting the note for encouragement, are you feeling generally well?
PATIENT: Generally well… Look, Doctor, I’m 56 years old. Everything aches a little. My knees complain when it rains. I get tired after a long shift. Is that what you want to know? It’s called getting older. It doesn't mean I'm sick. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time, and I don't intend to start now complaining about normal aches. The card, please. Can we just focus on the card? It’s important to me.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. You're feeling the effects of age, some typical aches and pains, but otherwise consider yourself generally well. I appreciate you being upfront with me, Early. Just to be thorough – and this is a quick check – have you noticed any recent changes in your energy levels, appetite, or sleep?
PATIENT: Changes? Doctor, I work 12-hour shifts. My energy levels are always low. My appetite is… adequate. And my sleep? What sleep? I get a few hours when I can. That’s life. Are you going to ask me about my bowel movements next? Really, this is ridiculous. I came here for a card, not a… a full physical examination. I’m a practical man, Doctor. I don’t have time for all these questions. Just write the card. Please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Early. I hear you. I apologize for pressing the issue. It’s just… a significant change in energy, appetite, or sleep can be a sign of something underlying, even if it's not immediately serious. But you're right, we should focus on what brought you in today. Before I write the card, just one last quick question – have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Now you're just fishing. My ex-wife… she mentioned something about me looking… thinner. But that’s her, always finding something to criticize. It’s stress, alright? Dealing with her, the machines… life. I don’t need a lecture about my weight. Write the card, Doctor. A simple “Get Well Soon” or “Thinking of You” will do. And make it look official, please. With a proper stamp. I want her to know I’m… taking care of myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, Early. Thank you for being honest with me. It sounds like you've been under a lot of stress, and I understand wanting something to show you're taking care of yourself. While I'm happy to write the card, I am a little concerned about the unintentional weight loss and the change in appetite you've mentioned. It's not about lecturing, it’s about making sure everything is alright. Would you be open to a very quick check-up – just blood pressure, pulse, and a listen to your heart and lungs – just to be on the safe side?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! Doctor, I came here for a card, not a medical examination! I am perfectly fine. I operate heavy machinery every day! I don't need you poking and prodding me. This is… insulting, frankly. I'm wasting my time here. Just write the card or I'll go somewhere else. I'm a grown man, I know my own body. And I'm telling you, I'm fine! This is ridiculous. Just… write the card. Please. And then I'm leaving.
DOCTOR: Early, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if I’ve upset you. I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable or question your well-being. But as your doctor, I have a responsibility to make sure everything is alright, even if you feel fine. I see that you’re a strong, capable man, and I respect that. But sometimes, even strong people need a check-up. The weight loss could be something simple, or it could be a sign of something else. A quick check-up would just give us peace of mind. However, I respect your wishes. If you absolutely do not want a check-up, I will write the card. But before I do, I want to ask one last thing. Do you have any history of heart problems, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: History? My father… he had high blood pressure. He worked too hard, always stressed. Never took a day off. That’s all I know. And my mother… she had problems with her… digestion. Nothing serious. Look, just write the card, Doctor! I’m tired. This is… upsetting. A simple “Get Well Soon” is all I need. And a stamp, please. Make it official. I don’t want any more questions. Just… write the card.
DOCTOR: Okay, Early. I understand. We'll write the card. Knowing about your father's high blood pressure is helpful, though. It does increase your risk, so it’s good to be aware of. I’m going to write a note stating that you're under my care and I wish you well. It’s not a full medical statement, just a kind message. While I’m writing this, I want to give you some information about high blood pressure, just in case. It often has no symptoms, so it’s important to get regular check-ups. I'll also give you a brochure with some information on managing stress. Here you go. And here's the card. I do encourage you to schedule a follow-up appointment, even if you're feeling fine, just to discuss your family history and ensure everything is alright. Would you like me to schedule that for you now?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I have work to do. This is enough. Thank you. I appreciate… the card. A waste of time… all of it.
