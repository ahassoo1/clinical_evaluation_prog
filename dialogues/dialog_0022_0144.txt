DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Calvery. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's… Tosca, right? Yes. Well, honestly? Curiosity, mostly. I just moved here, you see, and thought I should find a doctor. It’s good to have one, I suppose. My late husband always said that. Though I can't rightly recall why he said that. Everything’s a bit…fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mrs. Calvery. It’s very sensible to establish care with a doctor when you move to a new area. Preventative care is excellent. And it's quite common for memory to have little blips, especially as we get older. "Fuzzy," as you say. So, even though you’re coming in to establish care, are there any specific health concerns you do want to discuss today?
PATIENT: Oh, I suppose not, really. Everything’s… ticking along, I guess. I get a little tired, but who doesn’t? And my knees… well, they aren’t what they used to be. But that’s just age, isn't it? Honestly, I just want to make sure nothing… dreadful is lurking. You know? My sister, she had something awful a few years back… but it wasn’t me. I just… don’t want surprises. Are you good at finding things before they become surprises?
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable concern, Mrs. Calvery, and exactly what we're here for. We'll do a thorough check-up to get a good baseline and address anything that needs attention. It's always best to be proactive. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been seeing any other doctors regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Doctors… not really. Just the usual. You know, the eye doctor, dentist. Nothing serious. My husband, he handled all that when he was… around. He liked to be in control of things. I mostly just… went along. I can’t even recall the name of my last primary care doctor, if I ever even had one. Is that bad? I suppose it is. My memory really is awful. Though I do remember he had a funny tie. Stripes, I think. Very distracting.
DOCTOR: It's not bad at all, Mrs. Calvery. It’s quite common for one partner to manage the medical appointments. We'll just start fresh today. And a funny tie is a perfectly good detail to remember! Okay. Do you have any major medical conditions you're aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… high… blood pressure? Doctor said something about that, a long time ago. Something about salt. I used to love salt. Still do, really. But he made me cut back. Or maybe that was my husband. Honestly, they both nagged about my salt. And my knees, I suppose. They ache. Is that a condition? I mostly just ignore them. I don't feel sick, if that makes any sense. Just… old. And a little tired. Is being tired a condition?
DOCTOR: Okay, so potentially some history of high blood pressure, and knee pain. And feeling tired. Those are all things we can definitely look into. It's good that you mention them. Being tired can be a sign of many things, so we’ll want to explore that. To get a better picture, could you tell me if anyone in your family – your parents, siblings, or other close relatives – has had any significant medical problems, like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or stroke?
PATIENT: Oh, family… that’s… a difficult question. My parents passed away a long time ago. My mother, she… she wasn’t very strong. She just… faded away. Something with her heart, I think. My father, he smoked. A lot. I suppose that wasn't good for him. My sister, she had that awful thing, but I can’t remember what it was. Something with her stomach, maybe? They all just… got old, I think. It’s what happens, doesn’t it? I never paid much attention to their illnesses. Too busy with… things. I can’t recall what those things were, either. Really, my memory is just… appalling. Perhaps you should just ask my sister. If she remembers anything. Though she’s not very reliable. Always exaggerating.
DOCTOR: It sounds like there might be a family history of heart issues, and that’s good information to have. It's alright that you don't recall all the details. We'll work with what you remember, and it’s okay if you need to think about it later. Now, let's talk about you a little more directly. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat… most things. Though I don’t much care for cilantro. Is that an allergy? It just tastes like soap. My husband loved cilantro. He’d put it on everything. Really ruined a perfectly good taco, if you ask me. I think I once had a rash after eating shellfish, but it was ages ago. Maybe it was just a bad shrimp. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to things like that. If it tastes good, I eat it. If it doesn’t, I don’t. Simple as that. I don’t like making a fuss. Though I did once have a terrible reaction to some lotion, I think. But I can’t recall which one. Really, I’m not very good at remembering these things. Is this helpful? I feel like I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: This is helpful, Mrs. Calvery. It’s good to know. And no, you’re not rambling at all. We’re just trying to get a complete picture. So, just to be clear, you’ve had a possible reaction to shellfish in the past, and a rash from a lotion at some point. Do you currently take any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... My neighbor, she’s always giving me things. Vitamins, mostly. Some sort of berry extract, I think. She says it’s good for the memory. Irony, isn’t it? I take those sometimes, when I remember. And I used to take something for my knees, a long time ago. A little white pill. But it didn’t really help, so I stopped. And… I think I have some aspirin in the cabinet, for headaches. But I rarely get headaches. Honestly, I just forget to take things. I’m terrible at keeping track of these things. I really should be more organized. My husband would have been so disappointed. He was a very organized man. Everything had its place. Not like me, at all. Do you think it matters that I forget to take things? Perhaps I should write it down. But then I’d probably forget to read the list. It’s a vicious cycle, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mrs. Calvery. Many people find it difficult to keep track of medications. And it’s good that you’re aware of it. We can certainly discuss ways to help with that. It’s helpful to know you have been taking some vitamins, and previously used medication for your knees. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health, I'd like to ask a few questions about how you're feeling generally. Have you experienced any recent changes in your weight, appetite, sleep patterns, or energy levels?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Changes… well, everything changes, doesn't it? My weight… I think I’ve gained a little. Or maybe it’s just my clothes shrinking. My husband always said I was getting a little… rounder. He wasn’t very tactful. My appetite is… okay. I eat when I’m hungry. Mostly. And my sleep… well, I don’t sleep as well as I used to. I wake up a lot during the night. Thinking about things. Or nothing at all. And my energy levels… lower than they used to be, definitely. I get tired easily. Very easily. I used to have so much energy. I used to… well, I don't even remember what I used to do. I've really lost my spark, haven't I? It’s just… old age, I suppose. Is there anything I can do about it? Besides move to a different planet?
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’ve noticed some changes that are affecting your quality of life, Mrs. Calvery. And it’s good that you’re bringing them to my attention. And no, moving to a different planet isn’t usually the first recommendation! To get a more complete picture, I’d like to ask about other systems in your body. Have you been experiencing any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Palpitations… are those like when your heart races? I think I’ve felt that sometimes. When I get… flustered. Or excited. Which doesn't happen very often anymore. Shortness of breath… not really. Unless I try to climb the stairs. Which I avoid, if possible. Chest pain… hmm. Not exactly pain. More of a… tightness. Sometimes. When I’m thinking about things. Or worrying. Which I do a lot of. It’s just… old age, isn’t it? Everything aches and creaks. I suppose it’s normal. I don’t want to make a fuss about it. Is it bad that I just ignore things until they get really bad? My husband always said I was too stubborn for my own good. He was probably right. Is this important? Perhaps I should call my sister. Though she’ll probably just exaggerate everything. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a little overwhelmed. Can we stop now?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mrs. Calvery. We can absolutely take a pause. You’re not making a fuss at all. It's perfectly understandable to feel overwhelmed. And you’re not alone in feeling this way. We’ve covered a lot of ground already. Before we move on to a physical exam, would you like me to review the information we’ve discussed so far, just to make sure I have everything correct?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That would be lovely, Doctor. I do tend to… ramble. And forget things. Perhaps if you tell me what you’ve written, it will jog my memory. Or at least reassure me that I haven’t completely left out anything important. Honestly, it’s a bit of a blur. And I do apologize for taking up so much of your time. My sister would probably say I’m making a spectacle of myself. But she’s always been a bit… dramatic. Yes, please. Review it. That would be wonderful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Calvery. So, just to recap, you’ve recently moved here and are establishing care with our clinic. You’ve noticed some changes in your weight, appetite, and sleep patterns, and have been feeling more tired. You mentioned a possible family history of heart disease and a sister who has had some health issues. You’ve had a possible reaction to shellfish in the past and a rash from a lotion. You currently take some vitamins occasionally and used to take medication for your knees but stopped. You also mentioned a history of high blood pressure and that your neighbor gives you vitamins. You’ve had some tightness in your chest and palpitations, particularly when feeling flustered, and you avoid climbing stairs. You also mentioned feeling a little forgetful and a bit overwhelmed. Does that sound accurate?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That… that’s pretty much it. You've written everything down so neatly. I'm a bit of a mess, really. The shellfish… yes, I remember that now. A rash. It was dreadful. And the lotion… oh, my. A terrible itching. And the vitamins… yes, my neighbor, bless her heart, she’s always trying to keep me healthy. And the palpitations… yes, when I get flustered. It’s quite embarrassing, actually. And the forgetfulness… well, that’s just a constant companion these days. You’ve captured it all so perfectly. Honestly, you’re a very good listener, Doctor. And a very good writer. Thank you. It’s… reassuring to have it all down in black and white. Perhaps now you can tell me what’s wrong with me? Or at least what you think might be wrong? I do worry, you see. About everything. Is it… is it something serious? Or am I just getting old?
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to be worried, Mrs. Calvery. And you’re not just getting old. We all experience changes as we age, but it's important to investigate what's going on and see if there are things we can address. Based on what you’ve told me, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The fatigue, changes in sleep, and occasional palpitations could be related to several things, including stress, anxiety, or even underlying medical conditions like anemia or thyroid issues. The tightness in your chest warrants further investigation to rule out any cardiac concerns. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to perform a physical exam. That will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a general assessment of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical exam… yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I suppose it’s inevitable, isn’t it? Prodding and poking. I’ve never been very good with doctors. My husband always took care of all that. But I suppose I can manage. Just… be gentle, please? And try not to poke too hard? My skin is rather sensitive these days. And… perhaps tell me what you’re doing as you go along? I do get a little anxious when I don’t know what’s happening. Yes, a physical exam. Let’s get it over with. Quickly, if possible? And… is it going to hurt? Honestly, I’m starting to feel a little faint. Perhaps I should have had a cup of tea before coming here?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mrs. Calvery. I’ll be as gentle as possible. And I’ll explain everything as I go along. It shouldn’t hurt, but let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. We’ll take it slowly. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. This will help me assess your heart rhythm and breathing patterns. Just take deep breaths for me, in and out. Okay, that sounds… relatively normal. There are some mild changes, but nothing immediately concerning. Next, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically. 140/85. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Now, I’m just going to briefly examine your throat and ears. Everything looks clear here. Finally, I’ll just feel your abdomen. Anything feel tender or painful here?
PATIENT: Oh, my abdomen… no, nothing particularly painful. Just a little… gurgly sometimes. And perhaps a little bloated. It’s probably just gas, honestly. I do eat a lot of beans. My sister says I have a terrible diet. But I enjoy my beans. And my rice. And my noodles. I suppose I should eat more vegetables. My husband always said I needed to eat more vegetables. He was probably right. But I don't much care for them. They taste… bland. And they make me… gassy. Is it okay that my abdomen is gurgly? Is that a sign of something serious? I do worry, you see. About everything. And… is my blood pressure really that high? What does that mean? Am I going to have a heart attack? Or a stroke? Or… something even worse? Honestly, I’m starting to feel a little lightheaded. Perhaps I should lie down? Or have a cup of tea? Or just go home and take a nap? This is all very stressful. I think I preferred just rambling.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mrs. Calvery. Let's take a deep breath. Your abdomen being gurgly is very common and usually nothing to worry about. It just means your digestive system is working. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. It's something we want to monitor, and we can discuss lifestyle changes – like diet and exercise – to help lower it. It does not mean you're going to have a heart attack or a stroke. But consistently high blood pressure can increase your risk, which is why it’s important to manage it. You're not going to have a heart attack or stroke today, and we are going to work through this together. You’re starting to feel lightheaded, and I think it’s best if you sit for a few moments and take some slow, deep breaths. I’m going to have a nurse bring you a glass of water and check your blood pressure again just to be sure. To get a more complete picture, I’d like to order some blood work. This will help us check your thyroid function, look for any signs of anemia, and assess your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, blood work… yes, I suppose so. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Though I’ve never been very good with needles. My husband always took me to get my blood work done. He held my hand. I do get a little anxious. And lightheaded. And… faint. But I suppose I can manage. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And as long as the nurse is gentle. And as long as I can sit down. And as long as I have a glass of water. And as long as… oh, never mind. Just… do whatever you think is best, Doctor. I suppose I’m just being silly. But I do get anxious, you see. About everything. And… is this going to hurt? Honestly, I’m starting to feel a little bit panicky. Perhaps I should have stayed home and taken a nap. Or had a cup of tea. Or just… gone back to bed. But you're a doctor, and you know what’s best, so just… do whatever you think is best. And… thank you. For being so patient. And for not making me feel silly. I do appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re not silly at all, Mrs. Calvery. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about needles and blood work. We'll take our time, and I’ll make sure the nurse is gentle. You can sit down comfortably, and we'll get through this together. I’m going to have the nurse come in and draw a few vials of blood. It will take just a few minutes. We're checking your thyroid, complete blood count, and a basic metabolic panel. The results should be available in a few days. In the meantime, I want to review some lifestyle changes that can help improve your blood pressure and overall health. We’ll discuss diet, exercise, and stress management techniques. Let’s start with diet. Are you currently following any specific dietary patterns?
PATIENT: Oh, diet… well, not really. I eat what I like, mostly. Which isn’t very healthy, I suppose. A lot of rice. And noodles. And beans. And… a little bit of meat. And a little bit of fish. And not enough vegetables. My husband always said I needed to eat more vegetables. He was probably right. But I don’t much care for them. They taste… bland. And they make me… gassy. I do enjoy my food, though. It’s one of the few pleasures I have left, you see. And I don’t eat a lot of sugar. Or salt. Well, maybe a little bit of salt. But not too much. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to what I eat. I just eat when I’m hungry. And I enjoy my food. And I don’t want to change my diet. It’s one of the few things that makes me happy, you see. And I don’t think it’s worth changing just to lower my blood pressure a little bit. Honestly, I think I’d rather just be happy. And eat my rice and noodles and beans. And… perhaps have a little bit of chocolate. Is that alright? Or is that bad for my blood pressure? Honestly, I’m starting to feel a little bit overwhelmed. Perhaps I should have stayed home and taken a nap. Or had a cup of tea. Or just… gone back to bed. But you're a doctor, and you know what’s best, so just… do whatever you think is best. And… thank you. For being so patient. And for not making me feel silly. I do appreciate it.
DOCTOR: It sounds like enjoying your food is very important to you, Mrs. Calvery, and that's wonderful. And it's perfectly alright to prioritize happiness. We're not going to drastically change your diet overnight. We can start small. Perhaps we can focus on adding just one serving of vegetables to your day, and see how that goes. Or finding ways to make your favorite dishes a little bit healthier without sacrificing the flavors you love. And a small piece of dark chocolate is perfectly fine! It actually has some health benefits. Let’s focus on making small, sustainable changes, rather than trying to overhaul your entire lifestyle. That's what will be most effective in the long run. To help manage your blood pressure, let’s also talk about exercise. Do you currently engage in any regular physical activity?
