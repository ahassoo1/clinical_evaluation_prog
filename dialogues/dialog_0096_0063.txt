DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. My back... it’s really bad. Hurts a lot. Been hurting for… maybe a week now? It’s different than usual. I already have the cancer, you know? And this feels… worse with that.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here in your record about the… previous diagnosis. It's good you brought that up. And you say this back pain is different than what you've experienced before?
PATIENT: Yes. Usually it's just a dull ache, kinda always there. But this… this is sharp. And it goes down my leg now. Like, shooting pain. Makes it hard to stand up straight. I had to ask my daughter to drive me today. It’s really bad, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Sharp pain radiating down the leg... Alright. And when did you first notice this different pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… Tuesday, I think. Yes, Tuesday. I was trying to… help my granddaughter with her garden. Lifting some pots. Didn’t feel right even then, but I thought I just pulled something. But it didn’t get better. It just got worse. I took some of the pills the other doctor gave me, but they don’t help this one.
DOCTOR: And what other doctor gave you those pills, Ms. Meigs?
PATIENT: Doctor Kaito. He’s… the one who found the cancer. He gave me pills for the pain from… that. But this back pain feels… different, like I said. Not the same kind of hurt. It’s hard to explain. It's like a stabbing pain, especially when I try to move.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we'll need to figure out what's causing this new pain. It's important to differentiate it from the pain associated with your cancer, as you correctly pointed out. Let's start with a physical examination. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Okay. Yes, I can stand. Oh… whoa. That’s… not easy. It hurts when I put weight on my left leg. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful to know. It appears you have some tenderness along your L4 and L5 vertebrae. And you’re right, there is some pain with weight-bearing on the left leg. Can you bend forward and touch your toes for me?
PATIENT: Oooof… Doctor, that really hurts. I can't… I can't go all the way down. It feels like something is… stuck. And the pain shoots down my leg even more when I do that. I'm sorry. I'm not very flexible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. Don’t push yourself. That's very good information. Now, can you try to walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… hard. And it hurts. I feel… unsteady. Like my leg might give out. I don’t want to fall, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's enough. Please, have a seat. Based on what you've told me and the examination, it sounds like you may have a nerve impingement, possibly a herniated disc or spinal stenosis, causing the sciatica. However, given your history of cancer, we need to rule out other possibilities, including metastasis. I'm going to order an MRI of your lumbar spine, and some bloodwork to check your cancer markers. We'll also need to consult with Dr. Ramirez, the oncologist, to discuss the imaging results. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: MRI… that’s the picture machine, right? And… metastasis? That sounds… bad. You think the cancer… spread to my back? I don’t understand all the words. Is this going to be… a lot of pain? And what about driving? I need to take my granddaughter to school.
DOCTOR: Yes, an MRI is a picture machine, but a very detailed one. It will allow us to see what's happening with the nerves and discs in your back. Metastasis means the cancer has spread, yes. However, we don’t know that’s happened yet. That’s why we need the MRI. It's important to be thorough. As for the pain, it’s difficult to say. It sounds like it's already quite significant. We can adjust your pain medication in the meantime, but it's important to determine the cause of the pain to address it effectively. And regarding driving… no, Ms. Meigs, you should not be driving until we have a diagnosis and a treatment plan in place. It’s simply not safe, and you could put yourself and others at risk. I will have my nurse write you a note excusing you from driving for the next two weeks, or until we get the results. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Two weeks… that’s… long. My daughter works, you know? She can't always take me everywhere. And the pills… they don't really help. They make me sleepy, but the pain is still there. But… okay. No driving. And the picture machine. And… talking to the cancer doctor. What if… what if it is the cancer? What happens then?
DOCTOR: Ms. Meigs, we are getting ahead of ourselves. We don’t know that it is the cancer. We need the MRI results before we can say anything definitive. If it is the cancer, we will discuss all of your options, including radiation, chemotherapy, and palliative care. But let's not borrow trouble. Right now, we need to focus on getting the MRI scheduled and gathering more information. My nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to schedule the MRI and give you a prescription for a stronger pain reliever. She will also go over some instructions for the MRI with you. Do you have any other questions for me right now before she arrives?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s… all. Just… a lot to think about. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. Sarah will be with you shortly. Try not to worry. We will get to the bottom of this. .
