DOCTOR: Hi Melvenia, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Yoshino. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, I need some papers signed, actually. Some health forms, for… well, it doesn’t really matter. Just need them notarized, I guess? Is that what you do here? I just want to get this over with, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We can certainly help with completing and signing health forms. It's not quite the same as a full medical exam, but we can verify information and act as a witness for notarization. However, before we do that, I do want to make sure that you don't have any current health concerns I should be aware of. Even if it's just a quick check-in. It's part of my job to make sure I'm offering the best care possible, and sometimes things come up even when people are just needing forms filled out. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, alright. I suppose a quick check-in is fine. I haven't really been sick, sick, you know? Just… old. Things ache a bit, here and there, but that’s just getting older, right? Nothing for you to worry about, probably. I mostly just want these papers done and get on with my day. Do you need me to fill anything else out?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Melvenia. It’s good to be thorough, and aches and pains are common with age, but it’s still good to talk about them. And you’re right, we want to get these forms done for you as efficiently as possible. Just so I have a good picture, can you tell me a little more about where you’re feeling those aches and pains?
PATIENT: Well, mostly in my back. Lower back, really. And my knees, sometimes. Gets worse when it rains, you know? Funny how that is. It’s not… debilitating, or anything. I can still get around, do my gardening, mostly. It just… bothers me. Been like this for… oh, I don’t know. Years. I just assumed it was getting old. Is there something I should be worried about? I really don’t like going to doctors, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Melvenia. It's good you're still active with your gardening, that's wonderful. And it is common for those kinds of aches and pains to come with age. The rain thing is common too – changes in barometric pressure can definitely affect joints. To get a better idea of what's going on, and just to be on the safe side, could you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. What do you want to know? It’s… dull, mostly. Not sharp, not throbbing. Just a constant ache. It’s worse in the mornings, when I first get up, and after I’ve been sitting for a long time. Like after watching television, or… well, just sitting. Does that make sense? Sometimes it feels a little stiff, too. I take some… I think they're ibuprofen? The over-the-counter kind. Helps a little, but not much. I just figured it was part of getting old, really. I don’t want to bother you with all this if it's nothing.
DOCTOR: No, you're not bothering me at all, Melvenia. It's good you're telling me all of this. Dull ache, worse in the mornings and after sitting, some stiffness, and ibuprofen provides a little relief… that gives me a good starting point. Just to clarify, how long would you say this has been going on – these aches and pains?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a hard question. Years, I think. Maybe… ten years? Or more? It started slowly, you know? Just a little twinge here and there. I didn’t really pay much attention to it at first. It just gradually got worse, and worse. Now it's just… constant. I really don’t remember exactly when it started. Old age does funny things to your memory, you know? Are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? I really just want to get these papers signed.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are, Melvenia. And it is perfectly normal for memory to change with age. Ten years of gradual onset, constant ache… that’s helpful information. Before we move on to the forms, and just to rule out anything serious, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A physical exam? I really didn’t want to have to do that. Is it necessary? I told you, it’s just old age. I just want these papers signed, so I can get back home. I have my garden to tend to. And a book club meeting. Really, Doctor, is it absolutely necessary? It’s probably just a waste of your time, and… well, I just don’t like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Melvenia. And you're right, it might be nothing. But a quick exam – just checking your range of motion and feeling your back and knees – would help me feel more comfortable and make sure we're not missing anything. It really won't take long, and it could give us both peace of mind. Think of it as just being thorough, especially since you haven't had a check-up in a while. We can certainly proceed with the forms without it, but I would feel better if we did a quick assessment first. It would only take a few minutes. Would you be willing to let me do that, just to be on the safe side?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. But make it quick, please. And be gentle. My skin is… delicate, you know? And don’t expect to find anything. It’s just old age, I tell you. Just old age. Where do I even… what do I even do?
DOCTOR: Of course, Melvenia. I will be very gentle. And I’ll make it as quick as possible. Okay, let’s start with your back. Could you just stand up for me, if you’re able?
PATIENT: There. Now be careful. It creaks, you know? Like an old door. Don't go pulling or anything. Just...look. Is that what you do? Just look?
DOCTOR: Yes, I’m starting by just observing your posture and how you stand. I see a little bit of rounding in your lower back, which is common with age. Now, if you don’t mind, I’m going to gently feel along your spine. Just let me know if anything feels particularly uncomfortable. Okay, just a little pressure here… and here… How does that feel?
PATIENT: Ooh, that’s… not comfortable. It's not painful, exactly, but… tight. Very tight. It’s always tight. I just assumed it was… well, everything. Just getting old. And… don't press so hard. It creaks, you know? It feels like you’re going to break something. Just… gentle. Please.
DOCTOR: Of course, I apologize. I’ll be very gentle. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable at all. Okay, now let’s check your knees. I’m just going to gently feel around them. I’ll support your leg as I do this. Any discomfort with this?
PATIENT: Ooh, that one’s a little stiff. Just… stiff. It’s worse when it rains, you know? I told you. And… yes, that one feels a little… crunchy. It makes noises. Like… pebbles. Is that bad? Just… don’t bend it too much. I don’t want it to… pop. Just… leave it alone, really. It's just old age. Honestly. Are we done yet? I just want to get these papers signed.
DOCTOR: Okay, we’re done with the physical exam. You’ve been very patient, Melvenia, thank you. The stiffness and crepitus in your knees are common with age and wear and tear, and not necessarily a cause for immediate concern. However, the muscle guarding in your lower back and the discomfort with palpation suggest there may be some underlying inflammation or strain. The crunching sounds are also normal, but we should investigate the cause of the pain. Before we get to the paperwork, I’d like to get a slightly more detailed history. Just to cover all bases. Do you have any history of arthritis?
PATIENT: Arthritis? Oh, goodness. I don’t think so. My mother had something in her hands, I think. All twisted up and swollen. But I don’t have anything like that. Just… aches. Like I said. And stiffness. I don’t think I have arthritis. Doctor, honestly, I just want these papers signed. I have things to do. Are you going to make me stay here all day?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Melvenia. And I apologize if I’m taking up too much of your time. I'm just trying to be thorough. Given your history of years of back and knee pain, the muscle guarding I felt during the exam, and the fact that it's not improving with over-the-counter medication, I think it would be wise to get some X-rays of your lower back and knees. That would help me rule out any structural problems. Would you be willing to schedule those?
PATIENT: X-rays? Oh, goodness. More poking and prodding. And waiting. And… radiation. I don’t like radiation. Honestly, Doctor, this is getting ridiculous. I just want these papers signed, so I can get back to my life. Can’t you just… sign them? I’m sure everything is fine. It's just old age. I told you. I really, really don’t want to have to do any X-rays. Are you sure they’re absolutely necessary? I just want this over with. I have a book club meeting tonight.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Melvenia. And you are right, it may very well be just age-related changes. But as your doctor, I have a responsibility to rule out anything serious. X-rays would help me do that, and give you peace of mind. Given your discomfort, and the fact that this has been going on for so long, I strongly recommend them. It's a quick and relatively painless procedure. However, if you absolutely refuse the X-rays, I can sign the forms as they are, with the understanding that I haven't been able to fully assess your condition. But I would strongly advise you to follow up with me if your pain worsens or doesn't improve. What would you prefer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I just… I just want to go home. Fine. Fine, do the X-rays. But make it quick. And be gentle. And promise me it won’t take all day. Honestly, I just want this over with. I have a book club meeting. Is there anything else? Anything else you’re going to want to poke and prod? Just… tell me now. I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Okay, Melvenia. We’ll get the X-rays done, and I promise to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. We'll have to schedule an appointment with the radiology department, which is just down the hall. They'll do the imaging, and then we can review the results together. No, that's all the tests for now. No further poking and prodding, I promise. I just want to get a clear picture of what's going on so we can get you feeling better. Now, let's get you scheduled for those X-rays. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies. Just… old age. And a book club meeting tonight. Honestly, I hope this doesn’t take too long. And is it going to be expensive? I don’t have… well, I don’t have much money. I just want to get these papers signed, get some X-rays, and go home. Are you sure they really need to be done? Honestly. It’s just… aches.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, that’s good to know. And I understand your concerns about the cost. We do have a financial assistance program for patients who are uninsured or have limited income. We can explore those options for you once we have an estimate for the X-rays. I'll make sure we find a solution that works for you. And yes, while it's likely just age-related changes, the X-rays will give us peace of mind. It's always better to rule out anything serious, especially with chronic pain. Okay, I’ve scheduled you for X-rays tomorrow at 10:00 AM. The radiology department is just down the hall, and they’ll give you specific instructions when you arrive. Now, while we're waiting for the results, let's go ahead and get these forms completed. Do you have your glasses?
PATIENT: Glasses? Oh, goodness. Yes, here. Just… hurry, please. I have a book club meeting. And honestly, I'm starting to get a headache. This has taken long enough. Let's just get it over with. I just want these papers signed. It's just… old age.
DOCTOR: Okay, just one moment… everything looks good here. Alright, here you go. All signed and completed. Now, remember, if your pain worsens or you experience any new symptoms, please call the office right away. We'll follow up with you once the X-ray results are in. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No. No, that’s it. Just… thank you. And… thank you for not making me wait all day. Honestly. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a book club meeting. It’s just… old age, you know. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Melvenia. I'm glad we were able to get everything taken care of. Please drive safely and enjoy your book club meeting. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
