DOCTOR: Good morning, Louine. Welcome to the clinic. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Finco. Now, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about my foot. It’s been…troublesome. A sore, really. A nasty one. It just won’t heal. And frankly, I don’t have time for this nonsense. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. A sore that won’t heal can be very frustrating. I understand. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Frustrating is an understatement. It’s on my…well, the side of my foot. Near my little toe, I suppose. It started as just a little scratch, really. I didn’t think much of it. But then it got…bigger. And now it’s red and…well, it hurts. I’ve been putting ointment on it, the kind my daughter sent, but it doesn’t seem to be helping. Honestly, I suspect it’s just one of those things the young people exaggerate the importance of.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started as a small scratch on the side of your foot, near your little toe, and has become red and painful despite using ointment. You mentioned your daughter sent the ointment…do you recall what kind it was?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Names escape me these days. It was in a silver tube, I believe. Some fancy antibacterial cream. She’s always sending me things from the internet. Says it’s “the best.” Honestly, I wouldn’t know good cream from…well, from anything else. It smelled rather…floral. And it was expensive, I’ll tell you that much. She keeps telling me I have to watch my “sugar,” but I like my sweets!
DOCTOR: Okay, a floral-scented antibacterial cream, and your daughter is concerned about your sugar levels. Thank you. Now, besides the pain, have you noticed any other changes to your foot?
PATIENT: Changes? Well…it feels warm sometimes. Not feverish, exactly. Just…warm. And it’s a little…swollen, I suppose. Not terribly, but enough to notice when I put my shoes on. And my shoes…they don’t fit quite as well anymore. Which is ridiculous! I have perfectly good shoes. They’ve just…shrunk, I suppose. Everything these days is inferior quality.
DOCTOR: Alright, warmth and some swelling, making your shoes feel a little tighter. And you've been using this cream for how long now?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think…about two weeks, maybe? Possibly three. Time does fly when one is busy, you know. I’ve been trying to keep it covered with bandages, but they get damp and…well, it’s just a bother. My granddaughter usually does it for me, but she's away at that…college, is it? Learning about…things. It's all very modern.
DOCTOR: Okay, two to three weeks of using the cream. And you’ve had your granddaughter help with the bandages, which is good. Now, Louine, have you noticed any drainage or pus coming from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? Pus? Oh, dear. Let me see……Well, now that you mention it, there has been a little bit of…moisture. A yellowish tinge, perhaps. I thought it was just from the bandage, you know, getting sweaty. It’s been rather warm lately. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to require changing the bandage more frequently. It’s quite messy, frankly.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for telling me. It’s important to know about any drainage. Now, I’m going to take a quick look at the sore, if that’s alright with you. It will just be a quick examination to get a better idea of what we’re dealing with. Could you please tell me if this is painful when I touch here?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, get it over with then. I haven’t got all day. And be gentle, young lady! I don’t appreciate unnecessary poking and prodding. Yes, that’s…tender. Very tender. Don’t press too hard! It feels…raw. Like a scrape that won't heal, but worse. Much worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, Louine. I see some redness around the sore, and it does appear a bit raw. There's also some drainage present. It feels warm to the touch, which is concerning. Based on what you've told me, and the examination, it sounds like you may have an infection developing. We need to address this quickly to prevent it from getting worse. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Goodness, no. I’ve never had an allergy in my life. I used to eat everything. Shellfish, nuts, exotic fruits…you name it. My mother always said I had a cast-iron stomach. Though, I did have a rather unpleasant reaction to that new laundry detergent my daughter sent. Made my skin itch terribly. But that wasn’t an allergy, I suspect. It was just…inferior quality, like everything else these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sensitivity to a laundry detergent, but no known medication allergies. That’s helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think……Well, there's the little blue pill for my blood pressure, of course. Doctor Henderson prescribed that years ago. And I take a calcium tablet every morning, for my bones. My daughter insists. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take that ibuprofen. The pink one. But that's just when it really hurts, you know? Nothing regular. Mostly just the blue pill and the calcium.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a blood pressure medication, a calcium supplement, and ibuprofen when needed for arthritis. Thank you for letting me know. Based on everything we’ve discussed and the examination, I believe you have an infected sore on your foot. We need to get that treated with antibiotics. I'm going to prescribe an oral antibiotic. We'll also need to keep the wound clean and covered. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Antibiotics, you say? Hmph. Well, I suppose if that’s what you think is necessary. I do want this sorted out. I have a garden party to attend next month, you know. Can’t be hobbling around with a sore foot. Will it be one of those bitter pills? I hate bitter pills. And will it interfere with my…digestive system? I have a very delicate constitution.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns. The antibiotic I’m prescribing is generally well-tolerated. It's not typically a bitter pill, and we can discuss strategies to minimize any potential digestive upset, such as taking it with food. I'll write the prescription now, and the pharmacist can provide you with detailed instructions. We'll also need to keep the wound clean. I recommend washing it gently with soap and water twice a day, and then covering it with a clean, dry bandage. I also want you to monitor the area for any signs of worsening, such as increased redness, swelling, pain, or pus. If you notice any of those signs, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Hmph. Twice a day, you say? And with soap and water? That sounds rather…harsh. My grandmother used to use chamomile tea, you know. But alright, I’ll try your method. And what about this garden party? Will I be able to wear my good sandals? They have an open toe, which is essential for proper ventilation. And will the antibiotic make me…sleepy? I absolutely must be alert. It's a very important event.
DOCTOR: Chamomile tea is lovely, but for an infection, soap and water is best. As for the garden party, I’m hopeful you’ll be able to wear your good sandals! The antibiotic shouldn’t make you sleepy, but everyone reacts differently. If you do feel drowsy, please don’t drive or operate any heavy machinery. The most important thing is to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed, even if you start feeling better before it’s finished. That will help ensure the infection is completely cleared. Now, I’ll write up the prescription and also a note for you outlining the wound care instructions. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a week to check on your progress. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: A week, you say? Very well. As long as it doesn't interfere with my bridge club. Tuesdays are sacred, you know. And be sure to write down clear instructions. I’m not good with…modern handwriting. All these loops and swirls! My granddaughter says I have “old-fashioned penmanship.” Honestly, I don’t see the problem. It’s perfectly legible. Just…make sure it’s easy to follow. And don't make me come back early. I have things to do, young lady!
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ve written everything in large, clear print. The instructions are straightforward – wash the wound twice a day with soap and water, cover it with a clean bandage, and take the antibiotic as prescribed. We’ve scheduled your follow-up appointment for next Tuesday at the same time, unless that doesn't work with your bridge club. If it does conflict, please call the office, and we can reschedule. I want to be sure you get better as quickly as possible so you can enjoy your garden party. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Just…try not to prescribe any more of those "floral-scented" ointments. They're a waste of money. And tell your staff to be more punctual. I waited fifteen minutes just to see you! Honestly, the inefficiency of modern healthcare is appalling. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll make a note about the ointments and speak with the staff about the wait time. Thank you for your patience, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Enjoy your garden, and I look forward to seeing you next week. .
