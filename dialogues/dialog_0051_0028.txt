DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Glazewski. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t quit, and my heart… it hasn't been the best lately. The nurse said I should come in.
DOCTOR: Alright, a cough and some heart concerns. Thank you for letting me know. Let’s start with this cough. How long have you been dealing with it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It started… back in late June, I believe. Maybe the first week of June? It comes and goes, but it's been pretty steady the last couple of weeks, I'd say. It’s mostly dry, not much… you know… bringing anything up. Just a tickle and then a little… hack. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, roughly six to eight weeks now, mostly dry. And has anything seemed to make it worse – like certain times of day, being in a specific place, or doing particular activities?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it seems worse when I lie down, definitely. I have to prop myself up with a couple of pillows to sleep. And it's a bit worse in the evenings. I do a lot of cooking, of course, but I haven’t noticed it being worse during cooking. Just… generally worse when I’m trying to rest. Oh! And dust. A little bit worse if there’s a lot of dust around. I try to keep things clean, but you know… an old house.
DOCTOR: An old house, yes, I understand. So, worse when lying down, evenings, and with dust exposure. Okay. And you mentioned your heart hasn't been the best lately. Can you tell me a little more about what you've been experiencing with that?
PATIENT: Well, I get short of breath just walking around the house, really. Not like I can’t do it, but I have to stop and catch my breath more than I used to. And my ankles… they swell up something awful by the end of the day. They’ve been like that for… oh, a good six months now, maybe longer. My doctor before… Doctor Ramirez, she said it was my heart. Something about it not pumping as well as it should. I’ve been taking some pills for it, but… I can’t quite remember the name.
DOCTOR: Let me just take a quick look at your records here… Ah, yes, Doctor Ramirez. I see here you've been prescribed Furosemide and Lisinopril. Are you still taking those medications?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes. Those are the ones! Furosemide… and Lisinopril. I take them every morning, with breakfast. I try to be very good about it. Sometimes I forget on Sundays, maybe, but mostly I remember. They help a little with the swelling, I think. Not a lot, but a little. And I haven't had to go to the hospital, so… that’s good, right?
DOCTOR: That’s very good, yes. Consistent medication use is important. Okay, so you’ve been on Furosemide and Lisinopril for some time now, with some benefit to the swelling. And you’re experiencing shortness of breath with activity, in addition to the swelling and cough. Do you experience any chest pain with this shortness of breath, or at any other time?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Not really. It's just… like I’m trying to breathe through a straw, sometimes. And it's more when I walk upstairs, or try to carry something heavy. Not just walking on a flat surface. And it doesn't feel like… a tight pain, or anything. Just… winded. And the cough, of course, makes it harder to catch my breath. It's a lot, isn't it? I’m probably just an old woman falling apart.
DOCTOR: It doesn’t sound like you’re “falling apart” at all, Nadene. It sounds like we have a few things to investigate. Alright. Before we do a physical exam, let's quickly go through some other things. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. And no chills or night sweats. I sleep pretty soundly, actually. Unless the cough keeps me up, of course. But then I just get up and have a little cup of chamomile tea. It helps calm me down. I haven't felt sick, sick, you know? Just… tired. And this cough… it just won’t go away.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or night sweats, just fatigue and the persistent cough. Good. And have you noticed any recent changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Well… my appetite isn’t what it used to be, I suppose. I don’t eat as much as I did when I was younger, naturally. But I haven’t lost any weight, not intentionally. I actually think I might have gained a little, but that’s probably just from all the good food my daughter brings over. She worries about me, you see. She’s a good girl.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear. It's good to have family support. Alright, Nadene, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, and also check your ankles. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’m ready. Just… be gentle with my ankles, please? They’re a little tender.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Okay, let’s start with your heart. I’m going to listen with my stethoscope. Just breathe normally. I hear a slight murmur, which has been documented previously. I also notice some mild crackles in the lower lobes of both lungs. Now, let's check your ankles. There is some moderate pitting edema bilaterally. Alright, that gives us some good information. I'd like to order a chest X-ray and a blood test – a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel – just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. X-ray and blood tests… alright. I trust your judgment. Will that take long? And… will I get the results quickly? My daughter is coming to visit next week, and I’d like to know what’s going on before she gets here. She worries so much.
DOCTOR: We can get those tests done right away. The X-ray will only take a few minutes, and the blood draw won't take long either. The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back, so we should have them before your daughter arrives. I’ll have the nurse schedule those for you now. In the meantime, I want to continue the Furosemide and Lisinopril as prescribed. And I’m going to prescribe you an albuterol inhaler to help with the cough and shortness of breath. It can help open up your airways. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Albuterol inhaler… alright. I’ve used an inhaler before, years ago, but I can’t quite remember how to use it properly. Could the nurse show me? And… is that something serious, all this? The crackles and the swelling and the cough… it sounds frightening when you say it like that.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, the nurse will definitely show you how to use the inhaler correctly. It's important to get the technique right. As for whether it's serious… it's good that we're investigating. The crackles in your lungs could indicate some fluid buildup, which is often associated with heart failure, as we suspected. The swelling in your ankles is also consistent with that. However, we need the X-ray and blood tests to confirm that diagnosis and rule out other possibilities. It's important not to jump to conclusions right now. We'll have a clearer picture once we have the results. I’m going to refer you to a cardiologist for a more specialized evaluation. They can perform an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of the heart, and help us determine the best course of treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… yes, that sounds wise. I always did trust Doctor Ramirez, and she would have wanted me to see a specialist, I’m sure. An echocardiogram… that’s the one with the… the gel? Yes, I remember. It doesn’t hurt, does it? And… will I need to change anything else? About my diet, or how much I walk? I try to walk around the house, but I get tired so easily. I don't want to make things worse.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s the one. It doesn’t hurt at all, it’s completely painless. As for changes to your diet or activity… let's hold off on making any drastic changes until we have the results of the tests and the cardiologist's evaluation. However, it’s generally a good idea to limit your salt intake and avoid strenuous activity. Continue walking around the house as much as you can tolerate, but listen to your body and stop if you feel tired or short of breath. The nurse will give you a list of low-sodium foods to avoid. In the meantime, try to get plenty of rest and drink plenty of fluids. I'm going to write up a referral to Dr. Chen, a very good cardiologist in the area. The nurse will help you schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Dr. Chen… alright. No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. Just… try not to worry too much, you said? I suppose I'll just wait for the tests and see what the cardiologist says. Thank you for taking such good care of me. I really appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nadene. And you’re right to ask, I don’t want you worrying too much. We are taking all the right steps to figure this out. The nurse will go over everything with you again before you leave, and she can answer any questions you might have forgotten to ask. We will get to the bottom of this, and we'll work together to get you feeling better. Don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe shortness of breath or chest pain. I’ll see you after your tests, and we’ll discuss the results. Have a good day, and please, take care of yourself.
PATIENT: .
