DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Kovtun, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Look, I just need to know what the tests said, if that’s alright? I’ve got a pretty tight schedule today.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, I understand your time is valuable. Though, a proper consultation requires some… detail. But, very well. The tests… showed some irregularities. Can you remind me why you requested these tests in the first place?
PATIENT: Irregularities? Okay. Um… I was just feeling really tired all the time, even after sleeping. And kinda dizzy. It started a few months ago, maybe February? I just wanted to rule things out, you know? I didn’t want it to be anything serious.
DOCTOR: February, you say. And has this tiredness been… constant since then?
PATIENT: Not constant, exactly. It comes and goes. Some days I feel okay, almost normal. But then it’ll hit me, and I’m wiped out for a day or two. It's… unpredictable. Does that make sense? I don’t really track it, honestly. I just… feel it.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable… Right. And this dizziness, is it associated with anything specific?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really. Sometimes it happens when I stand up too fast, but not always. Other times it's just... there. Like the room is swaying a little. It hasn’t been bad enough to fall or anything, just… annoying. I thought maybe it was just low blood sugar, so I started eating more, but it didn't really help.
DOCTOR: Eating more… Interesting. Do you experience any… other symptoms alongside the fatigue and dizziness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… I’ve been getting headaches, on and off. Not migraines, just… dull aches, mostly in the back of my head. And… I guess I’ve been a little more irritable than usual? My friends keep telling me I’m being grumpy. I don’t know if that counts.
DOCTOR: Irritability… and headaches. I see. Do these headaches coincide with the fatigue, or are they separate occurrences?
PATIENT: Usually when I’m really tired, yeah, the headache’s there too. It’s like a heavy pressure, kinda all over my head. But sometimes I’ll get a headache even when I’m feeling okay-ish. It’s… complicated. Look, I’m not a doctor, I’m just telling you how it feels. Is this going to take much longer? I really need to get going soon.
DOCTOR: Complicated, yes. Well, Ms. Kovtun, based on the tests and your… description, it could be a number of things. We need to rule out some possibilities. Have you had any recent changes in your diet, exercise routine, or stress levels?
PATIENT: Stress? Yeah, a little. Work’s been hectic, lots of deadlines. I haven’t changed my diet or exercise much, though. I try to eat healthy, and I go for a run a couple of times a week, when I have the energy. It's been hard to keep up with it lately, obviously. Everything just feels…off. Is it something serious? You can just tell me straight, I don't need details right now.
DOCTOR: “Serious” is a very subjective term. Your blood work shows some mild anemia, which could explain the fatigue. However, given the dizziness and headaches, we should also investigate the possibility of… other contributing factors. I’m going to need to perform a neurological exam to rule out anything more concerning. It’s a simple procedure, but it's necessary.
PATIENT: Neurological exam? What does that involve? I really wasn't expecting a physical exam. I thought these tests would just tell us something. I have a meeting in two hours. Can it wait? I mean, is it urgent urgent?
DOCTOR: Ms. Kovtun, you came to me seeking answers. A proper diagnosis requires a thorough examination. It’s not simply about running tests and hoping for the best. Yes, it involves checking your reflexes, balance, and coordination. It will take approximately fifteen minutes. It’s not something I can simply dismiss. And frankly, given your symptoms, it is prudent to investigate this further promptly. Do you want to proceed, or would you prefer to seek another opinion?
PATIENT: Fine. Fifteen minutes. But you have to promise you’ll be quick. And… try not to poke me too much. I hate needles, and I'm already stressed enough. Just… let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit here, and I will begin. First, I need to check your ears… it's a standard part of the exam. Lean forward slightly…
