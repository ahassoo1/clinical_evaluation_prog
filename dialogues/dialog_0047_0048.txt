DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my wife, really. She’s the one who made the appointment. I’ve been… not quite myself lately, I suppose. Little things. Forget where I put things, or… what I was saying mid-sentence. Not a lot, mind you. Just enough to bother her. She says it’s “episodes of confusion,” whatever that means. I feel fine, mostly.
DOCTOR: "Episodes of confusion," is a perfectly reasonable way to describe it, Mr. Lason. It's good your wife is observant. And it's certainly best to get these things checked out. "Not quite yourself" can mean a lot of things, of course. Let's try to be a bit more specific. When did you first start noticing these… difficulties?
PATIENT: Difficulties… yes, that’s a good way of putting it. Hmm. Let me think. It’s been… oh, maybe three, four months now? It started subtly, I suppose. Just little slips of the mind. Like going into the kitchen for something and completely blanking on what I went in there for. Then, last month, I… well, I almost put the cat food in the fridge. My wife nearly had a fit. It’s not every day, thankfully. But it’s happening more and more.
DOCTOR: Alright, three to four months, increasing frequency. And specifically, memory lapses – forgetting why you entered a room, misplacing items. Has this been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… well, I've been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. Nothing drastic. Just… a little sluggish. And, now that I think about it, I haven’t been sleeping as well. Waking up in the middle of the night for no reason. But I'm an old man, Doctor. Old men don't sleep well. It's just part of getting older, isn't it? I wouldn't necessarily call that a symptom.
DOCTOR: While fatigue and disrupted sleep can be part of aging, they are also symptoms that can indicate other issues, Mr. Lason. It’s good you’re mentioning them. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite… no, not really. I eat like a horse, always have. My wife complains I eat too much, actually. She tries to get me to eat more vegetables. A waste of perfectly good rice, if you ask me. But no, I haven't lost my appetite. Still enjoy a good meal. Plenty of fish, you know. Good for the brain, they say. Though it doesn’t seem to be helping much, does it?
DOCTOR: Alright. No change in appetite. Good. Now, have you had any difficulty with your vision, or speaking?
PATIENT: Vision… well, my eyes aren’t what they used to be, naturally. Need reading glasses now. But no sudden changes, no blurry spots or anything like that. And speaking? No, I can still yell at the television just fine, thank you very much. My wife would tell you I have no trouble speaking. Sometimes too much trouble, if you ask her. But no, nothing wrong with my speech. Clear as a bell. I don’t slur or anything.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you experiencing any weakness or numbness on either side of your body?
PATIENT: Weakness or numbness… no. Both legs work perfectly well, thank you. Still manage to get around the garden and do a bit of tiling now and then. A little slower, maybe, but perfectly functional. No tingling, no dropping things. Just… this forgetfulness. It’s really quite irritating, to be honest. My wife is making a much bigger deal out of it than I am. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: It’s good your wife is attentive, Mr. Lason, and it's wise to take her concerns seriously. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions – diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, well, let me see. I had a bit of a scare with my heart a few years back, maybe ten years ago? They said it was just some palpitations, nothing too serious. Put me on some pills for a while, but I stopped taking them after a bit. Didn't seem to be doing much good, and I didn’t like the way they made me feel. Blood pressure… I think it's been a little high sometimes, but nothing they ever really bothered with. And diabetes? No, never. My wife makes sure I get plenty of rice. Keeps the blood sugar up, she says. Otherwise, I’m a pretty healthy man for my age. Never been one for fancy medicines.
DOCTOR: Alright. History of palpitations, briefly treated. Occasional elevated blood pressure. And no known diabetes. Any surgeries, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. Just my appendix, when I was a boy. A long time ago, back in Cambodia. And, oh, I had a small mole removed from my back a few years back. Nothing major. The doctor said it was just a precaution. It didn't hurt or anything. That’s it, I think. Nothing else. I’ve always been lucky, never had much need for doctors.
DOCTOR: And what about your family history, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Family history… well, that’s a tricky one. My parents… they both passed away a long time ago. Back in Cambodia, you know. It was a difficult time. Not much talk of family medical history back then. Lots of farming, lots of hard work. They both lived to a good age, I suppose. My mother… she had a bit of trouble with her memory towards the end, but we didn't really know what it was. Just… old age. No one really talked about these things. Didn't have much in the way of doctors or hospitals where we were.
DOCTOR: Alright. Limited family history available. Now, are you currently taking any medications, herbal supplements, or vitamins?
PATIENT: No, no medications. I told you, I don’t like taking pills. Waste of money, if you ask me. And herbal supplements? No. I’m a simple man, Doctor. I eat my rice, I drink my water. That’s all I need. My wife tries to get me to take some vitamins sometimes, something for my bones, but I always refuse. I get enough sun when I'm working in the garden.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Just to confirm, no medications, no supplements, and no vitamins. Now, let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none that I know of. I eat everything. My wife always worries about me trying new things at the market, but I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can handle spicy food, too. She thinks that’s terrible, says it’ll ruin my stomach. But no, no allergies. I'm a pretty robust man, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, Mr. Lason, I’m going to ask you a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife would kill me if I even thought about it. She says it’s terrible for your health, ruins your lungs. I used to see some of the men in the village smoke, but I always thought it was a foolish habit. No, I've always preferred fresh air.
DOCTOR: Alright. Non-smoker. And how about alcohol, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Alcohol… well, I might have a small glass of rice wine with my wife on special occasions. Nothing fancy, you understand. Just a little something to celebrate. Mostly for her, actually. I don't really care for it much myself, gives me a headache. But no, I don't drink regularly. Not a drinker, not by any stretch of the imagination.
DOCTOR: Alright. Occasional rice wine, minimal consumption. Now, one final question about lifestyle, Mr. Lason. Can you describe your typical daily routine?
PATIENT: Typical daily routine… well, I wake up, have a bit of breakfast with my wife – usually rice, of course. Then I work in the garden for a few hours, tending to the vegetables. Sometimes I do a bit of tiling work, if I have a job lined up. Lunch is… well, more rice. Then I might take a nap. In the afternoon, I help my wife with the cooking, or just relax. Dinner is… you guessed it, rice. Then we watch a bit of television before going to bed. It's a simple life, Doctor. A very simple life.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. Thank you for that detailed information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. This will involve checking your vital signs, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment to check your reflexes and balance. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical examination? Oh. Well… I suppose so. I haven’t been to a doctor in a long time, as you know. It’s just… I don’t like being poked and prodded. But if you think it’s necessary… alright. Go ahead. But be gentle, please. I'm an old man.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let's start with your blood pressure. 148 over 92. A little elevated, as we might expect. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Heart rate is regular, but there's a slight murmur. Not immediately concerning, but we’ll want to monitor it. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished, but within normal limits for your age. And finally, I’d like you to stand up and walk a few steps for me. Gait is slightly unsteady, but no significant abnormalities. Alright, Mr. Lason. Thank you for your cooperation. Now, based on your history and this examination, I have some initial thoughts, but I’d like to order some blood tests to get a clearer picture. Specifically, I want to check your thyroid function, vitamin B12 levels, and rule out any underlying infections. We will also do a CBC and CMP.
PATIENT: Blood tests… oh dear. More poking and prodding, I suppose. Well, if you think it's necessary, Doctor. I don’t like the thought of it, but I’ll do what you think is best. What will the tests show, exactly? And how long will I have to wait for the results? I hope it’s not too long. I have a tiling job lined up next week, and I need to be in good shape for that.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will help us to identify any underlying causes for your memory lapses and fatigue, Mr. Lason. We're looking for things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or any signs of infection. It’s a fairly standard panel, and shouldn't take too long. The lab usually gets the results back within three to five business days. In the meantime, I recommend that you avoid driving long distances or operating heavy machinery. And it would be best to avoid strenuous activity until we have a clearer understanding of what's going on. I also suggest you drink plenty of fluids and get adequate rest. I will contact you as soon as the results are available to discuss them and formulate a treatment plan. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No strenuous activity… that tiling job… oh dear. This is going to be difficult. No, I don’t think so. I suppose I understand. Plenty of fluids and rest… yes. My wife will be happy to hear that, she’s always telling me to rest more. But… what if it’s something serious, Doctor? What if it’s… well, you know… my memory? Is it possible it’s something… permanent?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Mr. Lason. While your symptoms are concerning, it’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis. There are many potential causes for memory lapses and fatigue, and not all of them are permanent. The blood tests will help us to narrow down the possibilities. We will rule out the more serious conditions first, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, infections, and certain neurological conditions. If those tests are normal, we may consider further investigation, such as an MRI of the brain. I want to assure you that we will explore all possible causes and develop a treatment plan that is tailored to your specific needs. It’s important to remain optimistic and focus on getting a clear diagnosis. Do you have any other concerns that you would like to discuss at this time?
PATIENT: An MRI… oh dear, that sounds… unpleasant. But alright. If that’s what’s necessary. My wife will be relieved to know you’re considering all options. No, I don't think I have any other concerns… not at the moment. Just… please, let me know as soon as you have the results. This uncertainty is… unsettling. And please, try not to scare my wife too much. She worries enough as it is. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Lason. I understand your concerns, and I will do my best to keep you and your wife informed throughout this process. I will personally contact you as soon as the results are available, and we can discuss them together. I will also make a note to be sensitive to your wife's anxieties. Here are the lab requisition forms and some information about the blood tests. Please take these with you. You can schedule the blood tests at any convenient lab. If you have any questions or concerns before our next appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. I wish you all the best, Mr. Lason. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I hope… I hope everything turns out alright. .
