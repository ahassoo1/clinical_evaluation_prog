DOCTOR: Good morning, Esthela. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. I’m here because I’ve begun seeing someone, and I thought it prudent to have a general check-up before things progress. One must be certain, you understand. It wouldn’t do to introduce any… complications.
DOCTOR: That's very responsible of you, Esthela. A good idea to get a baseline check-up. We’ll certainly do that. To start, can you tell me a bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Well, I generally maintain a very healthy lifestyle. I watch what I eat – mostly. And I do try to get some exercise, when I can find the time. It's difficult, of course, with a husband who doesn't quite appreciate the importance of… well, everything. But I haven’t been seriously ill in years. Just the usual seasonal… inconveniences. Do you need specifics? Because I do remember the dates of every cold I’ve had since 1998.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And no, I don’t need every date since 1998, although your diligence is appreciated! Let's focus on the past few years. Have you had any major illnesses, surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, nothing of that sort. I had my gallbladder removed… oh, goodness, nearly fifteen years ago now. It was a rather unpleasant experience, but I recovered beautifully. Other than that, just the usual check-ups with my primary care physician. Though, frankly, I always felt she didn’t take my concerns seriously enough. That’s why I decided to come here. I’m hoping for a more… thorough assessment. Do you specialize in preventative care, Doctor? It’s terribly important, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do, Esthela. Preventative care is a big part of my practice. It’s excellent that you’re prioritizing that. And I understand your concern about feeling unheard; I'll certainly do my best to address all your questions and concerns today. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, family history. A rather bleak picture, I’m afraid. My mother suffered from hypertension, terribly high blood pressure. And my paternal grandmother… well, she succumbed to diabetes, a rather messy affair. My aunt, on my mother’s side, had breast cancer, though she’s thankfully in remission now. And my husband’s father… heart disease, naturally. Men and their hearts, always a problem. It’s rather discouraging, isn’t it? One feels quite… pre-disposed to misfortune, considering. Do you think genetics are entirely to blame, Doctor? Or is lifestyle a more significant factor? I do believe in taking responsibility for one’s own health, despite the… challenges.
DOCTOR: That is quite a bit to consider, Esthela. It sounds like you're right to be proactive, given your family history. It’s rarely entirely genetics, and you're absolutely right to focus on lifestyle factors as well. They play a huge role. Let’s move on to your current medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a small dose of lisinopril for my blood pressure, prescribed by my previous physician. And occasionally, I’ll take ibuprofen for a headache. Nothing… extravagant, you understand. I prefer to avoid pharmaceuticals whenever possible. And as for allergies… well, I have a slight sensitivity to dust mites, but it’s hardly debilitating. Mostly just a bit of sneezing. I’m not one of those people with a long list of ailments, Doctor. I consider myself quite fortunate, all things considered. Though, one must be vigilant. It’s so easy for things to… escalate, isn’t it? Do you find that to be true?
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Vigilance is always a good approach. We’ll keep an eye on things. Now, to get a better picture of your overall health, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What precisely does that entail, Doctor? I assure you, I lead a perfectly respectable life. We attend church regularly, and I volunteer at the local library. Are you inquiring about… questionable habits? Because I can confidently state that I do not smoke, drink excessively, or engage in any… unsavory activities. I find the question rather… intrusive, frankly. Is it necessary for a general check-up? Perhaps we could move on to more pertinent matters? Like… screening tests?
DOCTOR: I apologize if the question felt intrusive, Esthela. “Social history” simply refers to factors like your occupation, living situation, diet, and exercise habits – things that can impact your health. It’s not about judging lifestyle choices. It’s about getting a complete picture. For example, what do you do for work?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I am a Personal Service Manager, All Other. It’s… rather vague, I admit. It involves coordinating various services for clients. Essentially, I manage people who manage people. It requires a great deal of diplomacy, I assure you. And a firm hand. One must maintain control, you understand. It’s a stressful position, to be frank, but I am quite good at it. It keeps me… occupied. And it provides a certain level of… financial stability. We live in a rather nice suburban home, with my husband, of course. He’s retired now, mostly spends his time watching television. Does that suffice, Doctor? I trust we are not delving into excessively personal matters?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Esthela. Thank you. It sounds like a demanding role, and it's good you're able to maintain stability. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, let’s quickly review any symptoms you may be experiencing right now, even if they seem minor. Are you experiencing any pain, fatigue, changes in appetite or weight, or any other unusual symptoms?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… I have been feeling a touch more fatigued lately. It could be the stress at work, of course. And the weather has been rather… oppressive. But it’s nothing debilitating, Doctor. Just a general sense of… weariness. And my appetite has been slightly diminished, though I suspect that’s due to the heat. I haven’t lost any weight, as far as I can tell. My husband does tend to comment on everything, but I rarely take his observations seriously. He’s rather… oblivious, you see. Is it concerning, Doctor? Should I be… alarmed? I do prefer to be prepared for the worst, you understand. One must be realistic.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and decreased appetite can be caused by many things, Esthela. It's good you're aware of these changes. We'll definitely investigate further. Let’s start with a physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a general assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… adequate. Though I must warn you, Doctor, I am rather sensitive. Please be gentle. And do try not to startle me. I do dislike unexpected movements. It’s perfectly alright to explain each step beforehand, if you don’t mind. One prefers to be informed, you understand. It’s less… unsettling. Shall we proceed?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. I’ll be very gentle and explain everything as I go. We'll take it slow. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. It helps me hear how things are functioning. Just breathe normally. Deep breath in… and out… Very good. Your heart sounds regular, but I do detect a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily concerning, but we’ll want to monitor it. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 142/90. Again, not alarming, but something we'll keep an eye on, especially with your family history. Now, I'm just going to listen to your lungs. Lungs sound clear. Okay, everything seems okay so far. Now, I'm just going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Oh dear. I do have a rather… vivid imagination, Doctor. Are you certain it’s necessary? I always feel rather… vulnerable during those sorts of tests. And what precisely are you looking for? One prefers to understand the purpose of each procedure, you understand. It’s less… disconcerting. Though, if you insist… proceed, I suppose. But please be gentle. And do try not to startle me. I do have a tendency to… flinch.
DOCTOR: Of course, Esthela. We can certainly take it slow. Checking your reflexes helps me assess your nervous system function. It's a very quick test. I'll use this little hammer to gently tap on your tendons, and I'm just looking for a normal response. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Good, that’s a normal response. And now the other knee. Also normal. Now, let’s just quickly check your feet. And everything feels okay there. Okay, everything seems within normal limits. Given your fatigue, slightly elevated blood pressure and murmur, I’d like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what's going on. It will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We should also schedule an EKG to further evaluate your heart. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Blood work and an EKG… goodness. It sounds rather… extensive. Are you certain it’s absolutely necessary, Doctor? I do dislike needles, you see. And the EKG… will it be uncomfortable? Will I be required to… undress? I do prefer to maintain a certain level of… decorum, you understand. Though, if it’s absolutely crucial for my health… I suppose I can endure it. But please, do be gentle. And explain each step beforehand. One prefers to be prepared, you understand. Perhaps we could discuss the specifics of the blood work first? What precisely will it entail? And how long will it take? I do have a rather busy schedule, you see.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Esthela. I understand your concerns. We’ll take things slowly and make sure you’re comfortable. The blood work is quite routine. It will involve a small sample of blood drawn from your arm. It will take just a few minutes to draw, and then the lab will analyze it. The results typically take a few days to come back. As for the EKG, it's a non-invasive test where we place small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs to measure the electrical activity of your heart. You will need to undress to the waist, but we’ll provide a gown for your comfort. It doesn't hurt at all – it’s just a recording device. It takes about 10-15 minutes. We’ll schedule both tests for the same visit if you’d like, or we can do them separately. And I'll make sure the technicians are aware of your concerns so they can be extra gentle. How does that sound?
PATIENT: The same visit… goodness. It sounds rather… overwhelming. Perhaps it’s best to do them separately. One needs to… pace oneself, you understand. And I do require time to… mentally prepare. Yes, let’s schedule the blood work first. And then, after I’ve had time to… recover, we can schedule the EKG. And please, do ensure the technician is… gentle. I do have a rather sensitive constitution, you see. And I do dislike unexpected movements. Are there any specific instructions I need to follow before the blood work? Should I fast? Should I avoid caffeine? One prefers to be prepared, you understand. And do let me know the cost beforehand. I do prefer to maintain a certain level of… financial prudence, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Esthela. We will schedule the blood work first, and we'll do the EKG another day. I understand needing to pace yourself, and I’ll make sure to note your sensitivities on the chart. Yes, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood work. That means no food or drinks, except for water. You should also avoid caffeine for at least 24 hours before the test. I’ll have the receptionist give you a form with the specific instructions and the estimated cost. Medicare should cover a significant portion of the costs, but it’s always good to have an idea beforehand. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… adequate. Fasting and avoiding caffeine… it’s rather inconvenient, but I suppose one must endure certain… inconveniences for the sake of one’s health. And I appreciate you informing me about Medicare coverage. It’s rather reassuring. Now, Doctor, if you don't mind me asking… do you think this fatigue could be related to… the new relationship? It’s rather unsettling, you see. One tends to… overthink things, you understand. And the stress of… forming a connection can be rather… taxing. It’s just… a thought. Perhaps I’m simply being… irrational. But one does prefer to consider all possibilities, you understand. Before resorting to… medical explanations. Though, of course, I appreciate you taking the time to investigate. It’s rather… comforting.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid point, Esthela. Forming a new relationship can be incredibly stressful and emotionally taxing, and that can certainly manifest as fatigue. It's good you're aware of that possibility. We'll rule out any underlying medical causes with the blood work and EKG, but it's important to acknowledge the emotional component as well. If the tests come back normal, we can discuss strategies for managing stress and coping with the emotional demands of your new relationship. Perhaps some mindfulness exercises or talking to a therapist could be helpful. For now, let’s focus on getting those tests scheduled. Once we have the results, we’ll have a clearer picture and can discuss the best course of action. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… adequate. Focusing on the tests first… it’s rather… pragmatic. And the idea of mindfulness exercises… it’s… intriguing. Though I confess, I’m rather skeptical of such things. But I’m willing to… consider it. Very well, Doctor. Please proceed with scheduling the blood work. And do let me know the earliest possible appointment time. I do have a rather busy schedule, you see. And please, ensure the technician is… gentle. I do have a rather sensitive constitution, you understand. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… patience. It’s rather reassuring to know that someone is… listening.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Esthela. I’m happy to help. Let me see… We have an opening next Tuesday at 9:00 AM. Would that work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 9:00 AM… Yes, that will… suffice. 9:00 AM on Tuesday. Please note my sensitivities on the chart, Doctor. And do ensure the technician is… gentle. I do have a rather sensitive constitution, you understand. Is there anything else I need to know? Any specific preparations I need to make beyond the fasting and avoiding caffeine? Any… warnings I should be aware of? One prefers to be prepared, you understand.
DOCTOR: No, Esthela, that’s all for now. Just remember to fast for 8-12 hours before the test and avoid caffeine. Wear comfortable clothing with easy access to your arm for the blood draw. And please, don’t hesitate to let the technician know if you’re feeling anxious or uncomfortable at any time. The receptionist will give you a form with all the instructions, and she can answer any further questions you might have. I’ll see you next Tuesday at 9:00 AM. In the meantime, please try to get some rest and manage your stress levels. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that will be all. Thank you for your… patience. And for listening. It’s rather reassuring to know that someone is… taking my concerns seriously. I do appreciate it. Very well. I shall see you next Tuesday at 9:00 AM. Good day, Doctor.
