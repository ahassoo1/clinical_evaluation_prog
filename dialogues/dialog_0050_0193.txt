DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. The pleasure is all mine. Well, it’s… a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I’ve been having… a lot of gas. More than usual, you understand. It’s… quite disruptive.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It comes on… unexpectedly. And it’s… loud. It makes socializing… difficult. I work at the burger place, you see, and… well, you can imagine. It’s not good for business, this. And it’s been happening for maybe… three weeks now, I think. I try to… hold it in, but it’s not always possible. It’s very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, alright. And it’s a recent development, you’ve not experienced this to this degree before?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not like this. I always have some gas, you understand. Everyone does. But this is… much more. It used to be… manageable. Now, it’s… a constant worry. I find myself avoiding certain foods, but it doesn't seem to help much, to be honest. Mostly beans, yes, but also… cabbage. And sometimes even… water. It’s very strange.
DOCTOR: Avoiding foods is… prudent, but a rather broad approach, if it isn't targeting the specific cause. Could you describe a typical day’s diet for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, for breakfast, I usually have… toast. Just plain toast, with maybe a little bit of jam. Sometimes I have a coffee, black. Lunch is… usually from the burger place, naturally. A burger, small fries, and a soda. Sometimes a shake. And for dinner… well, it varies. Sometimes soup, sometimes… leftovers. Or a sandwich. Nothing too fancy, you understand. I try to drink enough water, but… the gas, it makes me hesitant. I don’t want to… add to the problem. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: A diet primarily consisting of processed foods and simple carbohydrates… is not generally conducive to optimal gastrointestinal health, Mr. Goodstein. But let’s not jump to conclusions. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the increased flatulence?
PATIENT: Oh. I… hadn’t thought of that, Doctor. Well, sometimes my stomach feels… bloated. Very full, even when I haven’t eaten much. And… a little bit of cramping, yes. Not severe, but… uncomfortable. And… I’ve been feeling a little tired, I suppose. But I work long hours at the burger place, so that could be anything. No… I don’t think so. Just the gas, the bloating, and a little tiredness. Nothing else, really.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and bloating… interesting. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Let me think. Well, I go… about the same amount as usual, I suppose. Maybe… a little looser? Not diarrhea, certainly, but… not as firm as it used to be. And… sometimes I have to go more often. Not every day, but… frequently enough to notice. It's…difficult to explain properly. It’s not a dramatic change, but… it’s different. It doesn’t hurt, though. Just… looser. And more frequent.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Mr. Goodstein, I’m going to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I’ve always been… fairly healthy, I think. I haven’t been to the doctor much, to be honest. Just for check-ups, and… the occasional cold. No serious illnesses, no surgeries, no… nothing. Just… the usual bumps and bruises from working at the burger place, you understand. I have Medicare, of course, but I haven’t needed to use it much.
DOCTOR: Good. Any family history of gastrointestinal issues – irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, or colon cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question, Doctor. Let me think… My mother, she had… stomach trouble sometimes. She used to complain of… indigestion, mostly. And… bloating, I think. But she never went to the doctor about it, to be honest. My father, he was healthy as a horse. Never a sick day in his life. No… I don’t believe so. No one in my family had anything serious like… Crohn’s disease or colon cancer, as far as I know. Just my mother’s stomach trouble, occasionally. Nothing diagnosed, though.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing at all. I don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I don’t need any. Just… the occasional aspirin for a headache, maybe. But that’s it. No prescriptions, no vitamins, no… anything. Just aspirin, very rarely. And I’m not allergic to anything, as far as I know. I’ve eaten everything, you understand. I’m not a fussy eater.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, I’m going to perform a brief physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table. I will listen to your abdomen and palpate your stomach to assess for any tenderness or abnormalities.
PATIENT: Oh. Very well, Doctor. I suppose that’s… necessary. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I have to get back to the burger place, you understand. They’re very busy.
DOCTOR: It will be quite quick, Mr. Goodstein. Now, if you'll just relax and take deep breaths. Normal bowel sounds present, though somewhat hyperactive… Slight tenderness in the lower left quadrant upon deep palpation… No rebound tenderness or guarding noted. Abdomen is mildly distended, but soft overall. No masses palpated.
PATIENT: Oh. Is that… bad, Doctor? The tenderness? And the distension? Is it something serious? I’m starting to feel a little worried now, you understand. I just want to get back to work, but… not if I’m seriously ill. Is it something I ate? Maybe too many burgers?
DOCTOR: Mr. Goodstein, please try to remain calm. The tenderness is mild and could be due to a number of factors, including increased gas production and intestinal inflammation. The distension is also not alarming in itself, and often accompanies increased gas. I do not believe this is an emergency, but further investigation is warranted to determine the underlying cause. Given your symptoms and the physical exam findings, I suspect you may be experiencing symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, potentially triggered by your diet. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I am going to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel. I will also order a stool sample to check for any signs of infection or inflammation.
PATIENT: Oh. Irritable Bowel Syndrome… Is that… serious, Doctor? Will I have to… stop working? And a stool sample? That sounds… unpleasant. And how long will it take to get the results? I really need to know. And what if it's… something worse? I'm starting to get quite worried, you understand. Will there be… medication? Or… surgery? I really don’t like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Mr. Goodstein, please. Irritable Bowel Syndrome is a chronic condition, but it is manageable with dietary modifications and, if necessary, medication. It is rarely life-threatening, and the vast majority of patients lead perfectly normal lives. It does not necessarily require surgery. As for the stool sample… it is a standard procedure, and frankly, a minor inconvenience. It will help us rule out more serious conditions. The results should be available within three to five business days. We will discuss the results thoroughly when they are available, and formulate a treatment plan accordingly. For now, I recommend avoiding processed foods, carbonated beverages, and excessive caffeine. Try to incorporate more fiber-rich foods into your diet, and stay well-hydrated. We will revisit the possibility of medication if your symptoms do not improve with dietary changes. Does that alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: Oh. That… does make me feel a little better, Doctor. No surgery… that’s good. And just dietary changes… I can try that. No more burgers, you mean? That will be difficult. But I understand. I need to get back to work. So, no more burgers… and more fiber? And drink more water? Three to five days for the results… Very well. Could you… perhaps write down those instructions? I’m a little forgetful, you understand. And what if the results… are bad? Will you… call me? I really don’t want to have to come back here if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: Very well. “Dietary Recommendations: Avoid processed foods, carbonated beverages, and excessive caffeine. Increase fiber intake with fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Drink at least eight glasses of water daily.” As for the results, my office will call you with the findings. If the results indicate further investigation is needed, we will schedule a follow-up appointment. However, I assure you, the likelihood of a serious underlying condition is low. I am also going to provide a referral to a registered dietitian. They can assist you in developing a personalized meal plan that meets your needs and helps manage your symptoms. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… very helpful. A registered dietitian… good. I appreciate that. And you’ll call if there’s anything… serious? I just want to get back to normal, you understand. Back to work. And maybe… a small burger occasionally. Is that possible? Three to five days… I’ll try my best with the diet. And I’ll keep drinking the water. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve… alleviated my concerns somewhat. I think that’s everything, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Goodstein. That appears to be everything. Please do not hesitate to contact my office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms. Get well soon.
