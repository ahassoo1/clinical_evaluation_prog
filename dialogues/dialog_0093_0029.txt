DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this… feeling full really quick when I eat. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Just a few bites and I feel like I’ve had a whole feast. It's been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so. It’s just… annoying, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Mr. Obarr. That does sound frustrating. Feeling full very quickly, even with small amounts of food, is certainly something we should investigate. So, it's been approximately a month, and it occurs regardless of what you’re eating. Could you describe the feeling of fullness a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it's not painful, exactly. More like… pressure, I guess. Right here, under my ribs. And it’s not like I’m stuffed, just… satisfied really fast. Like my stomach is saying, “Okay, that’s enough!” after only a few mouthfuls. It's just... weird. I used to be able to put away a good plate of salmon and bannock, you know? Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it's a feeling of pressure under your ribs, not pain, and it occurs relatively quickly after starting to eat. And you've noticed a change from being able to eat larger meals previously. That’s helpful information, Mr. Obarr. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this feeling of fullness?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, I've been a bit tired lately, come to think of it. Just generally feeling a bit run down. And maybe a little bit of… well, not actual heartburn, but just a bit of a burning feeling sometimes, up here. It's not bad enough for those antacid tablets, though. And… oh! My wife says I’ve been a bit grumpy lately. Could be the tiredness, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, so we have some fatigue, a mild burning sensation in your chest – not severe enough for antacids, and your wife has noted some increased irritability. Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Obarr; it’s important to get the complete picture. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your appetite generally?
PATIENT: Well, I want to eat, you know? I enjoy my food. It’s just… frustrating when I get full so quickly. I don’t feel less hungry, just… defeated, I guess, after a few bites. I still try to eat three meals a day, but they're smaller now. And I don't really crave anything specific, just… food. Used to look forward to a good bowl of stew, now… it doesn’t matter much. It's all the same, really. Gets me full too fast.
DOCTOR: Alright. So your appetite itself hasn’t diminished, you still want to eat, but the feeling of fullness prevents you from enjoying a normal-sized meal. That’s useful information. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, such as diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not diabetes, no. My heart's been a bit fluttery sometimes, the doctor said it was just age. Nothing serious, just told me to take it easy. I had a bit of trouble with my shoulder a few years back, but that’s been fixed now. Oh! And I had the flu, bad one, a couple winters ago. But that was just the flu, you know? Nothing lasting. I've mostly been healthy, I think, for an old fella.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some occasional heart palpitations, addressed by your doctor, a past shoulder issue that has been resolved, and a bout of the flu. Otherwise, generally healthy. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries, Mr. Obarr?
PATIENT: Let me see… Oh, yes! I had my appendix out when I was a young man. A long time ago, must be sixty years or more. And… I think that’s it. No other surgeries, that I can remember. Nothing since then, anyway. I've been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, an appendectomy many years ago. Good. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a tough one. My mother, she had a bit of trouble with her heart when she got older. My father… he was a strong man, mostly healthy, but he did get a bit shaky when he was in his eighties. And my brother… he had some trouble with his blood sugar, I think. But that’s about all I can remember, really. We weren’t big on talking about those things back then. It wasn't like today, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Obarr. Knowing even a little is helpful. So, some family history of heart issues and potential blood sugar problems. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Not much, thankfully. Just a little something for my eyes, the doctor gave it to me. Keeps the pressure down. And… oh! Sometimes I take a little something for my knees when they bother me, but that's just when I've been on my feet a lot. Nothing regular, you know? Just as needed. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for your eyes to manage pressure, and occasional pain relief for your knees. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat all sorts of things, and the doctor's always been able to give me whatever he needed to. I think I'd know if I was allergic to something, you know? My wife would never let me forget it! She keeps a close eye on things.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Obarr. No known allergies. Now, before we proceed, could you please tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I’m retired now, so I don't do much heavy lifting anymore! Mostly I spend my time with my wife, we enjoy watching the birds in the garden. I used to be a fisherman, spent a lot of time out on the water, but my legs aren’t what they used to be. I try to stay active, go for short walks when the weather’s nice. And I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. My wife does most of the cooking, she’s a good cook. I don’t smoke, never have. And I don't drink much alcohol, just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Pretty quiet life, really. But I enjoy it.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very pleasant lifestyle, Mr. Obarr. Active as you are able, a good diet, and no smoking or excessive alcohol consumption. Very good. Now, would you mind if I conducted a brief physical examination?
PATIENT: No, not at all, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don’t mind a poke and prod if it helps. I’m used to doctors, you know? Old fella like me needs to keep an eye on things.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, with no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. I do notice some mild tenderness in the upper abdomen. Now, I'll check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. No problem. That's alright… everything feels okay. A little tender, like I said, but no sharp pain. Just… pressure. And the reflexes… go ahead. I used to have pretty quick reflexes, but they've slowed down a bit with age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are diminished, as expected for your age. Strength is also slightly reduced, but within normal limits. Now, I’d like to get a better understanding of what might be causing your symptoms. I recommend some blood work to check your liver function, kidney function, and rule out any underlying infection. I would also like to order a stool test to check for any abnormalities. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Blood work and a stool test… sounds sensible, Doctor. If it helps figure things out, I'm happy to do it. My wife always says I worry too much, but better safe than sorry, right? When would I need to get those done? And is there anything I need to do to prepare?
DOCTOR: Exactly, Mr. Obarr – better safe than sorry. The lab is just down the hall, and you can go whenever you're ready. For the blood work, it’s best to fast for about eight hours beforehand, so no breakfast or coffee. For the stool test, I’ll give you a collection kit and instructions on how to properly collect the sample. You’ll need to collect a small amount of stool over the next few days and bring it back to the lab. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to eat a healthy diet and staying hydrated. Do you have any questions about these tests or anything else we've discussed today?
PATIENT: Eight hours fasting… okay, I can manage that. And a little kit for the… other test. Right. Sounds straightforward enough. No, I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. Hopefully, we can figure out what’s going on. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Obarr. It was my pleasure. I understand your concerns, and we'll work together to get to the bottom of this. The nurse will be in shortly to give you the lab requisitions and the collection kit. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or experience any worsening symptoms. I wish you a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon to discuss the results.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You have a good day too. I'll be in touch.
