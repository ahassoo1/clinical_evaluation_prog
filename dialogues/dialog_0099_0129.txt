DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hatchard. I’m Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Look, I haven't got all day, so let’s just get on with it. It’s my… well, it’s my stool. It’s black. Like tar. And I take those pain pills, you know, for my arthritis. Been taking them for years. That’s all. Is that enough for you?
DOCTOR: Right. Black, tarry stools. And you’re taking pain medication for arthritis, long-term use, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Long-term. Years. I told you already! Honestly, do I look like I just started taking them? It’s the pills, isn’t it? Everyone says those things mess you up. Just tell me what I need to do to fix it and let me go. I have a garden to tend to.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Hatchard, while it could be related to the pain medication, we can't simply assume that. Black, tarry stools – what we call melena – can indicate bleeding in the upper gastrointestinal tract. It’s crucial to determine the source of the bleeding, and it isn’t always the medication. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the change in stool color?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Upper… what now? Look, I’m just a simple woman. I fix trucks, I don't speak doctor-talk. And no, I haven’t noticed anything else! I feel… tired, maybe? But I'm 73 years old! Of course I’m tired. What else would you expect? I haven't thrown up blood or anything dramatic like that, if that's what you’re fishing for. This is ridiculous. Are you going to give me something or just keep asking questions?
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand your frustration, Ms. Hatchard. We need to rule out anything serious. "Upper gastrointestinal tract" simply means your esophagus, stomach, and the first part of your small intestine. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any history of ulcers, heartburn, or acid reflux?
PATIENT: Ulcers? Heavens no! I eat a sensible diet. Lots of cabbage, you know. Good for the digestion. Heartburn… sometimes, if I have spicy goulash. But nothing a little baking soda can't fix. And acid reflux… is that the same as heartburn? I don’t keep track of these fancy names for things. I just know what works. Look, I've been perfectly healthy my whole life, apart from the arthritis, of course. This is probably just a side effect of the pills. Can we just try a different painkiller?
DOCTOR: Right. No prior history of ulcers. Baking soda for occasional heartburn. I see. While a different painkiller might resolve the issue, we need to be certain. Now, let’s do a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I'd like to check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I want to order a stool test to check for blood, and a complete blood count to see if you’re anemic. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. But don’t poke and prod too much. And I’m not getting on any of those machines that make you dizzy. I need to be able to drive home and get back to my garden. A stool test… that doesn’t involve sending anything up there, does it? Because I’m telling you now, I’m not having anything go up where the sun don't shine. Just get it over with. And hurry up.
DOCTOR: No, the stool test is a simple collection, Ms. Hatchard. Nothing invasive. I assure you. Alright, let's start with your vital signs. Please have a seat on the examination table. I'll need to take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs first. Then we'll move onto the abdomen.
PATIENT: Honestly, all this fuss over a bit of black stool. My mother used to say a little bit of everything is good for you, even tar. Get it over with, doctor. I haven't got all day. And be gentle! My skin bruises easily.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140/90. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your age and potential stress. Pulse is 78 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I’m listening to your abdomen. It’s a little tender in the upper quadrants, but no guarding or rigidity. I don’t hear any unusual sounds. Alright. I'm going to need a stool sample. I’ll give you the collection container and instructions. Please try to collect it as soon as possible, and bring it back to the lab within 24 hours. We'll also need to run a Complete Blood Count. I’ll have the lab technician draw a small amount of blood while you're here.
PATIENT: A little tender? It's probably just gas! All this poking and prodding is making me nervous. And blood? More blood? You’re going to drain me dry! Look, I’m a truck mechanic, not a fainting couch enthusiast. Just… get it over with. And tell me exactly where I need to take this… sample. Don't send me on a wild goose chase. This better not take long. I have tomatoes to stake.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hatchard. Here are the requisition forms for the stool sample and blood draw. The lab is just down the hall, room 102. The phlebotomist will take care of the blood draw, it’s just a few vials. As for the stool sample, the instructions are on the form. It’s a simple collection, as I mentioned. I understand your frustration, but these tests are necessary to rule out anything serious. I'll have the results back within 48 hours. In the meantime, if you experience any dizziness, weakness, or notice any bright red blood in your stool, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Emergency room? Bright red blood? Heavens to Betsy! You're scaring me now! Fine, fine. I'll collect this… sample. And I’ll get poked and prodded. But if anything happens, I'm blaming you! And don’t expect a thank you card. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a garden to save. Where’s the door?
DOCTOR: Right through there, Ms. Hatchard. And please, try to relax. We're just being thorough. .
