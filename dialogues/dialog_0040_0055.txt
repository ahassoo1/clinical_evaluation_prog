DOCTOR: Right, Ellan Rannells. 74. Okay. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, Doctor… Osga, is it? Yes. My daughter, bless her heart, she thinks I need to try this… medical marijuana. Says it’s good for what ails me. Frankly, I’ve been perfectly fine for seventy-four years without it, but she’s quite insistent. And frankly, a woman needs her peace. So, here I am. I suppose I’m looking for a… certificate, she called it. To be allowed to… partake.
DOCTOR: Medical marijuana… Right. Well, I need to understand why your daughter thinks you need this. “What ails you” is a bit vague, isn't it?
PATIENT: Vague? I don’t think it’s vague. It’s old age, Doctor. What more do you need to know? Things just… ache. My joints, mostly. And I don’t sleep as well as I used to. It’s just… a general wearing down. It’s what happens when you live a long life, which, thankfully, I have. Is this really so complicated? My daughter, she reads all these articles online. Says it helps with… everything. Honestly, I just want to be left in peace.
DOCTOR: “Everything” is rather broad, Mrs. Rannells. And while I appreciate a long life, “aches and pains” can be caused by a multitude of things. Do you have any specific areas that hurt more than others?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, are you questioning my assessment of my own body? It’s my knees, mostly. They creak like an old ship. And my lower back. It’s a dull ache, really. Not sharp, not debilitating. Just… there. And, as I said, I don’t sleep soundly. I toss and turn. It's hardly a mysterious ailment requiring a battery of tests. It's simply… being old. Perhaps your daughter reads too much of that internet nonsense.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Rannells. Let’s just go through a few things to be thorough. Have you tried anything for the pain already?
PATIENT: Thorough? Oh, yes. Of course. I’ve taken those little over-the-counter pills. Ibuprofen, I think they are called. They help a little, but I don’t like taking them all the time. They upset my stomach. And my daughter, she’s always going on about side effects. It's a vicious cycle, really. Honestly, I've always just… tolerated it. That's what one does. But she keeps saying this marijuana will be… different.
DOCTOR: And how long have you been experiencing these aches and pains?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long? Well… let me think. It’s not like it came on suddenly, you know? It’s been… gradual. Probably… oh, at least five years, maybe longer. It started with just a little stiffness in the mornings, and then it just… got worse. Slowly, slowly. Like the tide coming in. It’s just a part of life, really. It's hardly a sudden crisis requiring a detailed timeline. Honestly, Doctor, are we going to be here all day?
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? I had my gallbladder out years ago, when I was… oh, I don’t know, in my fifties, I suppose. And I had a bit of a scare with my blood pressure a few years back, but it’s been under control since. I take a little pill for that every morning. Nothing major, really. Just… old age, catching up with me, I suppose. My daughter keeps a very detailed list, you know. She worries too much. Is this all relevant, Doctor? It feels like a full interrogation.
DOCTOR: And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Honestly, I have no idea. It’s a little white pill. Small. I take it every morning with my breakfast. My husband, he handles all that. He gets it filled at the pharmacy, and I just… take it. I don’t bother with names and dosages. It keeps me from getting dizzy, so that’s good enough for me. He’s the practical one. I'm afraid I’m not very good with details. Perhaps you could ask him? He'd be able to tell you exactly what it is. Honestly, I just want to get this certificate and be done with it. This is quite exhausting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mrs. Rannells, to even consider a certificate for medical marijuana, I need a better understanding of your medical history. I'm unable to proceed without knowing what medications you are taking. It's a matter of patient safety. Perhaps your daughter could bring a list next time?
PATIENT: Honestly! This is ridiculous. I came here for a simple certificate, and I’m being subjected to a full medical examination! I’ve been perfectly capable for seventy-four years, and now I need to provide a detailed list of pills just to get permission to try something that my daughter thinks might help? It’s absurd. I think I’ve wasted enough of my time. And yours, frankly. I shall take my business elsewhere. Good day, Doctor.
