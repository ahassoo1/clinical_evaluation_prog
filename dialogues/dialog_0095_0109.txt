DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I’m Dr. Vanochten. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. My head... back of my head... it hurts. Been hurting for, oh... maybe three days now? Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Feels like… a tight band. Is that... normal?
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache for three days, coming and going, and you describe it as a tight band around the back of your head. That gives me a little something to work with. Can you tell me a little more about when it comes and goes?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It's worse when I'm… working. I still do a little at the rail yard, you know? Not like I used to, but I help where I can. Lifting things… or even just being out in the sun. It gets better when I sit down, rest a bit. And… when it’s cooler. The sun is strong these days. Very strong. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So it seems to be triggered by physical exertion and heat. Is there anything else that makes it worse, or better?
PATIENT: Let me see… loud noises, maybe? The rail yard is a noisy place, always has been. When the trains are switching cars, that banging... it doesn’t cause the headache, but it makes it feel worse when it’s already there. And… a good night’s sleep helps. When I sleep good, it's not so bad. But sleep… it doesn't come easy these days. Not since… well, since my wife passed.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re recognizing those triggers – the noise and lack of sleep. And I’m sorry to hear about your wife. That certainly can disrupt things. Now, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate this headache at its worst?
PATIENT: Zero to ten… hmm. It’s not… it's not a bad pain, Doctor. Never been one for complaining too much. But when it’s at its worst… I’d say maybe a… six? Not like a splitting headache, but enough to make me stop what I'm doing. Makes it hard to think straight, you know? Like a pressure. Not sharp, just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a six, described as a pressure at the back of your head, worsening with exertion, heat, and noise, and improving with rest and sleep. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… Sometimes, I feel a little… dizzy. Not like falling-down dizzy, just… lightheaded. And… my vision, sometimes it gets a little blurry, but only for a moment. It happens when the headache is bad. I thought it was just my old eyes, you know? I’m ninety years old, Doctor! Things start to go wrong when you get old. But… I haven’t told anyone about the dizziness or the blurry vision before. Just thought it was part of getting old.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's important information, Mr. Brum. The dizziness and blurry vision, even if they seem minor, are things we need to take into account. Have you had any fever, neck stiffness, nausea, or vomiting with these headaches?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, no stiff neck. And… no, not sick to my stomach, not vomiting. Just the headache, the dizziness sometimes, and the blurry vision. And… being tired, mostly. It’s hard to get a good night's sleep, like I said. But no sickness, no. I eat okay, I think. My daughter brings me food, good food. Nothing missing there.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to confirm, are you currently taking any medications, over-the-counter or prescribed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications. Never been one for taking pills, if I can help it. I used to take something for my blood pressure, a long time ago, but the doctor… Dr. Ramirez, he said I didn't need it anymore. That was… oh, maybe ten years ago? Since then, nothing. Just… try to take it easy. And drink plenty of water. That's what my wife always told me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications currently, and you haven’t taken anything for blood pressure in ten years. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological exam to check your reflexes and balance. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. If you think it will help, then yes. Do what you need to do. I trust you. I’m just… I just want this headache to go away. And maybe… maybe get a good night's sleep. That would be nice.
DOCTOR: Okay. If you could just sit up on the exam table for me, that would be great. I’m going to start by taking your blood pressure. Then we’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Blood pressure is 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not drastically so, considering you’re describing some exertion. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and your balance. Please just relax, and I’ll let you know what I’m doing as I go. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Balance is a little unsteady, but not significantly so for someone your age. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. No obvious weakness or numbness in your extremities.
PATIENT: Unsteady… yes, that sounds right. I don't move around as much as I used to. My daughter says I need to be careful. Slipping and falling… that wouldn’t be good. But everything else… sounds okay. What does it mean, Doctor? Is it something serious? I'm not wanting to cause trouble.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Brum, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it doesn’t sound like anything immediately alarming. The most likely explanation, given your history, is a tension headache, possibly exacerbated by exertion, heat, and noise. The dizziness could be related to the headache, or simply a result of your age and decreased activity. However, the elevated blood pressure and the dizziness do warrant some further investigation. I’d like to order a few simple blood tests to rule out any underlying issues. And, because of the dizziness, I also think it would be prudent to get an EKG to check your heart rhythm. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… an EKG… Yes, Doctor. If that’s what you think is best, then yes. I trust your judgement. But… will it be expensive? I don't have insurance, you know. My wife… she used to handle all that. I don't want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: That's a valid concern, Mr. Brum. I understand. Let me see what I can do. We have some resources available here for patients who are uninsured. I'll check with our billing department to see what the costs would be, and we can discuss options to make it more affordable. I'll also see if there are any local programs that might be able to help. In the meantime, I want to give you a few things you can do at home to manage your symptoms. Avoid strenuous activity, especially in the heat. Stay well-hydrated, and try to get as much rest as possible. If the headache worsens, or you experience any new symptoms like fever, vision changes, or weakness, please come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thank you. That… that makes me feel better. Avoiding activity, staying hydrated, resting… I can do that. My daughter… she would help with that. She worries about me. Thank you for checking about the cost, too. It's a weight off my mind. And… thank you for listening. It's been a long time since someone took the time to listen.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Brum. That’s what I’m here for. We’ll get those tests ordered, and we’ll follow up as soon as we have the results. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, don't hesitate to call the office. I’ll have the nurse come in to draw the blood and schedule the EKG for you. And please, take care of yourself. .
