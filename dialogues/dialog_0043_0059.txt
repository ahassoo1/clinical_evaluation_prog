DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Swaby. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Um… well, honestly, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I’ve been… not speaking as clearly as I usually do, I suppose. It’s like my words are getting tangled up. It's been happening for a little while now, but it's gotten… more noticeable, I think. I don't really remember exactly when it started, though.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds concerning when your speech feels… off. “Tangling up,” as you put it, is a helpful way to describe it. And you mentioned it’s been happening for a little while, gradually worsening. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit more about when you first noticed this difficulty?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when, exactly? That’s… tricky. I really wish I could pinpoint a date, but it’s just… fuzzy. I feel like it was sometime after… well, after my wedding, definitely. But that was… last year, wasn't it? Or was it the year before? Everything feels a bit mixed up lately. I apologize, Doctor. I’m not very good with dates. Perhaps if you asked me about what I was doing around the time it started, that might help?
DOCTOR: Please, don't apologize at all, Ms. Swaby. It's perfectly alright. Memory can be unreliable, especially when you're focused on other things – like a wedding! Focusing on what you were doing is an excellent idea. So, after your wedding – thinking back, can you recall if there were any specific events, illnesses, or changes in your life around the time you began noticing the difficulty with your speech?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. After the wedding… well, things were quite busy, as you can imagine. Lots of settling in, getting the house organized. My husband, David, and I were doing a lot of work on the garden – planting things, building some raised beds. Oh! And I started helping out on a construction site, managing things for a friend. That was… new for me. It was a bit stressful, I suppose, making sure everything ran smoothly, coordinating with the workers… I think I was quite tired a lot of the time. I don't recall being ill, though. Just… tired. And busy.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Swaby. Settling into married life, a new garden, and managing a construction site – that is a lot to take on. Fatigue, especially when coupled with stress, can certainly contribute to various symptoms. You mentioned coordinating with workers on the construction site. Could you describe the nature of that work a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it wasn’t official, you understand. Just helping a friend, Mr. Henderson. He’s a builder, and he was a bit overwhelmed with a new project. I mostly handled the paperwork, scheduling deliveries, making sure everyone had what they needed, things like that. A lot of phone calls and… running around, really. There was a lot of shouting on the site, too. People talking over each other, giving instructions… It was quite noisy. And dusty, sometimes. I was usually wearing a mask, but… you know, it wasn't always perfect. Is that important, Doctor? The noise and dust? I honestly can’t recall if that’s when it started getting worse. Everything is so blurry.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Swaby, the noise and dust are important details. Exposure to those factors could certainly be relevant. And you’re right to point out the timeline is fuzzy, that’s alright; we’ll work through it. Let’s switch gears slightly. Aside from the difficulty with your speech, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms? Let me think… I have been feeling a bit clumsier lately, I suppose. Dropping things more often than usual. And sometimes my vision feels… blurry, even with my glasses on. But I just assumed that was because I was tired. Oh! And I've been feeling very… weak, particularly in my arms and legs. It’s hard to explain. Like it takes more effort to do things. Is that… is that unusual? I apologize for being so vague, Doctor. I’m trying my best to remember everything.
DOCTOR: You are not being vague at all, Ms. Swaby. You're providing me with valuable information, and I appreciate your honesty. Clumsiness, blurry vision, and weakness in your arms and legs are all things we need to investigate. To get a clearer picture, let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I have… I think I have high blood pressure, but it’s usually well-controlled with medication. I take a small pill every day. And I had a bout of the flu a few years ago, but that was nothing serious. Apart from that… not really. I'm usually quite healthy, actually. My husband always says I work too hard! I have Medicare, if that's important. I don't know if that makes any difference. Does it? I’m sorry, I'm just… a bit confused.
DOCTOR: Medicare is helpful information, thank you. And it’s good to know you generally enjoy good health and manage your blood pressure with medication. That’s excellent. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don’t think so. Just the one pill for my blood pressure, every morning. Sometimes I take a pain reliever for headaches, if I have one, but that’s not regular. And… oh! I started taking a vitamin D supplement a few months ago. My friend said I looked a bit pale, and she suggested it might help. But that's all. Really. I promise. I’m trying so hard to remember everything correctly. It’s just… everything feels a bit jumbled up lately.
DOCTOR: You're doing a wonderful job, Ms. Swaby. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed when trying to recall details. Vitamin D is good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… allergies. Let me think. No, I don’t think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. I can eat all sorts of foods, no problems there. And I haven't had any trouble with pollen or anything like that. I’m usually quite good, actually. My husband jokes that I have a cast iron stomach. But… now that I think about it, sometimes I get a bit itchy when I’m around cats. But that’s just a mild irritation, nothing serious. Is that important, Doctor? I apologize for being so… unfocused.
DOCTOR: The mild itchiness around cats is good to note, thank you. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, stroke, dementia, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. That’s a tricky one. My mother passed away a few years ago, she had… heart problems, I think. She was always quite frail. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had… something with his memory, towards the end of his life. It was like he was forgetting things, getting confused. My aunt said it might have been dementia, but I’m not sure. It was a long time ago. Nobody really talked about it much. And… that’s about all I can remember, honestly. My family wasn’t very good at keeping track of these things. I apologize. It’s all a bit blurry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Swaby. It's common for family medical history to be incomplete. Knowing about your mother’s heart problems and your grandfather’s memory issues is helpful, though. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Definitely not. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life. And I very rarely drink alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I’m a very… sensible person, you see. I need to be sharp for my work, managing things on the construction site and all. I apologize for being so… rambling. It’s just… I’m worried about what’s happening to me. I feel like I’m losing my grip, you see? Everything feels so uncertain.
DOCTOR: You are not rambling at all, Ms. Swaby. It’s completely understandable to feel worried, and I appreciate you sharing your concerns with me. It’s good to know you don’t smoke, drink excessively, or use any recreational drugs. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, could you tell me a bit about your work environment?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, the construction site is… quite busy, as I mentioned. Lots of noise, dust, people shouting. It’s mostly outdoors, so I’m exposed to the weather a lot – sun, wind, rain. And I’m usually on my feet for several hours at a time, running around, checking on things. It’s physically demanding, actually. And… it’s quite stressful, making sure everything runs smoothly, coordinating with the workers. There's a lot of responsibility, you see. I'm always worried about something going wrong. Do you think… do you think that could be contributing to this, Doctor? The stress and the noise and everything? I apologize. I’m probably just being silly.
DOCTOR: You're not being silly at all, Ms. Swaby. The stress, noise, and physical demands of your work environment are definitely factors we need to consider. It sounds like a very challenging job. Now, let's move on to a physical examination. Would you mind if I check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and then do a brief neurological assessment?
PATIENT: No, no, that’s perfectly alright. Please, go ahead. Whatever you think is best. I just… I want to find out what’s happening to me. I’m a bit worried, as you know. I’m just… hoping it’s nothing serious. Is it alright if I sit down? I feel a bit… unsteady on my feet, actually. And… perhaps if my husband, David, could join me? Just for support? I apologize for being such a bother.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Swaby. Please, do sit down. And absolutely, David is more than welcome to join us. It’s always helpful to have a support person present. Let me just make a note to have someone get him. In the meantime, let's start with your vital signs. Just relax your arm for me… and breathe normally. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88, which is a little elevated, but not drastically so, especially given the stress you've been under. Your pulse is 78, regular, and your temperature is 98.6, normal. Now, I'd like to check your reflexes, balance, and coordination. Do you have any difficulties with your vision or hearing?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. 142… is that bad? I do get quite anxious at the doctor’s office, you see. As for my vision… well, it’s been a bit blurry lately, even with my glasses on. And sometimes I have trouble hearing when there’s a lot of background noise. It’s probably just age, though. I’m not as young as I used to be. And I… sometimes I feel a bit dizzy, especially when I stand up quickly. But that’s probably just low blood sugar. I apologize for being such a… a worrywart. And please, tell me if you think something is seriously wrong. I’d rather know the truth, even if it’s not good.
DOCTOR: You're not a worrywart at all, Ms. Swaby. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned, and it’s good that you’re sharing these details with me. The slightly elevated blood pressure is something we'll monitor, and it could certainly be related to anxiety. Now, let's check your reflexes. Just relax your legs… good. Your reflexes are a bit diminished, which could be normal, but it's something we need to investigate further. Now, I'd like you to close your eyes and touch your nose with your index finger. Just reach out and touch your nose… good. Now, repeat that with the other hand.
PATIENT: Oh… that was a bit off, wasn’t it? I’m sorry. I feel a little… clumsy today. That was better, I suppose. But I still feel a bit unsteady. I apologize for being so… uncoordinated. It's not usually like this. And… I think my husband is here now? I heard his voice.
DOCTOR: Yes, David, thank you for coming. It’s helpful to have you here. That’s alright, Ms. Swaby. We’re just assessing your coordination, and it's not uncommon to feel a bit unsteady when you’re anxious. The slight tremor and difficulty touching your nose are things we need to investigate further. Now, I’d like to check your gait – how you walk – and observe your balance. Would you mind walking a few steps for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Oh… I feel a bit… off-balance. And my legs feel a little weak. Is that… is that bad, Doctor? I apologize for being such a… a bother. I’m just… worried. Very worried.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Swaby. You’re not a bother at all. It’s good that you’re letting me know how you’re feeling. The slight instability and weakness in your legs are concerning, and they warrant further investigation. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings of the brief examination, I'm concerned about the possibility of a neurological issue. David, has she been experiencing any other symptoms you’ve noticed – changes in her personality, difficulty with memory, or any problems with swallowing or speaking?
PATIENT: Neurological… what does that mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? Well, Doctor, she has been a bit more forgetful lately, I have to admit. Mostly just little things – misplacing her keys, forgetting appointments. And she has been a bit quieter than usual, a little withdrawn. But I just thought it was the stress of the job. She’s been working so hard, you see. And… she has mentioned that her speech has been a bit slurred sometimes, but I just thought she was tired. She doesn’t complain much, you see. And… oh! And she has had some trouble sleeping lately, restless nights, tossing and turning. But… that’s all. I honestly didn’t think it was anything serious. But… now that you mention it… it’s been happening more frequently lately. I apologize. I should have said something sooner. Is it… is it something bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Thank you both for sharing that information. It’s very helpful. The increasing forgetfulness, quieter demeanor, slurred speech, and difficulty sleeping are all concerning symptoms, and they strengthen my concern about a potential neurological issue. It's too early to say definitively what’s going on, but these symptoms could indicate a number of possibilities, including a stroke, a transient ischemic attack – sometimes called a mini-stroke – or other neurological condition. To get a clearer picture, I recommend we order some imaging tests, specifically an MRI of the brain, and some blood work. These tests will help us identify the cause of her symptoms and determine the best course of treatment. It's important to rule out anything serious. David, would you be able to stay with Adyn while we get these tests done?
PATIENT: Stroke… a stroke? Oh, goodness… I… I don’t know what to say. I… I feel so scared. Yes, Doctor, absolutely. I will stay with Adyn every step of the way. We’ll do whatever it takes to find out what’s going on and get her the help she needs. Is… is she going to be okay, Doctor? Is it… is it serious? And… how soon can we get these tests done? I’m just… so worried about her. She’s everything to me.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be scared, and I want to assure you both that we’re going to do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. It's important to remember that we don't have a definitive diagnosis yet, and many conditions can cause similar symptoms. We can get the imaging tests scheduled as soon as possible. I’ll have my nurse contact the radiology department immediately and arrange for an MRI today. We’ll also draw some blood work to check for any underlying infections or other abnormalities. Ms. Swaby, in the meantime, I recommend that you avoid any strenuous activity and try to get some rest. If you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms – such as weakness on one side of your body, difficulty speaking or understanding, severe headache, or vision changes – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’ll also prescribe a mild sedative to help you relax and get some sleep. And, I’ll want to consult with a neurologist to get their expert opinion on your case. Do you both have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I… I don’t think so. I’m just… so confused. And scared. I just… want to know what’s happening to me. Doctor, will she be able to… to recover? Is there a chance she’ll… be okay? And… what happens if it is… something serious? What are the treatment options? We just… need to know what we’re facing. And… is there anything we can do right now to help her? Anything at all? I apologize for all the questions. I’m just… trying to stay strong for her. I want to be prepared. We just… want to get her better. We need to know what's next.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to be scared and to ask questions. It’s important to be informed, and I’ll do my best to answer them honestly. The chances of recovery depend entirely on the underlying cause of her symptoms and the severity of the condition. If it’s a stroke, for example, early intervention is crucial, and the sooner we start treatment, the better the chances of a positive outcome. Treatment options may include medication to dissolve blood clots, rehabilitation therapy to regain lost function, and lifestyle modifications to prevent future strokes. Ms. Swaby, the good news is that we’re taking all the necessary steps to get a definitive diagnosis and develop a personalized treatment plan for you. And, with the right care and support, many people can make a full recovery from neurological conditions. Right now, the most important thing is to get the MRI and blood work done so we can get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’ll also contact a neurologist to get their expert opinion on your case. In the meantime, please rest, avoid any strenuous activity, and let David take care of you. I'll have my nurse come in and draw the bloodwork right away and walk you through the process of scheduling your MRI. After the MRI, we will schedule a follow up appointment for us to review the results with you. Do you have any other immediate questions or concerns that I can address at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now. I… I just want to go home. I want to rest. Thank you, Doctor. We appreciate everything you’ve done. We’ll just… take it one step at a time. We’ll follow your instructions and get the tests done as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: Of course. Please, take your time and get some rest. David, please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns, at any time. We are here to support you both. My nurse will escort you both out and provide you with further instructions. Take care, and we’ll see you soon.
