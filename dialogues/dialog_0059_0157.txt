DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Dudney. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Romario Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I already told the receptionist. High blood pressure. My husband made the appointment. He worries too much. It's probably nothing, but he insisted. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Dudney. I understand your husband made the appointment due to concerns about your blood pressure. While it sounds like you don’t feel particularly worried yourself, it’s always good to check these things. We'll take things as quickly as we can, but I do want to gather some information to ensure we have a complete picture. To begin, could you tell me if you’ve ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure before?
PATIENT: No. Never. I feel fine most of the time. A little tired, maybe, but who isn't? I don't go to doctors unless something is seriously wrong. This is just a waste of my time, honestly. Is that all?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney. It sounds like you generally feel well and are not a frequent visitor to the doctor, which is perfectly alright. We will try to make this as efficient as possible. Since this is the first time we're addressing this, let’s start with a little more detail about when you first noticed your husband was concerned about your blood pressure, and if anything specific prompted him to make this appointment?
PATIENT: He just kept checking it with that… that machine. The one with the cuff. Said it was high a couple of times. I told him it was probably just stress from work. I’m a civil engineer, you know. Lots of deadlines. He wouldn't let it go. He started nagging, so here I am. Honestly, it's ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like your husband was being proactive with home monitoring, and his concern stemmed from consistently elevated readings. It's good that he's looking out for you. While stress certainly can impact blood pressure, it's prudent to investigate further. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about your typical workday?
PATIENT: It's… a lot. Meetings, site visits, paperwork. I mostly do road work, so I'm in and out of the truck all day. Lots of driving. And I have to deal with contractors. You know how they are. Always trying to cut corners. It’s just… exhausting. Does that matter? Can we just take my blood pressure now?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Dudney, that absolutely matters. A demanding job like yours, with frequent travel and dealing with challenging situations, can contribute to increased blood pressure. It's helpful for me to understand the stressors you're under. Before we proceed with taking your blood pressure, could you briefly describe any other symptoms you've been experiencing lately?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Look, I told you, I feel fine. Maybe a little tired sometimes, like I said. And my head… sometimes it feels a little… full. But honestly, that could just be from staring at a computer screen all day. I don’t know. I’m not a doctor. I just want to know if it’s something serious or if I can just go back to work. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Dudney, that’s not too much to ask at all. We’ll get to the bottom of this. So, you’ve mentioned some fatigue and occasional fullness in your head. Has that fullness been accompanied by any dizziness, vision changes, or nausea?
PATIENT: No. Nothing like that. Just… a little pressure. Sometimes. It comes and goes. Look, I really need to get back to work. I have a deadline, and this is taking up my whole morning. Are we almost done?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about getting back to work, Ms. Dudney. We are getting there. Just a few more questions to get a complete picture. Have you noticed any changes in your eating habits or weight recently?
PATIENT: No. I eat the same stuff I always eat. My husband tries to get me to eat healthier, but I don't really have time to cook fancy meals. I grab something quick before work or eat out sometimes. Weight… I haven’t weighed myself in ages. Probably the same. Honestly, I don't focus on that stuff. It's just… a lot. Can we please just take my blood pressure?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudney. We’ll proceed with taking your blood pressure now. I’m going to need to ask a few more questions about your medical history afterward, but we can get through that quickly. To start, do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None. Never had any allergic reactions. I can eat anything. My husband worries about everything, but I’m perfectly healthy. Just tired. Can we hurry this up? I’m starting to feel anxious just being here.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Dudney. No known allergies, that’s good to know. Let’s get this done quickly, then. If you could just sit here and relax your arm, I'll take your blood pressure now. Try to take a few deep breaths. I'm just wrapping the cuff around your arm… and I’ll inflate it now. It’ll feel a little tight for a moment.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. I have things to do. This whole thing is just… ridiculous. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudney. Your blood pressure reading is 148/92 mmHg. Now, this reading is slightly elevated. It doesn't necessarily mean there's a serious problem, but it does warrant further investigation. We’ll want to repeat the reading a few times today to confirm the results. It’s important to rule out “white coat hypertension,” which is when blood pressure rises in a clinical setting. Before we do that, could you tell me if you have any other medical conditions—like diabetes, high cholesterol, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I do not have diabetes, high cholesterol, or any kidney problems. My husband gets me checked every year, and I’m perfectly fine. He’s just… overprotective. I don’t understand why I’m even here. This is a waste of my time and his money. Can we just confirm it’s normal and then I can leave?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudney. No known history of diabetes, high cholesterol, or kidney problems. Has anyone in your family—parents, siblings, grandparents—had high blood pressure, heart disease, or stroke?
PATIENT: My grandmother… on my mother’s side. She had… something with her heart, I think. But she lived to be 90, so it couldn’t have been that bad. My mother… she's fine, too. Healthy as a horse. Honestly, my family is really healthy. This is all so unnecessary. Are we almost done? I have a deadline, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Dudney. Grandmother with some heart condition, mother healthy. Now, just a couple more quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I do not smoke, drink, or do drugs. I'm a professional. I have a reputation to maintain. My husband would kill me if I did any of those things. This is ridiculous. I don’t understand why you're asking me these personal questions. Can we just get this over with? My blood pressure is probably just high because I’m stressed out from being here!
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Dudney. These questions are just part of a routine assessment to get a complete picture of your overall health. And you are right, being in a clinical setting can sometimes temporarily raise blood pressure. Alright, let’s take your blood pressure again, and then we can discuss the results and figure out the best course of action. If you could just relax your arm, I’ll proceed. I'm just wrapping the cuff around your arm… and I’ll inflate it now. Try to take a few deep breaths.
PATIENT: Fine. Just hurry up. I need to get back to work. This is wasting my entire morning. Honestly, it’s ridiculous. I feel perfectly fine. This whole thing is just… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudney. Your second reading is 152/94 mmHg. It’s still elevated. Given these readings, and to get a more comprehensive understanding of your cardiovascular health, I’d like to order some basic blood work. This will include a check of your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and a simple glucose test. It will also help us rule out any underlying causes for your elevated blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I do not want any blood work. I’m perfectly healthy. My husband gets me checked every year. This is just a waste of my money and time. I’m not doing it. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I want to leave. Now. Can we just write down that my blood pressure is a little high because I’m stressed out from being here and be done with it? I have a deadline, you know! I do not want any blood work.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Ms. Dudney. I respect your decision not to have blood work at this time. However, given these consistently elevated readings, I am still concerned about your cardiovascular health. While you are not experiencing any immediate symptoms, uncontrolled high blood pressure can lead to serious complications over time. In that case, I recommend a repeat blood pressure check at least weekly for the next month, ideally at different times of the day. It would also be beneficial to monitor your blood pressure at home with a home blood pressure monitor if possible. We can discuss proper technique and interpretation of the results at your next appointment. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Fine. I’ll check it once a week. But I’m not buying any fancy machine. My husband can use his. But that’s it. No more appointments, no more tests, no more wasting my time. And I want it in my chart that I’m perfectly healthy except for being a little stressed. Is that clear? I have a deadline, you know. I need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Dudney, that is perfectly clear. We will document that you’ve declined blood work at this time, and we’ll plan for weekly blood pressure checks, utilizing your husband’s machine. We’ll also note that you attribute the elevated readings to stress. I will provide you with a written summary of our discussion today, including the importance of monitoring your blood pressure and recognizing potential symptoms of high blood pressure. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, severe headaches, or vision changes, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. I do not. Just let me leave. I need to get back to work. Honestly, this whole thing has been a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Dudney. Thank you for coming in today. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns. Have a good day, and please do try to prioritize managing your stress levels. .
