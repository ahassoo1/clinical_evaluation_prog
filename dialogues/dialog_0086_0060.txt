DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, it’s…family history, mostly. My mother, her side… a lot of things. Cancer, heart problems, you name it. I just… want to know I'm not heading that way, you know? Preventative stuff, I guess. It’s probably nothing, but it’s always in the back of my mind.
DOCTOR: Right. Family history is important. A little anxiety never hurt anyone, though, honestly, obsessing over it isn't productive. Twenty-four years old, good age to get a baseline. We'll run some tests, see what we find. Let's start with the specifics. On your mother's side… what kinds of cancer?
PATIENT: Well, my grandmother died of…ovarian cancer, I think. And my aunt, she had breast cancer, but caught it early. And then there was… great-uncle, lung cancer, smoked his whole life, of course. It’s just…a lot. My dad’s side is okay, relatively. A bit of high blood pressure, but nothing major. Honestly, it feels like a lottery sometimes. You just hope you don't get the bad numbers.
DOCTOR: Ovarian, breast, lung… right. Smoking is a significant factor with the lung cancer, naturally. And early detection is key with breast cancer, thankfully. It's good your aunt caught it. Alright. And you?
PATIENT: Me? Nothing. I don't smoke, never have. I try to eat reasonably well, although…work gets in the way sometimes. I exercise when I can, which isn’t as much as I’d like. I don’t really do anything reckless, if that makes sense. No dangerous hobbies or anything. I'm an engineering teacher, so mostly just…sitting and grading papers and trying to explain things to students. Not exactly a physically demanding life, you know?
DOCTOR: Engineering teacher. Sitting is the new smoking, unfortunately. We’ll have to factor that in. No reckless hobbies... good. Let’s go through a bit of a standard review. Any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I’m aware of. I can eat anything, thankfully. No reactions to medications either, as far as I remember. I haven’t really…needed much medication, honestly. Just the occasional headache pill. Do you need to know specific things? Like, are there certain things I should be allergic to, genetically? Because I really haven’t paid that much attention to any of this.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s good you haven't had any major reactions. As for genetically predisposed allergies… it's a bit complex. It's not like there's a checklist. We’re mostly looking for patterns, and seeing if anything flags as particularly concerning given your family history. Are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter things regularly?
PATIENT: No, nothing regular. Like I said, just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache. Maybe a cold remedy if I’m actually sick, which isn’t often. I usually just try to sleep it off. I’m not a big fan of taking pills unless absolutely necessary, to be honest. It feels like I’m just masking the problem, not fixing it. Do you think that’s silly?
DOCTOR: Not silly, just... impractical. Sometimes, masking a symptom is the appropriate course of action, especially if it allows you to function. We're not all equipped to simply “sleep off” everything. Alright. Let's move on. Any significant medical history on your end?
PATIENT: No, nothing. I had all the usual childhood stuff, chickenpox, measles, whatever. Nothing major. I broke my arm once when I was a kid, playing around like an idiot, but it healed fine. I've had the usual yearly check-ups, nothing ever flagged. Honestly, I'm probably the healthiest person in my family, ironically. Which is probably why I’m here, worrying about things. It’s… illogical, I know.
DOCTOR: Irony is a cruel mistress. No significant medical history, that's good. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, basic things. And, if you don't mind, I'd like to take a quick look at your family history records, if you have access to them?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Physical exam is good. I’ve got my Medicare card, if you need it. And the family history… my mother keeps pretty detailed records, actually. She’s a bit of a… worrier, like me, so she’s tracked everything. I think she has it all scanned on a flash drive somewhere. I can bring it next time, if that works? I didn't really think to bring it with me today.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Next time is perfectly fine. A digital copy will be helpful. Alright, let’s get started. If you could just sit back and relax. First, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me…
PATIENT: Okay… Is everything alright? You seem…focused. Is it something you’ve already noticed?
DOCTOR: Nothing alarming, Mr. Theriot. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from anxiety, given the situation. Your lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 130/85… a bit on the higher side, but again, not immediately concerning. Now, I'm just going to gently press on your abdomen. Let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: No discomfort…yet. I always get a little…self-conscious during these exams. I know it's irrational, but… it just feels weird, you know? Someone poking around. It's probably just me being a weirdo.
DOCTOR: Perfectly normal to feel that way. It's not exactly a pleasant experience for most people. Everything feels normal here as well. Now, I'm just going to test your reflexes. Please relax your legs…
PATIENT: There. Is that okay? I feel like I’m failing some sort of test, honestly.
DOCTOR: They’re a little… diminished. Not drastically, but a little less responsive than I’d expect for someone your age. Could be a number of things. Stress, dehydration, even just not being fully relaxed. Alright, Mr. Theriot. Based on this quick exam, and your family history, I’m not seeing any immediate red flags, but I would like to order some blood work, just to get a clearer picture. A full lipid panel, a complete blood count, and a basic metabolic panel. And I also recommend an EKG, just to check your heart rhythm. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds…reasonable. Blood work, EKG…okay. So… it's not something serious, right? It's just…precautionary? I'm just… I hate waiting for results, you know? It always feels like the worst-case scenario is looming. I’m probably overreacting, but…my mother will kill me if I don’t get this checked out.
DOCTOR: It is precautionary, Mr. Theriot. And frankly, given your family history, it's the responsible course of action. I understand your anxiety, and it’s perfectly normal to feel that way. But it doesn’t mean you should automatically assume the worst. We’ll get the results back in a few days. I'll have my nurse contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, try to relax. I suggest you avoid Dr. Google, as it's rarely helpful. And perhaps focus on something enjoyable to distract yourself. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Um… well, my mother is always talking about genetic testing. Is that something I should consider? Like, actually finding out what genes I’ve inherited? I just… I don’t know if I’m ready for that information. It feels… overwhelming. And, honestly, I’m afraid of what I might find. But maybe it’s better to know? It's probably a silly question.
DOCTOR: It’s not a silly question at all, Mr. Theriot. Genetic testing is a complex issue. It can provide valuable information, but it also comes with potential drawbacks. Frankly, with your limited family history, I don't see an urgent need for genetic testing at this time. The results might not be definitive, and could potentially cause unnecessary anxiety. However, if you're strongly considering it, I can certainly write you a referral to a genetic counselor. They can discuss the pros and cons in detail, and help you decide if it's the right course of action for you. Ultimately, the decision is yours. Would you like me to write that referral?
PATIENT: No… no, I think I’ll hold off on the referral for now. You’re right. It sounds… overwhelming. And honestly, I think I just need the blood work results first. See what those say. Maybe it's nothing. So, blood work, right? And you'll contact me when they're back. And… that's it? I think I’m good. Thank you, Dr. Murtic.
DOCTOR: Yes, blood work. And I will have my nurse contact you as soon as the results are available. And you’re very welcome, Mr. Theriot. Try not to worry too much. We’re being proactive, and that’s the most important thing. Have a good day. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
PATIENT: .
