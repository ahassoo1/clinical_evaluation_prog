DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I ain't here 'cause I'm sick. I need a check-up. For the army. They want one before I sign up. Seems silly, but rules are rules, I guess. Don't got time for sniffles when I gotta serve.
DOCTOR: The army, you say?
PATIENT: Right. Gonna be a proper soldier. Always been good with machines, see? Fixing things, building things. My old man was a mechanic, taught me everything. Not much use bein' good with your hands if you ain't fit, though. That's why I'm here, I suppose. Waste of a good morning, if you ask me, but… gotta do what you gotta do.
DOCTOR: Alright. A pre-enlistment physical. I understand. We’ll need to go through a fairly comprehensive examination to ensure you meet the necessary requirements. It’s standard procedure, and frankly, quite sensible. Now, let’s start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions – anything at all, really?
PATIENT: Significant? Hmm. Not really. Had the chickenpox when I was a kid, like everyone else. Broke my arm once, fallin' out of a tree. Old man wasn't pleased about that one. Nothing a bit of plaster didn't fix. No… no serious stuff. Never been hospitalized, 'cept for the arm, of course. Don't even get common colds much, honestly. Strong constitution, I reckon.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just the arm. When it broke. They… put pins in it, I think. Years ago, can't rightly remember the details. Doc at the local hospital did it. Small town doctor, good enough. Didn't leave no scars, if that's what you're askin'. Worked perfectly fine ever since. Still got good grip. Wanna shake hands? Show ya.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, grip seems adequate. Now, let's talk about family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… that's a tough one. Old man died of… old age, mostly. Worked himself to the bone, never stopped. Mom… she had bad knees when she got older. Couldn't walk much towards the end. And her mother… she had something with her heart, I think. Faded away quiet-like. Nobody really talked about these things much. Not a family for sharing feelings, see? Mostly just kept to themselves. Doesn't mean much, does it? It's not like I caught her bad knees.
DOCTOR: It can be relevant. Alright. And what about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What's that even mean? You want to know if I go to bars? I don't cause trouble, if that's what you're gettin' at. I like a quiet night in with my wife, mostly. Bit of telly, maybe. I don't smoke, never have. Drink a beer now and then, with dinner. That's it. Perfectly normal life, really.
DOCTOR: It's standard protocol, Mr. Hartness. We need to know about things like tobacco use, alcohol consumption, recreational drug use… even your typical diet and exercise habits. It helps us get a complete picture of your overall health. You said you drink a beer "now and then." Could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Look, I'm not some wild party animal, alright? One or two beers with dinner, maybe three on a Saturday if there's a good game on. That's it. Not a big drinker, never have been. And I eat normal food. Meat and potatoes, vegetables, the usual. My wife cooks good. I ain't eatin' fancy stuff, but it keeps me goin'. As for exercise… I do a bit of work around the house. Fixin' things, gardening. Not runnin' marathons, if that's what you're expectin'. Practical work, keeps me strong. Is this gonna take all day? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. We'll proceed. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None. Never had a reaction to anything. Not even bee stings. My wife keeps tellin' me I should be careful, but I'm fine. Tough skin, I guess. Always been healthy as a horse. Can we get on with the actual examination now? I'm startin' to lose patience.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's begin with your vital signs. Please step onto the scale. And I will need a brief listen to your heart and lungs. Please remove your shirt and have a seat.
PATIENT: Alright, fine. Get it over with. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: 53 kilograms… That is… significantly underweight for your height of 187 centimeters. Blood pressure is 118 over 78. Heart sounds are regular, but somewhat distant. Lungs are clear to auscultation, but your respiratory rate is slightly elevated. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Are you experiencing any unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Unexplained weight loss? No! I always been lean. It's the build of me, alright? Always been a bit… wiry. I ain't sick, I just don't put on weight easy. Used to bother my old man, he liked a bit of bulk on a man. But I’m strong enough. Don’t need to be a giant to get things done. See? Still got some muscle on me. Is that it? Can we move on now? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: We're not finished yet, Mr. Hartness. We need to assess your neurological function and musculoskeletal system. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Sensory function appears intact. Range of motion is within normal limits, but there appears to be some mild tenderness in your left shoulder. Do you have any pain or limitations with movement in that shoulder?
PATIENT: Pain? Nah, not really. Just a bit… stiff sometimes. Old injury, I reckon. From when I was a kid. Fell outta that tree, remember? Broke my arm. Shoulder's never been quite the same since. But it doesn't bother me. I can still lift things, still got good grip. See? Perfectly fine. Don’t need a fancy exam to tell me that. Are you tryin' to find somethin' that isn't there?
DOCTOR: We are simply completing a thorough assessment as required for a pre-enlistment physical. There is mild crepitus in the left shoulder joint, and some restriction in external rotation. This is consistent with a history of trauma. Spine is straight, with full range of motion. No tenderness to palpation. I would like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and thyroid stimulating hormone. We should also obtain a chest X-ray to evaluate your lung fields. I am concerned about your low body weight and the potential for underlying medical conditions.
PATIENT: Hold on a minute. Blood work? X-rays? You're makin' a big deal outta nothin'. I told you, I'm fine. Always been lean. Always been strong. I don’t need fancy tests to prove I'm healthy enough to serve. This is a waste of time and money. Look, I’m a practical man. I’ve worked hard my whole life. I can handle myself. I don’t need a doctor tellin' me I'm broken. No blood work. No X-rays. I’m not payin' for that. This is ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration. However, as a physician, I have a professional obligation to ensure that you are medically fit for the demands of military service. Your low body weight and the findings on physical examination warrant further investigation. I cannot, in good conscience, clear you for enlistment without obtaining these tests. I strongly recommend that you reconsider. You mentioned that you are uninsured. I can attempt to locate some resources for low-cost testing in the area. Alternatively, you may wish to consult with another physician to obtain a second opinion. However, please understand that I will not be able to sign off on your enlistment form without these tests. .
