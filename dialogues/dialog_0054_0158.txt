DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning. Yes, hello. It's... nice to meet you too, I suppose. Honestly, it’s a bit of a fuss, this whole thing. My landlord is being difficult. Something about a letter for a… a pet? I think. It’s for my daughter, really. She’s the one with the animal. I just need something official-looking, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds like you’re needing a letter documenting a pet for your landlord, and it’s related to your daughter. Just to clarify, is your daughter living with you, or is this a separate situation?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Separate. Definitely separate. She’s… in the city, somewhere. I don't keep track, really. She's a grown woman. I just... agreed to help with this letter. It's probably a dog, or a cat. One of those fluffy things. I don’t really do animals. Too much mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your daughter is an adult living independently, and you're assisting her with a letter for her landlord regarding a pet. Do you happen to know what kind of pet it is, or if there are any specific requirements the landlord has mentioned – breed restrictions, weight limits, that sort of thing?
PATIENT: Oh, bother. See, that's what I don't know! She just called me, said she needed a letter saying I approve of her having a pet. Something about “responsible pet ownership” and… allergies, maybe? Honestly, she moves so fast, it's hard to keep up. I think it's a small dog, though. She likes those yappy little things. Honestly, I wouldn’t know a breed if it bit me.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a letter confirming your approval of your daughter having a pet, potentially a small dog, with a possible mention of responsible pet ownership and allergies. To make sure the letter is useful for her, would you like me to include a statement confirming you have no known allergies that would be affected by her having a pet?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, please do! That sounds... sensible. Allergies. Yes. I don't have any, not that I'm aware of. I’ve always been fairly robust, you know? A bit of a cold now and then, but nothing serious. And definitely no animal allergies. Write that down, please. The more official it looks, the better. She can be… persuasive, my daughter.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll include a statement confirming you have no known allergies. Just to be thorough, are you aware of any family history of allergies – perhaps a sibling or parent who had significant reactions to animals?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history? Now you’re asking things... My mother… she had a bit of hay fever, I think. But that was just seasonal, you know? Dust and pollen and such. Not animals. And my father... he was a very stoic man. Didn't believe in illnesses of any kind, really. Probably allergic to everything, but he’d never admit it. So, no, not that I recall. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No significant family history of animal allergies. So, to recap, I’ll draft a letter confirming your approval of your daughter having a pet, stating you have no known allergies, and mentioning responsible pet ownership. Is there anything else you think would be useful to include, or any specific concerns you have that you’d like me to address in the letter?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well… perhaps something about her being a responsible adult? She can be a bit… scattered. Just to reassure the landlord, you know? That she’s capable of looking after an animal. And… oh, and that the pet won’t cause any disturbances to the neighbors. She lives in an apartment building, I believe. Yes, that’s important. No barking, or… whatever it is small dogs do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll include statements confirming your daughter is a responsible adult and that you anticipate the pet will not cause any disturbances to the neighbors. Just to be clear, do you have any specific information about the apartment building or any rules you're aware of that I could mention in the letter?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I haven't been there. She doesn't really share details. Just said something about a landlord being… particular. Honestly, I just want this over with. Write something reassuring. That’s all. Something that says, “Yes, my daughter is a good person, and she’ll take care of the animal.” You know, general niceties. I’m sure you’re good at that.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I can certainly draft a letter with those sentiments. I’ll focus on confirming your daughter is a responsible adult and that you trust her to provide proper care for the pet. It’ll be a professional and reassuring document. Give me just a moment, and I’ll have a draft ready for you to review.
PATIENT: That sounds lovely, thank you. Honestly, you're doing a much better job of this than I ever could. I just wish she'd told me what kind of animal it was. Still, I suppose it doesn't really matter, does it? As long as the landlord is satisfied.
DOCTOR: Here’s the draft. As you can see, it confirms your approval of your daughter having a pet, states you have no known allergies, and emphasizes her responsibility and trustworthiness as a pet owner. It also includes a statement that you anticipate the pet will not cause any disturbances to the neighbors. It doesn’t specify the type of animal. Does this meet your needs, or would you like me to make any changes?
PATIENT: Oh… that looks very official. Yes, very good. All the right words. “Trustworthy.” That’s a good one. And “responsible.” Yes. It doesn’t mention the animal, which is probably for the best. Less to argue about, I suppose. No, that’s perfect. Absolutely perfect. You’ve saved me a great deal of trouble.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m glad I could help. Here you go. It’s signed and dated. I’ll also provide a copy for your records. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! Thank you so much. No, I think that’s everything. Just this letter, and I can finally get this off my plate. Honestly, you've been a lifesaver. It’s so nice to deal with someone sensible.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wrye. I'm happy to have helped. If you happen to think of anything else, or if your daughter needs any further documentation in the future, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Have a wonderful day, and I hope everything goes smoothly with the landlord.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, thank you. I certainly hope so too. She can be… a handful, sometimes. You have a good day as well, Doctor. And thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Wrye. Take care.
PATIENT: .
