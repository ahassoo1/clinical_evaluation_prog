DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Murph. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Asami. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Nice to meet you too. Uh… well, my son, he signed me up. Something about… a tryout? For… sports? Old man like me? I forget what sport now. He said I needed a check-up first.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Murph. It's very common to feel a bit overwhelmed with things like that, and your son sounds like he’s looking out for you. A check-up is a great idea before starting any new activity. So, aside from the tryout, are you experiencing any health issues or concerns at all?
PATIENT: Health issues? Hmm… not really. I get a little tired sometimes, you know, being an old guy. And my knees… they ain’t what they used to be. But that’s just getting old, right? Nothing a little rub ain’t fixed. Mostly, I feel okay. Do I need to tell you what I had for breakfast? My son always asks a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: No, no, we don't need to go over breakfast unless you think it’s relevant! It sounds like you're generally feeling alright, which is good. The tiredness and knee pain are certainly common as we get older, but it’s good we’re talking about them. Just want to make sure nothing else is going on. Let's start with the tiredness. Has it been getting worse lately?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. Maybe a little. It's hard to say. I sleep okay, I think. My wife says I snore, but she always says that! I just… don't have as much pep as I used to. I used to walk everywhere, now I gotta sit down after a little bit. It’s just… slowin’ down, I guess. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Murph, slowing down isn’t necessarily bad. It's a natural part of aging. But it’s important to rule out anything that could be contributing to the fatigue. A lot of things can cause tiredness, and we want to make sure we’re not missing something. Do you ever feel short of breath with the tiredness, or have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Short of breath… not really. Maybe a little when I climb the stairs, but I’m outta shape! Swelling… sometimes my feet feel a little puffy at the end of the day. But I been wearin’ these shoes a lot lately. They’re comfy, but maybe they’re holdin’ onto some water. My wife says I got big feet. Is that normal? Does that mean somethin’ is wrong?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re noticing these things, Mr. Murph. Puffiness in the feet and some shortness of breath with exertion could be related to a number of things, and it's good we're talking about them. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your legs and feet. That will give me a better idea of what might be going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doc. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Just don’t poke too hard, these old bones ain't what they used to be! I used to be strong, you know. Real strong. But that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I’ll be very gentle, Mr. Murph, I promise. We’re just gathering information. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning right now. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, a slight murmur, which is common at your age, but nothing alarming. Lungs are clear. Now, can you flex your knees for me?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. There we go. Oh, that little pop? That’s just an old injury, Doc. Back when I was a young man… uh… playing baseball, I think it was. Can’t remember exactly. It pops sometimes. Does it feel… rough? It's probably nothin'. Just old bones, I tell ya. What did my son say I was tryin’ out for again? Basketball? Football? It’s all a blur.
DOCTOR: I see. There's some crepitus—that’s the popping you’re feeling—and a little tenderness on the inner side of the knee. Not unexpected, given what you’ve told me. And yes, it does feel a little rough, which suggests some mild arthritis. Nothing drastic at this point. Pulses are good in both feet. There is some mild swelling, as you mentioned, but no redness or warmth. Okay, Mr. Murph, that was helpful. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you have some normal wear and tear for your age, including some mild arthritis in your knees and some mild swelling in your feet. However, the tiredness is something we need to investigate a bit further. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… not that I know of. My wife gives me somethin’ for my allergies in the spring, but I don’t remember what it is. She handles all that. I just take the pills she gives me. I never really paid attention to the names. She’s a good woman, my wife. Very organized. She'd know all that stuff. What kinda tests are we talkin’ about for the tiredness, Doc? Is it gonna hurt?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Murph. We can always check your medication list with your pharmacy later. No need to worry about that right now. For the tiredness, I’d like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid test. These will help us rule out things like anemia, kidney problems, and thyroid issues, which can all cause fatigue. The blood draw itself is a quick pinch—you might feel a little discomfort, but it shouldn’t hurt much. Would you like me to order those tests for you today?
PATIENT: Tests… well, if you think it’s best, Doc. I trust your judgment. A little pinch, you say? Okay. As long as it don't take too long. I got a lunch date with my wife later. She makes a mean sandwich. Go ahead and order ‘em. What do I need to do? Just gotta give ‘em some blood? Do I need to eat somethin’ special beforehand? Or not eat? My son always tells me what to do… but I forget.
DOCTOR: You’ve got it, Mr. Murph. I’ve ordered the tests now. You don't need to do anything special beforehand. You can eat and drink as normal. And you don’t need to fast. The lab will take care of everything. They'll just need a small sample of blood. The lab is just down the hall, room 102. They’ll take about 15-20 minutes. After that, we’ll get the results back in a few days, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—like chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant dizziness—please call the clinic right away. Do you have any questions for me before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it, Doc. Chest pain… shortness of breath… I’ll remember that. My wife will remind me anyway. She’s got a good memory. Alright, guess I’ll go get poked. Thanks for lookin’ at me, Doc. You seem like a nice fella. Room 102, you said? Okay. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Murph. It was a pleasure meeting you. And don’t worry, the lab staff are very gentle. If you have any questions or concerns after your blood draw, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. Have a good day, and enjoy your lunch date with your wife! .
