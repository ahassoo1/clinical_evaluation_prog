DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. I’m Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doc. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's these bumps on my legs. On my shins, mostly. They’re kinda red and...well, they hurt. Not all the time, but when I rub against somethin', or if I'm standin' for too long. Been botherin' me for a couple weeks now.
DOCTOR: Okay, bumps on your shins that are red and painful, especially with friction or prolonged standing. A couple of weeks, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, about two weeks, give or take. It started small, just a little itchy. I didn't think much of it at first, just figured it was a bug bite or somethin'. But then they got redder and started hurtin’ more. My wife, she told me to come see someone, said it didn’t look right. She's usually right about these things.
DOCTOR: It's always good to listen to your wife! So, it started as itchy, then progressed to red and painful. Have you noticed any changes in the bumps themselves – size, shape, number?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. They haven't gotten huge, you know? Maybe a little bigger than a pea, some of 'em. There’s...I don’t know, maybe six or seven now? Started with just a couple, and they kinda spread. They’re all kinda round-ish, and hard to the touch. Not like, filled with pus or anything. Just…bumpy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so about six or seven bumps, pea-sized, round, hard, and not draining. Have you tried anything to treat them yourself – creams, lotions, anything at all?
PATIENT: Not really, Doc. I put some lotion on 'em once or twice, but it didn't seem to do nothin'. I mostly just try to avoid bumpin’ 'em. I work, you know, movin' stuff around. Can’t always be careful. My wife, she put some of that Vicks VapoRub on one, but I told her, I don't think that’s gonna do much. But she worries.
DOCTOR: It’s good she’s looking out for you! Vicks VapoRub...well, sometimes people try all sorts of things. Alright, let’s take a look at those shins. If you don’t mind?
PATIENT: Oh, sure, go ahead. Here. Be careful, they’re a little sensitive. I try to keep 'em covered, but it's been hot out, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. I see them. They are reddish, slightly raised, and firm to the touch. There doesn't appear to be any open skin or drainage. I’m noting some mild inflammation around the bumps. Do you have any history of diabetes, Mr. Aluia?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Not that I know of. Never been told I have it. My wife keeps track of all that stuff, but I haven't heard nothin' about it. I get my check-ups, you know, but they always tell me I’m just a little high blood pressure. They give me a pill for that. Does that have somethin' to do with the bumps?
DOCTOR: It can, sometimes. High blood pressure itself doesn’t directly cause bumps, but it can contribute to circulation issues, which can sometimes play a role. And diabetes can sometimes cause skin changes. It’s good you’re getting regular check-ups and taking medication for your blood pressure. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I've taken penicillin a couple times when I had a bad cold, and never had no reaction. I get a little heartburn sometimes, so I take that stuff…Tums, I think it is. But other than that, nothin'. My wife will probably know better, to be honest. She remembers all that stuff.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you have a good wife who looks out for you! Okay, no known allergies. Now, just to get a clearer picture, can you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Well, I work at the warehouse down by the docks. I unload stuff off the trucks, move boxes around, stack 'em on pallets… pretty physical work, you know? Lots of standin', lots of walkin', lots of bendin'. It can be hot and dusty in there sometimes. Been doin' it for… oh, must be fifteen years now. It's honest work, but it's hard on the body.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a physically demanding job at a warehouse, involving prolonged standing, walking, and bending, potentially with exposure to dust. Based on what you've told me, and what I see, these bumps could be a few things. One possibility is stasis dermatitis – that’s often associated with circulation issues and prolonged standing. Another possibility is a form of contact dermatitis, if something at work is irritating your skin. Sometimes, it's difficult to say for sure without a little more information. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a simple blood test. It will check your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and some markers of inflammation. Also, I can take a small scraping of one of the bumps to look at under a microscope, just to rule out any infection. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Blood test and a scrapin'? Sounds… thorough, Doc. I guess if you think it's necessary. I don't like needles much, but I can handle it. As long as it helps figure out what's goin' on. What will the scrapin' feel like?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be a little worried about needles. We'll be quick and gentle with the blood draw. And the scraping is usually very mild – it's a quick brush of the skin surface, like a gentle exfoliation. You might feel a tiny bit of pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. We'll use a local anesthetic if you're particularly sensitive. The lab results usually take a few days to come back. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your legs whenever you can, especially after work. And I'm going to prescribe a mild topical steroid cream to help reduce the inflammation and itching. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Elevate my legs and some cream… yeah, that sounds doable. Cream's good, I can handle that. As long as it doesn't smell too strong, my wife doesn’t like strong smells. And the blood test… okay, let's get it over with. Where do we do that? Is it here at the clinic?
DOCTOR: Good to know about the smell! I’ll make sure it's a mild, unscented cream. Yes, we can do the blood test right here in the clinic. The phlebotomist, Maria, is very good – she’s very gentle. She’ll come in and draw the sample in just a few minutes. After that, we’ll apply the cream to one of the bumps as a demonstration, and you can start using it at home. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doc. Just…try to be quick with the needle, okay? And thanks for explainin' everything so clear. My wife's gonna be glad I came. Let's get this done.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. And I’m glad I could help. Maria will be in shortly to draw your blood. Please let me or one of the nurses know if you feel any discomfort at any point. We’re here to help.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doc. I appreciate it. Let’s get it done.
