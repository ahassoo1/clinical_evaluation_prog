DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Panjoj. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Just Venna is fine. My blood pressure’s been actin’ up, that’s why I’m here. Seems to get higher and higher lately. My late husband, bless his soul, used to keep track of it, but... well, it's been a bit since then.
DOCTOR: I understand, Venna. It’s perfectly alright. Losing a spouse is never easy, and it's common for things to feel a bit overwhelming afterwards. High blood pressure can be a concern, and it's good you're getting it checked. Could you tell me a little more about when you noticed it starting to be a problem?
PATIENT: Hmm… when, you say? That’s a good question. It’s been… a few months, I reckon. Maybe since the spring? I’ve just been feelin’ more tired than usual, and gettin’ headaches now and then. Not terrible headaches, mind you, just… persistent. And my daughter, she noticed I was breathin’ a little heavy when I was helpin’ her with the garden last month. That's when she really told me to come see someone. She worries somethin' fierce, that girl.
DOCTOR: That’s very good of your daughter to encourage you to come in. It's always helpful to have someone looking out for us. Tiredness and headaches can be related to blood pressure, and shortness of breath is something we definitely want to investigate further. Do you happen to know what your blood pressure readings were when your husband was monitoring them?
PATIENT: Well now, that’s where my memory gets a little fuzzy. He kept a little notebook, but I haven't seen it since... well, since he passed. I think he said it was usually around… 120 over somethin’? But I’m real bad with numbers, always have been. He did the writin’ and I did the bakin’, you see. Did that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Venna. No need to worry about numbers – that's what I’m here for. Around 120/80 is considered normal, so that gives us a baseline. Now, let's talk about other things that might be going on. Have you been experiencing any chest pain, or any vision changes?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, thankfully not. Not a bit. And my eyesight’s been gettin’ a little blurry lately, but I figured that’s just old age catchin’ up with me. I’ve always needed glasses, you see. Never had trouble seein things, just… readin’ small print’s gettin’ harder. I mostly make pies and cakes anyway, don’t need perfect vision for that! But no real changes in my vision, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Blurry vision can be related to a lot of things, so we’ll make a note of that. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other health conditions, like diabetes or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No diabetes, not that I know of. My mama always said I had a sweet tooth, but never anything serious. As for kidney problems... I don’t think so. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. Used to spend hours walkin’ in the woods with my husband, collectin’ berries and herbs. Maybe that kept me healthy! But I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh, goodness, I don't even remember. Years, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful that you were so active. Being outdoors is very good for your health. It’s alright that it’s been a while since your last check-up, we'll get you back on track. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me see… no surgeries, not ever. And I haven’t been in a hospital since I was born, thank goodness! A little flu here and there, a sprained ankle once when I was a teenager, but nothin’ serious enough for a hospital. Mostly I just wrapped it up and kept bakin’. My mama always said a little flour and sugar could cure anything. Probably not true, but it made me feel better!
DOCTOR: That’s a lovely sentiment, Venna! Sometimes a little comfort food is the best medicine. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any health problems that run in your family – like heart disease, stroke, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well, my mama… she had a weak heart, I think. She tired easily, and sat a lot. But she never went to doctors much, either. Just like me! And my papa… he was a strong man, worked hard all his life, but I think he had a touch of somethin’ wrong with his kidneys, now that I think about it. He swelled up some in his legs when he got older. I don’t rightly know what it was, nobody talked much about sickness back then. Just… people got tired, and they passed on. It weren't like it is today, with all the tests and doctors and such.
DOCTOR: That gives me some helpful information, Venna. Weak heart and swelling in the legs… those are both things we'll keep in mind. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Land sakes, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I might have a sip of wine with dinner on a special occasion, but nothin’ regular. Mostly I drink water. Gotta stay hydrated when you're bakin’ all day, you know! And my husband… he wasn't one for smokin’ or drinkin’ neither. He liked a good cup of coffee, though. That's about it. We mostly just lived simple lives.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful. A simple, healthy lifestyle is always best. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, nothin' at all. I don't hold with takin' a lot of pills if I can avoid it. Just a little honey for my throat when I have a cold, and that's about it. I used to make my own elderberry syrup, but I haven't gotten around to it lately. Too tired, I suppose. Mostly, I just rely on a good night’s sleep and a little fresh air.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venna. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your legs and feet. It’ll just take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, ma'am, that's fine. Go right ahead. I reckon I've been poked and prodded enough by life to not mind a little more. Just let me know if anything feels… strange.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 160 over 95. That’s higher than we’d like, which confirms what you told me. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Your heart sounds a little strong, and I can hear some slight crackling in your lungs. It's not alarming, but we'll want to investigate further. I do notice some mild swelling in your ankles. Does that cause any pain?
PATIENT: Well now, that don’t surprise me none. I feel all puffed up sometimes, especially at the end of the day. That pressin’… it's a little tender, yes, but nothin’ awful. Just… uncomfortable. Like my feet’s been crammed in shoes too long. I used to wear better shoes, but my feet changed over the years, you know. Hard to find comfortable ones these days.
DOCTOR: That makes sense, Venna. Changes in your feet over time can certainly contribute to discomfort and swelling. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings – the elevated blood pressure, crackling in your lungs, and swelling in your ankles – it sounds like you may be developing some mild heart failure and possibly some fluid buildup due to the high blood pressure. It’s important to rule out other causes, though. I’d like to order some blood tests and a chest X-ray to get a better look at what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Land sakes, heart failure? That sounds… serious. But if that’s what it is, I reckon it’s best to know, right? Tests and an X-ray… yes, go right ahead. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I just want to feel like myself again, and stop feelin’ so tired all the time. Just let me know when and where to go for these tests. I don’t mind a little inconvenience if it means gettin’ better.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right, Venna. It’s always best to know what we’re dealing with. And it’s good to be proactive. The tests will help us determine the best course of action. I'll have the nurse schedule you for blood work and a chest X-ray at the clinic tomorrow morning. They'll let you know what time to come in. The results usually take a couple of days to come back. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a low-dose diuretic, a water pill, to help reduce some of the fluid buildup. It'll help with the swelling in your ankles and make it easier to breathe. I’ll also recommend limiting your salt intake and drinking plenty of water. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, ma'am, not that I know of. I’ve never had a problem with any pills before, but I haven't taken many, like I said. A water pill… that sounds alright. As long as it don’t make me need to run to the bathroom all the time! Salt… well, I like a little salt on my tomatoes, but I reckon I can cut back. I mostly use it for bakin’ anyway. What about tomatoes? Can I still have my tomatoes?
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Venna! Tomatoes are perfectly fine in moderation. The goal is to reduce added salt, not eliminate all salt from your diet. You can still enjoy your tomatoes – just be mindful of how much salt you’re adding. I’ll write down the name of the diuretic, the dosage, and instructions on how to take it. It's called Furosemide, 20 milligrams, once a day in the morning. Be sure to take it with a full glass of water. I'm also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks, once we have the test results, to discuss them and adjust your treatment plan if needed. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Furosemide… I can try to remember that. Two weeks… yes, that sounds good. I’ll mark it on my calendar right away. Thank you, Doctor. You've been real kind, explainin' everything so clear. I feel a little better just knowin’ what’s goin’ on. Now, is there anything else I need to do? Or are we all set for now?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venna. I'm glad I could help. For now, just focus on taking the Furosemide as prescribed, limiting your salt intake, and drinking plenty of water. If you experience any dizziness, shortness of breath, or significant swelling, please call the clinic right away. I'll have the nurse give you a handout with information about heart failure and a low-sodium diet. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything real thorough. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to an old lady like me. And thank you for not makin’ me feel foolish askin’ about my tomatoes! I reckon I'll just go home and rest a little, and try to get my calendar sorted out. You have a good day now, Doctor. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Venna. It was a pleasure meeting you. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and I’ll see you in two weeks. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Thank you kindly, Doctor. You have a good day too.
