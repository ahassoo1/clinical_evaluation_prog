DOCTOR: Right. Well, Mrs. Kelder, please, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor… Batara, is it? Yes, thank you. Well, it’s my stomach, mostly. It just… doesn’t feel right. I get sick to it pretty easily now, even if I only eat a little bit. And I feel full so fast. It's been going on for a little while, I reckon. Not sure exactly how long, things kinda blur together these days.
DOCTOR: Right. “Doesn’t feel right” is… not terribly helpful, Mrs. Kelder. We need specifics. When you say “sick to it,” are we talking nausea?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes, nausea. That’s a fancy word for it, isn’t it? Yes, that’s what it is. Just feeling like I’m going to… well, you know. And it doesn’t take much to bring it on. Even things I used to love. Like… what was I saying? Oh, the eating. It just doesn’t feel good anymore. Not like it used to. I get full after just a few bites. It’s… worrying, I suppose.
DOCTOR: “Worrying” is also not a diagnosis, Mrs. Kelder. How long ago did this start happening?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. It feels like… a while. Maybe a couple of months? It’s hard to say, honestly. Everything sort of… blends together these days. It wasn't sudden, it just… crept up on me, I think. I don't remember a specific day or anything. My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. I do remember my husband used to say I had a good appetite… that feels like a lifetime ago.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a gradual onset of nausea and early satiety—feeling full quickly—over approximately two months. And you’ve noticed this is affecting your ability to eat things you previously enjoyed. Are you experiencing any pain?
PATIENT: Pain… hmm. Not really pain, no. More like… discomfort. A sort of fullness, like I said, but… higher up, I guess? In my tummy. It’s not a sharp pain, just… unpleasant. It doesn’t come and go, really. It’s just… there. And sometimes I feel a little… bloated, I think that’s the word. Does that make any sense? I’m not very good at describing things.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, discomfort, bloating, and early satiety. No sharp pain. Are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh… let me think. Well, I've been feeling… tired. More tired than usual, I suppose. And a little… weak. Not like I can’t get around, but just… easily worn out. And… oh! Sometimes I feel a little… out of breath. Not when I’m doing anything strenuous, just… sometimes. It comes and goes. Is that important? I don't know what’s important anymore.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, weakness, and intermittent shortness of breath. Right. And are you having any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… bowel habits. That’s a… personal question, isn’t it? Well… not really. Everything seems pretty normal there, I think. Maybe a little… less regular than usual, but nothing drastic. I haven’t noticed anything… concerning. Does that answer your question? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at talking about these things.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant changes in bowel habits. Now, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Oh… now that you mention it… I think so. My clothes feel a little looser than they used to, but I just figured it was because… well, because I haven't been eating much lately. I haven't weighed myself in ages, I don't even have a scale anymore. But yes… I suppose I have lost a little weight. It wasn’t on purpose, though.
DOCTOR: Right. Weight loss, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, nausea, early satiety… Mrs. Kelder, you’re quite a complex case. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any significant medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. Let me think. I had my gallbladder out years ago, but that was a long time ago and I haven't had any problems with it since. And… well, a few years back, the doctor found something… on a scan. It was… cancer, I think. In my… stomach, maybe? I had some treatments, but… I can't remember much about it. It was a stressful time. They said it was… in remission, I think that’s the word. But I haven't been back to that doctor in a while. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: “A bit of a blur”?
PATIENT: Oh, I’m sorry, Doctor. It truly is. Things just… fade, you know? It's not that I’m trying to be difficult, it's just… my memory. I do remember going to the hospital, and having tests, and… feeling very sick. And the treatments… they weren't pleasant. But the details… they escape me. I had a lovely nurse, though. She was very kind. But the cancer… I think it was stomach cancer, yes. And they said it was under control. But I haven’t had any follow-ups since then. I just… didn’t want to deal with it, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right. So, history of stomach cancer in remission, no follow-up care. Let’s move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications?
PATIENT: Oh… let me see. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but the doctor took me off of it a long time ago. Said I didn't need it anymore. And… I take a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. Just when it flares up. It's over the counter, though. Aleve, I think it’s called. And… that’s about it. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. They make me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: Right. Aleve as needed for arthritis. And no allergies that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a little girl, but I haven't been stung in years. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, as far as I can remember. Although… now that you mention it, I did get a bit of a rash when I took that antibiotic for my tooth a few years back. But it wasn’t anything serious. It went away on its own. Is that important? I always forget these things…
DOCTOR: Alright. A possible mild reaction to an antibiotic. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I don’t mind. I’m used to doctors poking and prodding. Just… be gentle, if you would. My stomach’s been a little sensitive lately, as I said.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, though slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen… is soft, but there is some mild tenderness in the epigastric region. No guarding or rebound tenderness. No palpable masses. There’s some mild fullness, consistent with your description. Bowel sounds are… hypoactive. Alright. That's what I expected.
PATIENT: Oh… that doesn’t sound very good, does it? Hypoactive… what does that mean? Is something wrong? Is it the cancer? Has it come back? I… I don’t want to go through all that again. It was awful.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kelder, please. Let’s not jump to conclusions. “Hypoactive” simply means your bowel sounds are quieter than usual. It can be caused by a number of things—dehydration, medication, even just a little bit of constipation. It doesn’t automatically mean the cancer has returned. However, given your history, and your current symptoms—weight loss, fatigue, nausea, early satiety, hypoactive bowel sounds—I think we need to order some tests to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. We'll need a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool test to rule out any infection. And I think we need to schedule an endoscopy.
PATIENT: An endoscopy… Oh dear. That sounds… unpleasant. What does that involve? Is it… painful? I really don’t like doctors poking around inside me. Is there… is there any other way? I just… I don’t want to go through all that again. It was so frightening last time. Could we… could we try something else first? Maybe just some medication?
DOCTOR: Mrs. Kelder, with all due respect, “something else” won’t provide us with the answers we need. An endoscopy is the most accurate way to visualize your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum and determine the cause of your symptoms. It’s the gold standard. Yes, it’s a procedure, and yes, it requires some preparation. We’ll give you a sedative to keep you comfortable during the procedure. And it's the only way to definitively rule out a recurrence of the cancer. We can discuss the risks and benefits in detail, of course. But I strongly recommend it. If we delay diagnosis, we risk allowing any potential problem to worsen. I will order the blood tests and stool test, but I want to schedule that endoscopy as soon as possible.
PATIENT: Oh… I… I don’t know. It all sounds so scary. And I don’t want to know if the cancer is back. Sometimes, it’s better not to know, isn't it? But you’re right… delaying things probably isn’t a good idea. Alright. Alright, go ahead and schedule the endoscopy. But… please, make sure I get a good sedative. And… could I have someone with me? My niece, Sarah… she's very good with me. Just… promise me you’ll explain everything very carefully. And that you’ll take good care of me. I’m just… so frightened.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Kelder. We will explain everything very carefully, and you can absolutely have Sarah accompany you. We’ll ensure you’re as comfortable as possible throughout the entire process. I’ll have the nurse schedule the endoscopy for next week, and we’ll call you with the details. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms—severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool—please go to the emergency room immediately. I’m going to prescribe a medication for nausea to help manage your symptoms until the endoscopy. Here you go. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We'll get to the bottom of this, Mrs. Kelder. Now, let's get you scheduled, alright?
