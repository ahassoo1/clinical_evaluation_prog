DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s lovely to meet you as well. Well, I requested to come in… it’s about getting tested for HIV. It’s something I’ve been wanting to do for a while now, and I thought it was finally time.
DOCTOR: That’s very responsible of you, Ms. Shaub. It’s good you’re taking this step. To ensure we proceed appropriately, could you tell me a little more about what prompted you to get tested now?
PATIENT: Oh, well… it’s not any one thing, really. Just… a bit of worry, you know? I’ve been with my husband for a long time, thankfully, but life happens. And I just want to be certain, for both our sakes. Better safe than sorry, that’s what I always say. Is that enough information, Doctor? I don’t really know what you need to know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Ms. Shaub. It’s good to be proactive, and wanting peace of mind is a very valid reason. To clarify, when you say “life happens,” are you referring to any recent changes in your or your husband’s health, or any potential exposures outside of your established relationship?
PATIENT: No, no changes in health, thankfully. And no… not exposures, exactly. It’s just… I travel a bit for church functions, you see. Different states, different people. And even though nothing happened, it made me think. It’s probably silly, really. Old woman worrying too much. But my husband… he deserves to know we’re both safe, you understand?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Shaub, it's not silly at all. It’s very thoughtful of you to consider your husband's well-being, and travel does introduce variables. It’s always best to be cautious. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Let’s see… I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I had my children naturally, no complications there. About ten years ago, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure, and I take medication for that now. Other than that… just the aches and pains of getting older, I suppose! I haven’t been to a doctor regularly, if I’m honest, except for check-ups with my primary care physician for the blood pressure. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Shaub. Thank you. And it’s good you’re being monitored for your blood pressure. Could you please tell me the name of the medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s a little white pill. Oh dear, I’m terrible with names. It starts with an “A”, I believe. Amlodipine? Is that right? My daughter helps me manage my medications, so I don’t always remember the specifics. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine is correct, Ms. Shaub. No need to apologize at all. It’s common to have trouble remembering medication names. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not even as a child. My mother always said I had a strong stomach. But I suppose it’s always best to be sure… I don’t recall ever being allergic to penicillin, if that means anything. But other than that, no, I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, before we proceed with the HIV testing, I want to briefly discuss the different testing options available. There are different types of tests with varying waiting times for results. We can do a rapid test today, which provides preliminary results within about 20-30 minutes, but it may require a confirmatory test later. Or, we can send a sample to the lab, which takes a few days, but is generally considered more accurate. Which option would you prefer?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds complicated. Well, if it means a more accurate result, I suppose waiting a few days is fine. I don’t mind waiting, really. It’s not like I’m in a rush. Accuracy is the most important thing, isn’t it? So, the lab test then, please. If that's alright.
DOCTOR: That’s a very sensible choice, Ms. Shaub. Accuracy is indeed important. We’ll send a blood sample to the lab for testing. Before we draw the blood, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, just to get a general overview of your health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable. I have… rather sensitive skin, you see. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Shaub. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, I’ll check your blood pressure. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Finally, I’ll palpate your abdomen. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That’s a bit elevated, but not surprising given your history. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears are clear. Nose is clear. Throat is clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Everything seems within normal limits at this point, Ms. Shaub. We'll just need to draw a small sample of blood now for the HIV testing. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Everything sounds… reassuring, actually. I appreciate you being so thorough. And yes, let’s get the blood draw done. I'm ready when you are. Just… try not to poke too hard, if you don't mind!
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shaub. I’ll be as gentle as possible. This may sting for a moment. All done. Just keep that bandage on for about fifteen minutes to prevent any bleeding. The lab results should be available in approximately three to five business days. We'll contact you as soon as they are available. Do you have a preferred method of contact – phone or email?
PATIENT: Oh, that wasn’t so bad, actually. Thank you, Doctor. Email would be best, please. My email address is tierney.shaub@emailprovider.com. That’s t-i-e-r-n-e-y dot s-h-a-u-b at emailprovider dot com. And please, don’t hesitate to call if there are any urgent concerns. I really appreciate you taking such good care of me.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Shaub. I've noted your email address. We’ll send the results to tierney.shaub@emailprovider.com as soon as they’re available. While we’re waiting for the HIV results, it’s important to continue managing your blood pressure. Are you taking your medication as prescribed?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. Mostly. My daughter helps me keep track of it, you see. Sometimes I forget, if I'm honest. But she reminds me, thankfully. She's a good girl. I try to eat healthy too, but… church suppers are my weakness! But I’m trying. Really, I am. I know it’s important. Is there anything else I should be doing to help keep my blood pressure down?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Shaub. Having support is very helpful. And church suppers are tempting! Besides medication and diet, regular exercise can also significantly lower blood pressure. Even a short walk each day can make a difference. Also, reducing stress levels is important. Do you have any hobbies or activities that you find relaxing?
PATIENT: Oh, I do love to garden, Doctor. It's very therapeutic, getting my hands in the soil. And I sing in the church choir, that’s very relaxing too. Though sometimes the soprano section… well, let’s just say it can be stressful! But overall, those things help. I try to take things easy, you know? Life is too short to worry too much. Although, waiting for these test results is making me a bit anxious, if I'm honest. But I'm trying to keep busy.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Ms. Shaub. Gardening and singing are excellent ways to manage stress. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious while waiting for results. Try to focus on those enjoyable activities to keep your mind occupied. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't believe so. You’ve been very thorough and helpful. I truly appreciate your kindness and patience. Thank you for everything. I feel much better knowing I’m taking care of this. I’ll just wait for the email, then. Have a lovely day.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Shaub. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before the results arrive. You have a lovely day as well. .
