DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor... it's a bit of a bother coming all this way. My skin... it's darkening. And I’m always tired. Just… perpetually fatigued. It’s quite inconvenient, really. I haven’t much time to waste, you understand.
DOCTOR: Darkening skin and fatigue. Right. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… a while. Weeks, perhaps? Months? It all blurs together, you see. I simply can’t keep track these days. It’s not as if I’m… idle. A man needs to work, Doctor. Even at my age. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Weeks to months, alright. And is there anything specifically making it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Goodness, Doctor, it’s quite general! I work hard, as I mentioned. Rebar, you know. Reinforcing iron. It's… physical labor. Do you expect me to be peppy after a day of that? I suspect it’s simply the work. Though my wife keeps fussing about sun exposure… a woman’s worries. Utter nonsense, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay. Sun exposure can be a factor. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well… I suppose I’m a bit… forgetful. Though that's hardly new. And my appetite isn’t what it used to be. But that’s just getting old, Doctor. I’m eighty-five years old! What would you expect? Honestly, I fail to see what all the fuss is about. Is there anything concrete you can tell me? Because my schedule is quite… demanding.
DOCTOR: Alright. Forgetfulness and decreased appetite. And you're working with rebar... Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? Goodness, Doctor! Is this truly necessary? I came here because my skin is darkening, not to discuss… that. Really. I… I believe I’ve answered your questions sufficiently. I’m not entirely certain what all this probing is for. I simply wish to know if this skin discoloration is something serious, or if it’s merely a consequence of honest labor. Are we getting anywhere? Because frankly, my time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s just do a quick exam, then. I need to check your skin, feel your abdomen... basic things. It won't take long. Just lie back on the table, please.
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor... all this fuss. I’ve lived a long life, and I’ve never needed this level of… scrutiny. I suppose if you insist. But do be quick about it, if you please. My back isn't what it used to be, you know. And I haven't got all day. Get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your abdomen feels… normal. Skin is definitely darker in patches. No obvious masses or tenderness. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 72. I'm going to order some basic blood work. CBC, CMP, liver function tests... just to rule things out. Also, a TSH. You said you're fatigued, and we should check your thyroid. We'll get the results back in a few days. .
PATIENT: Tests? Goodness, more waiting. And all for… fatigue? Honestly, Doctor, I suspect it’s simply the work. But very well. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And please, send the results to my home address. I rarely check… whatever it is you young doctors use these days. My wife handles such things. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have work to return to. Honestly, the inconvenience… .
