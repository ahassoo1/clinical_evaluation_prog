DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I already told the nurse. This… this has been going on for weeks. Severe diarrhea. Nothing seems to help it. I've tried everything the drugstore sells, and it’s just… persistent. Frankly, it's embarrassing to even talk about. Can we just get this sorted?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Woodring. I understand it’s uncomfortable to discuss these matters, and I appreciate you coming in to address it. We’ll certainly do our best to get to the bottom of this. To start, could you tell me a bit more about this diarrhea?
PATIENT: What do you mean "a bit more"? It’s diarrhea. I go to the bathroom constantly. It’s watery. It’s… unpleasant. I don’t need a detailed description of what I experience when I have diarrhea, do I? I just want to know what's wrong and what I need to take to make it stop. Honestly, I don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize if my questions seem repetitive. It’s important for me to gather a comprehensive history to ensure I can accurately assess the situation and determine the best course of action. When did this diarrhea begin?
PATIENT: Oh, jeez. Let me think… weeks ago. Honestly, I wasn’t really paying attention to the exact date. Probably around the beginning of July, maybe? It started gradually, just a little off, and then it just got worse and worse. Does it really matter when it started? It’s happening now.
DOCTOR: It can be helpful, Ms. Woodring. Knowing the timeline can sometimes point us in the right direction. Has anything specific coincided with the start of the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Coincided? What are you, a detective? No, nothing coincided! I didn’t eat anything weird, I didn’t travel anywhere exotic, I haven’t been sick with anything else. Life just… happened. And then my stomach decided to revolt. It's just... bad luck, I guess. Look, I don’t believe in dwelling on the past. I need a solution for the present.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Woodring. We can focus on the present. Are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Well, I’m tired. Constantly running to the bathroom is exhausting, you know? And… my stomach cramps a bit. Not horribly, just uncomfortable. And I haven’t really felt like eating much, but honestly, who does when their stomach is… like that? That's about it. No fever, no vomiting, nothing dramatic. Just… miserable.
DOCTOR: I understand. Fatigue and loss of appetite are certainly common with this sort of thing. Have you noticed any blood or mucus in your stool?
PATIENT: Ugh. Really? Do you have to ask about that? Look, I'm not going to get into the specifics of my… bathroom habits. It's… personal. If it was something serious, I would have said something already. Just assume no, alright? Let’s just skip that line of questioning. It’s disgusting.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Ms. Woodring. I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable. It’s a standard question to rule out certain conditions, but I respect your boundaries. Let’s move on then. Have you taken any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – for this diarrhea?
PATIENT: Yes! I told the nurse. I tried everything from the drugstore. Imodium, Pepto-Bismol, those little packets… everything. They helped for like, an hour, maybe, and then it just started all over again. It's a waste of money, honestly. And nothing has really made a lasting difference. I'm starting to think this is just something I have to… live with.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any other medications regularly, for any other condition?
PATIENT: No. Just a multivitamin, sometimes. Old habit, my mother always said. Nothing for anything serious. I'm generally healthy, you know? This diarrhea thing is just… a blip. A very annoying, persistent blip. Can we just get to the part where you tell me what I need to take to fix it? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Understood, Ms. Woodring. To get a better understanding, and before suggesting a treatment plan, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't see why that's relevant. I’ve never been seriously sick. A few colds, the flu now and then, but nothing a little rest and chicken soup couldn’t fix. No chronic anything. I'm a healthy person who is currently suffering from a very unpleasant bowel problem, and that's what we should be focusing on. Look, are you going to help me or are you just going to ask me a million questions?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize if it feels like I’m taking a long time. It’s simply important to get a complete picture. Okay, let’s move on. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No! Look, I’ve lived a normal life. No surgeries, no major illnesses, no… anything. I'm not a complicated case. I just have… diarrhea. Can we please focus on that? I feel like I'm being interrogated. I'm starting to regret even coming in here. Honestly, I think I could have just ridden it out. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Woodring, I understand your frustration and I assure you, I’m not trying to interrogate you. I want to help you. However, based on the information you’ve provided, it’s difficult to determine the cause of your diarrhea and the best course of treatment. I would like to perform a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It would involve listening to your abdomen and checking for any tenderness. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
