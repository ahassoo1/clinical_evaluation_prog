DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, Doctor, I haven't got all day. It’s about this…procedure. My daughter booked it, frankly. Says I'm looking “worn.” Honestly. I just need a note saying I’m fit enough to…get it done. Terrazzo work isn't easy on the body, you know. Been doing it for sixty years. Sixty! What do you think?
DOCTOR: Sixty years is…remarkable, Mr. Orwin. I appreciate your directness. Just to be thorough, even with a note being the primary goal, could you tell me a little more about this procedure your daughter has arranged?
PATIENT: Oh, it's…face tightening. Some sort of lift, I suppose. Honestly, I don't pay attention to those things. She found some fancy doctor in the city. All very expensive, I'm sure. Just needs a piece of paper saying my heart can handle being…put under. Is that so hard? I’ve had a check-up every year with old man Hemlock back home for decades. Never a problem.
DOCTOR: I understand. A face tightening procedure, requiring a medical clearance. It is important to ensure your heart is healthy enough for anesthesia, absolutely. And you've been seeing Dr. Hemlock regularly – that’s good to know. Do you happen to recall any specific conditions he’s noted over the years?
PATIENT: Conditions? Well, he always said my blood pressure runs a little high. Old man's worry, that was. “Watch the salt,” he'd say. I've tried. Not easy when your wife makes lutefisk every Christmas. And…arthritis, I suppose. In my hands mostly. Makes the work harder, naturally. But I manage. Honestly, I don't need a full examination. Just tell me what I need to sign so I can get this over with. My daughter is expecting me back by one.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I completely understand your time is valuable, and I do appreciate your patience. However, even a simple clearance requires some assessment to ensure your safety. High blood pressure and arthritis are important details. Do you know what your blood pressure readings typically are?
PATIENT: Readings? Doctor, I haven't memorized numbers since high school! Hemlock used to write them on a little card, but my daughter has it now, probably for this. Look, are you going to do the clearance or not? I’ve got things to do. This whole thing is a waste of my time, frankly. I’m a sturdy Norwegian, not some fragile…city fellow.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I assure you I’m not questioning your strength. It's simply my professional responsibility to gather enough information. It’s for your well-being. Let me see if I can access Dr. Hemlock’s records through the system. Perhaps that will provide the necessary details. One moment, please.
PATIENT: Honestly, the bureaucracy of it all. You'd think sixty years of honest work would be enough of a medical history. And what if he isn't in the system? Are you going to send me home empty-handed? My daughter will have a fit. She's very…particular.
DOCTOR: It appears Dr. Hemlock’s practice uses a different electronic health record system, and we don’t have direct access. However, I do see a note here from your primary care physician, Dr. Albright, from six months ago. It mentions controlled hypertension and osteoarthritis, as you mentioned. She also noted a slightly elevated cholesterol level. To proceed safely with the procedure, I would like to perform a brief physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure today. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Elevated cholesterol... Another thing to worry about. Fine, fine. Listen to your heart and lungs. Get it over with. But make it quick. I really haven't got all day, Doctor. And don't expect me to undress or anything. Just…the usual. Blood pressure cuff, I suppose. And point that listening thing at my chest. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. Just the basics. Relax your arm for me, please. Blood pressure is 148 over 86. Slightly elevated, as Dr. Albright noted. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Lungs are clear, but breathing is a little shallow. The murmur is likely age-related, but I would like to order an EKG just to be certain, and also a basic metabolic panel to check your cholesterol and kidney function. It’s a precaution, but important before undergoing anesthesia.
PATIENT: An EKG? A metabolic panel? Now you're just trying to pad your bill! Look, I've lived a long life. I’ve built things, Doctor. I haven't keeled over yet. This is ridiculous. I’m starting to think my daughter is trying to get rid of me. Are you seriously telling me I need more tests just to have a little tightening done? .
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration. However, these tests aren’t about increasing my bill, they are about ensuring your safety during the procedure. Anesthesia can put strain on your heart, and it’s my responsibility to rule out any potential issues. While you’ve lived a long and productive life, that doesn’t mean we can disregard potential health concerns. Given your slightly elevated blood pressure, the heart murmur, and the mention of elevated cholesterol, I strongly recommend postponing the procedure until we have the results of these tests. If everything comes back normal, we can proceed with the clearance. However, proceeding without these basic assessments could be detrimental to your health. Would you be willing to consider that?
