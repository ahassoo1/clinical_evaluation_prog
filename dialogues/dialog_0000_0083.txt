DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Kammer, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Early Kammer. I have an appointment... about a card? A get-well card, I think the lady on the phone said. It’s a little silly, but… well. I just need something from the doctor, you understand?
DOCTOR: A…card?
PATIENT: Yes. Not for me, exactly. It's for a… a friend. He’s not feeling so good, you see. I thought a card from you, Doctor… well, it would mean a lot. More than from, you know, just anyone. You are a doctor, a respectable person. It’s encouragement he needs, really. Not medicine, not bandages… just a nice word.
DOCTOR: So, you want me to…write a get-well card for your friend based on…what exactly?
PATIENT: Well, I don’t know exactly what to tell you. He’s… down. Just generally down. Not eating, not sleeping. He used to be a strong man, a very strong man, but… things happen, you know? A little encouragement, a little “keep your chin up” from a doctor… that's all I’m asking. It’s just… a lot of folks don't listen to me, but they listen to doctors. You understand? A little paper with some nice words. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, with all due respect, I am a physician. I diagnose and treat medical conditions. I don't…compose motivational correspondence. I need to understand why your friend isn't eating or sleeping. Is this a recent change?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, now you’re getting… technical. I just thought, you know, a doctor is a healer. And sometimes healing is… more than just pills. He hasn't been himself for… a few months now, maybe. Longer. He used to love to fish, build things with his hands. Now he just… sits. He says he’s tired. Very, very tired. And he worries a lot. I don’t know what he worries about, exactly. He doesn't talk much these days. That’s why I thought a card... a little pick-me-up... would help. But if you need details… I don’t have them. I just see him. He’s a good man. A very good man.
DOCTOR: Hmm. According to this, you brought him in six months ago with complaints of… fatigue and early satiety. Weight loss was noted. Did he follow up with any specialists as recommended?
PATIENT: Specialists? Oh, dear. No, no specialists. He doesn't like doctors. Says they poke and prod and don't listen. He’s a stubborn man, my friend. Very stubborn. He said he just needed to rest. I tried to get him to go, believe me, I did. But he wouldn't hear of it. He says he's fine, just… old. That’s what he says. Old and tired. Now, about that card… is it too much trouble? I’m not asking for a miracle, just a few kind words. It would really mean a lot to him. And to me, if I’m being honest. I worry about him, you see.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I understand you're concerned. But simply writing a card without any assessment is… irresponsible. "Old and tired" can mean a great many things. It could be depression, anemia, heart failure, a dozen other conditions. He needs to be examined. I’m not refusing to help, but I will not participate in providing false reassurance without proper medical investigation. Do you want me to examine him now?
PATIENT: Examine him…? Now? He… he wouldn’t like that. He gets very… upset when people fuss over him. He says he’s wasting my time, wasting your time. He’s a proud man. But… well, if you think it’s really necessary… I suppose I could try. But I’m warning you, he’s not going to be happy. Very unhappy. Maybe just a short card then? Just something simple. “Get well soon”? “Thinking of you”? Is that too much to ask, Doctor? Really? A little kindness… it shouldn’t require a whole examination.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kammer, I am going to ask you one more time. He presented with weight loss. That is not a normal symptom of simply being "old and tired." It requires investigation. I will examine him, and then we can discuss a card, if appropriate. But I will not endorse a get-well message without knowing what we are wishing him well from. I need his consent, and I need to perform a basic examination. Can we agree to that?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Alright, Doctor. You win. He’ll… he’ll probably grumble. And complain. But… alright. You can examine him. I’ll… I’ll try to convince him. But don’t expect him to be cheerful about it. He’s a very stubborn man, you know. But… alright. Let’s get it over with, I guess. Just… be gentle with him, alright? He doesn’t like being poked and prodded. And… well, I suppose the card is out of the question until after?
DOCTOR: Yes, the card is out of the question until after. And I will do my best to be…thorough. Please, have him lie down on the examination table. And Mr. Kammer, try to explain to him that this is for his own good. It’s important. Now, where is he?
PATIENT: He's… right outside. I told him we were just going to talk. I didn’t mention the… examination. He's probably already suspicious. He’s very good at spotting things. Just… try to be quick, alright? And… maybe say something about his fishing? He likes to talk about fishing. It's the only way to get him to relax. I’ll go get him.
DOCTOR: Fishing. Of course. This is going to be…a long afternoon.
PATIENT: Doctor Batara, this is my friend, Hector. Hector, this is Doctor Batara. She… wants to ask you a few questions. Hector, now be nice. It won’t hurt. Much.
DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Hector. Please, have a seat. I understand your friend is concerned about your health. I simply want to ask a few questions, and perhaps listen to your heart and lungs. Can you tell me, Hector, have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? What’s to tell? I eat when I’m hungry. Sometimes I’m not hungry. It’s not a state secret, Doctor. Look, I told Early here I didn’t need to be poked and prodded. I feel fine. Mostly. A little tired, maybe. But that’s it. Old age, you know? It happens.
DOCTOR: "Mostly" is not a diagnosis, Hector. And while I respect your independence, dismissing potential health concerns with "old age" is not a responsible approach. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss in the past six months?
PATIENT: Weight loss…? Now you’re asking me to remember things I don't bother with. I don't weigh myself every day, Doctor. Maybe a little? I don’t know. My clothes fit the same. Mostly. Look, I used to be a bigger man, alright? A working man. Now I just sit around. Things…shrink. It's a natural process. What’s the big deal?
DOCTOR: According to Early, you have noticed a change in your clothing size. He expressed concern that your shirts are looser. Is that accurate, Hector?
PATIENT: He said that, did he? That Early... always exaggerating. It’s just… they’re comfortable shirts, alright? I like comfortable shirts. And they shrink in the wash, maybe? I don’t know! It's not a sign of the apocalypse, Doctor. Honestly. That Early shouldn't go talking about my shirts…
DOCTOR: Hector, with all due respect, I am trying to understand why your friend is concerned about your health. Dismissing these changes as simply “comfortable shirts” is not helpful. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels?
PATIENT: Energy levels? What do you want from me, Doctor? Of course my energy levels are lower! I'm an old man! I used to build things, work hard all day. Now I sit and watch TV. I get tired. It's called getting old! You keep asking me these stupid questions like I'm some kind of… puzzle. Look, I don't feel sick. I just feel…old. Tired. Maybe a little sad sometimes. Is that a medical condition now?
DOCTOR: Hector, feeling "sad sometimes" can be a symptom of underlying medical conditions, such as depression. And fatigue, coupled with unintentional weight loss and decreased energy levels, warrants further investigation. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to order some basic blood work to rule out any potential problems. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work…? Oh, alright. Whatever. Do what you have to do, Doctor. But don’t expect miracles. I’m telling you, it’s just old age. Just…be gentle with the needle, alright? I don’t like needles. And don't make a fuss, Early.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, take a deep breath and relax. I’m going to start with your blood pressure. Systolic 140, diastolic 88. Not bad. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Heart rate is regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but I do detect some mild wheezing on expiration.
PATIENT: Ouch! Careful with that, Doctor. That’s… tender. What are you looking for anyway? Are you trying to find something wrong with me?
DOCTOR: I am assessing for any areas of tenderness or masses. Tenderness can indicate a variety of things, and it's important to rule out any potential problems. Do you experience any pain in this area regularly?
PATIENT: Pain…? Sometimes. A little ache. It comes and goes. I figured it was just… old age again. Or maybe something I ate. I don’t pay much attention to it. It's worse when I sit for too long. Like now, actually.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Alright, Hector. That concludes the physical examination. Now, I'm going to order some blood work to check your complete blood count, electrolytes, kidney and liver function, thyroid levels, and vitamin D. This will give us a better understanding of your overall health and help me determine the cause of your fatigue and weight loss. Do you have any allergies to latex or any other medications?
PATIENT: Blood work… more blood work. Honestly. No allergies, as far as I know. I haven't taken anything for years. Except for some over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes. And… I think I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a kid. But that was a long time ago. Just get it over with, Doctor. Let’s get this done.
DOCTOR: Early, please accompany Hector to the lab. They will need a sample of his blood. I will be here to review the results as soon as they are available. And Hector, please refrain from eating or drinking anything for at least eight hours before your next appointment, should one be necessary. We’ll contact you with the results within three to five business days. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your condition, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe abdominal pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. Just… will you tell me if he’s really sick? That’s all. I worry about him, you see. He doesn’t like to admit when he’s not feeling well. And… about the card? Could we… maybe still do the card? Even if it’s just a little something? It would mean a lot to him. A little encouragement… sometimes that’s all someone needs.
DOCTOR: Early, I will be honest with you. I cannot say definitively whether or not Hector is "really sick" until I have the results of the blood work. But I am ordering these tests because his symptoms warrant further investigation. And as for the card… Once I have a better understanding of Hector's condition, I will gladly write a brief note expressing my support and encouragement. But I will not provide false reassurance without knowing the facts. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s… that’s acceptable. Thank you. Just knowing you’ll… help him, and maybe say a kind word… that’s all I ask. Come on, Hector. Let’s go get this blood work done. The sooner we get it over with, the sooner we’ll know what’s going on. And try to relax, alright? Everything will be okay.
DOCTOR: Stubborn men. Both of them. .
PATIENT: .
