DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Smetak, you said? Yes, well… it’s this darn bladder of mine. Been going a bit too often, if you catch my drift. It’s… inconvenient, to say the least. Old age, I suppose. Everything starts to go, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Segretto, it often does. And you’re right, these things can be quite bothersome. “Going a bit too often,” you say. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not like I’m constantly running, mind you. Just… more than I used to. Used to be able to go hours, maybe even all day if I was busy enough with the farm. Now? Every couple of hours, at least. Sometimes sooner, especially if I drink anything. Coffee, mostly. Can’t live without my coffee, you see. My wife, bless her heart, keeps telling me to cut back, but… well, a man needs his comforts.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Segretto. Coffee is a comfort for many. So, it’s more frequent urination, and it seems to be worse with coffee. Has this been a gradual change, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Hmm… gradual, I think. It’s hard to say, really. Things… blur as you get older, you know? I don’t pay attention to every single trip to the… well, you understand. But I'd say it’s been getting worse over the last… six months, maybe? A year? It's all a bit of a muddle, truthfully. I just noticed it was becoming a nuisance. My wife pointed it out, too, said I was disappearing a lot more. She's got a good memory, that one.
DOCTOR: Yes, a gradual onset over six to twelve months. And your wife has noticed the increased frequency as well. That's helpful to know. Besides the increased frequency, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… … Well, sometimes… sometimes it feels like I don't completely empty when I go. Just a little bit left in there, you know? Not much, but enough to be… irritating. And, now that I think about it, I've been getting up once or twice at night. Used to sleep right through, solid as a rock. Not anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some incomplete emptying and getting up at night – nocturia, we call it. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not at all. Just… the feeling of not getting everything out. And the inconvenience, of course. … It’s not like it’s crippling or anything, but it’s… bothersome. And frankly, a bit embarrassing. A man shouldn’t have to worry about these things.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to feel that way, Mr. Segretto. These things are common as we get older, and there's no shame in seeking help. Now, have you had any changes in your urine itself?
PATIENT: Changes in… the urine? … Hmm. Well, it’s usually… you know, normal colour. Sometimes a bit darker if I’m not drinking enough. But no blood, no… foam, nothing like that. My wife hasn’t said anything about it being different, and she'd notice, she's very observant. Just the usual.
DOCTOR: Good. No changes in colour or anything unusual. Alright, Mr. Segretto, before we proceed, let me ask a few general health questions. Do you have any known allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had any trouble with pills, and I’ve taken a few in my time. Farm life, you know? Always a little ache or pain here and there. My wife gives me something for my knees sometimes, but that’s about it. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you mentioned something for your knees. Do you recall the name of that medication?
PATIENT: … Now that’s a good question. She handles all that. I just take the pills when she gives them to me. It's… a little white one, I think. Or maybe it was blue? Honestly, Doctor, I have no idea. She keeps them in a little bottle in the kitchen, next to the vitamins. She'd know the name, she always does.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Segretto. No need to worry about that right now. We can ask her later if needed. Now, let’s talk about past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, the doctor told me years ago my blood pressure was a bit high, but it wasn’t anything serious. Just told me to watch my salt intake. My wife’s been good about that, keeps me on a healthy diet. No diabetes, no heart trouble, as far as I know. I’ve been pretty healthy for an old man, if I do say so myself. Lots of fresh air and hard work, you know? Keeps you going.
DOCTOR: Good to hear you’ve been generally healthy. And high blood pressure, managed with diet. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Let me think… … Years ago, when I was younger, I had my appendix taken out. That was… a long time ago. And… I think I had a hernia operation once, but that was ages and ages ago. Nothing recently, mind you. Not for a long, long time.
DOCTOR: Appendix and hernia repairs, both in the past. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history? … Well, my father… he died of old age, mostly. He lived a long life, like I said. My mother… she had a bad heart, I think. But that was a long time ago. And my brother… he had something with his lungs, but I don’t remember the details. Honestly, Doctor, I don't pay much attention to all that family history stuff. It doesn't change much for me, does it?
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s alright if you don’t have a lot of details. Just knowing if there were any major illnesses in the family is helpful. Now, lastly, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? Never touched a cigarette in my life! My wife would kill me. Always been against it. And frankly, I never had the urge. No, never smoked a day in my life. Clean living, that's what I believe in.
DOCTOR: Good, never smoked. Do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: A little, now and then. A glass of wine with dinner sometimes, that's all. Nothing heavy. My wife and I, we used to have a small glass with supper, but we don't do it as often now. It's not something we need, you see. A little treat, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional wine. Thank you for answering my questions, Mr. Segretto. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Go ahead. … Just be gentle, alright? Old bones, you know. Not as sturdy as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I'll feel your abdomen. Finally, I’ll do a quick neurological exam. Could you please lie back on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. … Here we go. Old age is no picnic, let me tell you. … Just be careful with those instruments, Doctor. Don’t want to poke a hole in anything.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, though slightly muffled. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles detected. Your abdomen is soft, with no tenderness or masses. I do feel a slight fullness in your lower abdomen, near your bladder. Your reflexes are normal and sensation is intact. Everything seems within normal limits, although that slight fullness near your bladder is worth investigating further.
PATIENT: Fullness, you say? … Well, that could be anything, couldn’t it? It’s an old man’s bladder, for goodness sake. Everything’s… loose in there. What does that mean, Doctor? Do I need surgery? I don’t want surgery. My wife would never let me live it down.
DOCTOR: Now, let’s not jump to conclusions about surgery just yet, Mr. Segretto. It doesn't necessarily mean that's needed. That fullness could be due to a number of things. The most common cause of your symptoms - frequent urination, incomplete emptying, and getting up at night - is an enlarged prostate, which is very common in men your age. As the prostate grows, it can press on the bladder and urethra, making it difficult to empty completely. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a urinalysis to check for infection and a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, blood test to help us assess the size of your prostate. We may also need to do an ultrasound to get a more detailed picture of your bladder and prostate. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Ultrasound and blood tests… … Well, I suppose so. If it gets to the bottom of things, it's worth it. Though I hate needles, mind you. Absolutely hate them. And an ultrasound… is that comfortable? I’m not a young man anymore, Doctor. Everything aches. So, PSA and a urinalysis, you said? And then this ultrasound thing? What happens if this… PSA thing is high? Does that mean I definitely need surgery? My wife will be insufferable if I need surgery. Insufferable, I tell you.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Segretto. I'll make sure everything is as comfortable as possible. The blood test is a standard procedure, and the ultrasound is non-invasive. We will use a gel on your abdomen and move a small device over it. It shouldn’t cause any discomfort, though you may feel a little pressure. As for the PSA, a higher number can indicate an enlarged prostate, but it can also be elevated due to other factors, like inflammation or infection. It doesn’t automatically mean you need surgery. It just helps us assess the situation and determine the best course of action. We may consider a watch and wait approach, medication, or other less invasive options before considering surgery. Let’s start with the PSA and urinalysis. We'll get the results back in a few days, and then we can discuss them and decide what to do next. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: A plan, yes. That sounds… reasonable. … Just get it over with quickly, alright? And tell your nurse to be gentle with the needle. I bruise easily, you know. Old age, again. And no poking around too much with that ultrasound thing. So, I need to give you some… a sample? And then a little prick? Fine. Let's get it done. This whole thing is a nuisance, but… I suppose it's better to know. Just promise me no surgery unless it's absolutely necessary. My wife… well, she'd never let me hear the end of it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. No surgery unless absolutely necessary. I promise. And I'll make sure the nurse is as gentle as possible with the needle. I will get the nurse to prepare a sample collection kit for you, and I'll explain the process. It's a simple procedure. And I'll make a note in your chart to be extra careful during the blood draw. Let me just write up these orders for the lab. Then, I’ll have the nurse come in and assist you with the sample collection and blood draw. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Sounds… tolerable. … I suppose I’m ready for it to be over with, as much as a man can be. Just… be quick about it, alright? And maybe a little something to calm my nerves wouldn't go amiss? Just a small glass of water, perhaps? It’s a stressful situation, you see. Old man’s bladder, and all that.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. I'll have the nurse bring you a glass of water right away. And I will also let her know about your anxiety so she can be extra patient and gentle. I’m just finishing up these orders now. It will only take a moment. Alright, these are sent to the lab. The nurse should be with you shortly. Just try to relax, and we'll get through this. And please don't hesitate to let me or the nurse know if you're feeling any discomfort. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… get it over with, quickly and gently, alright? … And maybe, just maybe, if this whole thing turns out alright, I’ll treat myself to a nice, strong cup of coffee. A reward for surviving the ordeal.
DOCTOR: A nice, strong cup of coffee sounds like a perfect reward, Mr. Segretto. I’ll be sure to remember that. Here comes the nurse now. Nurse, could you please assist Mr. Segretto with the sample collection and blood draw?
