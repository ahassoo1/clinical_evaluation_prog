DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about my…business. Down there. I noticed some red in the, uh, bowl. Not a pretty sight, I can tell you that. And at my age, you don’t want surprises. I've been perfectly healthy my whole life, you know. Flying kept a man fit. Still do a bit of consulting, when they'll let me. But this… this is concerning.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s good that you’re addressing this. Blood in the stool, or what we call hematochezia, is something we definitely want to investigate, regardless of your otherwise good health. It’s wise to get it checked out, especially with a change in bowel habits. To start, could you describe the blood a bit more?
PATIENT: Hematowha…? Look, I don’t need fancy words. Just tell me if it’s serious or not. As for describing it… well, it was red. Bright red. Not dark, not mixed in. Just… there. And there wasn’t a ton of it, mind you. A few streaks, mostly. And it happened after… well, a normal trip to the restroom, if you catch my meaning. I eat alright, I suppose. Not one of these youngsters with their… salads and whatnot. Mostly meat and potatoes, keeps a man strong.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the medical terminology, Mr. Rowbottom. I sometimes fall into that habit. Bright red blood, as you describe, is often associated with bleeding closer to the rectum. The amount is also helpful information. Just to get a clearer picture, has this happened before, or is this a first occurrence?
PATIENT: A first occurrence, as far as I can recall. And I have a good memory, despite what some folks might say. I’ve had a few… tummy troubles over the years, but nothing like this. And I certainly haven’t seen blood before. Makes a man think, you know? About all sorts of things. I’m not one for worrying, but this has me a bit… unsettled.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern completely, Mr. Rowbottom. A new symptom like this is certainly worth investigating. To help me get a better understanding of what might be going on, could you tell me about any other changes you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Changes? Let me think… well, I've been a bit tired lately. But at my age, everything aches, so it's hard to say if that's anything new. And my appetite's been a little off, perhaps. Not that I'm not hungry, mind you, just… not as ravenous as usual. And I've had to get up once or twice at night to… visit the restroom. Not a flood, just a bit of urgency. Is that what you mean by changes?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Rowbottom, that’s exactly the kind of information I’m looking for. The fatigue, decreased appetite, and increased nighttime urination are all helpful pieces of the puzzle. Now, have you experienced any pain or discomfort in your abdomen, rectum, or lower back?
PATIENT: No, no pain to speak of. A bit of a…pressure, sometimes, when I’m…occupied. But not pain. Just a feeling of needing to go, quickly. And a bit of strain, perhaps. But I’ve always been a strong man, so I don't mind a bit of effort. Honestly, Dr., I've been through worse on the flight deck. A little pressure is nothing. But I do appreciate you asking. Thorough, I’ll give you that.
DOCTOR: I’m glad to hear you haven’t been experiencing any pain, Mr. Rowbottom. And I appreciate your detailed answers—it helps me build a clearer picture. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Medical history… Hmph. Not much to tell, truthfully. I've been remarkably healthy, as I’ve said. Never been one for doctors, to be honest. A bit of a cold now and then, a pulled muscle here and there… but nothing serious. My wife – God rest her soul – she was the one who always had the ailments. She was a worrier, always going to the doctor for every little sniffle. Me? I just kept flying. No high blood pressure, no heart trouble, no…diabetes or whatever you called it. A strong constitution, that's what I had.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear, Mr. Rowbottom. And I understand your preference to avoid doctors if possible. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. There was that time I broke my arm as a boy, climbing a tree. They set it, put it in a cast. That was… oh, must have been seventy years ago now. And I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, but that was a simple thing. Nothing major. No open-heart surgery or anything like that, if that’s what you’re asking. Honestly, Dr., I've led a pretty uncomplicated life.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Rowbottom. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as colon cancer, heart disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmph. My father was a fisherman, strong as an ox. Lived to be eighty, if you can believe it. Always ate fish, of course. My mother… she died young, pneumonia. And my brother… he was a bit of a drinker, didn't look after himself. Died before his time, I’m afraid. As for colon cancer or heart disease… not that I recall. We weren't one for discussing such things, frankly. Fishermen and drinkers don’t spend much time talking about their ailments. It's bad luck, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. That gives me a little bit of information. And I appreciate you sharing what you remember. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Absolutely not. I don't believe in coddling the body with pills and potions. A strong constitution and a good diet are all a man needs. I take a bit of cod liver oil sometimes, for the joints, but that's it. And maybe an aspirin if I have a headache, but that's once a year, if that. I pride myself on being drug-free, Dr. Giganti. A clear head is essential, you see.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Rowbottom. Now, would you mind if I conducted a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Hmph. I suppose. But don't go poking around too much. I'm a sensitive man, you know. And be quick about it. I have things to do. Consulting work doesn't do itself, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rowbottom. I’ll be as gentle and efficient as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Does this cause any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no pain. A bit of pressure, perhaps. But I’ve had worse at the dentist. Honestly, Dr., you’re being very gentle. Still, I’d prefer to get this over with quickly. I'm not one for lingering in doctor's offices.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Rowbottom, now I’m going to perform a quick rectal exam. This will allow me to check for any abnormalities. Please lie on your side with your knees bent. This may be slightly uncomfortable, but it will only take a moment. Okay, Mr. Rowbottom. I did not feel any obvious masses or significant tenderness during the exam. However, I did notice some bright red blood on the glove, consistent with what you described. I also noted some internal hemorrhoids, which could be contributing to the bleeding.
PATIENT: Hemorrhoids, you say? Well, that's… something, I suppose. Not exactly what I was expecting. So, it’s not… anything serious? Not cancer, or… something worse? I told you I keep myself fit. Never smoked, never drank much… though my brother… never mind. So, hemorrhoids. That’s it? Can they be fixed?
DOCTOR: It’s good that we’ve identified a potential cause, Mr. Rowbottom. Hemorrhoids are very common, particularly as we age, and they are often the source of bright red bleeding. While they can be uncomfortable, they are rarely a sign of anything more serious, like cancer. However, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. The bleeding could also be coming from a small anal fissure, or less commonly, from higher up in the colon. To be thorough, I’d recommend a fecal occult blood test to check for hidden blood in your stool and a colonoscopy to visualize the entire colon and rule out any other issues. Would you be open to those tests?
PATIENT: Hidden blood, you say? And a…colonoscopy? Sounds unpleasant. And probably expensive. Look, Dr., I’m eighty years old. I’ve lived a good life. Do I really need to go poking around inside my…intestines? Can’t we just treat the hemorrhoids? Some cream, perhaps? I'm not keen on invasive procedures at this stage in my life.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s reasonable to weigh the risks and benefits of testing, especially at your age. However, colon cancer is a serious concern, and early detection is key. While it’s less likely at your age, it's still important to rule it out, particularly with the presence of bleeding. A fecal occult blood test is a simple stool test that can be done at home. It's non-invasive and relatively inexpensive. If that test is negative, we can focus on treating the hemorrhoids with creams and dietary changes. If it’s positive, a colonoscopy would be necessary to determine the source of the bleeding. Would you be willing to start with the fecal occult blood test?
PATIENT: Hmph. A simple stool test, you say? Non-invasive? And I can do it at home? Alright. I suppose I can manage that. But if it comes back positive, I’m not promising anything about this…colonoscopy. We’ll see. I’ll need time to think about it. And I expect a full explanation of the procedure, the risks, and the costs. Don’t think you can rush me into anything.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. I completely understand. We’ll take things one step at a time. I’ll give you instructions for the fecal occult blood test, and we can discuss the colonoscopy in more detail if the test results warrant it. I’ll also provide you with a referral to a gastroenterologist, should you decide to pursue it. In the meantime, to manage the hemorrhoids, I recommend increasing your fiber intake with fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and drinking plenty of fluids. I can also prescribe a topical cream to help relieve the discomfort and itching. Would you like me to write you a prescription for that?
PATIENT: A cream would be good, yes. Anything to ease the… discomfort. And instructions for this stool test. Clear instructions, mind you. I'm not one for complicated procedures. Fiber and fluids, you say? Alright. I can manage that. A bit of roughage never hurt anyone. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’ve wasted enough time here today. Let’s get this prescription and the instructions sorted out, and I’ll be on my way.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Rowbottom. Just a moment while I prepare the prescription and print out the instructions for the fecal occult blood test. Here you are. The prescription is for a topical cream called hydrocortisone 1%, to be applied twice daily to the affected area after bowel movements. And these instructions detail how to collect the stool sample. Please read them carefully. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Hydrocortisone, twice a day… I can remember that. And I’ll read these instructions carefully, as you suggest. Honestly, Dr. Giganti, you’ve been… thorough. More thorough than I expected, I must say. Alright, then. I suppose I’ll be on my way. Thank you for your time. And I’ll see how this cream works. Let's hope it does the trick.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Rowbottom. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And please follow up with us if your symptoms don't improve or if they worsen. Get well soon, and have a good day.
