DOCTOR: Hi Percell, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. What brings me in… hmm. It's this headache, see? Right in the back of my head. Been botherin’ me for… oh, I’d say close to a week now. Not the worst pain, but it’s there, always. Feels like a tight band, kinda.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache for about a week, located in the back of your head, described as a tight band. That gives me a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure can. It's not like a pounding headache, you know? More of a constant pressure. It doesn’t really come and go, just… is there. I’ve tried taking some over-the-counter pain relievers, the ones for headaches, but they don't seem to do much good, to be honest. And it doesn’t seem to be worse with light or sound, not that I’ve noticed anyway. Just… a dull ache, back there. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A constant pressure, not throbbing, and the over-the-counter meds aren’t helping. Okay. Have you noticed anything that does make it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Let me think… I don’t think anything makes it worse, specifically. As for better… well, lying down sometimes helps a little, I guess. Just relaxing, you know? But it's not like it goes away completely. And I don’t really notice anything that definitely triggers it either. I've been tryin' to keep track, but nothin' jumps out at me. I do a lot of gardening, though. Maybe that's somethin'? It's been pretty hot lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying down provides some relief, and you've been gardening in the heat. That's helpful to know. And you're right, gardening in this weather could be a factor. Now, besides the headache, have you been experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no dizziness, no blurry vision. My appetite’s been normal, sleepin’ alright. No neck stiffness or anything like that. Just the headache, really. It's just… persistent, you know? And it's worryin’ me a little bit, to be honest. I usually don’t bother doctors for headaches, but this one just hasn't gone away.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other associated symptoms – that’s good. It’s wise to get it checked out if it’s not resolving and is worrying you. Let's talk a little about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I used to have high blood pressure, years ago, but I got it under control with diet and exercise. Been normal for a long time now, doctor said so. Otherwise, just the usual aches and pains of gettin' old, I suppose! I haven’t been to the doctor in… oh, gosh, probably five years or more. I try to stay healthy, you know? I like bein’ outside, keepin’ busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled high blood pressure in the past is good to know. And it’s good you've been prioritizing your health. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never been in the hospital, thankfully. And no surgeries either. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, climbin’ a tree, but that was it. Just a cast for a few weeks. Everything else has been… normal. I’ve been pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. That’s helpful. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My wife and I, we divorced about ten years ago. I have two grown sons, they’re both doin’ alright, livin’ in different states. They’re busy with their own lives, you know? My parents… they both passed away years ago. My mother had some heart trouble, and my father… he just got old, I suppose. No real family history of headaches or anything like that, not that I remember. Mostly just the usual things – heart trouble, arthritis, things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That’s good to know. Now, I'm going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smokin' for me. Never really got into that. And I don’t drink much alcohol, maybe a glass of wine with dinner once in a while, but that's about it. And definitely no recreational drugs, never been my thing. I like my garden, that's my escape! I suppose a little caffeine with my morning coffee, but nothin' excessive. Just tryin’ to stay healthy, doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear. No smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all – prescription or over-the-counter – besides the occasional pain reliever for the headache?
PATIENT: Nope, not takin’ anything regularly. Just those over-the-counter headache pills when this one flares up, but they don't do much good, like I said. I try to avoid medications whenever possible. My wife used to be a big believer in natural remedies, and I guess some of that rubbed off on me. Mostly just try to rest and drink plenty of water when I'm feelin’ under the weather.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. That’s good. Alright, Percell, I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes and coordination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment. Been a long time since I had a good lookin' at, I suppose! Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright? I'm a little bit of a worrywart, so just tell me what you're doin' as you go.
DOCTOR: Okay, first, I'm just going to check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. 148 over 86. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your history. Now I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Just relax your legs. Your reflexes are normal on both sides. Finally, I'll check your coordination. Can you touch your nose with your finger, and then touch my finger?
PATIENT: There you go. Feels a little clumsy, but I think I got it. I haven't done anythin' like this since… well, since school, I reckon. Everything feels alright, though. No dizziness or nothin’. Just a little bit stiff, maybe. Old age catchin’ up with me!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Everything seems normal so far, Percell. Your coordination is fine, and you haven’t reported any dizziness. Given your symptoms – the constant headache, lack of other neurological symptoms, and normal exam – it’s likely a tension headache. These are very common, especially with stress or muscle tension. However, because of your slightly elevated blood pressure, and your age, I'd like to be a little cautious and order some blood work just to rule out other potential causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds reasonable, Doctor. Better safe than sorry, I always say. Blood work sounds fine. Anything to put my mind at ease, you know? It's just… this headache hasn't gone away, and I worry about it. So, yes, go ahead with the blood work. What exactly will they be lookin' for? Just curious, that's all. I don't want to bother you, but I like to understand what's goin' on, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Of course, Percell. It’s good you ask questions. We'll be looking at a complete blood count to check for infection or anemia, and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar. We’ll also check your thyroid levels, as thyroid problems can sometimes cause headaches. And, given your blood pressure reading, we’ll check a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels. It's a fairly standard set of tests. It will give us a good baseline and rule out any underlying medical issues that could be contributing to your headache. It should only take a few minutes to draw the blood. Do you have any allergies to latex or other medical supplies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, no allergies at all, Doctor. Latex, medical tape, nothin’ bothers me. I’ve had a few shots in my life, and never had a reaction. Just draw the blood when you're ready. I appreciate you takin' the time to look into this, and explainin' everything so clearly. It really puts my mind at ease. Now, where do I go to get this blood work done? Is it here in the clinic, or do I need to go somewhere else?
DOCTOR: Excellent. No allergies – good to know. The lab is just down the hall, room 203. The nurse, Sarah, will be able to draw your blood. She's very good. After the blood work is drawn, it will typically take 2-3 business days to get the results back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and formulate a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to rest, staying hydrated, and you can try over-the-counter ibuprofen or acetaminophen for the pain, as long as you don’t have any other medical conditions that would contraindicate their use. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: No, that all makes sense, Doctor. Room 203, Sarah the nurse. Rest, hydrate, and ibuprofen. Got it. No, I don't think I have any other questions right now. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you for takin’ the time to listen to my worries, and for not dismissin’ it as just an old man complainin’ about a headache. I appreciate it. I’ll go find Sarah now. And thank you again, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Percell. It's my job to listen and help you feel better. And please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We're here to help. Have a good day, and I'll see you soon.
PATIENT: .
