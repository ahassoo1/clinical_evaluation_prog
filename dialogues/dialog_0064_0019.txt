DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Carlotta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, doctor. Thank you. Hmm... well, my wife and I... we are thinking about... a baby. It's been a long time, you see. We want to make sure everything is okay, before... before we try. I forget things easily, so maybe you can help us check?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Carlotta. That’s very wise of you both to think ahead and get things checked out. It's good you're considering this. And don't worry about forgetting things, that happens to the best of us. We'll take our time. So, you and your wife are planning to start a family… that’s wonderful. To start, could you tell me a little bit about both of your general health?
PATIENT: Yes, wonderful… I think so. My wife, she is good, very good. She walks every day, and eats… healthy foods. I try to, too. I make little things… metal things, you see? It keeps my hands busy. I have… Medicare, for my health. I don't get sick often, just… old man things, you know? A little ache here, a little ache there. Nothing serious, I think. I am… seventy years old now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear that both of you are generally healthy. And metalwork is a wonderful hobby! Keeps the mind and hands active. Seventy years young, that’s excellent. Just to clarify, when you say “old man things,” could you tell me a bit more about those aches and pains?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my knee, sometimes it hurts when I stand up too long. And my back… a little stiff. It’s nothing that stops me from working, but… it’s there. I used to be very strong, building things, but… time passes, you see? I also… sometimes I feel tired. Very tired, even after sleeping. But it could just be the heat, maybe? It’s very hot these days. I forget if I told you about the heat…
DOCTOR: No, you haven't mentioned the heat yet, that's perfectly alright. It is quite hot, and that can definitely contribute to fatigue. And it's good you're able to continue with your work despite the aches. Alright, so we have some knee and back pain, and occasional fatigue. Now, have you ever been formally diagnosed with arthritis, or any other condition affecting your joints or back?
PATIENT: Arthritis… hmm. I don’t think so. I went to the doctor… a long time ago, when I first felt the knee pain. He gave me… pills. White pills. And told me to rest it. I don’t remember the name of the doctor, or what he said exactly. It was many years ago, before Medicare even, I think. Just pills and rest. And it got better for a while, and then… it came back, a little. I don’t think it’s very serious, doctor. I just want to make sure… everything is okay for a baby.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, you received treatment for knee pain some time ago, with white pills, and it provided some relief. It’s alright that you don’t remember the specifics; these things happen. Now, thinking about your overall health, have you ever been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had… a problem with my heart, many years ago. When I was younger. Not a big problem, the doctor said. He gave me… different pills. Blue ones, I think. I took them for a long time, and then… he said I didn't need them anymore. Everything was good. That was a long time ago, before my wife and I got married, even. I forget so much, doctor. It’s very frustrating.
DOCTOR: It is frustrating, Mr. Carlotta, and perfectly understandable. Don’t worry about remembering everything; we’ll work through it. So, you had a heart issue in the past, which was treated with blue pills and resolved. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: No, not now. I don't take anything. Not even for the aches. I try to rest when I need to. And I rub it… my knee, you see? With a special cream my wife buys. It smells nice, like flowers. But it doesn’t help much. Just makes it smell nice. I don't like taking pills, doctor. They make me feel… strange. Is it bad that I don't take pills?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not bad at all, Mr. Carlotta. It’s perfectly reasonable to prefer avoiding medication if you can. We’ll certainly try to explore other options first. Now, let’s talk about your family history, if you don’t mind. Are there any significant health conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm… my father… he had a bad heart. Very bad. He died when I was young. My mother… she lived a long time, but she had… trouble with her sugar. The doctor said it was diabetes, I think. My wife’s family… they are very healthy, I think. She doesn’t remember any big problems. But… she comes from a small village, very far away. She doesn’t know much about her family’s history. It’s a long story. It’s hard to remember, you see. Everything is so far away.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Mr. Carlotta. So, a history of heart disease in your father, and diabetes in your mother. And your wife’s family history is less clear. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you mean, doctor? I wake up, I eat breakfast with my wife, I go to my workshop and make things. I eat lunch, I work more, I eat dinner with my wife, and I go to bed. We watch television sometimes. It’s a quiet life. Not much excitement. I don’t smoke, I don't drink alcohol. I used to play football when I was younger, but… that was a long time ago. Is that what you mean by lifestyle?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I meant, Mr. Carlotta. A quiet life, and a healthy one, it sounds like! No smoking or alcohol is excellent. Now, one last thing before we do a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I eat everything my wife cooks! She makes very good food. I've never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I remember. Sometimes, if I touch a certain plant in the garden, my skin gets a little itchy. But it's not a serious allergy, just a little itch. Nothing that needs a doctor. I think I am a very healthy man, doctor. For my age, anyway. Do you think everything will be okay for a baby?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear about the allergies. And you sound very healthy, Mr. Carlotta. Now, let’s just do a quick physical exam to get a better picture of things. It won’t take long. If you don’t mind, could you please step onto the table?
PATIENT: Okay, doctor. Whatever you need. Be careful, my balance isn't what it used to be. I’m ready when you are. Just tell me what you want me to do.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Carlotta. I appreciate you letting me know. We'll take things slow. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Now, one more deep breath… excellent. Your heart sounds… regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It’s not necessarily concerning, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Now, I’m listening to your lungs. Take a few deep breaths, please. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, not really. A little bit… here. But it’s just an old ache. It comes and goes. Nothing to worry about, I think. I get aches all over. It’s just… being an old man, you see? You're being very thorough, doctor. Thank you.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good to know where the discomfort is. Just noting that you have some tenderness in your lower abdomen. Now I’m just going to check your reflexes. Good, good. Those seem normal. And finally, I’m just going to check the pulse in your feet. Pulse is a little weak, but present. Okay, Mr. Carlotta. That’s all for the physical exam. Please step off the table carefully.
PATIENT: Thank you, doctor. That wasn't too bad. My legs are a little shaky, but I’m okay. So… what do you think? Is everything okay for a baby? My wife and I are very excited, but… I don't want to get her hopes up if it’s not possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Carlotta. Let’s go over everything. Overall, you appear to be in fairly good health for your age. You’re active, you don’t smoke or drink, and your lungs and reflexes are normal. However, there are a few things we need to address. The slight heart murmur is something we’ll want to monitor, and the weak pulse in your feet could indicate some peripheral artery disease, which is common with age. The tenderness in your lower abdomen is also something we should investigate further. Given your history of heart problems, and your family history, I recommend a few tests before you proceed with trying to start a family. These include an electrocardiogram to assess your heart rhythm, a blood test to check your overall health and kidney function, and an abdominal ultrasound to look at the cause of the tenderness. It’s also important to keep in mind that male fertility declines with age, so we may also want to consider a semen analysis. I want to be upfront with you, Mr. Carlotta. These tests will help us determine if you are healthy enough to proceed with trying to start a family, and if there are any potential risks. It doesn't mean it's not possible, but we need to be thorough. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Tests… so many tests. I understand, doctor. You're being very careful. It’s good. But… my wife… she’s been wanting this for so long. And I… I don't want to disappoint her. Electro… something? And a picture of my tummy? It all sounds a bit scary. And a… a what-was-it? A semen… analysis? That sounds… personal. Does it mean… does it mean I am too old? I just want to know… is it possible for us to have a baby? Even if it’s a little risky?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Carlotta. It’s perfectly natural to feel overwhelmed and anxious about these tests. And it’s absolutely okay to feel embarrassed about the semen analysis – it’s a common feeling. Let me reassure you, the tests are not about determining if you are “too old.” It's simply about getting a clear picture of your overall health and identifying any potential risks that could affect your ability to conceive or the health of the baby. The ECG is a simple, painless test that records your heart’s electrical activity. The blood test will tell us how well your kidneys and other organs are functioning. And the abdominal ultrasound will help us figure out why you’re experiencing tenderness in your lower abdomen. As for the semen analysis, it’s a routine test that assesses the quality and quantity of your sperm. It’s a private procedure, and the results will be kept confidential. I understand your wife has been wanting this for a long time, and I want to be as supportive as possible. I can’t give you a definitive answer right now, but these tests will help us make an informed decision about whether it’s safe and possible for you to proceed. Would you like me to explain any of the tests in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please, doctor. Tell me more about the… the tummy picture. And the sperm… test. What does it involve? I just want to be prepared. And… if everything is not okay… what happens then? What are our options? My wife and I, we just want to be honest with each other, and do what’s best for everyone. Is there any chance… even a small chance… that we can still have a baby, even if things are not perfect?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Carlotta. Let’s talk about the tests and then we can discuss options. The abdominal ultrasound is a non-invasive test where a technician uses a gel and a handheld device to create images of your internal organs. It’s painless, but you'll need to lie on a table. The purpose is simply to see if there’s anything causing the tenderness in your abdomen - maybe a small stone, or something else. It doesn’t involve any needles or radiation. As for the semen analysis, it involves collecting a sample of your semen in a private room. We’ll provide you with instructions and a sterile container. You'll need to refrain from sexual activity for a couple of days beforehand. The sample will be analyzed in the lab to assess the sperm count, motility , and morphology . Again, it’s a private procedure and the results are confidential. Now, if the tests reveal any issues, there are several options we can explore. If the sperm count is low, we could discuss lifestyle changes or medications to improve sperm production. If there are other underlying health concerns, we’ll address those first. In some cases, assisted reproductive technologies, such as intrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilization , might be an option. These are more complex procedures that involve a specialist, but they can significantly increase your chances of conception. It’s also important to remember that adoption or fostering are wonderful options to consider. It’s too early to say what our options will be, Mr. Carlotta. We need to get the test results first. But I want to assure you that there are many ways to build a family, and I’ll be here to support you and your wife every step of the way. Would you like me to schedule those tests for you now?
PATIENT: Yes, doctor. Please. Schedule the tests. I want to know… I need to know. And thank you. Thank you for being so patient, and understanding. It’s… it’s a lot to take in. But you’re right. There are options. And I’m glad you’re here to help. My wife… she’s a strong woman. We can handle anything, as long as we’re honest with each other. So, yes. Let’s do the tests. The sooner we know, the sooner we can start planning. And… maybe you can give me a pamphlet, or a website, about those other… those things you mentioned? About building a family in other ways? Just in case.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Carlotta. I’ll schedule the tests for you right away. We’ll need to arrange an ECG, a blood test, and an abdominal ultrasound. I’ll also get you the paperwork for the semen analysis. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and explain everything to you in more detail. Here’s a list of local labs where you can get the tests done. And here’s a website, and a pamphlet with information about assisted reproductive technologies and adoption resources. Don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions. I understand this is a lot to take in, Mr. Carlotta, but I’m confident that we can work through this together. Remember, there are many ways to build a family, and I’ll be here to support you and your wife every step of the way. Now, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, doctor. That’s all for now. Thank you. Thank you very much. You’ve been very kind. I’ll go home and tell my wife. And we’ll get started. Thank you again. And… tell Sarah I said hello.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Carlotta. I’ll be sure to tell Sarah.
