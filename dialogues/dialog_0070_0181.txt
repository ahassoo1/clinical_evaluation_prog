DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. I requested a general wellness check, a lab panel, if you will. Just wanted to see how things are holding up, you know? At my age, one likes to be… proactive. I believe the results came back, and I was hoping we could discuss them.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Mombrun. That’s very wise of you to be proactive about your health. Yes, your lab results are here. Let's go through them together. Before we dive into the numbers, could you tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I’m 74 years of age, as you know. I’ve been… quite fortunate, really. No major illnesses to speak of. I work – still work – in construction. Keeps me moving, keeps me strong. My wife and I, we try to eat well. Lots of fish, vegetables. Not much for sweets, thankfully. I do enjoy a good arepa now and then, but… moderation is key. As far as habits go, I’ve never smoked, and I only drink socially – a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps. Is there anything in particular you’d like to know?
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear, Mr. Mombrun. Staying active and maintaining a healthy diet are fantastic. It sounds like you’ve established a good foundation. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any past surgical procedures you’ve had?
PATIENT: Let me see… surgical procedures. Nothing major, thankfully. When I was a young man, perhaps… forty years ago now… I had my appendix removed. Routine, really. And… ah, yes. About fifteen years ago, I had a small growth removed from my shoulder. Benign, the doctor assured me. Other than that, nothing significant. Just the usual bumps and bruises one collects working on a construction site, I assure you. Is that what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, thank you. Just trying to get a complete history. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Ah, family history. That’s a bit… complicated. My mother lived to be quite old, nearly ninety, but she suffered from high blood pressure in her later years. My father… he passed away relatively young, in his sixties, from a heart condition. I don’t recall the specifics, it was… some time ago now. And my sister, she has diabetes. Type 2, I believe. Other than that… my family wasn't really one for visiting doctors much. We tended to tough things out. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Mr. Mombrun. Knowing about the heart condition and diabetes is particularly useful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I am not. I pride myself on not needing any medication. I believe in letting food be my medicine, as they say. Perhaps a multivitamin now and then, just to be safe, but nothing regular. I have a friend who takes all sorts of pills, and frankly, it frightens me. I prefer to stay as natural as possible.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Mombrun. That's a sensible approach. Finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I've never had a reaction to anything. My wife is the one with the allergies – pollen, certain fruits… but I seem to have been blessed with a rather robust constitution. I can eat just about anything without issue. Perhaps it’s the Venezuelan blood!
DOCTOR: That's excellent news, Mr. Mombrun. Alright, let’s turn to your lab results. Overall, most of your numbers are within a normal range, which is very encouraging. However, there are a couple of things I'd like to discuss with you. Your cholesterol is slightly elevated, and your A1C level is a little higher than we’d like. This suggests some pre-diabetes, which is not uncommon at your age, and, thankfully, very manageable. Would you like me to explain these results in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. I appreciate you pointing these things out. I prefer to know exactly what’s going on, you understand. Explain it to me as if you were speaking to someone who doesn’t know much about these… numbers. And what does "manageable" mean, exactly? What are my options? I’m a practical man, and I’m willing to make changes, but I need to understand what we’re dealing with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Mombrun. Let's start with cholesterol. Think of it like fat in your blood. We all need some cholesterol, but too much can build up in your arteries, making them narrow and harder, increasing your risk of heart problems. Your number is a bit above the ideal range, but not alarmingly so. Now, A1C. This test gives us an average of your blood sugar levels over the past three months. A slightly elevated A1C suggests your body isn’t processing sugar as efficiently as it should, which is what we call pre-diabetes. It doesn't mean you have diabetes, but it's a warning sign that you're at risk of developing it if we don’t take action. "Manageable" means we can likely control this through lifestyle changes – diet and exercise – and, if necessary, medication. We can start with the diet and exercise and re-check your levels in three months. If those aren’t enough, we can explore medication options. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Doctor. Thank you for explaining it so clearly. So, diet and exercise. I can certainly work on that. I’ve been… less active lately, to be honest. The construction work keeps me busy, but it’s not the same as a proper exercise routine, is it? And the arepas… well, I do enjoy a good arepa. What sort of dietary changes are you recommending, specifically? And what about exercise? What would be a good starting point for someone my age? I don’t want to overdo it, you understand.
DOCTOR: You are right to be mindful of not overdoing it, Mr. Mombrun. For diet, we want to focus on reducing refined carbohydrates – things like white bread, pasta, sugary drinks – and increasing fiber-rich foods – vegetables, fruits, whole grains. We don't need to eliminate arepas completely, but perhaps reduce the frequency and portion size. Lean proteins – fish, chicken – are also good. As for exercise, a good starting point would be 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. This could be brisk walking, swimming, or even gardening. It doesn't need to be strenuous. Start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration as you get fitter. We can also discuss some simple strength training exercises to help maintain muscle mass. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… quite reasonable, Doctor. Not overly daunting, thankfully. I can certainly cut back on the white bread and sugary drinks. And the walking… I enjoy a good walk. Perhaps I can walk to the construction site instead of taking the truck a couple of days a week. As for the strength training… I might need a little help with that. I’m not as nimble as I used to be. Are there resources available to help me with the exercises, perhaps a physical therapist or… something? And how often should I be checking my blood sugar, if at all? I don’t want to become obsessed with numbers, you understand.
DOCTOR: That's a very sensible approach, Mr. Mombrun. It's important to find a sustainable routine that fits your lifestyle. There are excellent resources available. I can provide you with a referral to a physical therapist who can design a personalized strength training program. They will teach you proper form and help you avoid injuries. As for blood sugar monitoring, we don’t need to start that immediately. Let’s focus on the diet and exercise for the next three months, and then we’ll re-check your A1C. If it hasn’t improved, we can discuss home blood sugar monitoring at that time. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… perfect, Doctor. A physical therapist, that’s exactly what I need. And waiting three months before worrying about monitoring… much more sensible. I appreciate you not overwhelming me with too much information at once. So, just to be clear, a referral to a physical therapist and focus on diet and exercise for three months, then a re-check of the A1C. Is there anything else I need to be doing, or anything I should be avoiding? Any warning signs I should be looking out for? I always like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: That is a perfect summary, Mr. Mombrun. As for other precautions, it’s important to maintain a healthy weight, continue to avoid smoking, and limit your alcohol intake. Be mindful of any symptoms of heart disease, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or swelling in your legs. If you experience any of those, please seek medical attention immediately. I'm also providing you with some educational materials on pre-diabetes and healthy eating. They include recipes and exercise tips. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough and patient, and I appreciate your clear explanations. I feel much more confident now, and I’m ready to tackle this. Thank you again for your time and guidance. I’ll schedule an appointment with the physical therapist and get started on those changes right away. It was a pleasure meeting you.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Mr. Mombrun. I’m glad I could help. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a wonderful day, and I look forward to seeing you in three months. .
