DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Chagarís. It's good to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. Uh… well, it's my family. Lots of… problems with hearts, you see. My mother, my brother… even my cousin. I just want to make sure I’m okay. I don’t want any surprises, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I certainly understand your concern, Mr. Schwer. Family history is very important. It's wise to be proactive about your health, especially with a strong history of heart issues. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about these heart problems in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my mother, she had… trouble breathing. Lots of visits to the hospital when I was a kid. They said it was her heart, something weak. She passed away when she was… oh, maybe sixty? My brother, he had… chest pains. Real bad. He had some operation, a long time ago. Still alive, but… not so good, you know? And my cousin… he just… dropped. Heart attack, they said. Very fast. I was… surprised.
DOCTOR: I see. So, your mother had breathing difficulties likely related to heart issues, your brother underwent a heart operation, and your cousin unfortunately experienced a sudden cardiac event. That certainly paints a concerning picture. To help me assess your risk, could you tell me how old your brother is now, and do you know what specifically the operation was for?
PATIENT: My brother… he’s seventy-two, I think. Maybe seventy-three. Old, anyway. The operation… uh… I don’t really know the name of it. Something with… a blocked pipe? He said the doctor put a… a little spring in there? To keep it open. He didn't explain much. I was young.
DOCTOR: That sounds like he likely had a procedure called a stent placement – a small mesh tube inserted to open a blocked artery. That’s helpful to know. Now, focusing on you, Mr. Schwer, have you ever experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or any other symptoms that might be related to your heart?
PATIENT: No… not really. I get a little tired sometimes, walking up hills, but… I'm old! I figure that’s just getting old. Nothing like my brother, or my mother. No pain, no funny feelings, nothing like that. I just… worry. A lot.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, and it’s good that you’re taking it seriously. Even without specific symptoms, it’s wise to be thorough given your family history. Let's do a quick physical exam and then we can discuss some potential tests, if you're agreeable. I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement, Doctor. My wife… she always said I worry too much. But better safe than sorry, right?
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, Mr. Schwer – better safe than sorry. And your wife sounds like a very wise woman. Alright, let’s start with your blood pressure. Could you please relax your arm for me?
PATIENT: Okay, here you go. Relax… I’m trying. It’s hard when you're thinking about… everything. My brother’s operation… my cousin… my mother…
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated at 140 over 85. That's not drastically high, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds are a little… robust. I'm detecting a faint murmur, which isn’t necessarily cause for alarm, but it's something we'll want to investigate further. Your lungs sound clear. Now, I'd like to check your pulse at your wrists and ankles.
PATIENT: Wrists and ankles… okay. Is that murmur… bad? My brother had murmurs, I think. He said the doctor always listened to his heart.
DOCTOR: It’s good you mentioned that, Mr. Schwer. Murmurs can be common and often harmless, but it's important to determine the cause. The fact that your brother had a murmur is relevant. Your pulses are a little weaker in your ankles than I’d like to see, which could suggest some narrowing of the arteries. Given your family history and these findings – the elevated blood pressure, the murmur, and the diminished pulses – I think it would be prudent to order some further tests. Would you be agreeable to an electrocardiogram to check your heart’s electrical activity, and a blood test to check your cholesterol and other heart health markers?
PATIENT: Yeah… that sounds… sensible. If it makes sure I'm okay, then yes. I just want to know. My daughter… she keeps telling me to take it easy, but… I just worry. Cholesterol… what does that have to do with my heart?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schwer. Knowing is always best. Cholesterol is a fatty substance in your blood. High levels of certain types of cholesterol can build up in your arteries, narrowing them and making it harder for blood to flow – that build-up is what can lead to problems like heart attacks and strokes. The blood test will give us a good baseline. The ECG is a quick, painless test that records your heart’s electrical activity. It can help us identify any irregular heartbeats or signs of previous heart damage. We’ll draw the blood right here in the clinic, and I’ll have the ECG technician come in to perform the test. It should only take about 15-20 minutes altogether. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah… that sounds okay. Fifteen minutes… I can handle that. My daughter always says I worry too much, but… it's better to be safe, like you said. What if… what if something is wrong?
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, Mr. Schwer. If something is wrong, we'll discuss all of your options and create a plan to address it. There are many effective treatments available for heart conditions, from lifestyle changes and medication to more advanced procedures. The important thing is to catch any potential problems early so we can manage them effectively. We’re not jumping to any conclusions right now, and these tests are simply a precaution. I want to assure you that you're in good hands, and we'll work through this together. Now, while we wait for the lab and the technician, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, that makes me feel better. Together… yeah. My lifestyle… hmm. Well, I’m retired. I used to work in sales, travelling around… now I mostly stay home. I like to read. And… I like to eat. My wife… she used to cook amazing food. I’m not so good at it myself. I don’t… I don’t exercise much. I used to walk more, but… my knees aren't so good. I smoke… maybe half a pack a day.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being honest with me, Mr. Schwer. That gives me a much better picture. It sounds like you enjoy reading, which is wonderful, and I understand it can be difficult to maintain an active lifestyle with knee problems. The smoking is a concern, but we can discuss options for quitting when you're ready. It's one of the biggest risk factors for heart disease, but it’s never too late to make a change. And I’m sorry to hear about your wife. It's understandable that cooking might not be a priority now. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just some pills for my knees, the arthritis. And… sometimes I take something for my heartburn. Nothing else. Oh… and sometimes I take a vitamin D pill. My daughter says I need it, because I don't get much sun.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take medication for your arthritis, something for heartburn as needed, and a vitamin D supplement. That’s helpful to know. Do you know the names of the medications for your arthritis and heartburn?
PATIENT: Uh… the arthritis one… it's a little white pill. I think it starts with a ‘N’… Naproxen, maybe? And the heartburn… it's just something I get at the drugstore. Tums, I think. The pink ones.
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen for arthritis and Tums for heartburn. That’s perfect. Ah, here's the lab technician now. They’ll just need to draw a little bit of blood for the tests. It will only take a few minutes. After the blood draw, we’ll get the ECG done, and then we’ll discuss the next steps once we have the results. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Just… try not to take too much blood. My wife… she always said I get lightheaded easily.
DOCTOR: Of course, we'll be very gentle. Mr. Schwer gets a little lightheaded with blood draws, so please take your time and let me know if he's feeling unwell at any point. You’re in good hands with the technician, and I’ll be right here if you need anything. Just relax, and try to take some deep breaths. We'll get through this together.
