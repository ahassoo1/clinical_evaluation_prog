DOCTOR: Right. Well, hello. Mystery Kobler, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. It’s… good to meet you. Though, I confess, I don’t quite recall how I arranged this appointment. Everything feels a little… fuzzy lately.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Not a bad fuzzy, exactly. More like… trying to remember a dream just after waking up. Details slip away. It's been happening more and more, I think. And… well, that’s also when I started noticing my mouth feeling so dry, and my eyes too. It’s quite uncomfortable, honestly.
DOCTOR: Right. Dry mouth, dry eyes… and this "fuzziness" is new, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, newish. Perhaps… the last few months? It’s difficult to be precise. Time… doesn’t feel as structured as it once did. I used to be quite good with dates, for my writing, but… now I rely on calendars a great deal. It’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Writing, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. I… attempt to be a writer. Mostly stories, though I haven’t finished anything substantial in… a while. It requires focus, and, well, the fuzziness makes that difficult. It’s rather frustrating, to be truthful. I used to enjoy it immensely.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been… a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. Not constantly exhausted, but needing more rest. And… I feel a little breathless sometimes, even when I haven’t been doing anything strenuous. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a tightness in my chest, and I have to take a few deeper breaths. Is that… relevant? I truly don’t know.
DOCTOR: Breathlessness, tiredness… and this dry mouth and eyes. Alright. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… That’s a good question. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a particularly strong reaction to anything, as far as I recall. No hives, no swelling… nothing like that. Though, I suppose it’s possible I’ve simply forgotten. My memory… is unreliable. I used to be quite careful about these things, but… again, it’s difficult to be certain.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, not regularly. I used to take something for… mild anxiety, a few years ago, but I stopped that a long time ago. I sometimes take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s infrequent. And… occasionally, a sleep aid if I’m really struggling, but I try to avoid that whenever possible. It doesn’t agree with me, I find. Is there anything else I should be considering? It’s all a bit muddled, truly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Any serious illnesses or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: That’s… a difficult question. I had pneumonia once, when I was quite young, I believe. And… I broke my arm as a child, naturally. But beyond that… I honestly can’t recall anything significant. I had a rather… isolated upbringing, and didn’t see doctors frequently. It’s possible I’ve forgotten something, but I truly don’t think so. It’s frustrating… I wish I could be more precise. Is it important that I don't remember details?
DOCTOR: It’s… helpful to know what isn’t there, as much as what is. No surgeries?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Not that I recall, at least. I… grew up in a very remote area. Access to medical care was limited. Most ailments were treated with… traditional remedies. Herbs and rest, mostly. It wasn’t ideal, I suppose, but it was all we had. I don’t believe I ever required anything… more invasive. I just wish I could remember things better. It feels like pieces are missing.
DOCTOR: Alright. What about your family?
PATIENT: My family… That’s… complicated. My mother passed away several years ago. I didn’t have a close relationship with my father. And I don’t have any siblings. As for medical history… I honestly don’t know. We weren’t a family that discussed such things. I know my mother suffered from… headaches, frequently. And she had a… a heart condition, I think. But beyond that… I’m afraid I can’t offer any useful information. It feels terrible to be so unhelpful. I wish I knew more. Is it important I try and find out?
DOCTOR: It’s… always good to have a family history. But we’ll proceed. Now, social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. It’s… a dreadful habit. I find the smell quite unpleasant, actually. And I’m very… careful about what I put into my body. It’s important to maintain one’s health, especially given… everything. Does that… help?
DOCTOR: Alcohol?
PATIENT: Occasionally. I might have a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a month. Nothing excessive. I don’t… rely on it, or anything like that. It’s more of a… social thing, when I’m with friends. Though, I haven’t been socializing much lately. It’s… difficult to explain. Is it relevant?
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. No, never. That’s… quite a suggestion. I lead a very… quiet life. I focus on my writing, and… trying to maintain my health. Recreational drugs have never been part of that equation. I find them… detrimental, frankly. Is that… satisfactory?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, then we can discuss this further. Can you stand for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Though, I do apologize if I seem a little unsteady. I haven't been feeling quite myself lately, as you've gathered. Please, let me know if you need me to do anything specific. I’m happy to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 118 over 72. Pulse is 76, regular. Temperature is normal. Respiratory rate is 16. Lungs are clear to auscultation, though a little… diminished. Throat is clear. No obvious inflammation. Lymph nodes are… slightly enlarged, but not dramatically so. Now, can you open your mouth and say “ah”?
PATIENT: Ah… Is that… sufficient? My throat does feel a little dry, as I mentioned. Perhaps that’s contributing to the sound. It’s quite uncomfortable, actually. Is it concerning?
DOCTOR: Tongue and throat are slightly dry, as you said. No obvious lesions. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are… a little sluggish. And finally, let's just check your heart rate again. Heart sounds are… a little faint, but regular. Alright. That concludes the physical exam.
PATIENT: Alright… And what did you… ascertain? Is it… serious? I confess, I’m feeling a little anxious now. The sluggish reflexes and faint heart sounds… that doesn’t sound particularly encouraging. Please, be honest with me. I understand if the news isn’t good. I just… wish I had a better grasp on what’s happening.
DOCTOR: Well, the exam wasn't… dramatically concerning. But there are some findings that warrant further investigation. The dry mouth and eyes, the diminished lung sounds, the sluggish reflexes, and the slightly enlarged lymph nodes… taken together, they suggest a few possibilities. It could be something relatively simple, like dehydration or a mild viral infection. But it could also indicate something more… systemic. We need to run some blood work to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It’s far too early to make a diagnosis. But we'll figure this out.
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, that makes sense. I understand. I suppose I was hoping for a more straightforward answer, but… I’ve learned not to expect such things. What specifically will the blood work reveal? And… will it be painful? I confess, I’m not particularly fond of needles. And how long will it take to get the results? I have a… deadline approaching, and this uncertainty is rather disruptive. I apologize for asking so many questions, but I simply want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: The blood work will give us a comprehensive look at your organ function, electrolyte levels, and look for any signs of inflammation or infection. It's a standard panel. As for pain, it's a quick prick, really. Most people barely feel it. The results usually take a few days to come back, typically three to five business days. We can discuss them here, or over the phone, whichever is more convenient for you. In the meantime, I'm going to order some basic tests. And honestly, drinking more fluids will likely help in the interim. Try to get plenty of rest. Now, do you have any allergies to latex, or anything of that nature?
PATIENT: Latex… I don't think so. I’ve never encountered any problems with it, as far as I recall. But… my memory is unreliable, as you know. It’s possible I’ve simply forgotten. Perhaps it’s best to err on the side of caution? Is there an alternative to latex? And what if the results are concerning? What kind of possibilities are we considering? I understand you can’t give a definitive diagnosis at this stage, but… a general idea would be reassuring. I apologize for being so… inquisitive. I simply prefer to be prepared for any eventuality.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll use non-latex gloves. As for what we're considering… honestly, it could be a wide range of things. Everything from a simple infection to… well, let’s not jump to conclusions. We'll get the blood work results first, and then we'll discuss it in more detail. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… comprehensive. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. Very well. I suppose there's nothing else to do but wait, then. Will I need to fast before the blood work? And is there anything else I should be doing to prepare? I want to ensure the results are as accurate as possible. And… will I receive a call to schedule the appointment, or should I contact the clinic directly? I confess, I’m terrible at remembering things like that. It’s best if someone else handles the logistics.
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. No food or drinks, except water. And yes, the clinic will contact you to schedule the appointment. I’ll make a note on your chart to ensure someone reaches out. Honestly, try not to worry too much. It’s likely something relatively minor. But we're being thorough, just to be sure. Do you have any further questions, or shall we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… everything for now. You’ve been very patient with me, and I appreciate your thoroughness. I’ll try not to worry, as you suggest. Though, it’s rather difficult, given my… predisposition to anxiety. Thank you again, Dr. Havird. I’ll await the clinic’s call. Perhaps… we can stop here for today? It’s been… rather exhausting, to be truthful. And I think I need a rest.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll be in touch. Do try to get some rest. And drink plenty of fluids. Have a good day.
