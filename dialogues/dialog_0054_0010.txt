DOCTOR: Good morning, Jahaad. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be honest, I’m not entirely sure what exactly brings me in. I’ve noticed some… swelling, I suppose. It’s a bit strange, and my memory hasn’t been the best lately, so I haven’t been able to pinpoint when it started or what might have caused it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It’s common to not have all the details figured out right away. We can work through it together. You mentioned swelling. Can you tell me where you're experiencing this swelling, and how long you’ve noticed it?
PATIENT: Hmm… it seems to be mostly around my face, I think. Perhaps my cheeks and jawline? It’s difficult to say for certain. As for how long… that’s where things get tricky. I want to say a few weeks, maybe? It’s all a bit hazy, unfortunately. I apologize for not being more precise. It doesn’t hurt, thankfully, just… feels different.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Jahaad. Memory issues can certainly make it harder to recall timelines. A few weeks is a good starting point. And you said it feels different. Can you describe that feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s not painful, like I said. It’s more… a fullness, I suppose? A sort of tightness. And sometimes, it feels… warm to the touch. Not feverish, just… warmer than the rest of my face. It’s subtle, but noticeable when I touch it. It’s hard to explain, really. Perhaps it’s best if you… examine it? I wouldn’t want to mislead you with a poor description.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. Your description is helpful, and an examination will definitely give us more information. Alright, let's take a look. If you don't mind, I'm going to gently palpate your face and neck, just to assess the swelling and feel for any tenderness or abnormalities. And I'll just check your temperature to rule out any fever. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. Please, do whatever you need to. I appreciate you taking the time to look into this for me. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m noting some mild swelling on both sides of your face, primarily around the cheeks and jawline, as you described. The swelling feels… somewhat firm, but not hard. No significant tenderness to the touch. Temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, which is within the normal range. I’m also checking your lymph nodes in your neck. They feel… slightly enlarged, but not dramatically so. No obvious signs of inflammation. Given the swelling, the enlarged lymph nodes, and your memory concerns, I’d like to ask a few more questions to get a clearer picture of what might be going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. Please, ask away. I’ll do my best to answer, even if my recollections are a bit… fragmented. I trust your judgment and want to be as helpful as possible. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Jahaad. Let's start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a difficult question. I… I believe I had a bout of bronchitis a few years ago, but beyond that, I can’t recall any significant diagnoses. I’ve generally been quite healthy, or at least, I think I have. It’s frustrating how fuzzy everything is. I did see a specialist about some… general fatigue a while back, but they didn’t find anything conclusive. It just felt like I was always tired. Do you want me to try and remember details about that specialist visit? It might be a long shot.
DOCTOR: No, don’t strain yourself trying to recall specifics about the specialist visit just yet. The bronchitis is good to know. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven't. I’ve never had to undergo any surgical procedures, thankfully. I’ve always been fairly careful, I suppose. And lucky, perhaps. What about… allergies? Do you need to know if I have any allergies?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And yes, please. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, insect stings, or anything else?
PATIENT: Let me see… I don’t believe so. I don’t think I have any major allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I can eat all sorts of foods without issue, and I’ve never been stung by a bee or wasp. Though, now that I say that… I did have a bit of a rash once after using a new hand soap, but it went away quickly, so I didn’t think much of it. Probably just a mild irritation, I assumed. It’s difficult to be certain with my memory being what it is.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. We’ll note the possible mild reaction to the hand soap. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I'm not currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements. I generally try to maintain a healthy diet and get enough rest, so I haven't felt the need to take anything extra. I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, but it's very infrequent - maybe once or twice a year. Beyond that, nothing at all. I assure you, I’m not one to self-medicate.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a difficult one. My mother had… high blood pressure, I believe. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, had some sort of… heart condition, I think. It was many years ago, and I wasn’t very close to him, so I don’t have many details. I believe my aunt had diabetes, but again, the specifics are hazy. My family isn't very forthcoming about medical issues, generally. It’s… a bit taboo, I suppose. I apologize for not being more helpful. It feels like I'm grasping at straws.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Jahaad. It’s common for families to be less open about medical history. Knowing about high blood pressure and the possible heart condition and diabetes is a good start. And finally, let's talk a bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’ve never smoked a cigarette in my life, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, as I mentioned earlier. I prioritize my well-being and avoid anything that could potentially harm my health. I assure you, those aren't concerns in my case.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear. Okay, Jahaad, thank you for answering those questions. It gives me a much better understanding of your overall health. Given your symptoms – the facial swelling, enlarged lymph nodes, and your reported memory concerns – there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be something relatively minor, like an infection, or something more complex. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us assess your overall health, check for signs of infection, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment, and I’m happy to undergo any tests you deem necessary. Please, do whatever you need to get to the bottom of this. I just want to understand what’s going on and, hopefully, find a solution. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I’m ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a C-reactive protein. These tests will give us a good baseline. We'll also do a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to rule out any thyroid issues, as those can sometimes cause facial swelling. Here's the requisition form. You can take this to the lab, and they'll draw the blood samples. It's best to fast for 8-12 hours before the blood draw, so I recommend scheduling it for tomorrow morning. Do you have any questions about the blood tests or the fasting requirement?
PATIENT: No, that seems straightforward enough. Fasting for 8-12 hours… I can certainly manage that. Is there a particular lab you recommend, or can I go to any lab that accepts this form? And approximately how long will it take to get the results back? I understand these things can take time, but I’m naturally anxious to know what’s going on. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It’s very reassuring.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jahaad. I’m glad I can ease some of your anxiety. There's a lab just down the street, "MedTech Labs," at 123 Main Street. They're very reliable and have a good turnaround time. You can go to any lab that accepts this form, but MedTech Labs is the one I usually recommend. The results typically take 24-48 hours to come back. I’ll contact you as soon as they’re available, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms – such as fever, difficulty breathing, or significant pain – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any further questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you again for your time and your thoroughness. I appreciate you listening to my concerns and taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I will schedule the blood tests at MedTech Labs tomorrow morning, and I’ll be sure to contact the clinic if anything changes. I feel much more reassured knowing we are taking steps to figure this out.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jahaad. I’m glad I could help. And you’re right, getting the tests done is a good first step. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We're here to support you. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you then.
PATIENT: .
