DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Farson, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Nicky Farson. Look, I’m not usually one to bother doctors over every little thing, but this bruising… it’s getting a bit ridiculous, frankly. I bumped my arm on the doorframe yesterday, a doorframe, and it looks like someone attacked me.
DOCTOR: A doorframe, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a doorframe! Not a brick wall, not a fall, a doorframe. Honestly, Doctor, I’m on this blood thinner, I know it’s supposed to help, but it feels like I bleed if I just look at something hard. It’s… concerning. I used to be able to handle a bit of rough and tumble, you know? Before… before my wife passed. Things just aren’t the same.
DOCTOR: Blood thinners will do that to you. Let’s see… Medicare, right?
PATIENT: Yes, Medicare. Though, with all due respect, Doctor, I wasn’t expecting a lecture on the effects of the medication. I know it makes me bruise easier. I just want to know why it’s so much worse now. It started subtly, a little bump here and there, but now… it’s like a child’s been practicing their boxing on me. Are you sure you’ve got the right dosage on file?
DOCTOR: Dosage is standard. Have you been… injuring yourself more frequently lately?
PATIENT: Injuring myself more frequently? Goodness, no! I haven’t taken up a new, dangerous hobby, if that’s what you’re implying. I live a quiet life. I read, I garden… I certainly haven’t been in any fights! I just… I bumped my arm. It's the extent of the bruising that's the problem, not the bump itself. Are you suggesting I’m making this up? Because that's rather insulting, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Farson, I’ve been doing this for twenty-five years. People exaggerate. Now, let’s just get through this. Roll up your sleeve. I need to see this bruising, and I’ll listen to your heart, just to be thorough.
PATIENT: Thorough? After suggesting I’m inventing injuries? Fine. There. Happy now? It's not a small thing, Doctor. And it wasn't there yesterday morning. Honestly, it looks like something out of a detective novel. Don’t tell me it’s just a bruise.
DOCTOR: It is a bruise. A rather large one, admittedly. Heart sounds are… regular. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not concerning. You said this started subtly?
PATIENT: Yes, subtly. A little discoloration after a minor knock, nothing I’d usually even mention. Over the last few weeks, it’s gotten progressively worse. It’s not just the size of the bruises, it’s how easily they appear. I’m careful, Doctor. I really am. I don't go around throwing myself against walls! Are you sure there isn't something else going on? Perhaps a blood test? To rule things out? I’m not a medical professional, but it just doesn't seem right. This feels…different.
DOCTOR: A blood test. Everyone wants a blood test these days. Look, Mr. Farson, you're on a blood thinner. You bump into things. You bruise. It's not exactly a medical mystery. But fine. I’ll order a CBC and a PT/INR, just to appease you. Don't expect any surprises. Come back next week for the results. And try to avoid hitting doorframes.
PATIENT: Avoid hitting doorframes? Really? That's your professional advice? Fine. A CBC and a PT/INR. Next week. But if this continues to worsen, I expect a more thorough investigation. I’m not leaving here until I feel like my concerns are being taken seriously. It's my health, Doctor, not a game of avoiding furniture. Do I need a referral to see another pathologist, perhaps? Someone with a little more… bedside manner?
DOCTOR: Look, I have other patients, Mr. Farson. If you want a second opinion, feel free to seek one. But I’m telling you, this is likely just a side effect of your medication. The lab results will be sent to your primary care physician. Schedule a follow-up with them to discuss. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Though I must say, this has been… less than satisfactory. I expect a phone call if the results show anything unusual. And frankly, a little more respect would be appreciated. Good day, Doctor Osga. .
