DOCTOR: Hi Zoie, it's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. Can you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It's nice to meet you too. Dr... Yoshino, you said? My water... it's been hard to... go. That's why I'm here, I think. It's not like a pain, just... difficult. Old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Zoie. Difficulty with urination – that can be a lot of things, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. It’s not necessarily just “old age,” although changes can happen as we get older. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about...? Oh dear. Well... it just takes a long time. And sometimes it... stops. Then I have to try again. It's been going on for... a while now. Maybe a month? I don't keep good track of time these days. My husband, he helps me with things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been happening for about a month, with difficulty starting and sometimes stopping mid-stream. That's helpful to know. And it sounds like your husband is a good support, which is wonderful. Just to be thorough, are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain...? No, no pain. Not really. It doesn't hurt. It's just... frustrating. Like trying to push water through a small pipe, maybe? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Zoie. It sounds frustrating, and that’s a good way to describe it. No pain is good. Now, have you noticed any changes in the color of your urine?
PATIENT: Color...? Hmm. I don't really pay attention, dear. It's usually... yellow, I guess? Maybe a little darker sometimes? I drink plenty of water, though. My husband makes sure of that. I don't think it's been different different, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally yellow is good. No major changes in color is helpful. Let’s talk about how often you're going to the bathroom. About how many times a day would you say you urinate?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a hard one. I used to go... regularly. Now... it's different. Maybe four or five times a day? Sometimes more, sometimes less. It's not a set thing, you see? I wake up once or twice at night too, which I didn’t use to do. Old age, I tell ya. It changes everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so four to five times a day, with waking up once or twice at night. That increase in frequency, especially at night, is something we want to look into. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, just to get a complete picture. Have you had any recent fevers, chills, or abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fevers... no, not that I recall. Chills, sometimes I feel a little cold, but that's just the air conditioning, I think. Abdominal pain... no, nothing like that. My tummy feels alright. I eat pretty regular, you know? My husband cooks good food.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear, Zoie. No fever, chills, or abdominal pain. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that's a lot to remember. My husband, he knows all that. I think... I had a little bit of high blood pressure a long time ago, but they gave me pills for it. I take those every day. And... something about my kidneys, maybe? He told me, but it was a long time ago. I don’t really recall the details. I just take the pills he gives me, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure that’s currently managed with medication, and potentially a kidney issue in the past. That’s helpful. Do you know what the name of the medication is that you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh goodness… that's a tricky one! It’s a little white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. My husband fills the little container for me. I don't really look at the name, dear. I just take what he gives me. He handles all that.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We can try to look it up in your records, or if you're comfortable, we can have your husband call the clinic with the name of the medication. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of! I haven't had any trouble with anything, not really. I eat all sorts of things. My husband makes sure I get a good diet. He’s very careful about that. I think I'm okay, dear. No allergies. At least, I don't remember any.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. No known allergies. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll just listen to your abdomen and check your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'd like to do a quick urine test. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's fine, dear. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. Listening and checking… that sounds alright. And a little water sample, you said? Yes, yes, I can do that. I just hope I can manage. It's getting harder these days, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, wonderful. Okay, Zoie, let’s start with the urine sample when you’re ready. I'll step out and give you a little privacy. Just let me know when you’ve collected a sample, and I’ll be right back.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Thank you, Zoie. I'm going to send this sample to the lab for analysis. It will help us look for any signs of infection or other problems. The results should be back in a couple of days. Now, while we wait for the results, I want to check your blood sugar levels quickly, if that’s alright. It’s a simple finger prick, and it can give us some helpful information. Also, I'd like to do a neurological exam.
