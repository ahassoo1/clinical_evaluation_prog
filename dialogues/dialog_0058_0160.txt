DOCTOR: Right. Candis, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. And honestly, I don't have all day. I took the bus all the way over here. What do you need to know?
DOCTOR: Well, I need to know why you're here. I have other patients waiting, so if you could just get straight to the point… What's been bothering you?
PATIENT: It's… tiring. Just constantly tired. And I’ve been… well, it’s embarrassing, but I’ve been eating dirt. Not a lot, mind you, just… a little bit when I'm feeling really weak. I don't know why I'm doing it, but it's been happening more and more lately. And it doesn’t help, if that makes sense. It just makes me feel worse, but I can’t seem to stop.
DOCTOR: Eating dirt?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt. Clay, really. From the garden. Don't look at me like that! It’s not like I’m out there shoveling it down, just… little pieces. And I used to be so strong, you know? I could lift anything working as a physical therapy aide. Now… now I can barely get through the day. It's awful. What is wrong with me?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, this is… unusual. Have you had any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me think… I’ve been a bit more forgetful lately, I suppose. Though, at my age, what isn’t forgetfulness? It’s probably just old age. And… I haven't been hungry much. Everything tastes kind of… bland. Like cardboard. Honestly, that's probably why I'm craving the dirt – it has a taste, you know? Though, don't tell anyone I said that. It sounds ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Do I have to talk about that? Really? Look, I'm a grown woman. But… well, they've been a little… strange. Harder than usual, if you must know. And… darker. It’s probably just the dirt, isn't it? This is all so embarrassing. I just want to feel better, and if you can't help me, you should just say so. I have errands to run.
DOCTOR: It's important to get all the information. Okay. And what about any other cravings?
PATIENT: Other cravings? Like for food? Not really. Everything tastes awful, remember? I haven't wanted a thing. Except… well, sometimes I get a strange urge for ice. But that's not unusual, is it? Old ladies like ice, don't they? Look, are we getting anywhere with this? Because frankly, I'm starting to feel worse just talking about it. I'm tired and I’m feeling ridiculous. .
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
