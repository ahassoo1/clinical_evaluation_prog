DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Tati, is it?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. Rayshon Tati. That's me. It’s good to meet you, Doctor… uh, Carrington, right? Sorry, my head is a bit fuzzy today.
DOCTOR: Yes, Carrington Dechêne. And you are here today because…?
PATIENT: Cough… yeah, the cough. It’s been… a long time. And tired all the time, you know? Also, my nose… always blocked, or runny. Gets bad sometimes. I think I had a few of those… sinus things before. Like, bad colds that don't go away.
DOCTOR: A long time… can you be a bit more specific, Mr. Tati?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific… Maybe… six months? Or more? It's hard to say. It comes and goes, but it always comes back. The tired… that's been maybe three months, I think? I work… with tires, you know? It's hard work, so I thought maybe it's just that. But it doesn’t seem to get better even when I rest. I don't really… keep track of dates so well.
DOCTOR: Right. And this cough… is it productive?
PATIENT: Productive? Sorry, I don’t… what does that mean? Is it… a bad cough? I cough up… stuff. Yeah. Sometimes it's clear, sometimes… yellow-ish. Not blood, if that’s what you mean. Just… mucus, I think that's the word.
DOCTOR: So, mucus. Yellowish mucus. Okay. And any fever, chills, night sweats, or shortness of breath accompanying this?
PATIENT: Fever… sometimes. Not a high one, I don’t think. Just… warm. Chills, maybe a little? Hard to say. Night sweats… I sleep hot, always have. Shortness of breath… no, not really. I get tired after work, but not… like I can’t breathe. It’s just… heavy, you know? Like I’m carrying something. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: And any chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain… Not really pain, pain. Sometimes it feels… tight. Like someone is squeezing. But it doesn't last long. Maybe after I lift heavy tires, you know? It goes away when I stop. I just thought it was my muscles. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Uh… not that I know of. Never been told. I live in the country, you know? Lots of trees and… stuff. I sometimes sneeze when the flowers bloom, but everyone does, right? I haven’t ever been to a doctor about allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what medications are you currently taking, if any?
PATIENT: Medications… Not really any. Just… paracetamol, sometimes. When I have a fever. Or… when I’m really aching. Just the normal ones, you buy at the shop. I don’t take them every day, only when I need to. That’s it, I think. I don’t like taking pills if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tati. I’m going to need to do a quick physical examination. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay… Sure, okay. Is it going to hurt? I don't like being poked and prodded too much.
DOCTOR: It shouldn’t. Just listen to your lungs and heart, and maybe feel your sinuses. Now, please, lie down.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Just tell me if it’s going to be cold. I don't like cold things on my chest. Ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and exhale. Again… Good. And now, I’m going to listen to your heart. Your lungs sound… congested. There's some wheezing. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but that could be from exertion, given your work. Your sinuses are… tender. There's some fullness there. Alright.
PATIENT: Tender… yeah, they feel that way. That feels… normal, I think. They always feel blocked. What does that mean? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: It suggests… a likely upper respiratory infection. Possibly bronchitis, given the wheezing. The sinus tenderness points towards a sinus infection as well. Given your symptoms and physical exam, I suspect this is a viral infection complicated by a secondary bacterial sinus infection. However, to be certain, I would like to order a chest X-ray to rule out pneumonia.
PATIENT: X-ray? X-ray… is that… safe? I don't like too much… radiation, or whatever it is. And… how much does it cost? I don't have… much money, you know. Is it really necessary?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tati, the amount of radiation from a chest X-ray is minimal. It’s a standard diagnostic procedure. It will allow me to definitively rule out pneumonia, which is a potentially serious condition. As for the cost… I’m aware you are uninsured. I can write you a referral to the local hospital; they may have financial assistance programs available. However, without the X-ray, I cannot be certain of the cause of your symptoms. I can prescribe antibiotics to treat the likely sinus infection, but if it is pneumonia, antibiotics alone won’t be enough. It could worsen.
PATIENT: Pneumonia… Worsen… that doesn't sound good. Okay… okay, financial assistance… I can try that. I don't want to get… worse. Alright. Yes. Okay, do the X-ray. Write me the referral. But… please, make sure it's not too expensive. And… is it very uncomfortable?
DOCTOR: Alright. Here is the referral form. The hospital will contact you to schedule the X-ray. It's a very quick procedure, Mr. Tati. Just stand still for a moment. It shouldn't be uncomfortable. As for the cost, you'll need to discuss that directly with the hospital's billing department. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a course of amoxicillin for the presumed sinus infection. Take it as directed, even if you start to feel better. And please, if your symptoms worsen – if you develop a high fever, shortness of breath, or chest pain – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Amoxicillin… okay. Okay, amoxicillin. And… go to the emergency room… that sounds serious. What if… what if it is pneumonia? What happens then? Will I… will I have to stay in the hospital? And… how long will I be sick? Also… does the amoxicillin have side effects? I get… a bit of a stomach sometimes.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tati, let's not jump to conclusions. If it is pneumonia, treatment typically involves antibiotics and potentially oxygen therapy, depending on the severity. Some patients require hospitalization, yes, but many can be treated as outpatients. As for side effects, amoxicillin can sometimes cause nausea or diarrhea. If you experience severe stomach upset, stop taking it and contact me. Here is the prescription for the amoxicillin. I’ve also included a handout with information about pneumonia and sinus infections. Please read it carefully. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Understand… Yes. Read it… okay. What if… what if I can't afford the medication? And the X-ray? Is there… anything else I can do? Also… if I feel worse tonight… can I call you?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tati, I understand your concerns. Unfortunately, I cannot provide financial assistance directly. However, I can write a letter stating your medical need, which you can present to charities or assistance programs. As for calling, my office closes at 5 PM. If you experience a medical emergency after hours, please go to the nearest emergency room. Here is my card. Now, if there are no further questions, I have other patients waiting.
