DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. Things just… aren’t right. I suppose that’s a good place to start. I'd really like to get this sorted out quickly if we can, I have a busy schedule.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mrs. Derasmo. We’ll do our best to be efficient. When you say “not yourself,” could you elaborate a little?
PATIENT: Elaborate… yes. It’s difficult to put into words. Just a general… sadness, I suppose. Not enjoying things I used to. The job… lifeguarding, it’s always been a comfort, but even that feels like a chore now. I find myself… withdrawing. Spending more time alone. And I sleep… terribly. I wake up several times a night. It’s been going on for a few months, at least. Honestly, it’s rather embarrassing to admit.
DOCTOR: It’s not embarrassing at all, Mrs. Derasmo. These things happen. It takes courage to come in and discuss them. A few months, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, roughly. It started… around March, I think. After the winter ski patrol season ended. Usually, I'm quite alright, bouncing back, looking forward to the summer work. But this year… no. It just felt… heavier. And it hasn't lifted. I've tried to push through it, you understand. But it's wearing me down. Are we getting anywhere? I do hope this won't take too long.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are, Mrs. Derasmo. We're gathering information. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Definitely. My appetite has… diminished. I used to enjoy a good meal, but now… food just doesn’t hold the same appeal. And I’ve lost weight, I think. Though I haven’t actually weighed myself recently. My clothes feel a bit looser, if that helps. It’s not deliberate, I assure you. I haven’t been trying to diet or anything. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any difficulty with concentration or memory?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. I… yes, actually. I forget things more easily now. Small things, mostly. Where I put my keys, appointments… things like that. And I find it difficult to focus. When I’m trying to read, my mind wanders. It’s quite frustrating, really. I always prided myself on my sharp mind. It's… disconcerting. Is that… serious?
DOCTOR: It could be, Mrs. Derasmo, but it doesn't necessarily mean anything serious. We need to explore further. Now, I'm going to ask you a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… Not that I recall, no. I’ve always been fairly healthy, thankfully. Good genes, I suppose. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. A broken arm once, falling out of a tree as a child. And a touch of arthritis in my knees, from years of being on the ski patrol. But that's been managed with over-the-counter pain relievers and physiotherapy. Nothing else that I can think of, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Just one, many years ago. A hysterectomy. Around 1998, I believe it was. Routine, really. Nothing complicated. And I recovered well. That’s all, Doctor. No other surgeries. Are we nearly finished? I have a commitment this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Almost, Mrs. Derasmo. Just a few more questions. Now, regarding your family history… Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a tricky one. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I think. And my father… he suffered from diabetes, later in life. My sister is quite healthy, as far as I know. Nothing else that springs to mind, Doctor. We weren’t a particularly… medical family. We preferred to keep to ourselves. Are you finding this helpful? I hope you can offer some sort of… solution soon. This is rather draining, revisiting all of this.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is helpful, Mrs. Derasmo. We're building a picture. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the occasional ibuprofen, for my knees, when they flare up. And a multivitamin, every now and then. Nothing regular, Doctor. I prefer to avoid medication if possible. I believe in letting the body heal itself, naturally. I don't want to become reliant on pills. Is that… unreasonable? I really would like to know what you think is going on. This feeling… it's unsettling. It’s not like me at all.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Derasmo, have you experienced any feelings of hopelessness or thoughts of harming yourself?
PATIENT: Oh! Good heavens, no! Absolutely not. Never. I am a strong woman, Doctor. I've faced challenges in my life, certainly, but I would never… think such things. That's… a rather alarming question. I understand you must ask, but it's quite upsetting to even consider it. No, I simply want to feel like myself again. I want to enjoy my work, my life… is that too much to ask? I have a good life, or had a good life. This sadness… it’s just… a cloud. A very unwelcome cloud.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that question was upsetting, Mrs. Derasmo. It’s standard protocol, and I must ask. Now, one final question. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I used to be quite adventurous with food, travelling extensively when I was younger. Never a problem. No allergies, Doctor. That's everything, isn't it? Are we finished now? I really must be going. My schedule… it’s rather tight today.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Derasmo. Thank you for that information. Based on what you’ve told me – the persistent sadness, loss of appetite, difficulty sleeping and concentrating – it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, we need to rule out any underlying medical causes first. I’d like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, and a complete blood count. I also recommend a urine analysis. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… yes, alright. If it will help. Though I do hope it’s not too extensive. And a urine analysis… yes, I suppose so. I just want to get to the bottom of this quickly. I trust your judgment, Doctor. Can we schedule that for today? I'd like to get it done and over with as soon as possible. And then… what? What happens after the blood work? Will I need… medication? I truly hope not.
DOCTOR: Yes, we can schedule that for today. The lab should be able to accommodate you this afternoon. Once we have the results, which typically take a few days, we’ll review them together and discuss the best course of action. If the tests are normal, we can explore other possibilities, including counseling or, if appropriate, medication. However, we won't rush into anything. We’ll make a decision together, based on your preferences and the results. In the meantime, I recommend trying to maintain a regular sleep schedule, even if you’re not sleeping well, and engaging in light exercise, if you're able. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Light exercise… yes, I can manage that. A walk on the beach, perhaps. Regular sleep schedule… I’ll try. It's difficult when my mind is racing. No, I don’t think I have any further questions at this moment, Doctor. Just… please, let’s get this sorted out quickly. I have a life to live, you understand? I'm not used to feeling like this. Thank you for your time. Can I go and schedule the blood work now? I'd really appreciate it if someone could direct me to the lab.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mrs. Derasmo. I understand. I will have the nurse direct you to the lab. She’ll also provide you with the necessary paperwork. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. I hope you feel better soon. The nurse is right outside. She’ll take care of everything.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your assistance. I do hope this is all straightforward. Good day to you.
DOCTOR: Good day to you as well, Mrs. Derasmo. We'll do our best. .
