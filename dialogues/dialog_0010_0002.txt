DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. Welcome. I'm Dr. Annesley. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Stoffregen, yes, that's me. Hmm... what brings me in... Well, it’s a bit… tricky. I have trouble… going to the bathroom. Not a big trouble, but it’s getting harder, you see? It takes a while, and I don't always feel like I get everything out, if you know what I mean. It’s just been happening lately.
DOCTOR: I see. So, difficulty with urination – a sense of incomplete emptying, and it’s taking longer than usual. And you say this has been a recent development?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Difficulty… yes. And… recent. Not… not years, no. Maybe… a few weeks? It’s hard to say exactly. Time… it goes so fast these days. My husband, he noticed it first, actually. He says I'm taking longer in the bathroom.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks. And your husband noticed the increased time. That’s helpful. Now, are you experiencing any pain during urination?
PATIENT: Pain? Hmm… not really pain, no. Not a sharp pain. It’s more… a straining feeling. Like I have to push a little. And sometimes, after I’m done, there’s a little… a little drip. Not a lot, just a few drops. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Straining, and some post-void dribbling. Are you having any difficulty starting the stream of urine, or is it a strong, steady stream once you begin?
PATIENT: Oh… starting… That’s a good question. Sometimes it takes a moment, yes. Not a long moment, but not right away. Like… I have to think about it a little. Then it comes, but it's not as strong as it used to be, I think. It's… weaker, maybe?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a slight delay in starting, and a weaker stream. Have you noticed any changes in your urine itself – color, smell, anything unusual like blood?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh, goodness, no. Not that I've seen. The color… it looks normal, I think. Maybe a little darker sometimes, but I drink a lot of water, so it’s usually pretty clear. The smell… well, it smells like… pee, I guess! I haven’t noticed anything strange about the smell.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. Well, I've been a little more tired lately, but I'm an old woman! That could be anything. And… no, not really. I don't have a fever, no pain in my back, no… nothing else that I can think of. My memory isn't what it used to be, but that's just getting old, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no back pain, increased fatigue but likely age-related. Now, let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have a primary care physician?
PATIENT: A primary… doctor? Oh, yes. Doctor… uh… Miller, I think. Yes, Doctor Miller. I see him sometimes. Not very often, though. Just for check-ups, you know? He’s a good man, Doctor Miller. But I forget what he says half the time!
DOCTOR: I understand. Do you know if he's ever diagnosed you with any chronic medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear… chronic… That sounds serious. Let me think… High blood pressure, yes! He told me I had that. Years ago, though. I take a little pill for it, every day. And… um… I don't think so. No kidney problems that I know of. He never said anything about my kidneys. Just the blood pressure. And… arthritis. My joints ache something awful. But that's not a chronic condition, is it? It’s just old age!
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure, managed with medication, and arthritis. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see… Yes! A long time ago, I had my gallbladder out. And… oh, I had a hysterectomy when I was young. That was… a long time ago. Before I met my husband, even! I don’t think I’ve had any surgeries since then. Just those two.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and a hysterectomy in the past. Now, are you currently taking any medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Just the little white pill for my blood pressure. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when it’s really bad. It's a little orange pill. I don't take it every day, just when my joints are hurting. And… oh! Sometimes I take a little something to help me sleep. Just when I can't get to sleep, though. A tiny blue pill. My husband keeps them on the nightstand.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, medication for blood pressure, an occasional orange pill for arthritis, and a small blue pill for sleep. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Not that I know of, no. I eat everything. My husband always says I have an iron stomach. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. No hives, no trouble breathing… nothing like that. I’m very lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like prostate problems, bladder cancer, or kidney disease?
PATIENT: Oh, family… that’s a hard one. My family… they’re all gone now. My brothers and sisters… all passed away. I don’t really… remember much about their illnesses. My father… he had a bad heart, I think. And my mother… she just got old, you know? She wasn’t really sick, just… wore out. I don’t think anyone in my family had trouble with their bladder. Maybe my uncle… but I barely knew him.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart problems in your father, but no specific recollection of bladder issues in the family. Finally, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never smoked a day in my life. My husband smoked for a while, but he gave it up years ago. And I don't drink. Never liked the taste of it. Just water for me, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. No smoking or alcohol use. Thank you for all of that information, Ms. Stoffregen. Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and then I'd like to do a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes. After that, I'd like to do a simple urine test to check for infection. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. My heart and lungs… alright. And the… neurological thing… is that painful? And the urine test… I suppose that’s necessary. Yes, go ahead. Just be gentle, dear. My old bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stoffregen. I will be as gentle as possible. Let's start with listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out for me. I'm just listening for any unusual sounds. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, but I do feel a little… fullness in your lower abdomen. Not concerning, but worth noting. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your legs. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common at your age. Finally, we'll just need a small sample of your urine. I'll give you a cup, and I'll show you how to collect it. It's very simple.
PATIENT: Alright… diminished reflexes… that sounds about right. My everything is diminished these days! A cup, you say? Yes, alright. Show me. I can manage a cup, I think. Just try not to make me rush, dear. My bladder isn’t as cooperative as it used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Stoffregen. No rush at all. Here you are. When you're ready, just collect a small sample – about two to three ounces is fine. I’ll be right here when you get back. Take your time.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. There you go. It took a while, but I managed it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Stoffregen. Okay, the urine test shows no signs of infection, which is good. However, there is a small amount of protein present, and a trace of blood. It's not a large amount, but it's something we should investigate further. Based on everything you've told me, and the results of the urine test, it sounds like you may be experiencing some mild urinary retention, likely due to an enlarged prostate – a common condition in older men, and occasionally in women, it can sometimes lead to a weakened bladder. The trace of blood could be related to the straining you've been experiencing.
PATIENT: Enlarged… prostate? But… I'm a woman, dear. My husband had a prostate. Not me! What does that mean? Is something seriously wrong? I don’t want to end up in the hospital.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to question that, Ms. Stoffregen. My apologies – that was a lapse in my thinking. Women do not have prostates. What I meant to say is that the symptoms you’re experiencing – difficulty emptying your bladder, straining, and a weakened stream – can sometimes be caused by a weakened pelvic floor, which is common as we age, especially after childbirth and menopause. This can lead to similar symptoms as an enlarged prostate in men. It’s not quite as straightforward, but it’s a similar idea – the muscles supporting your bladder aren’t as strong as they used to be. The trace of blood is still a concern, and we want to rule out anything serious, but it doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong. It could simply be irritation from straining. To be on the safe side, I would like to order a simple ultrasound of your bladder to get a better look at it and rule out any blockages or other abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… alright. If you think it's best. I don’t like the sound of blockages, though. That sounds… painful. Is it expensive? My Medicare… it doesn’t cover everything, you know. And my husband… he's got enough medical bills already.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Stoffregen. An ultrasound is a non-invasive procedure – it doesn't involve any needles or radiation, and it shouldn't be painful at all. It's just like a pregnancy scan – a technician will move a wand over your abdomen to create an image of your bladder. Regarding the cost, I will have the billing department verify your Medicare coverage and let you know the estimated out-of-pocket cost beforehand. We can also explore options for financial assistance if needed. In the meantime, I would like to recommend some simple exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles – Kegel exercises. They can be very helpful in improving bladder control. I'll give you a handout with instructions, and a referral to a physical therapist who specializes in pelvic floor rehabilitation would also be beneficial. Would you like me to write you a referral for the physical therapist today?
PATIENT: A physical therapist… alright. If it helps, yes. I'm willing to try anything. Kegel exercises… I think I remember reading about those somewhere. But my memory… it’s not what it used to be. A handout would be good. It’s just… getting old is hard, dear. Everything aches, and everything stops working.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Stoffregen. It is hard, and you're not alone in feeling that way. Okay, I've written a referral for you to see Sarah Chen, a physical therapist who specializes in pelvic floor rehabilitation. She's excellent, and her office is conveniently located near the clinic. I'll also print out a handout with detailed instructions for Kegel exercises, and a list of resources for managing bladder issues. I'm also going to order that ultrasound, just to rule out anything serious. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Finally, I'm going to prescribe a mild medication – oxybutynin – to help relax your bladder muscles and reduce the urgency. It’s a low dose, and it can be very helpful in improving bladder control. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Oxybutynin… is that a strong pill? I don’t want anything that will make me sleepy. I already sleep enough! And what if it interacts with my blood pressure medicine? My husband always worries about interactions. He keeps a list of all my pills.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Ms. Stoffregen, and your husband is right to be cautious about interactions. Oxybutynin is a low dose, and side effects are generally mild, but drowsiness is a possibility. We'll start you on a low dose to minimize that risk. I've already checked for potential interactions with your blood pressure medication, and it is considered safe to use together, but we will monitor you closely for any adverse effects. I will also write a note to your primary care physician, Doctor Miller, informing him of our findings and the medications I've prescribed. Here are the prescriptions, the referral for physical therapy, and the handout on Kegel exercises. Please call the physical therapy office to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. The ultrasound lab will contact you within a few business days to schedule your appointment. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. It’s good to know someone is taking care of me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Stoffregen. That’s my job, and I’m glad I could help. Remember, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, or if you have any concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you for a follow-up appointment in about a month to discuss the results of the ultrasound and your progress with the physical therapy. Have a good day, Ms. Stoffregen.
