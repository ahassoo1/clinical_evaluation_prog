DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this… weakness. It’s been getting worse, you see. Not all at once, but… little by little. It’s making things difficult.
DOCTOR: I understand. Weakness can be quite concerning, and it’s good you’re addressing it. To get a better understanding, could you tell me more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… where to start? It’s mostly in my legs, I think. Makes walking… tricky. And sometimes my hands feel… clumsy. Not pain, exactly, just… not as strong as they used to be. It's been going on for… oh, maybe six months now? Hard to say for sure, time flies when you get to be my age. It’s just… more noticeable lately.
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Mr. Astore. Six months of progressive weakness, primarily in your legs and hands... and you've noticed it worsening recently. When you say "tricky" with walking, could you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not that I can’t walk, Doctor. It’s more… unsteady, you know? Like my legs don’t always listen to me. Sometimes I feel like I’m dragging my feet a little. And I have to think about each step, which… I didn’t used to. It’s tiring, too. Makes long walks… impossible. And I used to love a good walk.
DOCTOR: I see. So, instability, a feeling of dragging your feet, and increased effort with walking – all leading to fatigue. Have you experienced any falls as a result of this instability, Mr. Astore?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no falls. I'm very careful, you see. My wife, Leilani, she worries something awful about me. I use a cane most of the time now, just to be safe. It helps a lot. But… it’s not the same. I just wish I could move like I used to.
DOCTOR: That's good you're using a cane and that you haven't fallen. It’s wise to be cautious. Besides the weakness and instability, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Well, my vision has been a little blurry sometimes. Not all the time, just… comes and goes. And… sometimes I feel very tired, even when I've had a good sleep. More tired than usual, you understand. And… Leilani says I’ve been a little more forgetful lately, but at my age… who isn't?
DOCTOR: Okay, so blurry vision, increased fatigue, and some memory changes, in addition to the weakness and instability. We’ll certainly want to explore all of this. Now, let's go through some more detailed questions to get a complete picture. Have you noticed any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It comes and goes, mostly in my feet. Like… pins and needles. Not always, but… often enough to notice. It's worse at night, I think. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes. It’s not pain, exactly, just… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, intermittent pins and needles in your feet, worse at night. That's important information. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let’s see… I had a touch of high blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor got it under control with pills. And… I had a bad fall when I was younger, broke my arm. But… nothing major, really. Oh! And they told me… years ago… something about my nerves. Something about them being… not working right? I don’t remember all the details. My wife, Leilani, she would know better. It was a long time ago. They gave me some medicine, and I’ve been… okay, mostly. It's all a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure managed with medication, a past broken arm, and a history of a nerve condition years ago, treated with medication. Do you recall the name of that medication, or approximately when you were taking it?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I truly do not. It was a long, long time ago. Perhaps… twenty years? More? I really can't say. And I don’t remember the name of the pill at all. Leilani… she might remember. She has a very good memory. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful. I just remember they said something about my nerves… and that the medicine helped for a while.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Astore. We'll do our best to piece things together. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the pills for my blood pressure, Doctor. And… sometimes I take something for my knees, when they bother me. It’s just… something over the counter. Ibuprofen, I think it’s called. And… Leilani gives me a vitamin every day. Something for older folks. But that’s it, really. Nothing else. I try not to take too many pills, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so medication for blood pressure, occasional ibuprofen for your knees, and a daily vitamin. Have you ever been allergic to any medications, or do you have any known allergies to foods or other substances?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things. Leilani makes a wonderful palusami. I've never had a problem with allergies, thankfully. No, no allergies that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or neurological disorders?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother, she had… a bad sickness when she was older. Something with her brain, I think. She couldn't walk very well at the end. And my brother… he had heart trouble. Had a surgery, I think. And… my grandfather, on my wife’s side, he had diabetes. But… other than that… I don’t really know. We didn’t talk much about sickness back then. It wasn’t something we focused on.
DOCTOR: Okay, a mother with a neurological condition affecting her ability to walk, a brother with heart trouble and surgery, and a grandfather with diabetes. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, Doctor. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And I don’t drink alcohol. Leilani and I… we prefer a good cup of tea. And… no, no recreational drugs. Never have, never will. I’m a simple man, you see. I like my garden, my family, and my church. That’s all I need.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful, Mr. Astore. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if that’s alright with you. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, assess your reflexes, and evaluate your strength and balance. It will help me get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable. Go ahead, please.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Astore. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but nothing too concerning at this point. Your heart and lungs sound good. However, your reflexes are a bit diminished in your legs, and your balance is slightly impaired. When I ask you to stand on one foot, you require assistance to maintain your balance. Strength is 4/5 in your upper extremities bilaterally, but 3/5 in your lower extremities, particularly your feet and ankles. I also noted some decreased sensation to light touch in your feet and ankles. These findings suggest some possible nerve involvement and muscle weakness in your lower extremities. Now, I’d like to ask you a few more questions based on these preliminary results. Do you experience any pain in your feet or legs?
PATIENT: Pain… not exactly pain, Doctor. More… tingling, like pins and needles, as I said before. And sometimes… a burning sensation, especially at night. It’s not constant, but it’s… uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. And… sometimes, my legs feel… heavy. Like I’m carrying weights. It's hard to explain. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a strange feeling.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Astore. So, tingling, burning sensations, and a feeling of heaviness in your legs. That further supports the possibility of nerve involvement. Given your symptoms, physical exam findings, and medical history, several possibilities come to mind. One is peripheral neuropathy, which is damage to the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. This can be caused by various factors, including diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, and certain medications. Another possibility is a condition affecting your spinal cord. To help narrow down the diagnosis, I’d like to order some blood tests to check your vitamin levels, blood sugar, and kidney function. I also recommend an MRI of your spine to rule out any compression or inflammation of the spinal cord. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood tests, yes, that’s fine. And… an MRI? Is that… dangerous? I’ve never had one before. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then I trust your judgment. But… is it painful? Will it show something… bad?
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly valid question, Mr. Astore. An MRI is not dangerous. It uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your spine, without using any radiation. It’s a very safe procedure. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large tunnel, and it’s important to remain still during the scan. It can be a little noisy, and some people feel a bit claustrophobic, but we can provide you with earplugs and a sedative if you’re concerned about that. As for showing something "bad," the purpose of the MRI is to gather information, so we can understand what’s causing your symptoms and develop the most appropriate treatment plan. It doesn't necessarily mean there's something serious, but it will give us a clearer picture. We can discuss the results thoroughly once they're available. Would you like me to order the blood tests and schedule the MRI for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Please. Blood tests and the… MRI. I trust you, Doctor. I just want to know what’s happening. And… what we can do about it. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Astore. I'll have my nurse draw the blood samples now, and she’ll schedule the MRI for you. I recommend getting it done as soon as possible, so we can review the results and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a vitamin B12 supplement, as a deficiency can sometimes cause similar symptoms. I also recommend continuing to use your cane for stability and avoiding any strenuous activities that might worsen your symptoms. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as weakness in your arms, loss of bowel or bladder control, or severe pain, please contact my office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think you’ve explained everything very clearly. Just the vitamin, the blood tests, and the… MRI. Thank you, Doctor Neppl. I appreciate your time and your kindness. I’ll see you when the results are back?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astore. I’m glad I could help. Yes, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available, so we can discuss them in detail and formulate a plan. My nurse will assist you with that as well. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day, Mr. Astore.
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. I will. Have a good day to you as well.
