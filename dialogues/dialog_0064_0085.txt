DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bartock. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It's nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s about my skin. It’s…discolored. Not all over, thankfully, but it’s quite noticeable, and frankly, it’s just not right. I noticed it a few weeks ago, and it hasn’t gotten any better on its own.
DOCTOR: Discolored skin, you said. A few weeks now… Alright. Can you describe the discoloration for me?
PATIENT: Well, it’s…patchy. Sort of a brownish hue, but not like a tan. More…dull. And it’s mostly on my arms, and a little bit on my face, around my cheekbones. It doesn’t itch or anything, which is good, I suppose. It just…looks unhealthy. Honestly, it's quite embarrassing. I've always taken pride in my appearance, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good that it isn't itchy or painful, that's certainly a plus. Patchy, brownish…mostly on the arms and around the cheekbones. Hmm. Now, has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed? Let me think… Not really. My husband and I haven’t traveled anywhere. I haven’t started using any new soaps or lotions. I eat the same things, more or less. We did redecorate the living room, but that was months ago. I really can’t think of anything that would cause this. It’s quite baffling, really. I pride myself on a very…orderly life. Changes are not usually part of it.
DOCTOR: An orderly life… I see. No new products, no travel… That does make it a bit puzzling. Just to be thorough, Ms. Bartock, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? No, not that I’ve noticed. I feel perfectly fine, otherwise. No fatigue, no fever, no…well, nothing. I’m quite robust, actually. I always have been. It’s just this…blemish. It’s just…there. It’s very disconcerting, I must say. And my husband keeps telling me it's probably nothing, but he doesn't have a very good eye for these things. Men!
DOCTOR: Yes, well, husbands often have a different perspective. Robust, feeling well otherwise… That’s good to hear. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, rubella… but nothing serious. And I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl. Other than that, I’ve been remarkably healthy. I do have Medicare, of course, but I rarely use it. Honestly, I haven't been to a doctor in…oh, goodness, probably five years. My husband handles most of that sort of thing. He’s quite efficient.
DOCTOR: Alright, tonsillectomy as a child, otherwise healthy, and rarely use your Medicare. That’s helpful to know. Any family history of skin conditions, Ms. Bartock?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mother had…well, she had a lot of freckles, if that counts. And my grandmother, on my father’s side, she had some sort of rash when she was younger, but I don’t recall what it was. Nothing serious, as far as I know. My family is generally…sturdy people. We don't tend to have a lot of ailments. We're Ukrainian, you see. We’re built to withstand things. Though, I suppose that doesn't make us immune to everything.
DOCTOR: Ukrainian… sturdy people. I understand. Freckles in your mother, a rash in your grandmother… Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I prefer to get my nutrients from my food. My husband tries to get me to take a multivitamin, but I refuse. I eat a very balanced diet, you see. Lots of fresh vegetables, lean protein… I make everything from scratch. I don’t believe in all those processed things. Honestly, it’s probably the healthiest part of my life, my cooking. Though, it’s not helping with this…discoloration, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t seem to be, unfortunately. A very balanced diet… that’s excellent. Alright, Ms. Bartock, I’d like to take a look at the areas you're concerned about, if you don’t mind. Would you be comfortable with a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please do. I’d like to get this sorted out, if possible. It’s just… unnerving, not knowing what it is. And frankly, I have a luncheon with the ladies next week, and I’d rather not…draw attention to myself. They can be quite judgmental, you know. It’s very important to maintain appearances.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Maintaining appearances is understandable. If you’ll just have a seat here, and I’ll take a look. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Alright… I see the discoloration you’re referring to. Patchy, brownish… it’s not raised or scaly, and there doesn't seem to be any tenderness. The borders are somewhat irregular. Hmm. It does appear to be mostly concentrated on sun-exposed areas. Do you spend much time outdoors?
PATIENT: Well, I do enjoy gardening. Not excessively, mind you. I wear a hat, of course, and I try to stay in the shade as much as possible. But I am out there for a couple of hours most days, weather permitting. I do enjoy a good tomato, you see. And my roses need tending to. Though, I’m always very careful. I really don't like being burned. It’s just…I’ve always been careful. It's baffling, really. My skin has always been…reliable.
DOCTOR: Gardening… that’s helpful to know. And you do take precautions, wearing a hat. Okay. It appears to be mostly on your forearms and around the cheekbones, as you mentioned. The skin feels normal to the touch, and there's no noticeable inflammation. Based on what I’m seeing, it’s difficult to say definitively without further investigation. However, given the patchy discoloration, the distribution on sun-exposed areas, and your history, one possibility is solar lentigo, also known as sun spots or age spots. It’s quite common, especially in people who’ve had sun exposure over the years. But, it's important to rule out other causes, as there are other conditions that can present similarly.
PATIENT: Solar…lentigo? Sun spots? Oh, goodness. That sounds…dreadful. Is it serious? Will it…spread? And what does that mean? I pride myself on taking care of my skin. I use a good moisturizer, I avoid harsh chemicals… I really don't want anything…cosmetically displeasing. And, frankly, I don’t have time for anything complicated. I have a very busy schedule, you see. Luncheons, gardening, keeping the house tidy… it all takes time. Is there a cream or something? Something simple?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Ms. Bartock. “Dreadful” is a strong word, and thankfully, solar lentigo is generally not serious. It’s a cosmetic condition, meaning it doesn’t pose a threat to your health. And it usually doesn't spread. It's caused by sun exposure over time, and it’s more common as we age. There are several treatment options. Topical creams, such as hydroquinone or tretinoin, can help lighten the spots over time. They do require consistent use for several weeks or months to see results, and they can sometimes cause mild irritation. We can also consider procedures like cryotherapy, which freezes the spots off, or laser treatment, which can remove them more quickly. However, those procedures are a bit more involved and may require multiple sessions. Before we decide on a treatment plan, I’d like to order a simple skin biopsy just to be absolutely sure what we're dealing with. It's a very quick procedure where we take a small sample of the skin and send it to the lab for analysis. It will give us a definitive diagnosis and help us determine the best course of action. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A biopsy? Oh, goodness. That sounds…invasive. And what if it’s something…serious? I really don't like the sound of that at all. I’m perfectly healthy, as I’ve said. And I really don't want to be poked and prodded. Is it absolutely necessary? I mean, couldn’t we just try a cream first? A simple cream? I really don't want to cause a fuss. And I have the luncheon next week, as I’ve mentioned. I don't want to have a bandage on my face. It would be quite…unbecoming. Honestly, sometimes I think these doctors just want to do things to…complicate things. Are you sure it’s necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Bartock. It's perfectly reasonable to feel apprehensive about a biopsy. It is a small procedure, but I completely respect your hesitation. The reason I recommend it is simply to rule out other, less common conditions that can sometimes resemble solar lentigo. While it's most likely sun spots, a biopsy offers peace of mind and allows us to tailor the treatment plan to your specific needs. It’s a very quick procedure, and the discomfort is minimal. We can perform it right here in the office. The sample is very small, and it usually only requires a few stitches, if any at all. We can even schedule it so that the area will have time to heal before your luncheon next week. If you're still hesitant, we can certainly try a topical cream first. However, it may take several weeks to see results, and it may not be as effective if it's not sun spots. Also, without a diagnosis, we won’t know for sure if the cream is the right treatment. It's a bit of a trade-off between speed and certainty. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. This is all so…complicated. A trade-off between speed and certainty… Honestly, I really don't like trade-offs. I just want this…blemish to go away. And I really don't want to have a bandage on my face. Alright. Fine. Do the biopsy. But you must promise me it will be quick. And you must promise me it won't leave a visible scar. And you must schedule it so that it won't interfere with my luncheon. And you must explain everything very clearly beforehand. I really don't like surprises. And please, be gentle. I have very delicate skin. Is that understood?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Bartock. Perfectly understood. Quick, minimal scarring, scheduled around your luncheon, clear explanations, and gentle technique. I’ll make sure to document all of that. Let me explain the procedure briefly. We’ll numb the area with a local anesthetic, then take a small sample of skin with a special instrument. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes, including the numbing time. We’ll apply a bandage to protect the area, and I’ll give you detailed instructions on how to care for it. The sample will be sent to the lab for analysis, and we should have the results back in about a week. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to local anesthetics?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. My husband always checks those things. He’s very thorough, you see. Though, I do tend to bruise easily. Is that a problem? And will it hurt? I really don't like pain. Honestly, sometimes I think doctors just don’t understand how sensitive some people are. It’s just… unnerving, having things poked and prodded. And what if it’s something…serious? You haven’t really reassured me on that point. Are you absolutely sure it’s most likely sun spots? And will I need follow-up appointments? I really don't have time for endless appointments. Honestly, I just want this over with.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask those questions, Ms. Bartock. Easy bruising is good to know, and we’ll be extra careful to minimize any discomfort. Regarding pain, the anesthetic will numb the area completely, so you shouldn’t feel any sharp pain during the procedure. You may feel a slight pressure or pinching sensation, but it shouldn’t be anything unbearable. Afterwards, you may experience some mild discomfort or soreness, which can be managed with over-the-counter pain relievers. Regarding the likelihood of it being sun spots, based on my exam, that’s the most likely scenario. However, a biopsy is the only way to confirm it definitively. If it turns out to be something else, we’ll discuss the appropriate treatment plan at that time. As for follow-up appointments, we’ll schedule one to remove the stitches, usually in about a week or so. If the biopsy results require further investigation, we’ll discuss that then, but it’s unlikely. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… get it over with quickly, please. And be gentle. And promise me it won't leave a visible scar. Honestly, I really don't want to be self-conscious. It’s just… it’s very important to maintain appearances, you see. And I have the luncheon. I really don’t want to ruin it. Alright. Let’s do it. But warn me before you poke anything. I really don’t like surprises. And please, make sure your hands are clean. Honestly, you never know what germs are lurking around.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Bartock. I’ll warn you before each step, and I assure you my hands are thoroughly clean. We follow strict sterilization protocols. Alright, I’m just going to clean the area now. This may feel a little cool. Just a quick wipe… there you go. Now, I’m going to inject a small amount of local anesthetic. You’ll feel a brief pinch… There… just a little pinch… Now it will start to numb the area. This will take a few minutes. I'll let you know when it's ready.
PATIENT: Oh! That was a pinch. It’s…tingling now. Is that normal? Honestly, I really don't like needles. It makes me feel…faint. Just…let me know when it’s completely numb. And please, don't poke around too much. I really don’t want to feel anything. And what if it bleeds? I really don’t want a mess. Honestly, sometimes I think these procedures are just… unnecessary. But I suppose I agreed to it. Just… hurry up, please. And try not to make a scene. I really don't want to draw attention to myself.
DOCTOR: Yes, the tingling is perfectly normal, Ms. Bartock. It means the anesthetic is working. It will continue to numb the area over the next few minutes. I understand your discomfort with needles, and I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. We’ll wait just a moment longer until it’s completely numb. You shouldn’t feel any pain at all. I’ll do a little test pinch to make sure. Okay, excellent. You shouldn’t feel anything. Now, I’m just going to make a small incision with a special instrument to remove a tiny sample of skin. It will be very quick. Just a little pinch… and there we go. It’s done. Now, I’m just going to apply some pressure to stop any bleeding. It may bleed a little bit, but it should stop very quickly. There… just a little bit of bleeding. It’s stopping now.
PATIENT: Oh! That was a pinch. And it’s… tingling even more now. Honestly, I really don’t like this. It feels… strange. And what if it gets infected? I really don’t want to have to come back here. Just… make sure everything is sterile, please. And what if it leaves a scar? I really don’t want a visible scar. It would be quite…unbecoming. Just… hurry up, please. And please, don’t make a mess. I really don’t want to draw attention to myself. And what will happen to the sample? Where does it go? Honestly, I just want this over with. And will it hurt when you take off the bandage?
DOCTOR: You're doing wonderfully, Ms. Bartock. It's almost over. The tingling is normal, and it will subside soon. I understand your concerns, and I want to assure you that everything is sterile. We use strict infection control protocols. Okay, I’m just applying a bandage now. It will protect the area and help stop any bleeding. The risk of infection is very low, but we'll provide you with detailed instructions on how to care for the area to minimize any risk. And we’ll take every precaution to minimize scarring. We use a special technique to close the incision, and we’ll provide you with a scar cream to help with healing. As for the sample, it will be sent to a laboratory for analysis. They’ll examine it under a microscope to determine the cause of the discoloration. We’ll receive the results in about a week. As for removing the bandage, it may be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t hurt. We’ll use a gentle technique, and we’ll provide you with instructions on how to care for the area afterwards. Okay, all done. Just keep the area clean and dry, and follow the instructions we provide. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I suppose not. Just… please make sure the instructions are very clear. I really don’t want to mess this up. And what if it’s something… serious? You haven’t really reassured me on that point. Honestly, sometimes I think doctors just like to… worry people. Alright. I suppose I’ll be going now. Just… please don’t call me with bad news. And please, don’t expect me to come back for endless appointments. I really don’t have time for that. Oh, and one more thing. What if I have questions later? Who should I call? And please, make sure it's someone… competent. Honestly, I just want this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Bartock. Here are the aftercare instructions, and they are very clear. And I understand your concerns. While we need to rule out other possibilities, the most likely scenario is solar lentigo, which is not serious. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call the clinic, and ask for me directly. I'll be happy to answer them. If I'm unavailable, the on-call physician is highly competent and can assist you. We’ll contact you with the results in about a week. And if you have any concerns about the healing process, please call us immediately. Have a good day, Ms. Bartock. And please, don’t worry. We’ll take care of you.
