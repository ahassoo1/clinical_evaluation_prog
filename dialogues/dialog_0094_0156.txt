DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi, Dr. Gegan, nice to meet you too. Um... well, it's my stomach, I guess. I've been having… a lot of trouble with diarrhea lately. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it’s just… really annoying, to be honest. I don’t really remember exactly when it started, but definitely a few weeks, maybe more? It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Diarrhea for a few weeks now. It’s certainly frustrating when something like that drags on. To help me get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. Um… it's pretty much constant, but some days are worse than others. Like, sometimes I just… have to go, really quickly. And it’s… watery, obviously. I haven't noticed any blood or anything, if that makes sense. And it doesn’t really hurt, just… uncomfortable. Honestly, I mostly just feel tired all the time now. I’m married, so it's a bit embarrassing, you know? Having to run to the bathroom all the time.
DOCTOR: I completely understand how disruptive and embarrassing that can be, Jase. Thank you for sharing that with me. No blood is good to know. And tiredness is a common symptom with ongoing diarrhea – it can really drain your energy. When you say constant, about how many times a day would you estimate you’re going to the bathroom?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. That's a good question. Um… at least six, maybe more? Sometimes it feels like every hour. It’s hard to keep track, honestly. It's not like a normal amount, that’s for sure. I'm on Medicare, so I don’t really want to be racking up bills going back and forth all the time, you know? It's just... a lot. I don’t remember a time it stopped completely in the last few weeks.
DOCTOR: Okay, at least six times a day for several weeks now, with no complete breaks. That certainly explains the tiredness. It's good you mentioned your Medicare coverage – we'll definitely keep costs in mind as we figure this out. Have you noticed anything that seems to make it worse, or perhaps a little better?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. I don’t think anything specifically makes it worse. I mean, eating probably doesn’t help, but I have to eat something, right? I’ve tried… maybe cutting out dairy? I don’t really remember if that helped. I don't really keep a food diary or anything. My husband does most of the cooking, and I just… eat what he makes. Sorry, I'm not very helpful. It all just feels kind of blurry.
DOCTOR: You're being very helpful, Jase. It's completely understandable that it feels blurry when it's been going on for weeks. No need to apologize at all. So, no specific foods seem to worsen it, and you've tried reducing dairy without a clear result. Now, let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you experienced any fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: No fever, definitely not. And I haven’t thrown up, thank goodness. Sometimes my stomach feels a little… achy? But not really pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, maybe? And it comes and goes. Mostly it's just the… constant running. I feel so drained. I think I might have lost a bit of weight, but I haven't actually weighed myself recently. Everything feels like such a hassle now. I barely have the energy to think straight.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or vomiting, just occasional dull abdominal discomfort. And possibly some weight loss, but not confirmed. I hear you – constant diarrhea can really take a toll on your energy levels and overall well-being. Let’s move onto some other questions, if you don’t mind. Have you traveled anywhere recently, or been exposed to anyone who has been sick?
PATIENT: No, I haven't traveled anywhere. Just been at home, really. And no, not that I know of. My husband works in an office, so he sometimes gets a cold, but nothing major. And I haven't been around anyone else who's been sick, not recently. I mean, I go to the shops sometimes, but I try to avoid people when I can. It’s just me and my husband, mostly. I honestly have no idea what could be causing this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no recent travel or known exposure to illness. That helps rule some things out. Now, thinking about your past health, do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… well, the doctor told me a while back that I might have something with my stomach… IBD or… celiac? Something like that. I don't really remember the exact name. He did some tests, but then I haven’t really been back since. It wasn’t anything urgent, he said, just to watch out for certain things. I think that's why I'm on Medicare, maybe? Honestly, everything is so hazy. I don’t keep track of that stuff. I just try to get through the day.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very important information, Jase. It sounds like there may have been some previous investigation into a possible inflammatory bowel disease or celiac disease. Do you happen to have any records from that visit we could access?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. I honestly have no idea. My husband handles all the paperwork and doctor’s appointments. I’d have to ask him. He keeps everything in a filing cabinet somewhere… I’m terrible with that sort of thing. Would you… want me to ask him? I could call him, maybe? He’s at work right now, but I could leave a message. It might take a while, though. I’m so sorry I’m not more helpful. This is all so frustrating. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: You are not at all being unhelpful, Jase. It’s perfectly understandable that you don't have that information readily available. Let's do this: I can try to access your records electronically through your Medicare information. We can also call your husband later if we can't find anything that way. Before we do that, let me ask a few more questions about your current medications and allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I take a vitamin D supplement sometimes, if I remember. And sometimes ibuprofen for headaches. But that's it, I think. Nothing regularly. Oh! And I use a Ventolin inhaler if I get out of breath, but that’s not very often. My doctor gave it to me a long time ago for… something. I don’t really remember. I don’t have any allergies that I know of. My husband always checks the ingredients before I eat anything, just in case. He's very careful.
DOCTOR: Okay, so Vitamin D occasionally, ibuprofen for headaches, and a Ventolin inhaler as needed. No known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical examination, if that’s okay with you. I’ll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I'm just glad you're trying to figure this out. I'm getting really tired of feeling like this. Please, go ahead. Just… be gentle? My stomach's been pretty sensitive lately.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. Okay, I’m listening now. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: Um… a little bit, maybe? Not sharp pain, just… achy. It’s… hard to explain. It feels kind of all over, really. Like a dull pressure. It’s worse on the left side, I think. And… it feels a bit bloated, if that makes sense? Like I’m really full, even though I haven’t eaten much. Oh, and… it kind of feels… gurgly? I can hear noises, if I listen closely. Is that normal? I’m sorry, I’m probably making this very difficult.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not making it difficult at all, Jase. This is all very helpful information. The dull ache, more pronounced on the left side, bloating, and gurgling sounds are all things I need to take note of. Okay, I’m not feeling any significant masses or tenderness beyond what you’ve described. Your abdomen is slightly distended, which can explain the bloated feeling. I’m going to document these findings. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms consistent with chronic diarrhea, possibly related to Irritable Bowel Syndrome or, given your previous history, a flare-up of an undiagnosed inflammatory bowel condition or celiac disease. However, to get a clearer picture, we need to run some tests. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. Anything to figure out what’s going on. Tests sound good. I just… want this to be over with. I'm so tired of feeling sick. What kind of tests are we talking about? Are they… awful? I’m not very good with medical stuff, to be honest. I get a little anxious. Will they take a lot of blood?
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Jase. It’s perfectly normal to feel that way. We'll take things one step at a time. We'll start with a comprehensive stool sample to check for infections and inflammation. We’ll also do a blood test to check for celiac disease antibodies, as well as some basic inflammatory markers and to rule out other potential causes. The blood draw will be a standard amount—a few vials—and isn’t typically too painful, just a quick pinch. It’s likely we’ll also need to order a colonoscopy, if possible, to directly visualize the colon and take biopsies if needed, but we can discuss that further once we have the results of the initial tests. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Okay… a stool sample, blood test, and maybe a colonoscopy… It sounds… a lot, but if it will help figure out what’s wrong, then yes, manageable. I guess. A colonoscopy sounds… scary? What’s involved in that? And how long will it take to get the results back? I really just want to get back to normal. My husband is starting to worry about me. He keeps asking if I need to go back to the hospital.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Jase. A colonoscopy does sound intimidating, but it’s a very safe and effective procedure. Essentially, a thin, flexible tube with a camera is gently inserted into your rectum to visualize the entire colon. It's performed under sedation, so you won’t feel any discomfort. It allows us to see if there are any abnormalities, like inflammation or polyps, and take small tissue samples for examination. It’s the most definitive way to diagnose many colon-related conditions. The lab results from the stool and blood tests usually take about 5-7 business days. The colonoscopy results will take a little longer, as the tissue samples need to be analyzed by a pathologist—typically 10-14 business days. I’ll order these tests now, and my nurse will schedule appointments for you. We’ll review the results together as soon as they become available and discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, are you able to manage with your current diet and hydration?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… better, knowing it’s under sedation. It’s just… a lot to take in. I guess. Um, managing… I’m trying to eat small meals, but it doesn’t always stay down. And I’m drinking a lot of water, but it feels like I’m just going through it all anyway. I’m not really getting any energy. My husband has been making me soup and toast. But honestly, I’m mostly just tired and uncomfortable. He’s worried sick. He keeps asking if I should go to the hospital, but I don’t want to go unless it’s really bad. I guess… I’ll just try to wait for the test results. Is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Any foods I should definitely avoid? Or anything to look out for?
DOCTOR: It’s completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, Jase. You're doing the right thing by focusing on hydration and small meals. In the meantime, try to avoid foods that tend to worsen diarrhea—like dairy, sugary drinks, fatty foods, and caffeine. Bland foods like rice, toast, bananas, and applesauce are usually well-tolerated. Most importantly, please monitor for any of the following warning signs: high fever , severe abdominal pain, bloody stools, signs of dehydration , or persistent vomiting. If you experience any of these, go to the nearest emergency room immediately. My nurse will also provide you with written instructions regarding these warning signs. I'm going to write a referral for you to a gastroenterologist, as they are the specialists in this area. Having them involved will be very beneficial, regardless of the test results. Do you have any questions for me before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Dr. Gegan. You’ve been very helpful. It’s… reassuring to have a plan, I guess. I’ll try to follow the instructions and wait for the test results. And I’ll keep an eye out for those warning signs. I really appreciate you referring me to a specialist. I think… that’s all. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jase. I'm glad I could help ease your mind a bit. Remember, I'm here if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. My nurse will be reaching out to schedule things, so expect a call soon. Please take care of yourself and try to rest. I will see you soon, and we’ll discuss the results together.
