DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fornes. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you! Well, it’s just a routine check-up, really. My husband thought I should probably get my shots updated, you know, to be safe. He worries about these things more than I do.
DOCTOR: A preventative visit prompted by your husband. Very considerate of him. While I appreciate his concern, a “routine check-up” generally involves more than just vaccinations. Have you been experiencing any specific symptoms or health concerns recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing I’d call a concern, anyway. Just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, I guess. My knees bother me sometimes when the weather changes, and my back isn’t what it used to be, but I work construction, so… that comes with the territory, you know? Is it important I mention all that?
DOCTOR: It is important, Ms. Fornes. “Usual aches and pains” can still be indicative of underlying issues. It’s my job to determine whether those are simply related to your profession or something else. Construction work is physically demanding, certainly. Let’s start with your knees. When did you first notice the pain, and what makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s been… gradual, I think. Probably started a couple of years ago, honestly. It’s worse when it’s cold, definitely. And after I’ve been on my feet all day, or if I’ve been squatting a lot. Rest helps, and sometimes I wrap them with those ace bandages. Nothing fancy. I haven't really done anything about it, though. Just tried to ignore it.
DOCTOR: “Tried to ignore it.” Ms. Fornes, that's not a strategy I recommend. Ignoring pain rarely makes it go away, and can sometimes cause further damage. Now, tell me about your back. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, you’re right, I know. Bad habit, I guess. My back… it comes and goes. It’s usually just a dull ache, lower back, mostly. But if I lift something heavy, or bend over in a weird way… that’s when it really flares up. Sometimes it’ll shoot pain down my leg, but not always. It’s been worse this summer, with all the concrete work we’ve been doing. I try to lift with my legs, but… you know how it is.
DOCTOR: I do know how it is, Ms. Fornes. Years of experience with patients who underestimate the importance of proper lifting technique. Have you ever had any injuries to your back or knees?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I twisted my back pretty bad when I was younger, maybe twenty years ago? Had to go to physical therapy for a bit. And I’ve sprained my ankle a couple of times, nothing serious. But nothing major to my knees, not that I remember. Just the usual bumps and bruises that come with the job. Honestly, I’m pretty lucky considering what I do.
DOCTOR: “Pretty lucky.” Ms. Fornes, you’ve described a history of physical strain and repeated minor injuries. Luck has very little to do with it. Now, let's move on to other things. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Well, when my knees are really bothering me, I take ibuprofen. The regular kind, you know, like Advil. And sometimes I take Tylenol for headaches. But that’s about it. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. I don’t really believe in taking a lot of medication unless I absolutely have to. And no supplements, no. Just… coffee. Does that count?
DOCTOR: “Coffee.” Hardly a medical intervention, Ms. Fornes. I’m noting ibuprofen and acetaminophen use as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve eaten pretty much everything, and never had a reaction. My mom always said I had an iron stomach. And I've never had a problem with any kind of medicine, as far as I can remember. Hmm… actually, I did get a rash once, when I was a kid, after eating some berries… but that was a long time ago. I don’t even remember what kind of berries they were. It wasn’t a bad rash, just itchy.
DOCTOR: “Itchy.” Ms. Fornes, even minor reactions should be documented. We’ll note a possible sensitivity to unidentified berries. Now, let’s discuss your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that. I’ve been pretty healthy, all my life. My blood pressure is usually a little high when I’m at the doctor’s office, just because I get nervous. But it’s always fine at home. And no arthritis or anything like that, thankfully. My grandmother had arthritis, but I don’t think I inherited it. I’m lucky, like I said! Though maybe I’m just tough.
DOCTOR: “Tough” is not a medical diagnosis, Ms. Fornes. We'll note normal blood pressure at home, with possible elevation in the clinical setting. Now, has anyone in your family—parents, siblings, grandparents—had any significant health problems?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think... My dad had heart problems when he got older, had a bypass surgery, I think. And my mom had some trouble with her eyesight. She went blind when she was in her 80s. And my brother, he's got high blood pressure, like I said. Oh, and my aunt, on my dad’s side, she had diabetes. But other than that, I don’t really know… We don’t really talk about health stuff much in my family. It’s just… not a thing.
DOCTOR: History of heart disease in father, vision loss in mother, hypertension in brother, and diabetes in aunt. Very informative. Now, Ms. Fornes, before I proceed with the physical examination, is there anything else—anything at all—that you think I should know?
PATIENT: Hmm... Well, I haven’t been sleeping very well lately. Just restless, you know? And I’ve been feeling a little more tired than usual. But I figured that was just from working so hard. I don't really worry about things. I'm a pretty optimistic person, usually. Oh! And my husband’s been wanting me to get a flu shot too. He’s a worrier, like I said. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Insomnia and fatigue. And a husband concerned about vaccinations. All relevant. Very well. Now, Ms. Fornes, I’m going to need to perform a physical examination to get a clearer picture of your overall health. Please have a seat on the examination table. We’ll start with your vital signs.
PATIENT: Okay. Sounds good, Doctor. I haven't been on one of these tables in a while. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Simply relax, Ms. Fornes. I'll be starting with your blood pressure. Tell me if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay, I'm relaxed. Though, like I said, it’s always a little higher at the doctor’s office. I get nervous, I guess. Is this tight?
DOCTOR: 148 over 92. As expected. Your pulse is regular, but elevated at 88 beats per minute. Take deep breaths, in and out…
PATIENT: Okay, deep breaths. In… and out… Is that okay? I used to smoke when I was younger, but I quit about twenty years ago. Does that make a difference?
DOCTOR: Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, but a history of smoking is relevant, regardless of cessation. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… normal stomach stuff, I guess. I eat pretty healthy, mostly. Sometimes I get heartburn, but that’s about it. Ooh, that’s a little tender there. But it’s probably just gas. I ate a big lunch.
DOCTOR: Tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen, likely musculoskeletal, but will monitor. And now, let's examine your knees. Do you feel any pain with this movement?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s a little uncomfortable. It’s not sharp pain, just… a dull ache. It’s worse when you bend it all the way. Like that. I can still walk, though, and I haven’t had any trouble with it locking up or anything. It just gets sore after a long day.
DOCTOR: Some crepitus noted with range of motion, and mild tenderness medially. No significant swelling. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. This may feel a little strange.
PATIENT: Oh! That tickles! There it is. Is that normal? I haven't had my reflexes checked in… I don't even remember when. I'm getting old, I guess.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is within normal limits. Alright, Ms. Fornes, that concludes the physical examination. I've noted your elevated blood pressure, slightly elevated pulse, history of smoking, tenderness in your abdomen, and crepitus in your knees. We'll need to discuss some potential next steps.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… thorough. What do you think it all means, Doctor? Is there something seriously wrong? I'm not really worried, but my husband will be asking, for sure. He always worries.
DOCTOR: It’s too early to determine if there’s something “seriously wrong,” Ms. Fornes. However, several factors warrant further investigation. Your blood pressure elevation, while likely exacerbated by the clinical setting, needs to be monitored. The tenderness in your abdomen could be indicative of several issues, ranging from musculoskeletal strain to something more significant. And the crepitus in your knees suggests some degree of joint degeneration, which is not uncommon with age and physical activity. I recommend a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolytes, a complete blood count to rule out any underlying infection, and an X-ray of your knees to evaluate the extent of any joint damage. We should also schedule regular blood pressure checks to monitor your cardiovascular health.
PATIENT: Oh, wow. That's… a lot. Blood tests and X-rays… I haven’t had those done in years. Is it really necessary? I feel fine, mostly. And I really don’t like going to the hospital. My husband will be relieved you're being so thorough, though. He always says I should get checked out more often. What about the flu shot? Should we do that while we're at it? And how much will all this cost? I don't have insurance, so… that’s a concern.
DOCTOR: While you feel fine, Ms. Fornes, that doesn’t necessarily mean everything is fine. These tests are necessary to establish a baseline and rule out any underlying conditions. Early detection is always preferable. As for the flu shot, I recommend it, particularly given your age and the upcoming flu season. It’s a simple and effective way to protect yourself from a potentially serious illness. Regarding cost, I understand your concern about being uninsured. The cost of the comprehensive metabolic panel is approximately $150, the complete blood count is $80, and the X-ray of the knees is $200. We do offer a payment plan option, and I can provide you with a list of local resources that may be able to assist with the costs. We can discuss the payment plan after the tests are completed. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves or the results we’re looking for?
PATIENT: Two hundred dollars for an X-ray… that’s a lot. Okay. I guess I understand. Early detection and all that. And my husband will definitely be happy about the flu shot. He worries so much. I don’t really know much about those tests, Doctor. What are you looking for, exactly? And what happens if something is wrong? Will I need to see a specialist? I just… I don’t like surprises. I prefer to just keep things simple.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Fornes. Let me explain. The comprehensive metabolic panel assesses your kidney function, liver function, and electrolyte balance. It can help us identify any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to your symptoms. The complete blood count checks for any signs of infection, anemia, or other blood disorders. And the X-ray of the knees will reveal the extent of any joint damage, such as osteoarthritis or cartilage loss. If the tests reveal any abnormalities, we will discuss the findings in detail and determine the appropriate course of action. This may involve further testing, medication, or a referral to a specialist. For example, if the X-ray reveals significant joint damage, I would recommend a consultation with an orthopedic surgeon. However, it’s important to remember that these tests are simply a tool to help us understand your overall health. They do not necessarily indicate that something is wrong. And if the results are normal, we can simply monitor your health regularly and focus on preventative care. Do you have any further questions about the tests or the potential outcomes?
PATIENT: Okay… that makes a little more sense. So, it’s not necessarily a bad thing if we find something. It just means we need to do more tests, or see another doctor. Alright. I guess I can agree to the tests. But I want to be clear, Doctor, if it’s just something minor, I don't want to go overboard with unnecessary treatments. I'm an older woman, and I've lived a long life. I just want to stay healthy and active for as long as possible. And maybe get that flu shot. When can we schedule the tests? And can you please explain the payment plan options again? My husband is good with paperwork, so he can handle it.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Fornes. I appreciate your pragmatism and clear understanding. We will proceed with the comprehensive metabolic panel, complete blood count, and knee X-ray. I assure you, we will not pursue any unnecessary treatments. The goal is to identify any potential issues and develop a tailored plan to help you maintain your health and activity level. We can schedule the blood work for tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM. The X-ray can be scheduled for the following day, at 10:00 AM. Here are the requisitions and order. Regarding the payment plan, we offer a 20% down payment, followed by monthly installments of $50. We also accept cash, check, and credit card. The paperwork is straightforward. Your husband can handle the details. Do you have any further questions before we conclude?
PATIENT: 8:00 AM tomorrow… okay. And 10:00 AM the day after. That works. 20% down payment and $50 a month… that’s manageable. No, I think that covers everything. Thank you, Doctor Trestrail. You’ve been very patient with me, and I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. My husband will be happy to hear this. I guess I’ll see you tomorrow morning then.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Fornes. I will see you tomorrow morning. Have a pleasant evening.
