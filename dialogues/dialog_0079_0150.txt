DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you are 51 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It’s rather obvious, isn’t it? I want to… have a baby. And I want to do it easily. I don’t have time for… complications. I’m not getting any younger, you know.
DOCTOR: "Obvious," you say. While I appreciate directness, Ms. Shteynberg, a desire to conceive doesn’t necessarily present with a clear physical symptom. Let’s clarify. Is this your first attempt at pregnancy, or have you tried previously?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t patronize me. Of course it’s not obvious. I’m stating the reason for my visit. And no, it is not my first. I was married, once. A long time ago. We… tried. It didn't work. And frankly, I don't want to revisit all that. I just want to know what can be done now. Quickly.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Shteynberg, I am not attempting to be patronizing. However, understanding your previous attempts is rather crucial. Knowing the details – even if unpleasant – allows me to assess potential issues and determine the most appropriate course of action. "Didn't work" is… vague. Were there any investigations done at the time?
PATIENT: Investigations? Honestly, it was decades ago! He… the ex-husband… insisted on some things. Blood tests, I think. Maybe a scan. I was young. I didn’t pay much attention to the details. He just said everything was “fine” on my end, and… well, it wasn’t. Look, can we skip the history lesson? I need solutions, not a rehash of a failed marriage.
DOCTOR: Very well. While a complete history is always preferable, we can proceed with a more focused approach. Given your age, and the fact that you’ve experienced difficulty conceiving previously, we need to assess your current ovarian reserve and overall reproductive health. Have you had any regular gynecological check-ups in the past few years?
PATIENT: Gynecological check-ups? Look, I run a bicycle repair shop, Doctor. I don't have time for annual… examinations. When something was wrong before, I went to the doctor. Otherwise, no. I am perfectly capable of knowing my own body. Although, clearly, it needs… assistance now. Is that what those tests are for? To see if anything is even working anymore?
DOCTOR: Precisely, Ms. Shteynberg. We’ll need to run some bloodwork to evaluate your hormone levels – specifically Follicle-Stimulating Hormone , Luteinizing Hormone , and Anti-Müllerian Hormone . These will give us an indication of your ovarian reserve. We should also perform a transvaginal ultrasound to assess your uterus and ovaries, and check for any fibroids or cysts. Are you comfortable proceeding with these tests?
PATIENT: Transvaginal… ultrasound? Is that absolutely necessary? It sounds… invasive. And honestly, Doctor, I’d rather not spend all day lying around in a clinic. What kind of information will it really give you that bloodwork won’t? Can’t we just start with the blood tests and see what those say?
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, while bloodwork is a valuable starting point, a transvaginal ultrasound provides critical information that blood tests simply cannot. It allows us to visualize the uterus and ovaries directly, identifying any structural abnormalities, such as fibroids, polyps, or cysts, that could be hindering conception. It also allows us to count the number of antral follicles, which is a direct measure of your remaining egg supply. It is a relatively quick and – I assure you – safe procedure. If you are truly serious about pursuing pregnancy, it is a necessary step. Are you experiencing any pelvic pain, irregular bleeding, or unusual discharge?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Bleeding is… normal. As normal as it gets for someone my age, anyway. Honestly, Doctor, you’re making this sound so complicated! Can’t you just… give me something to make it happen? Like a pill? Or an injection? I’ve heard things… People do it all the time. Is that not an option? I don’t want a lot of poking and prodding and… waiting.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, you are referring to fertility medications, likely Clomiphene or Letrozole, or potentially injectable gonadotropins. While these can be effective, they are not without risks, and they are not appropriate for everyone. Moreover, they are best used in conjunction with monitoring – typically through ultrasound and blood tests – to minimize the risk of complications such as multiple pregnancies or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Furthermore, given your history of difficulty conceiving, it’s crucial to understand why your previous attempts were unsuccessful before initiating any treatment. I must emphasize that proceeding without a thorough evaluation would be irresponsible. I need to know your baseline hormone levels, assess your uterine health, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, not that I know of. Look, Doctor, are you saying I'm too old for this? Because if that’s what you’re saying, just say it. I don’t need a sugar-coated lecture about my… reproductive timeline. I just want to know if there’s anything you can do, and if it’s going to involve a month-long investigation. I have a business to run.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I am not saying you are "too old." However, fertility does decline with age, and a more cautious and thorough approach is warranted. The investigations I am recommending – bloodwork and a transvaginal ultrasound – are not intended as a month-long ordeal, but as a necessary step to assess your individual situation and determine the safest and most effective course of action. It will take approximately one week to complete these tests and review the results. Before proceeding, I need a detailed list of any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements. Also, could you provide me with information about your menstrual cycle – the typical length of your cycle and the date of your last menstrual period?
PATIENT: Fine. I take a multivitamin. That’s it. And my… cycle. Honestly, it’s all over the place these days. Roughly every… four weeks? Sometimes five. It’s unpredictable. Look, can we just schedule the tests? I have customers waiting. And please, no more questions about my personal life.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shteynberg. I will order the bloodwork and schedule the transvaginal ultrasound for you. The lab is located just down the hall, and the ultrasound technician will contact you directly to arrange an appointment. I will need your insurance information to process the claims. While I understand your desire to expedite this process, I must reiterate the importance of providing a complete medical history. It significantly impacts my ability to provide you with the best possible care. Do you have any family history of early menopause or infertility?
