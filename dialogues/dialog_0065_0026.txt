DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s this tiredness. Just awful tiredness. It comes and goes, but when it hits… I can barely get out of my chair. And the young man at the lab said something about my… numbers being off? Something about my muscles, I think. Honestly, I don’t remember much of what he said. It's all a blur these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. "Tiredness" is rather vague, Ms. Oitker. When did this start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… That’s a difficult one. Seems like… well, a while now. Maybe a few months? Longer? I really can’t put my finger on it. It's not like it was sudden, you see. More… gradual. It just sort of crept up on me. I've been doing my work as usual, though. Still diving, still keeping busy. It's just… harder now, that’s all.
DOCTOR: "Diving?
PATIENT: Yes, diving. Commercial diving, dear. Been doing it for… well, a very long time. It’s honest work, even if it’s a bit strenuous. Though, not as strenuous as it used to be, mind you. I don't do the really deep stuff anymore. Mostly inspections, repairs… things like that. Don’t look so surprised. I can still handle myself, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Commercial diving...right. And you said this tiredness comes and goes?
PATIENT: Yes, it does. Some days I feel… well, not great, but I can get by. Other days… I just have to lie down. It's not like a normal tired, you know? It's more… a weakness. Like all my strength just… vanishes. And my muscles ache, terribly. It's hard to explain, really. It's just...unpleasant.
DOCTOR: When you say your muscles ache, is it all over, or in specific areas?
PATIENT: Hmm... that’s a good question. It's mostly in my legs and back, I think. Though, sometimes it feels like it's everywhere, all at once. It's hard to pinpoint, really. Like when you've done a really hard piece of work, and everything just… feels used up? That sort of ache. Not sharp, not like an injury. Just… worn out. And heavy. My legs feel very heavy sometimes, like I'm dragging weights around.
DOCTOR: Do you notice any other symptoms with this weakness?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Well, sometimes I feel a bit… confused, I suppose. Like I’m not quite thinking straight. And my hands… they've been a bit shaky lately. Not all the time, mind you. Just occasionally. And I’ve noticed my urine is… darker than usual. But honestly, Doctor, I’m an old woman. Things go wrong when you get old. It's probably nothing.
DOCTOR: "Probably nothing" is not a diagnosis, Ms. Oitker. Dark urine and shakiness, along with confusion, are concerning. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, or have you lost any weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh dear. You’re making me worry now. Well, my appetite hasn't been what it used to be, no. I don't eat as much as I used to, that's for sure. And… I suppose I have lost a little weight, now that you mention it. My clothes are a bit looser, aren't they? But I haven't been keeping track, not really. It's just… life gets busy. And when you're tired, you don't really feel like eating, do you?
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to confirm, you said this started a few months ago, gradually worsening?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. A few months, creeping up on me. I kept thinking it was just… old age. You know, getting a bit slower, a bit weaker. It didn't seem worth bothering the doctor over. But then the young man at the lab said something about my numbers being off, and… well, I thought I better come in and get it checked out, just in case. It’s just… all this fuss. It's probably nothing, really. I just don't want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Oitker, it is my job to determine if this is “something” or “nothing.” It sounds like we need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. I want to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and muscle enzymes. We will also need to review your complete blood count. Are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright then. If you think it's necessary. I suppose I haven’t much choice, have I? Allergic… let me see. Not that I know of. I’ve never had any trouble with medications before. Though, I did have a bit of a rash once, years ago, after using a new soap. But it went away on its own. Just a little itch, really. Nothing serious. I hope these tests don't take too long. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to order a complete metabolic panel, a complete blood count, and a urinalysis. I'll also add a creatine kinase level to check for muscle damage. The nurse will draw your blood and collect a urine sample. It will take a few days to get the results back. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh dear, let me think… Well, I take a little something for my arthritis, it’s… naproxen, I believe. Just a small dose, when my joints are acting up. And sometimes, I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor told me my levels were a bit low. But that's it, really. Nothing else. Just the arthritis pills and the vitamin D, when I remember to take them. And a little something for my blood pressure, but that's a very small dose as well. I can't remember the name of it, I'm afraid. It's the little white one, I think.
DOCTOR: “The little white one” is not sufficient, Ms. Oitker. It’s important to have accurate medication information. Do you have a list of medications or perhaps the bottles with you?
PATIENT: Oh, now you're making me feel terrible. I told you, I’m an old woman, my memory isn’t what it used to be. No, I don’t have a list, and I didn’t bring the bottles with me. I’ve been taking them for years, the doctor knows what I’m on. Surely, it's in my records, isn't it? Honestly, all this fuss over a few pills. It's probably nothing, I tell you. My daughter always worries too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Oitker. However, accurate medication reconciliation is a critical part of patient safety. We must verify all medications to avoid potential interactions and ensure appropriate treatment. I'll ask the nurse to check your records, but we may need to contact your primary care physician if the information is incomplete. While we’re waiting, let me perform a brief physical exam. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright, alright. You win. It’s just… all this paperwork and questions. Very well, I’ll try to remember what I take when I get home. And yes, I can stand up. Though, I might need a moment. My legs haven't been feeling their best, you know. There. Not as sprightly as I used to be, but I can manage.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Oitker. Please stand still. I’m going to check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Blood pressure is 140/85. Heart sounds are normal, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear. Now, let me check your reflexes. Reflexes are diminished bilaterally. And finally, I’m going to check your muscle strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? It's not as strong as it used to be, I'm afraid. My grip isn't what it once was, you know. All this diving, all the years of hard work... it takes its toll. And honestly, Doctor, all these tests are making me a bit nervous. I feel like I'm falling apart.
DOCTOR: Your grip is indeed diminished bilaterally, Ms. Oitker. I also noticed some mild swelling in your ankles. Given your symptoms – the fatigue, muscle weakness, dark urine, diminished reflexes, and ankle swelling – along with the lab results indicating abnormal muscle enzymes, I am concerned about the possibility of rhabdomyolysis or other underlying muscle condition. It is also important to rule out kidney issues. I am going to order a creatinine kinase level, a urine myoglobin test, and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney function. We need to investigate this further to determine the cause of your symptoms. I will also send a referral to a nephrologist for further evaluation. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Rhabdo-what? Nephro-who? Oh dear, you’re using all these big words again. It sounds very serious. Are you saying something is terribly wrong with me? I just thought I was getting old. All this fuss, all these tests... I don’t understand any of it. If it’s something terrible, I don’t want to know. I just want to go home and lie down. Is a nephro-… whatever… a specialist? What will they do to me?
DOCTOR: Ms. Oitker, I understand your anxiety, and I apologize for using medical jargon. Let me explain in simpler terms. Rhabdomyolysis is a condition where muscle tissue breaks down, releasing substances that can harm your kidneys. A nephrologist is a kidney specialist. We need to make sure your kidneys are functioning properly, and they can help us determine the cause of your muscle weakness and fatigue. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is terribly wrong, but we need to investigate to be sure. We will run some tests, and then we’ll discuss the results and create a plan. The nurse will explain the next steps and schedule an appointment with the nephrologist. Right now, let’s just focus on getting these tests done. We'll take it one step at a time. Do you have any questions for me at this moment?
PATIENT: One step at a time… That’s what my husband always says. But it all sounds so… frightening. Will it hurt? Will I have to stay in the hospital? I don’t like hospitals. I just want to be home, with my garden… Will I still be able to do my diving? That’s… well, that’s my livelihood. And what about my daughter? She worries so much. Will I be okay? Just tell me… will I be okay?
DOCTOR: Ms. Oitker, it’s understandable to be frightened, and you have every right to feel anxious. I cannot definitively tell you if you will be "okay" at this moment, as we haven't completed all the necessary tests to determine the cause of your symptoms. However, we are taking these symptoms seriously and will do everything we can to find out what’s going on. The tests themselves are relatively painless – just a blood draw and a urine sample. Whether or not you need to stay in the hospital will depend on the results of these tests. If your kidney function is significantly impaired, hospitalization may be necessary for treatment and monitoring. As for your diving, we will need to assess your condition thoroughly before we can discuss whether it’s safe for you to continue. We will keep your daughter informed every step of the way, and I will be happy to answer any questions she may have. Right now, let's focus on getting the tests done. We will take it one step at a time. The nurse is ready to assist you with the blood draw and urine sample. After the tests are completed, we will schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Just… just get it over with. I’m tired. So very tired. Tell the nurse I'm ready. And please… just be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Oitker. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. We will be as quick and efficient as possible. We'll take good care of you. The nurse will be in shortly.
PATIENT: .
