DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bulaong. Good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hello Doctor. It's my chest. It… hurts a little. Not all the time, but sometimes. It's… here. <points to chest> It's kinda strange, you know? I don't think it's from work, maybe.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain. Alright. “A little” is… helpful, but can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… Okay. It's not a sharp pain. More like… dull ache. And it comes and goes. Sometimes it's just on one side, sometimes it feels… all over. It doesn’t hurt to touch it, if that makes sense. It's just… uncomfortable. I noticed it maybe a week ago? I don't really keep track. My wife, she told me I should come see someone.
DOCTOR: Dull ache, comes and goes… not related to touch. A week ago, wife noticed it... Okay. And does anything make it worse?
PATIENT: Not really, I think. I do a lot of… climbing on roofs for work. Maybe it’s a little worse after a long day, but I always feel tired after work. So I don’t know if it’s the pain or just… being tired. Nothing specific makes it worse. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: Right. You mentioned climbing on roofs... is that your full-time job?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I’m a roofer. It’s hard work, but… it pays the bills. Been doing it for… a long time now. Maybe fifteen years? I don’t know exactly. It’s mostly climbing, and… lifting things. Heavy things. It’s good exercise, I guess. But sometimes I worry about falling. But this pain… it doesn’t feel like a falling pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, fifteen years as a roofer. We’ll need to keep that in mind. Now, aside from this chest pain, are you having any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I eat okay, I think. My wife cooks. I sleep alright, usually. I haven’t been sick, or… anything. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but that’s probably just the work. I don't know. Is there something else I should be feeling? Sorry, I don’t really know what to look for.
DOCTOR: No, no apologies needed, Mr. Bulaong. It's good you're asking. Just trying to get a full picture. Let's see... any shortness of breath, even when you’re not working?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath? Hmm… not really. I get a little… winded after climbing a lot of stairs, but that’s normal, right? I'm not a small man. <gestures to himself> I haven’t noticed anything… different. Like, not more breathless than usual. It's just hard work, you know? I don't think it's my breathing.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And how about any nausea, vomiting, sweating, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No, no to all of those. I haven’t been sick to my stomach. No sweating… unless it’s really hot on the roof. And no dizzy. I haven’t fallen, if that’s what you mean. My wife would kill me if I fell. She worries a lot. So, no, I don’t have any of those things. Just the… chest pain. It’s kinda annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, it’s good to rule things out. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need. I just want to know what’s going on. It’s just… worrying me a little, you know? I don’t want it to be something bad.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll figure it out. If you could just hop up on the table here, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel around a bit. Nothing to worry about, just routine. Take a deep breath for me… and again… Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs that I can detect. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Any pain with this?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Doesn’t hurt when you push. It just feels… normal. Like regular chest. Like… muscle, I guess. I don’t think it’s broken or anything. It just aches sometimes. Like when you’ve been working hard. Is that what you're looking for? Are you looking for something hard? I don’t think there’s anything hard in there. <slightly anxious tone>
DOCTOR: No, nothing hard. You’re perfectly right to ask. I’m just checking for any tenderness or abnormalities. No tenderness to palpation. Given your description and what I’m finding on the exam, it could be musculoskeletal pain – meaning related to the muscles and bones in your chest wall. Fifteen years of roofing is a lot of physical work. However, we can’t rule out other possibilities without a little more information. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No allergies. My wife always asks before she gives me anything, she’s very careful. I can take most things, I think. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. She's a good wife. Do you think it is my muscles? From the roofing? That would be… good. I don’t want anything serious.
DOCTOR: It's possible that it’s related to your work, yes. But chest pain always warrants a bit of investigation, just to be safe. I'd like to order a simple EKG – that's an electrocardiogram – just to check your heart rhythm and look for any signs of strain. And a chest X-ray to rule out anything in your lungs or around your heart. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An EKG and a… chest picture? Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s going on. It’s okay if it takes a little time. I don’t mind waiting. Is it… expensive? I don’t have insurance, you see. My wife… she worries about the money. <looks down at his hands>
DOCTOR: I understand. No insurance can make things difficult. The EKG and X-ray are relatively inexpensive tests. We can discuss options if cost is a concern. Let’s get the tests ordered first and then we can see what the results say. It’s possible this is just muscle strain, and we can treat that conservatively. I’ll have the nurse come in and get you set up for the EKG and X-ray. It won’t take long. In the meantime, I'm going to document my findings. And we can talk more about treatment options once we have the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. Thank you. I appreciate you explaining everything. And for not… making me worry too much. I just want to get back to work, you know? But I don’t want to make it worse. The nurse… she’ll come in now? That’s good. Thank you again. <slightly relieved tone>
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. That's what I’m here for. I'll let the nurse know to come in right away. We’ll get this sorted out. Don’t hesitate to ask if you have any questions while you’re waiting.
