DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, my chest… it’s been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me a little. It feels like… a squeezing, sometimes. Like someone is hugging my chest too tight.
DOCTOR: Okay, a squeezing chest pain. That’s good information to start with. When did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… three weeks ago? Around July 10th, I think. Yes, July 10th. I was making empanadas for my grandson, and I felt it then. Not strong, just a little uncomfortable. It’s been happening more since then.
DOCTOR: Okay, July 10th. And has it been gradually getting worse since then, or does it come and go with similar intensity?
PATIENT: It’s… it’s been worse some days, yes. Like last week, when I was helping my daughter with the garden, it really hurt. I had to sit down. But other days, it’s just… a little ache. Not so bad I can’t do things, but enough to make me careful. Does that make sense? I don’t know all the fancy words.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Sherion. And don’t worry about fancy words – we’ll use plain language. So, the pain is brought on by activity, like gardening, and it’s worse than when you’re resting?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! When I’m sitting and watching the telenovela, I barely feel it. But when I move around… or lift something… that's when it bothers me. And it sometimes goes up to my left arm, a little. Not all the way, just… up there. It doesn’t feel numb, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, discomfort in your left arm along with the chest pain that's brought on by activity. I want to get a better sense of this. Does the pain radiate to your jaw, neck, or back at all?
PATIENT: Hmm... now that you mention it... yes! A little bit in my neck. Not always, but sometimes. On the left side. It feels… tight, like a muscle. My daughter rubs it for me sometimes, and that helps a little. I haven't noticed it in my jaw or back though, no. Just the neck, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you short of breath with this pain at all, or do you feel any nausea or dizziness?
PATIENT: No dizziness, no. And I haven't felt sick to my stomach. But… sometimes, when I'm walking up the stairs, I get a little breathless. Not like… really out of breath, just like I need to stop and catch my air. It's not every time, but it's happened a few times since the chest pain started. My stairs are very steep, you see. Old house.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath with exertion, particularly on stairs. Let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing health conditions, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Let me think... the doctor told me a few years ago my blood pressure was a little high. He gave me a little pill for it. I take it every morning. Other than that… no, not really. I don't have sugar problems, and my cholesterol… I don’t remember. It was okay, I think. I go to the doctor every year for my check-up. Medicare pays for it, thank goodness.
DOCTOR: Okay, you’re on medication for high blood pressure. Do you know the name of that medication?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me see… it's a little white pill. I think… lisinopril? Yes, I believe it’s lisinopril. I have so many pills these days, it’s hard to remember! My husband helps me keep track. He's very good with that. But yes, I take lisinopril every morning. It's been a few years now.
DOCTOR: Okay, lisinopril for high blood pressure. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never any surgeries. And I've only been in the hospital once, a long time ago. When I had my grandson, Miguel. It was… a complicated birth, they said. But everything was okay in the end. That was… oh, goodness, 30 years ago! Other than that, no hospitals, no surgeries. I've been very lucky. Mostly just colds and the flu, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations aside from the delivery of your grandson. Now, are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes... my father, he had a problem with his heart. He had to go to the hospital a few times when he was older. They said it was something with the… the pumping. Heart failure, I think they called it. And my mother, she had high blood pressure too, like me. My sister has it as well. So, it runs in the family, you see. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of heart disease and high blood pressure. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never. I never liked cigarettes. My husband used to smoke, but he stopped many years ago. He said it was terrible for his health. So no, I’ve never smoked. And I don’t drink alcohol much either. Just a little wine with dinner sometimes, very little.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I've taken all sorts of pills over the years for headaches and colds, and nothing has ever bothered me. No problems with food either. I eat everything! Empanadas, arepas, all sorts of things. No, no allergies, thank goodness. My grandson is allergic to peanuts, but not me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your pulse. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’m ready. My husband always tells me to listen to the doctor. He says I worry too much, so it’s good to have someone tell me what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. 148 over 86. A little elevated, but not drastically so. I’m listening to your heart now... I hear a slight murmur, but it’s not new, based on your chart from last year. Lungs are clear. Your pulse is regular, at 78. Let's feel your extremities as well. Pulses are good in all extremities. Any swelling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no swelling. My feet sometimes feel a little tired at the end of the day, but they don't swell. Not like my sister's. She gets very bad swelling, but mine are just… tired. Not puffy or anything. Is something wrong, Doctor? You're looking very serious.
DOCTOR: No, no, I’m just trying to gather all the information. It's good that there's no swelling. Okay, based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms consistent with angina – chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart. The fact that it’s brought on by exertion, radiates to your arm and neck, and is accompanied by shortness of breath is concerning, especially given your family history. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order an EKG – that’s a simple test that checks your heart’s electrical activity. And I also want to order a blood test to check your cholesterol levels and rule out other potential causes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Angina… that sounds scary. Is that… serious? The EKG and the blood test… are those painful? I don't like needles very much. My husband can come with me, if that helps. He's very good at holding my hand. And… what if something is wrong?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Sherion. Angina can be a sign of underlying heart disease, but it’s often manageable with medication and lifestyle changes. We're getting these tests to understand what's going on so we can make the best plan for you. The EKG is completely painless. It involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs – it doesn't involve any needles at all. The blood test will involve a small needle prick in your arm, but it's very quick. We have very skilled phlebotomists here who are gentle and efficient. And yes, your husband is more than welcome to come with you, and holding his hand is perfectly fine. If something is wrong, we'll discuss all your options and make a plan together. We may need to refer you to a cardiologist – a heart specialist – for further evaluation and treatment. But let's not jump to conclusions yet. Let’s get these tests done first, and then we can talk about the results. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds a little better. No needles for the EKG is good. And my husband coming with me… that will definitely help. Yes, that’s good. So… we do the EKG first, and then the blood test? And then we wait for the results? How long will that take? I have to go to my grandson’s soccer game on Saturday…
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll do the EKG first, and then the blood test. The EKG will only take a few minutes, and the blood test shouldn’t take much longer than that. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. We can call you with the results as soon as they're available, or you can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in person. I can have my nurse schedule that for you now, if you’d like. We’ll definitely have the results back before your grandson’s soccer game. In the meantime, I want you to take it easy. Avoid any strenuous activity that brings on the chest pain. If you experience any severe chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, I understand. Take it easy, no hard work, and go to the emergency room if it gets really bad. My grandson’s soccer game is Saturday, so that gives us time. Please call me with the results if you can. And… can you write down the name of the emergency room just in case? My memory isn’t what it used to be. And thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here you go. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. My nurse, Maria, will come in shortly to schedule your follow-up and take you to the EKG room. She’ll also explain the procedure in more detail. Do you have any other questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Just… thank you again, Doctor. You've been very helpful. And please tell Maria I’m a little scared of needles, even though I know it’s just a small prick. She can be gentle with me, I hope.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll make a note of that for Maria. She’s very experienced and understanding, and she’ll do her best to make you comfortable. Alright. I’ll leave you to Maria then. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. .
PATIENT: .
