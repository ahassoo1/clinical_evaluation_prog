DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. I’m Dr. Hembrey. I see you’re here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Look, I ain’t got all day, so let’s get straight to it. It’s… well, it’s this. It just… ain’t right, you understand? Too much of it. Always been a skinny fella, worked hard all my life, but now… this. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re concerned about a change in your abdomen, Mr. Trendler. And I assure you, we will be as efficient as possible. However, to determine what “isn’t right,” I’m going to need some more information. When did you first notice this change?
PATIENT: Change? Well now… lemme think. It started… oh, maybe six months ago? After my wife passed, I weren't eatin’ right, you see. Mostly just soup and crackers. Then I started feelin’ better and I started eatin’ more. And more. And it just… stuck. Never been a big eater, I tell ya. Never.
DOCTOR: So, approximately six months ago, following your wife’s passing, you experienced a decrease in appetite, followed by a subsequent increase and noticeable abdominal change. Can you describe this change in more detail?
PATIENT: Change? It’s… bigger. It’s soft. Always been lean, you see? Like a whipcord. Now it’s… jiggles. And it sticks out further when I sit down. My trousers don't fit properly, and I had to loosen my belt, which I never ever do. It's… unseemly. Honestly.
DOCTOR: You’ve noticed an increase in abdominal size and softness, a change in your body composition, and difficulty with your clothing fit. Has this been accompanied by any pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, changes in your bowel habits, or fatigue?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not exactly. Sometimes… a little discomfort, after a big meal. But nothin’ serious. Bloatin’… maybe a little, sometimes. Nausea? No. Vomitin’? Heavens no. Bowels are… regular enough. And fatigue? Well, I'm seventy-six years old, Doctor. I'm always a little tired!
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Recently? Well, like I said, I started eatin’ more after my wife… but now? Now I ain’t as hungry as I was a few months back. Still eat a good plate, mind you, but don't crave things like I used to. Lost a little bit of the taste for sweets, too. Used to love a good mango, but… nothin’ like it anymore.
DOCTOR: So, a decreased appetite compared to a few months ago, and a loss of interest in sweet foods. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Let me think… High blood pressure, Doctor told me years ago. I take a pill for it, every mornin’. And my knees ain’t what they used to be, arthritis, you know. But other than that… no, nothin’ major. Always been a strong fella. Pile driver operator, you know. Hard work keeps you goin’.
DOCTOR: Hypertension, managed with medication, and arthritis. Any previous surgeries, Mr. Trendler?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Hmm... Let me see. Had my appendix out when I was a boy, that was somethin'. And a hernia operation, years and years ago. Must be twenty years, at least. Other than that… nope. Never been much for doctors, if I could help it.
DOCTOR: Appendectomy and hernia repair. Now, regarding your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Well, my mother, she had diabetes, towards the end of her life. And my father… he had heart trouble, I believe. A weak heart, they said. And my sister, she had high blood pressure too, like me. But other than that… not much that I know of. Didn't see much of my family, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Diabetes in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and hypertension in your sister. Do you currently take any medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just the one, Doctor. For the blood pressure. A little white pill, every mornin'. And sometimes, when my knees are botherin’ me somethin’ awful, I take an over-the-counter pain reliever. But that’s it. I don’t like takin’ pills, you know? Messes with your head.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we proceed, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. Never had allergies. Can eat anything, drink anything. Always been a strong stomach, you see. Maybe a little trouble with shellfish once, years ago, but that was a long time back. Not an allergy, really, just… didn't agree with me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Mr. Trendler, based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you've experienced a change in your abdomen accompanied by a decreased appetite and some subtle shifts in your bowel habits, occurring after a period of grief and altered eating patterns. While it’s unlikely to be anything serious, I would like to conduct a physical examination to assess the size and tenderness of your abdomen. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Physical examination? Look, I ain't keen on bein' poked and prodded, Doctor. I told you, I don't much like doctors. But… if you think it’s necessary… alright. Get it over with. Just… be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Trendler. I will be as thorough and gentle as possible. Please lie down on the examination table, and we’ll begin. First, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Your bowel sounds are present, though slightly diminished. There is some softness to the abdomen, as you described. No noticeable guarding or rebound tenderness. I do note some slight fullness in the lower abdomen. Is this where you feel the most… change?
PATIENT: Fullness… yeah, down there. Lower part, you're right. It’s… uncomfortable, sometimes. Not pain, like I said. More like… a heaviness. It feels… bloated, even when I ain't eaten nothin'. And it sticks out further when I’m sittin' down. It’s… embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your discomfort, Mr. Trendler. I’m also checking for any masses or unusual lumps. I don’t feel anything overtly concerning at this time. Now, I’m going to lightly tap on your abdomen to assess for any fluid accumulation. There’s a slight tympany in the lower abdomen, which can be consistent with some gas or fullness. Now, to complete the exam, I’d like to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is 142/88, which is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range considering your history. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Your temperature is 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Based on my examination, I don't detect anything acutely alarming. However, given your change in appetite, fullness, and slightly elevated blood pressure, I recommend a few basic blood tests to rule out any underlying issues, such as anemia, liver or kidney problems, or diabetes. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests? More needles and poking? Heavens to Betsy. Look, Doctor, I ain't keen on all this fuss. I just want this belly to go back to normal, that’s all. But… if you really think it’s necessary… alright. Go ahead. But don't go stickin' me with too many needles, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Trendler. We'll only take the necessary samples. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a fasting blood glucose test. These will give us a good baseline to work from. The lab technician will draw about two vials of blood; it should only take a few minutes. While we wait for the results, I recommend maintaining a healthy diet, staying well-hydrated, and engaging in regular, moderate exercise, if you're able. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits – please contact the office immediately. I will also schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to discuss the results of the blood tests and determine the best course of action. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable… I suppose so. A week… alright. Healthy diet, exercise… easy for you to say, Doctor. But alright. I'll try. Just… get those results back quickly, alright? I don't want to be waitin' around forever. And if anything serious comes up, you tell me straight, understand? No sugar-coatin’.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Trendler. I assure you, I will be direct and honest with you regarding the results. I’ll personally review them with you next week and explain everything in detail. The lab results typically take 2-3 business days to come back, and my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as they are available. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? Nah. Don’t think so. Just… get that belly fixed, Doctor. That’s all I ask. I reckon that's enough talkin' for one day. Can I go now?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Trendler. I’ll have the lab technician come in to draw your blood. Here is a requisition form for the lab, and a sheet with instructions for preparing for the blood tests. Thank you for your patience, and please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. You may get dressed, and I’ll see you next week.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor.
