DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Beinborn. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you too. Well, my left leg has gotten quite swollen, and… I have a heart problem, you see. They told me it was atrial fibrillation, but I don’t really understand all of that. It just…beats funny sometimes. And now this leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, so left leg swelling and a history of atrial fibrillation. It is good you’re letting me know about both. Can you tell me a little more about the leg swelling?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started… maybe three days ago? I didn’t think much of it at first, just thought I’d been on my feet too long. I do a lot of work at a computer, you see, so I sit for hours. But it’s gotten worse each day. It's mostly in my calf, I think, but it's going up my leg a little now. It feels…tight and achy, not really painful, just uncomfortable. And it looks different than my other leg, of course.
DOCTOR: Okay, starting three days ago, worsening swelling in the left calf, tight and achy, and different from your other leg. That’s helpful. And you mentioned atrial fibrillation – do you take any medications for that, or have you seen a cardiologist for it?
PATIENT: Yes, I do take something… it’s a little orange pill. I have to take it every day, but I can’t quite remember the name. The doctor at the hospital gave it to me when they told me about the… the fibrillation. I haven’t seen a specialist heart doctor, no. Just the one at the hospital when it was first discovered. They said to come back if anything changed, and well… this leg is a change, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is a change. Let’s try to figure out what’s going on with your leg. Do you have any pain in your chest or shortness of breath at all?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. And I can breathe alright. I get a little out of breath climbing stairs, perhaps, but I’ve always been a bit… breathless that way. It’s just… being out of shape, I suppose. But no, nothing new. Just the leg, and the orange pill for the…the heart thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. No new chest pain or shortness of breath, that's good. Now, can you tell me about any other medical problems you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was a little girl, that’s about the only surgery I’ve ever had. And I have…well, I’m a bit prone to colds in the winter, but nothing serious. Oh, and I broke my arm once, a long time ago. Apart from that, I think I’m fairly healthy. I don’t really go to the doctor much, if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed in childhood, broken arm, and prone to colds. That’s good to know. And no other significant medical history. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the orange pill for your heart?
PATIENT: No, just the orange pill. And sometimes I take a pain reliever if my head aches, like paracetamol. But that’s only when I need it, and not very often. I don't take anything regularly other than the heart pill.
DOCTOR: Okay. No other regular medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat everything, and I haven't ever had a problem with bees or anything like that. I'm quite lucky, really. Apart from this leg, of course.
DOCTOR: That’s good. Alright. Let's take a look at your leg now. Could you please sit on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly. I hope it's not too embarrassing. It's rather… swollen, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m seeing some swelling and redness in your left calf, and it is warmer to the touch than your right leg. Your pulse feels normal, thankfully. Does this feel tender when I press here?
PATIENT: Yes, that does feel a bit tender. Not terribly painful, but… definitely noticeable. A bit like a dull ache, really. It’s worse when you press right… there. And it feels a bit tight, like something is pulling.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like we might be dealing with a blood clot in your leg, which is called deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. The swelling, warmth, redness, and tenderness are all consistent with that. It’s important to confirm this with an ultrasound, as soon as possible. Given your history of atrial fibrillation, this is something we need to take very seriously. Have you experienced any pain in your chest or difficulty breathing recently?
PATIENT: A blood clot?! Oh dear. No, no chest pain, and I haven't been struggling for breath, not any more than usual. But… is that bad? I mean, is it very serious? What happens if it's a blood clot? I suddenly feel a bit faint.
DOCTOR: Okay, try to take a few deep breaths. It is serious, yes, but treatable. A blood clot in your leg can travel to your lungs, which can cause a pulmonary embolism – that's what causes the shortness of breath and chest pain. That's why it's important to get it checked out right away. We need to rule this out, or confirm it, with an ultrasound. I'm going to order one for you immediately. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend that you don't put any weight on your left leg, and we'll get you started on a blood thinner medication to prevent any further clots from forming. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… a blood thinner. And no weight on my leg. Yes, that sounds alright, if it helps. Will I have to stay in hospital? And… how long will it take to do this ultrasound? And what about work? I have a deadline coming up… This is all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable that this is overwhelming. Let's take things one step at a time. We'll need to do the ultrasound to know for sure what's going on, and whether you need to be admitted to the hospital. It should take about 30-45 minutes. I’m ordering it now, and the radiology department will call you when they’re ready. As for work, we can discuss a sick note later, if needed. Your health is the priority right now. The blood thinner will help prevent the clot from growing, and we’ll monitor you closely to make sure it's working properly. Do you have any questions about that at this point?
PATIENT: Okay… 30-45 minutes. And a sick note later. Thank you, Doctor. What… what kind of blood thinner is it? And will it make me… feel unwell? I've heard some medications have terrible side effects. I don't want to feel worse than I already do.
DOCTOR: There are several different blood thinners we can use. I'm leaning towards prescribing you Rivaroxaban, which is an oral medication that’s generally well-tolerated. Some people experience mild side effects like bruising or stomach upset, but serious side effects are rare. We'll monitor your bloodwork regularly to ensure you're on the right dose and to check for any complications. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully and let me know if you experience any unusual bleeding or bruising. Do you feel alright sitting up?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. A little shaky, perhaps. Rivaroxaban… okay. As long as it doesn’t make me feel too unwell. And bruising… well, I do bump into things a lot, so that’s probably inevitable. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. I feel a little bit better now, knowing what’s going on. When will the radiology department call? And should I… should I eat something? Or would that be better avoided before the ultrasound?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome. I’m glad I could help ease your anxiety a bit. The radiology department should call within the next hour or so. You can eat something light if you’re hungry, there’s no need to avoid it before the ultrasound. Just avoid anything too heavy or greasy. I’m going to write out a prescription for the Rivaroxaban now, and I’ll also give you some written instructions on what to expect, and what to watch out for. And please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns at all. Do you have any other medical conditions or take any herbal supplements or vitamins that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Just the orange pill for the heart, as we said. No supplements or vitamins. And I don't drink alcohol, or smoke. I mostly just sit at my computer, to be honest. I suppose that's not very healthy, is it? I'm rather pale from being indoors all the time. And I haven’t seen a proper sunshine in… well, a long time. Thank you again, Doctor. I think that’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Sitting for long periods can increase your risk of blood clots, so it’s important to take breaks and get up and move around regularly. We can discuss some lifestyle changes to help improve your overall health once we get the results of the ultrasound. Here are the prescription and instructions. The radiology department will contact you shortly. Please call us immediately if you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe bleeding. And remember, I’m here if you need anything. Please try to stay calm and rest until you hear from radiology. Do you have a way to get home safely?
PATIENT: Yes, my neighbor is picking me up. He’s very kind. Thank you so much, Doctor Beinborn. You’ve been very helpful. I… I feel a little less frightened now. I’ll call if anything changes. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. That's good to hear. Please take care of yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. And give your neighbor my thanks for helping you out. Bye bye to you too. .
