DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see you’re here today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, I don't really have time for a lot of this, to be honest. Just… my stomach's been puffed up. Bloated. It's annoying, alright? That's it. Don't need a whole life story out of it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kristofik. Bloating can certainly be bothersome. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about when this bloating started?
PATIENT: Ugh, when? Honestly, I don't really keep track of that stuff. Sometime recently, I guess. A few weeks, maybe? It comes and goes. Look, I work long hours, alright? Pile driving isn't exactly a job where you're thinking about your gut feelings. It just… started being uncomfortable. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kristofik. “A few weeks” is helpful. And I appreciate you telling me about your profession—that is important information. When you say “uncomfortable,” can you describe that discomfort?
PATIENT: Look, it feels… full. Like I ate way too much, even when I haven’t. And kinda… gassy. Not like, painful pain, just… pressure. It's just… unpleasant. I don't need a detailed description, alright? It’s a stomach. It’s bloated. What more do you want to know?
DOCTOR: I understand. No, you're right to ask—I don't need a detailed description. Just trying to get a complete picture. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse?
PATIENT: Worse? Hmm. Probably when I eat. Seems like it gets worse after I eat. Doesn't matter what I eat, really. Could be a burger, could be… I don't know, salad. Doesn't seem to make a difference. Everything just kinda swells up. It’s just… irritating.
DOCTOR: So, the bloating occurs after eating, regardless of the type of food. And it’s not associated with any particular pain, just pressure and discomfort. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the bloating, Mr. Kristofik?
PATIENT: Look, no. Nothing else. No… changes in bathroom habits, no fever, no… I don't know, anything weird. Just the bloat. Honestly, I'm starting to feel like I'm wasting my time here. Is there a quick fix or what?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Kristofik, and I appreciate your candor. We'll try to get to the bottom of this as efficiently as possible. Just to be thorough, I’d like to ask a few questions about your overall health. Have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? Look, I've broken a few bones, working. Pile driving, alright? It happens. Other than that… not really. I had the flu once, maybe? My wife… she handled all the doctor stuff. She passed a few years back, so I haven't been to a doctor in ages. Honestly, I don’t remember much about any past illnesses.
DOCTOR: I am very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Kristofik. That must have been very difficult. And it’s perfectly alright that you don’t recall specific details about past illnesses. So, generally, you'd say you’ve been in reasonably good health aside from work-related injuries?
PATIENT: Yeah, reasonably good. I work hard, I eat… food. I don't sit around worrying about every little ache and pain. Look, I need to get back to work. Is there anything you can give me to just… make it stop? Some pills or something?
DOCTOR: I understand your desire for a quick solution, Mr. Kristofik. Before I consider any medication, I would like to perform a brief physical examination to assess your abdomen and get a better understanding of what might be causing the bloating. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, really? You need to poke me? Look, I'm not a fan of being poked and prodded. Is it absolutely necessary? Can’t you just give me something for it? I've got a job to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Kristofik. A physical exam is important to rule out any underlying causes that require more than just symptom management. It will only take a few moments, and will help me determine the best course of action for you. It’s a standard part of evaluating abdominal discomfort. I can explain what I’ll be doing beforehand, and you can stop me at any time if you’re uncomfortable. We can also discuss alternatives if you truly prefer to avoid it, but that might involve a referral to a specialist for more extensive testing.
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. Quickly. I haven't got all day. And explain what you're doing, alright? I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. I will explain each step as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope to check for any unusual sounds. Then, I'll gently palpate – that is, feel – your abdomen to check for tenderness or any masses. I’ll be starting here, on your right side… Take a few deep breaths for me, please.
PATIENT: Just get it over with. This is… uncomfortable. I don’t see what listening to my stomach is going to do, but fine. Deep breaths.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m listening to your bowel sounds now. They sound… normal. Not overly active, not absent. Now, I’m going to gently press on different areas of your abdomen to check for any tenderness. It’s perfectly alright to tell me if anything is painful. Starting here… Do you feel any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. Not… sharp pain, just… pressure. Like you're pushing on the bloat. It’s… annoying. Just get it over with, alright? This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m noting that there is some tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant. Now I’m going to check the upper abdomen… Any pain or discomfort here?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… feels normal. Like a stomach should. Look, is this going to lead to anything? Am I dying or something? Just tell me straight. I don't need a lot of medical jargon.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Kristofik, you are not dying. Based on the examination so far, there's no indication of anything life-threatening. There is some tenderness in your right lower quadrant, and you describe significant bloating. Given your symptoms and the physical exam findings, it could be a few things. It's possible you have some mild constipation or gas buildup causing the discomfort. However, given that you haven’t been to a doctor in some time, and to be thorough, I would like to order some blood work. It will give us a better baseline and rule out any other potential issues. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work? Great. Just what I needed. Fine. Whatever. Just… get it done quickly, alright? And tell me what it's for. Don't just poke and prod and tell me I need tests. Explain it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Kristofik. The blood work will help us check a few things. We’ll be looking at your complete blood count – that tells us about your red and white blood cell levels, which can indicate infection or inflammation. We'll also check your liver and kidney function, just to make sure those are working properly. And we'll check an electrolyte panel, to see if your mineral levels are balanced. It’s a routine set of tests, and it will give us a good overall picture of your health. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes to draw the blood, and the results will usually be back within a day or two. Do you have any allergies to latex or any issues with drawing blood?
PATIENT: Latex… no. Never had a problem. And no, I don’t faint or anything when they take blood. Just… get it over with. I’ve got things to do. Honestly, this whole thing is a waste of my time, but fine. Get the blood work done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I'll have the nurse come in to draw your blood now. Once the results are back, we’ll review them together and discuss a plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding gas-producing foods like beans and broccoli, and drinking plenty of water. If your symptoms worsen significantly – meaning you develop severe pain, fever, nausea, or vomiting – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get it over with. And make it quick. I’ve got a job to do. And don’t bother calling me with minor stuff. If something’s wrong, just tell me straight. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Kristofik. I will certainly do that. The nurse will be with you shortly. Thank you for your patience. .
