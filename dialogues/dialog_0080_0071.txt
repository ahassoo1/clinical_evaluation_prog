DOCTOR: Hi Karry, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. My name is Karry Skarbek. Well, to be frank, it's about gettin' some shots. A friend of mine is lookin' at comin' to the States, and I believe there are certain vaccinations required for… well, for folks comin' here legally. I want to make sure he’s prepared, and I thought you might be the one to ask about what's needed. I’m not entirely sure where to begin, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very thoughtful of you, Karry. Preparing for a friend’s arrival is smart. We definitely want to get him up-to-date with everything he needs. So, just to be clear, he's planning to come to the States, he hasn’t arrived yet?
PATIENT: That is correct, Doctor. He’s still in… well, I believe it’s Belarus at the moment. He’s just started lookin’ into the visa process, and I wanted to get ahead of things. Better safe than sorry, you know? I wouldn’t want him to have any trouble once he arrives, or be turned away. Is there a specific kind of visa that matters for these requirements? I don’t know much about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s very proactive of you, Karry. It's good you're thinking ahead. The requirements do depend on the type of visa he’ll be applying for, and how long he plans to stay. Do you know what kind of visa he’s applying for—tourist, student, work, or something else?
PATIENT: I believe he’s lookin’ at a… a family visa. His sister lives here already, and he’s hopin’ to join her. It’s not a work visa, I know that much. He’s retired, so he wouldn’t be takin’ a job. He’s mainly wantin’ to be closer to family, you see. Does that help narrow things down, Doctor? I apologize for not knowin’ the specifics. He hasn’t always been the best at explainin’ these things to me.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Karry, thank you. A family-based visa changes things a bit. Okay, generally, for a family-based visa applicant, a medical exam is required, and that exam will include verifying certain vaccinations. Specifically, they'll need documentation of measles, mumps, rubella, varicella , tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, and influenza. Depending on his age and medical history, there might be others recommended or required. Do you happen to know if he has a record of his vaccinations from Belarus?
PATIENT: Well, that’s… a good question, Doctor. I’m not sure. He's lived there his whole life, and I doubt they kept records like they do here. I know things were different back when he was a young man. He’s a bit older now, you see – nearly seventy. He might have had some of those shots, but he wouldn’t have any paperwork to prove it. Is there a way to find out what he needs without a record? Perhaps a blood test? I’m just thinkin’ aloud here, of course. I don't want to put him through unnecessary trouble.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Karry. It's common for records to be unavailable from other countries, especially for someone his age. A blood test can determine immunity to some of those diseases – measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella – but it’s not always 100% accurate, and sometimes a booster is still recommended even with evidence of immunity. The immigration medical exam does require a physical assessment and review of his vaccination history, and the civil surgeon performing the exam will determine what vaccinations are needed based on his age, medical history, and current guidelines. Do you have his date of birth handy?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I do. He was born on March the 14th, 1957. That makes him… let me see… seventy-six years old as of this year. He’s always been proud of bein’ born on Pi Day, you know. A bit of a mathematician, he is. And he's pretty healthy for his age, all things considered. He walks every day and eats a good diet. But I don’t know about his medical records, or if he’s had any of these vaccinations. It’s all a bit of a mystery, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, March 14th, 1957. That's helpful. At seventy-six, he's likely to need boosters for tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis, and definitely a flu shot annually. We’ll also want to check his immunity to measles and varicella, and make sure he's up-to-date on his COVID vaccines. Given his age and the potential for needing several vaccinations, I recommend scheduling a full physical exam and a consultation with a travel clinic. They specialize in these situations and can provide a more comprehensive assessment and ensure he meets all the immigration requirements. Would you like me to schedule that for him?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. A travel clinic seems like a good idea, if they specialize in this sort of thing. I don’t want to cause him any worry, or make him go through anything unnecessary. I appreciate you thinkin’ of his well-being. Yes, if you could schedule something for him, that would be wonderful. I'm not sure what his availability is like, but I can try to get you a few dates and times that might work. Would you prefer I call you with those, or is there another way to get that information to you?
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of you, Karry. We can definitely get something scheduled. The best way would be if you could give me a call at 555-123-4567 when you have a few dates in mind. That will be the quickest way to coordinate. In the meantime, I'm going to print out a list of recommended vaccinations for adults over 65 and a summary of the immigration vaccination requirements, just to give you a head start. Would you like a copy of his medical history form as well?
PATIENT: That number is fine, Doctor. I'll give you a call when I have some dates for you. And yes, please, a copy of the medical history form would be very helpful. It might jog my memory a bit, or at least give me a better idea of what to ask him. He doesn't always remember everything, you see. It's just part of gettin' older, I suppose. I appreciate your patience with all this.
