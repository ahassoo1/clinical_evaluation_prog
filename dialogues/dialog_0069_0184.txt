DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Trendler. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Andraca. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I ain't got all day. It's about… well, I see myself in the mirror, right? And things ain't where they used to be. Down south, we got standards, you know? A man gotta look like a man. Not… this.
DOCTOR: I understand, sir. It sounds like you're concerned about some physical changes you've noticed. It's perfectly reasonable to want to feel good about how you look and to be concerned when things change. Can you tell me a little more specifically what you've noticed “down south,” as you put it?
PATIENT: Look, I don't need a lecture about feelin' good. I feel just fine. It's what I see that's botherin' me. Things is… saggin'. And smaller. Much smaller. Used to be… substantial. Now? Like a little boy's. It ain't right. And it’s makin’ things… uncomfortable. You understand? Things just don't work like they used to. I want it fixed. Plain and simple.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Trendler. You're concerned about changes in the appearance and function of your penis, and you'd like to explore options for addressing those concerns. That’s perfectly valid. To help me understand what's going on and determine the best course of action, could you tell me how long you've noticed these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, it didn't happen overnight, you know? Been goin' on… maybe five years now? Started slow. Thought it was just gettin' older. But it just kept goin’. And goin’. Now it’s… noticeable. My wife… well, she passed two years ago. She woulda said somethin'. She always did. Now, I just look at myself and… it’s disheartening. And like I said, things don't work the same. It's a problem. A real problem.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Trendler. Losing a partner is incredibly difficult. It sounds like these changes are impacting your quality of life in a number of ways. When you say things don't work the same, can you tell me a little more specifically what you mean?
PATIENT: Look, I ain't gonna get into all the details with you, alright? It's…difficult. Let’s just say it takes longer. And it ain't as firm. Used to be, quick and easy. Now? It's a whole… production. And honestly, it's embarrassin'. I used to be a… capable man. Now? I feel like a shadow of my former self. Is that clear enough? I don't need you askin' me for specifics. It's personal.
DOCTOR: Yes, sir, that’s perfectly clear. I understand your discomfort and respect your privacy. It sounds like you’re experiencing erectile dysfunction, and it’s understandably affecting your self-esteem. To get a better understanding of what might be causing this, and to discuss potential treatment options, I’d like to ask a few more general questions, if you’re comfortable. These are common questions I ask all my patients. We can skip anything you’d prefer not to answer. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Look, I don't like bein' poked and prodded. And I really don’t like answerin' personal questions. But if it gets me fixed, I guess. Just keep it quick. And no touchin', alright? I got standards. What kinda questions are we talkin’ about? Make it fast. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, sir. No touching, I promise. And I'll keep it as quick as possible. Just a few questions about your overall health. First, do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure. Doctor told me about it… ten years ago, maybe? I take a little pill for it every day. That’s it. Other than that, I’m as fit as a fiddle for a man my age. Used to work hard, you know? Pile driver operator. Ain’t easy work. Builds a man. But yeah, high blood pressure. And that’s all you need to know. Now, can we get on with the fixin’? This is takin’ too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… Had my appendix out when I was a boy. And a hernia operation… about twenty years ago. Other than that? No. Never been much for doctors, to be honest. Only come when somethin’s really broken. And right now, this is broken. And it needs fixin’. Seriously, are we gettin' anywhere? I ain’t got all day. This whole thing is a waste of time if you can’t help me.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I understand your frustration. Let's talk about your family history. Do any of your close relatives – your father, brothers, or sons – have any medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or prostate problems?
PATIENT: Look, family? My father passed when I was young. Never knew him. No brothers. And no sons. Just me. Always been a loner, to be honest. So, no, I don’t know nothin’ about family medical history. Can we please stop with the questions and start with the lookin'? I wanna know if this is fixable, and if so, how much it’s gonna cost. That's all I care about. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Trendler. I respect your wishes. Before we proceed with a physical exam, I want to be upfront. There are several potential causes for erectile dysfunction, and determining the right course of action requires a thorough evaluation. I understand you’re not comfortable sharing a lot of personal details, and that’s perfectly fine. However, I do need to perform a physical exam to assess your overall health and check for any obvious physical abnormalities. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a genital exam. The genital exam is necessary to evaluate the blood flow and sensation in the area. Would you be willing to proceed with the exam, knowing what it entails?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I told you, no touchin’. I came here lookin’ for a fix, not a… inspection. You want to know what’s wrong with me? Look at my chart. High blood pressure. That's it. If you can’t fix it with a pill, then I’m walkin’ out the door. I ain’t payin’ for a doctor to poke around down there. Waste of my time and money. I’m done.
