DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Asthore. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, it’s… this weakness. It’s getting worse, you see. It’s in my legs mostly, but sometimes my arms feel it too. It makes things… difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Weakness in your legs and sometimes your arms, and it’s been getting progressively worse. That certainly sounds concerning. To get a better understanding of what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this weakness?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. It’s hard to explain. It’s not like a sudden thing, not like I tripped and pulled a muscle. It’s… slower. Like trying to walk through water, maybe? And it comes and goes. Some days are better than others, but mostly… it’s just there, a heavy feeling. It tires me out quicker, you see. Even just getting up from my chair.
DOCTOR: Okay, “like walking through water,” that’s a helpful description. So it’s a gradual weakness, not a sudden onset, and it fluctuates – some days are better than others. It’s also causing fatigue, especially with activities like standing up. And when did you first start noticing this weakness, Mr. Asthore?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It was… maybe six months ago? It started very small, just a little stumble here and there. I thought it was just getting old, you know? But it’s… not going away. It’s been slowly getting worse, like I said. My wife, Leilani, she noticed it before I did, actually. She’s got a good eye for these things.
DOCTOR: Six months ago, starting gradually and noticed by your wife first. That’s good information. And has the weakness been worsening steadily over those six months, or has there been any particular time when it seemed to get significantly worse?
PATIENT: It’s been pretty steady, I think. Not big jumps, just… a little bit more each month. But maybe… three months ago it felt like a bigger change. I had to start using a cane for longer walks. That’s when I really started to worry. Before that, it was just something I shrugged off.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a noticeable increase in the need for a cane about three months ago. That’s helpful to know. Besides the weakness and fatigue, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Sometimes my vision gets blurry, but I thought that was just my eyes getting old too. And… sometimes I feel a little dizzy, not all the time, but enough to make me hold onto something. And my hands… they sometimes feel numb or tingly. Is that… is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s all important information, Mr. Asthore. Blurry vision, dizziness, and numbness or tingling in your hands. We’ll definitely want to explore those symptoms further. Now, do you have any pain associated with the weakness or the numbness?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not really pain. It’s not like a sharp ache or anything. It’s more… uncomfortable. Like pins and needles, sometimes, in my hands and feet. But no real pain, no. It’s just… worrying, you know? It’s the not knowing what’s causing it that bothers me the most.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Asthore. The uncertainty is often the most difficult part. No sharp pain, just discomfort and tingling. Let’s talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got it under control with medicine, maybe five years ago now. Other than that… nothing much. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all my life. I used to be a strong swimmer, you see. Played a lot of rugby when I was young too. Leilani always says I’m too stubborn to get sick.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you were generally healthy, and that your high blood pressure is under control. And being a swimmer and rugby player certainly speaks to your strength. Are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication you mentioned?
PATIENT: Just one, Doctor. A small white pill for my blood pressure. I take it every morning with my breakfast. Leilani makes sure I don’t forget! She’s very good at keeping me on track. I don’t remember the name of it, though. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Asthore. We can look that up in your records. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything Leilani cooks, and she cooks everything! She likes to experiment with different foods. I’ve never had a problem with any of it.
DOCTOR: Good. No known allergies. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. When I was a young man, I broke my arm playing rugby. They had to put it in a cast for a few weeks. But that was a long time ago. Other than that… no, Doctor. Never been in the hospital for anything serious. Just the usual colds and flus, like everyone gets.
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken arm when you were young, but nothing else significant. Now, let’s talk a little about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, or neurological problems?
PATIENT: That’s a good question, Doctor. My mother… she had some trouble with her balance when she got older. The doctor said it was something with her nerves. And my older brother… he had something with his hands, shaking and all. I don’t remember the name of it. But other than that, most of my family were pretty healthy. Leilani’s side… I don’t know much about their medical history, to be honest. We didn’t talk about it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, some balance issues in your mother and a shaking condition in your brother. We can note that down. And you mentioned you don’t know much about your wife’s family history. That’s alright, we can focus on what we do know. Finally, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never smoked a day in my life. I used to have a beer with dinner sometimes, but I stopped a few years ago. Leilani wanted me to, for my health. And no, no drugs. Never been interested in those. I get enough excitement just trying to keep up with my grandkids!
DOCTOR: Excellent. No smoking, no drugs, and limited alcohol. That’s all very helpful information, Mr. Asthore. Okay, let’s see… I see here you’ve been on lisinopril for your blood pressure for about five years now, as you mentioned. Everything else seems fairly unremarkable. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want to find out what’s causing this weakness, you see. It’s starting to worry me, and Leilani too.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Asthore. We’ll do our best to figure it out. Okay, let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 140/85, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. I’m going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a little diminished in your legs, but otherwise normal. And finally, I’m going to check your strength and coordination. Strength is slightly decreased in your legs, particularly when rising from a seated position. Coordination seems intact, but there’s some mild difficulty with balance. Alright, Mr. Asthore. Based on the exam, I’m noting some mild weakness in your legs, diminished reflexes, and some difficulty with balance. The symptoms you described – the weakness, the fatigue, the blurry vision, the dizziness, and the tingling – along with these exam findings, suggest a few possibilities. It could be related to your blood pressure, even though it's currently controlled, or it could be something else affecting your nerves or muscles. It’s too early to say definitively without further testing.
PATIENT: That sounds… worrying, Doctor. What kind of tests are you thinking about? And what… what could it be, if it’s not my blood pressure? Leilani will be very worried if you say something serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Asthore, and I want to be as clear and reassuring as possible. We're not jumping to any conclusions yet. Further testing will help us narrow down the possibilities. The tests I'm considering are a blood test to check your overall health, including your kidney function and electrolyte levels, and a complete blood count. I'd also like to order a Vitamin B12 level, as a deficiency can cause similar symptoms. And finally, I think an MRI of your brain and spinal cord would be helpful to rule out any neurological issues. As for what it could be, if it's not directly related to your blood pressure, we need to consider things like peripheral neuropathy – which is nerve damage often caused by diabetes or vitamin deficiencies – or possibly a neurological condition. However, it's important to remember that these are just possibilities at this point. The tests will give us more information. Do you have any questions about these tests, or anything else we've discussed so far?
PATIENT: MRI… that sounds… serious, Doctor. Is that… is that something to be really worried about? And peripheral… what did you call it? Nerve damage? I don’t have diabetes, do I? Leilani would have told me. She keeps a close eye on my sugar, always makes sure I don't eat too many sweets. And… I don’t know anything about Vitamin B12. Is that something I should be eating more of?
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask questions, Mr. Asthore. It’s good you’re being proactive. An MRI can sound scary, but it's a very helpful imaging tool. It allows us to get a detailed look at your brain and spinal cord to rule out any structural problems. It's a non-invasive test, meaning it doesn't involve surgery or injections. We're ordering it to be thorough and rule things out, not because we necessarily suspect something serious. Peripheral neuropathy is nerve damage, and it can cause weakness, numbness, and tingling in your hands and feet. It's often caused by diabetes, but can also be caused by vitamin deficiencies or other medical conditions. You're right to say Leilani would have noticed if you had diabetes, and her vigilance is excellent. We will, of course, check your blood sugar levels as part of the blood tests to confirm. Vitamin B12 is an important nutrient for nerve health, and a deficiency can cause similar symptoms to what you’re experiencing. We’ll check your B12 level with the blood tests. If it’s low, we can discuss dietary changes or supplements. So, to summarize, I’m ordering blood tests, including a blood sugar level and Vitamin B12 level, and an MRI of your brain and spinal cord. Once we have the results, we can discuss them in detail and develop a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… alright. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what’s going on, you see. It’s the not knowing that bothers me the most. Leilani will want to know about the MRI, of course. She always wants to be involved. Can she come with me for the test? And… how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to wait too long.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Asthore. The uncertainty is often the most difficult part, and we’ll do everything we can to get you answers as quickly as possible. Yes, your wife is absolutely welcome to come with you for the MRI. Having support during tests like these can be very helpful. The MRI should take about 30-45 minutes to complete. As for the results, it typically takes a few days for the radiologist to review the images and send a report. I anticipate having the blood test results back within a day or two. Once I have both sets of results, I'll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as severe weakness, difficulty walking, or changes in your vision – please don't hesitate to call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything for now. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for not rushing me. I appreciate that. I’ll let Leilani know about the tests and the appointment. I guess… I’ll see you when the results are back.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Asthore. It’s my pleasure. I’m glad I could ease some of your concerns. Please don’t hesitate to call if anything changes. And I look forward to seeing you both when the results are back.
