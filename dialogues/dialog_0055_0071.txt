DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. I am Dr. Eaddy. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s about some shots I need. My granddaughter… she’s trying to get me to come live with her family, over in Canada. And it seems there’s paperwork, and shots, involved. I’m hoping you can tell me what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Canada, you say. Yes, there are often requirements for immigration, even temporary relocation. Immunizations are frequently a part of that process. Let’s start with the basics. Do you happen to know which vaccinations your granddaughter’s paperwork specified?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. She gave me a lot of papers… honestly, it was a bit overwhelming. I mostly just handed them to her husband to deal with. He’s very good with that sort of thing. I don’t recall seeing any specific names of shots on the ones I looked at, but I didn't study them closely, if I’m being truthful. Would a list be on those papers, do you think?
DOCTOR: It would be most helpful if you had reviewed the documentation yourself, Mr. Skarbek. However... we can certainly attempt to ascertain what is required. Do you have a copy of your immunization records with you today?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I apologize. You’re right to scold me a bit. I just… get flustered easily with all that official writing. No, I don’t have them with me. I think my primary care doctor back home might have them, but I haven’t been there in… a while. Years, likely. I suppose I should have thought of that first.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will proceed as best we can without those records. It may necessitate repeating some vaccinations to ensure you are adequately protected, but it is preferable to taking unnecessary risks. Now, Mr. Skarbek, have you had a tetanus booster within the last ten years?
PATIENT: A tetanus booster… hmm. Let me think. Ten years… That would be… around the time my wife, bless her heart, got sick. I honestly don’t recall. I was… preoccupied then. I think I had a shot, but I couldn’t swear to it. Is there a way to check? Or… would it be alright to just get another one, to be safe?
DOCTOR: While a booster is generally safe, it's not ideal to administer one unnecessarily. It would be prudent to review your history, if possible. However... given the circumstances, and your inability to recall, and the travel plans... we could proceed with a tetanus booster today, along with a review of your other common vaccinations. Have you experienced any adverse reactions to vaccinations in the past?
PATIENT: No, ma'am, I haven't. Never had any trouble with shots, not a bit. A little pinch, of course, but nothing more. If getting the booster is the easiest way forward, then I trust your judgement, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I just want to get this sorted out so I can go be with my granddaughter.
DOCTOR: Very well. We will administer a tetanus booster today. I will also need to inquire about your influenza and pneumococcal vaccination status, as those are often recommended for individuals of your age and travel plans. Now, before we proceed, let me ask: do you have any allergies to medications or latex?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. My wife used to say I could eat anything, and I mostly did! I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not even bee stings. So, no, no allergies. Just a bit nervous about needles, I suppose, but I’ve always managed.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed then. I will be administering the tetanus booster in your left deltoid muscle. It may cause some mild discomfort and soreness afterward. Please inform me immediately if you experience any unusual symptoms. Now, try to relax your arm. Alright, that’s complete. Keep that bandage on for at least fifteen minutes. We will monitor you for any adverse reaction. Now, while we wait, let’s discuss your pneumococcal vaccination history… Have you ever received a pneumococcal vaccine?
PATIENT: Ooh! That was a pinch. But I’m alright. Just a little…jumpy. Pneumococcal… no, I don’t think so. That sounds like one of those fancy ones they give to folks in hospitals, doesn’t it? I haven’t been in a hospital in… oh, goodness, decades. So, no, I’m pretty sure I haven't had that one either. Is that a bad thing? Should I have had that?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily a “bad” thing, Mr. Skarbek, but it is recommended for individuals of your age, particularly with travel plans. The pneumococcal vaccine helps protect against serious infections like pneumonia, meningitis, and ear infections. Given your history, and lack of prior vaccination, I would recommend administering the pneumococcal vaccine today as well. Are you amenable to that?
PATIENT: Well… two shots in one day… That does sound a bit much. But if you recommend it, Doctor, and it will help keep me safe with my granddaughter… then yes, alright. Go ahead. Just… maybe warn me before you give it? I’m a tough old bird, I suppose. But surprises aren’t my favorite.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will administer the pneumococcal vaccine in your right deltoid muscle. It may cause some mild soreness, and fatigue is a common side effect. Now, I will warn you beforehand. This may sting slightly. Alright, that's complete. Keep that bandage on for fifteen minutes. We will monitor you for any adverse reaction. Now, before we conclude, let me inquire about your influenza vaccination status. Do you receive an annual flu shot?
PATIENT: Oh, the flu shot! Yes, I try to. Old Mrs. Henderson down the street, she always reminds me. She’s a retired nurse, you see. She organizes a little clinic in the community center every fall. So, yes, usually I get it. I think I had one last October… or was it November? It all sort of blends together after a while. I think so. But I can’t be absolutely certain. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Very well. Given your uncertainty, and the upcoming travel season, I would recommend receiving a flu shot today to ensure you are adequately protected. It is the most effective way to prevent influenza infection. It won't be pleasant, getting three in one day, but it would provide comprehensive protection. Are you amenable to that?
PATIENT: Three… three shots. Goodness gracious. Well… if it’s what’s best, Doctor. If it will truly keep me safe for my granddaughter… then alright. Go ahead. Just… please be quick about it. And maybe tell me a joke while you do it? Distraction, you see. I’m starting to feel a bit faint, but I’m a tough old bird, remember?
DOCTOR: Very well. A joke, you say. Why don't scientists trust atoms?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I don't know, Doctor. Why don't scientists trust atoms? Is this supposed to distract me? I'm starting to feel quite woozy… but go on, please. Tell me the punchline, and then… let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Because they make up everything. Now, I will administer the influenza vaccine in your left upper arm. It may cause some mild soreness. This may sting slightly. Alright, that's complete. Keep that bandage on for fifteen minutes. Now, you have received the tetanus, pneumococcal, and influenza vaccines today. It is important to monitor yourself for any adverse reactions, such as fever, severe soreness, or difficulty breathing. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That was… a lot. No, I don’t think so. Just… can I go sit down now? And maybe have a glass of water? I think I need a little lie-down. Thank you, Doctor… for everything. I truly appreciate you looking after me. And… please don’t tell anyone about the joke. It wasn’t very funny, was it?
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Skarbek. A nurse will assist you to a chair and provide you with water. I will have her monitor your vitals. Please alert her immediately if you experience any concerning symptoms. And no, the joke was not particularly amusing. .
