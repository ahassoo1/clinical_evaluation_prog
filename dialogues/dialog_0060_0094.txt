DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. Welcome. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, the lady on the phone… she said something about… learning? I don’t really remember. Something about… my body? I work with metal all day. It’s… hard work.
DOCTOR: Right. Learning, yes. It seems there was a misunderstanding when scheduling. We offer a wellness exam, and sometimes that includes discussing healthy habits, especially given your physically demanding job. But let's focus on you today. You said you work with metal all day – is that causing you any problems?
PATIENT: Problems? Not… really. My back gets sore. Everyone’s back gets sore. It’s metal! Heavy, you know? And… dirty. I just… take some pills. Red ones. I think. My husband gets them for me. He knows about this stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay. So back soreness, that’s understandable with your line of work. And you’re taking red pills for it, brought by your husband. Do you know what those pills are for, exactly?
PATIENT: No! He just… gives them to me. Says they’re good. I don’t… ask questions. I just want the pain to stop. He works in an office, he knows about… things. I bend metal, he… pushes papers. It’s different.
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s important to know exactly what you’re taking, Ms. Fontanazza, even if your husband is managing it. We need to be sure those pills are safe for you and aren’t causing any hidden problems. Do you have any of those pills with you today?
PATIENT: Um… no. I took them this morning. All of them. Like he said. I don't carry them around. He usually has a big bottle. Orange bottle, I think. In the kitchen. Why are you asking so many questions? It’s just a sore back!
DOCTOR: I'm asking because it’s my job to make sure you’re getting the right care, Ms. Fontanazza. Taking medication without knowing what it is or how it interacts with your body can be dangerous. And frankly, relying solely on someone else for your healthcare isn't ideal. Now, besides the back pain, are you experiencing anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, here we go. Like I said, I work with METAL. My hands are always cut, always dirty. I get tired. What do you expect? It’s hard work! Sometimes my stomach feels funny, but that's probably just lunch. It's normal. Everyone feels funny sometimes. I don’t need a lecture about my job.
DOCTOR: It’s not a lecture, Ms. Fontanazza. It’s about understanding the whole picture. The cuts and fatigue are expected with your job, yes, but the stomach upset… that’s something we should explore a bit further. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood?! What kind of question is that?! No! Absolutely not! I don’t… look at things like that! That's disgusting! Look, I came here because someone told me to. I’m wasting my time. I have metal to bend. Is there anything else, or can I go?
DOCTOR: Please, sit down for just one moment. I understand you’re frustrated, and I apologize if my questions seem… intrusive. But given that you’re taking medication you don’t know about, and you’re experiencing stomach upset, I need to do a quick examination, just to be safe. It’s a standard procedure. Let’s just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Will that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. But make it quick. And don't expect me to tell you everything. My husband knows what he's doing. He’s a smart man. Just… hurry up.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, Ms. Fontanazza. That could be due to stress, or a number of other factors. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out…
PATIENT: Hurry up. It’s… fine. Always a little fast. Metal is heavy, remember? Lifting, bending… it makes you… breathe. Are we almost done?
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m just feeling your abdomen now… Does that hurt anywhere?
PATIENT: Yes! There! It hurts… there! On the side. Sometimes it’s just a little ache, sometimes it’s… bad. But I just… ignore it. It’s nothing. Probably just… muscles. From the metal. Are you done yet? This is very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Fontanazza, given your elevated blood pressure, the medication you're taking without knowing what it is, and the tenderness in your abdomen, I'm concerned. I'm going to order some blood work and a scan of your abdomen – an ultrasound, to start. This will help us determine what's causing the pain and ensure everything is alright. It's important to rule out anything serious.
PATIENT: Scan?! Blood work?! No! Absolutely not! I don’t want any scans! My husband will be furious! He says I'm fine. He knows best. I just have a sore back, that’s all! You’re trying to scare me! I’m leaving now. I don’t need this. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, please. I understand you’re worried about your husband, but your health is my priority. I’m not trying to scare you, I’m trying to help you. The blood work and scan are simple procedures that can give us valuable information. If everything is normal, you'll have peace of mind. If there is something going on, we can address it early. I'm concerned about the unknown medication and the pain you're experiencing. Continuing to ignore these issues could be dangerous. I strongly recommend we proceed with these tests. I will explain everything to your husband, if you wish. I won't force you, but please reconsider. I'm here to help you get the care you deserve. If you refuse these tests, I strongly advise you to seek a second opinion.
