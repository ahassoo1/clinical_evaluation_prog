DOCTOR: Hello Hedy, it’s lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, I don't have a lot of time. Just…tired. Real tired. And I been…eating dirt. Don’t look at me like that. It started a few weeks ago, maybe? I don’t really keep track. It just…happens. Feels weird, but I gotta do it. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy, no judgement here. It sounds like you're going through a lot, and I want to help. “Eating dirt” is… unusual, and we definitely need to talk about that. And the tiredness is important too. Let me pull up your information here… 57 years old, Aztec heritage… okay. First, can you tell me a bit more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Tiredness? What do you mean? I'm always tired! It's not new. Just…more tired lately. Like, can’t even get through the day without a nap. And then I crave…stuff. Not food stuff. Like, the red clay behind my house. Don't ask me why! It just…feels right. And I feel worse when I don't eat it, if that makes any sense. Look, I program machines all day, okay? It's hard work. Maybe I just need a vacation.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the tiredness is ongoing, but worse recently. And this craving for the red clay – and feeling worse when you don’t have it – that’s… significant. You mentioned programming machines – that is demanding work. Just to clarify, when you say “worse,” can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Ugh, significant? What is this, a quiz? Look, it's just…everything feels heavier. Like walking through mud. Harder to think, harder to…do anything. And I get…shaky. And dizzy sometimes. The clay helps with that, a little. It’s hard to explain. It's just…a feeling. And I don't have time to sit here describing feelings all day. I got things to do. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Okay, heavier feelings, shakiness, dizziness – and the clay provides some relief. I understand you’re feeling frustrated and don’t have a lot of time, and I’ll try to be as efficient as possible. But these symptoms are important, and we need to get a good understanding of what’s going on. Let’s see… Have you noticed any other changes, like changes in your bowel habits, skin, hair, or nails?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? I haven’t been paying attention to my…nails! Really? You want me to look at my nails? Look, I’m a programmer, not a…manicurist. Everything feels…normal, I guess. Except for the tiredness and the dirt thing. And the shakiness. And the dizziness. Is there a point to this? Are you going to give me something for it, or what? Because I really need to get back to work. I have deadlines, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Hedy. I'm just trying to gather as much information as possible to figure out what’s going on. These questions help me rule things out and get to the right answer. Okay, no changes to your nails, skin or hair that you've noticed. Let’s talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical…history? Honestly, I don't really remember. It was a long time ago. I had the usual childhood stuff, I guess. Chickenpox, measles… nothing serious. My husband…he handled all the doctor stuff. He passed away a few years back. I haven't really been to the doctor since. Mostly just…power through. Is that a medical condition? Because I'm really good at powering through. Just…give me something to stop the tiredness and the craving, okay? I don't need a history lesson.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband, Hedy. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with a lot. And yes, "powering through" is admirable, but it’s important to address these symptoms. Okay, so no known medical conditions, aside from typical childhood illnesses. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Ugh, hospitals... No. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital. I'm a healthy person, mostly. I eat okay, I sleep when I can, I work hard. I just... this dirt thing is new and annoying. And the tiredness is getting worse. Look, can we just skip all the questions and get to the solution? I don't have time for this. Is there a pill? A shot? Something? I really need to get back to work. I have a deadline tomorrow.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy. No surgeries, no hospitalizations. This craving for dirt, called pica, is… unusual, and combined with the tiredness, it’s concerning. I need to ask a few more questions, but I also think we need to do some blood work to rule out some potential deficiencies. Before we order anything, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family…history? Honestly, I barely remember my family. My parents…they’re gone. I didn’t really keep in touch with anyone. Look, I was raised in the city, okay? It wasn’t exactly a close-knit family. Everyone was…busy. Is this really necessary? It feels like you're just trying to stall. Can we just take the blood and get it over with? I really don’t have time for genealogy. I need to finish this program. And I’m starting to feel shaky again. I think I need to sit down. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Hedy, please sit down. Right here. You're right, I apologize if this feels like stalling. It's just that these symptoms, especially the pica and the shakiness, can be caused by several things, and it's important to get a clear picture. Before we proceed with the blood work, let’s quickly cover some basics. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
