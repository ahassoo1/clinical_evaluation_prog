DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbbel. It’s lovely to meet you. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx. I see you’re 84 years young. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you as well. Eighty-four, you say? Feels like sixty-four some days! I’m here ‘cause of a headache. Right in the back of my head. It’s been botherin’ me for…oh, I’d say a little over a week now. Not the worst pain ever, but it's constant, you know? Just…there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache for a little over a week, constant pain in the back of your head. That gives us a starting point. Can you tell me a little more about the pain itself?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not a throbbing kind of headache. More like…a pressure. Like someone’s tightening a band around my head, but just in the back. Sometimes it feels a little stiff there too, in my neck. And it doesn't really come and go, it’s just…always there, at a pretty steady level. Maybe a 5 out of 10, if that makes sense? Not crippling, but definitely noticeable.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A constant pressure, 5 out of 10, located in the back of your head and neck with some stiffness. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I don't think anything makes it a whole lot better, to be honest. Lying down doesn't seem to do much. But…when I’m really focused on somethin’, like working on my finances – I do a little bit of advising on the side, you know, help folks with their savings – I kinda forget about it for a bit. So, maybe when I’m distracted it’s not as bad. And…bending my head forward seems to make it a little worse, yeah. Just a little. Not a huge difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, so distraction seems to help a bit, and bending your head forward slightly worsens it. You mentioned you do some financial advising. Is that a stressful activity for you?
PATIENT: Oh, it can be sometimes! People get worried about their money, and that worry kinda rubs off, you know? I try to stay calm and help ‘em see things clearly, but it’s not always easy. I’ve been doing it a long time, though, so I’m used to it. It's mostly paperwork now, thankfully – less one-on-one stress than it used to be. Still, yeah, it can get my mind goin’ and make me tense up a bit. I mostly work from home, though. Quiet and peaceful.
DOCTOR: Alright, so some stress with the financial advising, though mostly manageable now. And you work from home, quiet and peaceful. That’s good to know. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Let me think… no fever, definitely not. No blurry vision or anything like that. I haven’t been feeling dizzy, and no nausea or vomiting. I sleep okay, I think. Maybe a little more restless than usual, but I always wake up feeling mostly rested. Oh! And…sometimes my hands feel a little tingly, especially in the evenings. Not terrible, just…a little prickly feeling. It doesn't last long, though. Maybe ten, fifteen minutes?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no vision changes, no dizziness, no nausea or vomiting, restless sleep, and occasional tingling in your hands in the evenings for about ten to fifteen minutes. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm…let’s see. Years ago, back when I was maybe in my fifties, I had high blood pressure. They put me on some medicine for it, and it’s been under control ever since. I haven’t had any major illnesses or surgeries. No diabetes, no heart problems…nothing like that. I did have a bit of arthritis in my knees, but it’s pretty mild. Mostly just aches a little in cold weather. I don’t take anything for it regularly. And…oh, I had the shingles a few years back, but that’s all cleared up now. Nothing else I can think of, really. I’ve been pretty lucky so far, I guess.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you’ve been generally healthy. High blood pressure, well-controlled, mild arthritis, and shingles in the past. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. It’s Lisinopril. I take 20 milligrams every morning. I've been on it for…oh, goodness, I’d say about ten years now? The doctor checks it regularly, and it’s always been good. I haven't missed a dose, not that I can recall. It's part of my morning routine, like brushin’ my teeth.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Lisinopril 20mg daily for the past ten years, consistently. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, really. One of those Centrum ones, every day with breakfast. And…sometimes I take an ibuprofen if my knees are botherin’ me a bit, but that's not very often. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. It’s just over-the-counter stuff, nothing fancy. I try not to take too many pills, you know? I think natural is best, if you can manage it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a daily multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen for knee pain. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of! I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things – I love my Hmong food, lots of different spices and herbs – and I’ve never had any trouble. I haven't been stung by a bee in years, and I didn't have any trouble with penicillin as a kid, either. So, no, I don’t think I have any allergies. I'm pretty lucky that way, too!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. No known allergies. Finally, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she had high blood pressure too, like me. And she had a bit of arthritis, like me as well. My father, he was strong and healthy all his life, never much bothered with illness. He did have a stroke when he was very old, maybe in his nineties, but he lived a long life. And my sister, she had cancer, lung cancer, a few years back. That was very sad. As for the rest…I don’t really know much about my ancestors’ health. We didn't talk about that much, back when I was growin’ up. Things were different then, you know? So, mostly just high blood pressure and a bit of cancer in the family, that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and cancer in the family. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright. Go right ahead. I’m used to doctors poking and prodding, after all these years! Just let me know if somethin’ hurts, alright?
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 142/88, which is a bit elevated, but not drastically so. Your pulse is 76 and regular. Let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds normal, no murmurs or irregularities. Your lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Those are normal, good response. I'll also check your cranial nerves. All those are intact. Now, I'm going to palpate your neck and check for any swollen lymph nodes. No swollen lymph nodes. And finally, I'm going to do a quick neurological exam. Strength is good in all extremities, and your coordination seems normal. Everything seems generally normal, although your blood pressure is a little elevated. The neck stiffness is subtle, but present. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you might be experiencing a tension headache, possibly related to stress and some muscle tension in your neck. However, the slightly elevated blood pressure and the persistence of the headache for over a week warrant some further investigation.
PATIENT: That makes sense, Doctor. I do worry a bit, you know? About my finances, about my health… It’s good to know you checked my blood pressure. Maybe I should try to relax a little more. What kind of investigation are you thinkin’ about? Do I need any tests? I’m not afraid, I just like to know what’s goin’ on, you know? I appreciate you takin’ the time to check me out so carefully.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's good that you're proactive about your health. Given the headache's duration and your slightly elevated blood pressure, I'd like to order a few tests just to rule out anything more serious. I'd like to start with a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or inflammation. I also recommend a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolytes. Finally, I think it would be helpful to get a thyroid-stimulating hormone level to check your thyroid function, as thyroid problems can sometimes cause headaches. We’ll also need to monitor your blood pressure more closely. I’d like you to check it at home twice a day for the next week and bring me the readings. I can show you how to do that properly before you leave. Do these tests sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright to me, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Whatever you think is best, I'm happy to do. A little bit of bother is worth knowing what's goin’ on, you know? And yes, please show me how to check my blood pressure at home. I haven't done that before. Is there anything special I need to do to prepare for the tests? And... how long will it take to get the results? I appreciate you explainin’ everything so clearly. It makes me feel much better.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No special preparation is needed for these tests – you can eat and drink as usual. The blood draw can be done here at the clinic, and it usually only takes a few minutes. We typically get the results back within 3-5 business days. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available to discuss them. Let me show you how to properly check your blood pressure at home. It's important to sit quietly for 5 minutes before taking the measurement, and to keep your arm supported at heart level. You’ll want to take two readings, a few minutes apart, and record them both. Bringing me those readings will give me a better idea of your typical blood pressure levels. Do you have any questions about that process?
PATIENT: No, that makes sense, Doctor. Sit quietly, support my arm, take two readings…I think I can manage that. It seems pretty straightforward. And I will keep a careful record, just like you showed me. You said 3-5 business days? That gives me plenty of time to get it done. I'm glad you mentioned that, ‘cause sometimes I forget things, you know? So, writing it down is a good idea. I think that’s everything. Thank you again for takin’ such good care of me. I feel much better knowin’ we’re lookin’ into it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gibbbel. It was my pleasure. I’m glad I could ease your mind a bit. Remember, if your headache gets significantly worse, or if you develop any new symptoms like fever, vision changes, or weakness, please call the clinic immediately. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns between now and then. I'll see you in a few days to discuss the results. Have a good day, and try to relax as much as possible. .
PATIENT: .
