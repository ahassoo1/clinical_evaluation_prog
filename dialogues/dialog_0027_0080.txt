DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Fabing. Welcome. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doctor. Just need to get some forms filled out, that’s all. My husband said I needed to do it to keep everything straight with… well, with the healthcare stuff. Medicare, I think he called it.
DOCTOR: Right, Medicare forms. Yes, important to keep everything updated. And is there anything else you wanted to discuss while you’re here?
PATIENT: Nope, not really. Just the forms. I don't usually come to the doctor unless something's really wrong, you know? I’m pretty healthy, all things considered. Just want to get this paperwork done and be on my way if that's okay.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Fabing. We can absolutely focus on the forms. However, as your doctor, I do like to have a quick check-in with all my patients, even if they’re feeling well. It helps me get a better understanding of your overall health. It doesn’t have to be long. Perhaps just a quick review of any current medications or allergies?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright. I guess that’s not a bad idea. No medications, no allergies that I know of. I haven’t taken anything regular in… a long time. Just over-the-counter stuff sometimes, for a headache or cold, you know? Nothing fancy. Is there a list somewhere of what you need to know? I’m terrible at remembering things off the top of my head.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. We have a standard questionnaire on this tablet. It will help us cover everything systematically. We’ll start with a little bit about your past medical history – any serious illnesses or surgeries you’ve had?
PATIENT: Let me see… serious illnesses. Hmm. When I was a little girl, I had really bad pneumonia, almost didn’t make it, my grandma said. But that was a long time ago. As for surgeries… I had my tonsils out when I was about eight, I think. And… oh, I had a C-section with my daughter, about fifteen years ago. That’s about it, I think. Everything else has just been… bumps and bruises, you know? Normal life stuff.
DOCTOR: Pneumonia as a child, tonsillectomy, and a C-section fifteen years ago. Noted. And how was your recovery from the C-section?
PATIENT: It was… rough, honestly. It was a long recovery. I was pretty weak for a while. But I got through it. Everything healed up okay, though. No problems since then, thankfully. I was pretty young when I had her, so it took a bit longer to bounce back, I think. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. Recoveries can vary, especially after major events like childbirth. And you mentioned being young when you had your daughter; that can definitely play a role. Now, do you have any family history of significant medical conditions – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, things like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandma, on my mother’s side, had diabetes. She struggled with it for years, before she passed. And… my uncle, he had heart trouble. Had a bypass surgery a few years back. That’s about all I can think of, off the top of my head. My dad’s side of the family… I didn’t know them very well. He left when I was little, so I don’t know much about their health.
DOCTOR: Diabetes in your maternal grandmother and heart trouble in your uncle. Thank you for sharing that information. Now, just a couple more quick questions, if you don’t mind. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not me. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s about it. And definitely no drugs. I have a pretty healthy lifestyle, all things considered. I eat pretty well, try to stay active… you know, normal stuff. I work outside a lot, which keeps me moving.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent to hear. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol, healthy lifestyle. That's very good. Alright, Ms. Fabing, just to be thorough, would you mind if I quickly checked your blood pressure and listened to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: That sounds… okay. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I’ve got to get back and help my husband with dinner. He’s not the best cook, you know? He burns everything. But sure, go ahead. Blood pressure and listening… that sounds fine.
DOCTOR: It won't take long at all. Just a quick check. Please, have a seat and relax. Blood pressure is 128/78, which is within normal limits. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear, breath sounds are normal bilaterally. Everything sounds good so far. Now, do you have any current complaints?
PATIENT: Nope, nothing at all, thankfully. Just feeling a little tired, but that’s probably from working in the sun all day. It’s been hot lately, you know? Other than that, I’m feeling pretty good. Really. I think that’s everything. Can we get to the forms now? I’m starting to worry about dinner…
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fabing. It sounds like you’re in good health, which is wonderful. Based on what you’ve told me, there are no immediate concerns. We can certainly proceed with the Medicare forms now. Here you go. Please take your time and fill them out to the best of your ability. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask. I'll be right here if you need me.
PATIENT: Perfect. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I’ll just get started on these… and hopefully get home before everything burns!
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fabing. I'm glad I could help. Take your time, and I hope your dinner doesn’t burn. .
