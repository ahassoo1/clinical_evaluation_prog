DOCTOR: Hi Brad, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, doc, it's... unpleasant. Been throwin' up blood, mostly. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to make a fella worry. Happened a couple times now, over the last week or so. It's… dark. Like coffee grounds, you know? Not ideal.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad, that is concerning, and you’re right to get it checked out. Dark, coffee-ground-like vomit is something we definitely need to investigate. Let’s get a bit more detail, if you don’t mind. First, can you tell me exactly when did this start?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… it was… last Tuesday, I reckon. Yeah, Tuesday the 29th of July. Woke up and there it was. Thought it was just somethin' I ate, at first. But then it happened again on Thursday. And… yeah, yesterday morning, too. It’s not every day, thankfully. But it’s definitely not gettin’ better.
DOCTOR: Okay, so starting Tuesday the 29th, happening again Thursday, and yesterday – that gives us a good timeline. And you said it's not a large amount each time, but enough to worry you. Can you describe the vomiting itself?
PATIENT: Well, it ain't like a geyser, if you catch my drift. It's more… forced. Gotta really push, you know? And it's… well, it smells awful, if that matters. Like old pennies and… well, just bad. And afterwards, I feel completely drained. Weak. Like I ran a marathon. Not a pleasant experience, I can assure you.
DOCTOR: Okay, forced vomiting, unpleasant smell… and that feeling of weakness afterwards is important. Do you feel any nausea before the vomiting starts, or does it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Nah, not really nausea. It’s more like… a rumblin’ in my gut. A warnin’, kinda. And then… bam. It just comes up. Doesn't build up slow or nothin'. Just… happens. It’s quick, thankfully, but unpleasant as all get out. You ever deal with somethin' like this before, doc? I’ve never had this happen before.
DOCTOR: Yes, I have. It’s good you’re describing everything so clearly, Brad. The sudden onset, without significant nausea, is helpful information. Now, has anything changed in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? Not really. Same old stuff, mostly. Lamb, rice, some vegetables when my daughter brings 'em over, you know. I’ve been a bit… off my food the last couple days because of this, but I haven't been eatin' anythin’ new. I stick to what I know. Don't go for fancy stuff, if you catch my drift. And I definitely haven’t been drinkin’ anything strong. Not anymore, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay, no dietary changes, and you're not currently drinking alcohol. Good to know. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this—like abdominal pain, fever, weight loss, or any change in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain… a little bit. Just a dull ache, mostly, right under my ribs. Comes and goes. Haven’t got a fever, and I haven't been weighin’ myself, if that matters. As for bowel movements… well, they’ve been… darker. A little bit tarry-lookin’, if you know what I mean. Not every time, but a few times now. That's probably connected, right? That ain't good, is it?
DOCTOR: No, Brad, that’s not ideal, and you're right to be concerned. Dark, tarry stools alongside the vomiting blood is definitely something we need to investigate further. It suggests bleeding in the upper digestive tract. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any known medical conditions—like ulcers, liver problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Ulcers? Liver problems? Nah, nothin’ like that. Never been diagnosed with anythin’, doc. I've always been a strong fella. A little bit of a bad back here and there, but that's it. Worked in the crematory for twenty years, so I lifted a lot of things. That's probably why. My wife… well, she always told me to take it easy, but I never did. She passed away three years ago, bless her soul. That's… that's been rough. But I ain't been sick, nothin' major.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Brad. That must have been incredibly difficult. Okay, so no known medical conditions. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never been under the knife. Always managed to avoid it, thankfully. I’m a bit of a worrier when it comes to hospitals. My wife… she had a bad experience with one, a long time ago. That's probably why. I prefer to just… tough it out, if you catch my drift. But this… this is somethin' different. I can't just ignore this, can I?
DOCTOR: No, Brad, you absolutely can’t ignore this. It’s good you’re coming in to get it checked out. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Nah, not that I know of. My wife always handled the medications, bless her. I just took what she gave me when I had a cold or somethin'. Never had a reaction, thankfully. I haven’t taken anythin’ in months, maybe even longer. I’m a pretty simple fella, doc. Don’t need a lot of fancy pills to keep me goin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And you're not currently taking any medications. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any instances of ulcers, stomach cancer, or bleeding disorders in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a tough one. My family… they weren’t big on talkin’ about medical stuff. Lots of stoicism, if you catch my drift. My father… he died young, from a heart attack. My mother… she lived a long life, but she had some trouble with her digestion. Always complainin’ about heartburn, but I don’t know if it was serious. As for stomach cancer or bleedin’ disorders… I don’t recall ever hearin’ about anythin’ like that. Lots of strong folks, mostly. Not much sickness.
DOCTOR: Okay, so limited family medical history, but some mention of digestive issues in your mother. Finally, Brad, do you smoke?
PATIENT: Nah, not anymore. Used to, back in my younger days. A pack a day, maybe more. Quit about fifteen years ago when my daughter was born. Best decision I ever made, I reckon. Ain’t touched one since. My wife… she always hated it, bless her.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. It’s very helpful. Given your symptoms—the vomiting blood that looks like coffee grounds, the dark stools, and the dull abdominal pain—I’m concerned about possible bleeding in your upper digestive tract. We need to figure out what's causing it. I'd like to do a physical exam now, and then I'll order some blood work and a stool test. We may also need to consider an endoscopy—a procedure where we look inside your stomach and esophagus with a small camera—to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: An endoscopy? That sounds… unpleasant. Stickin' a camera down my throat? That don't sound ideal, doc. But… I reckon I gotta do what I gotta do, right? If that’s what you think is best. I just… I don’t do well with hospitals and procedures. My wife… well, let’s just say I ain't a fan. But alright. Blood work and a stool test sounds manageable. And the… the endoscopy, if you really think it’s necessary. Just… take it easy on me, alright?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Brad, and I completely respect your concerns. I promise we'll take things one step at a time. The endoscopy is the best way to pinpoint the source of the bleeding, and it allows us to treat the problem directly. We can discuss sedation options to make you as comfortable as possible during the procedure. First, let's do the physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your vital signs. Take a deep breath for me, Brad… and another one… Good. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Tell me if you feel any pain or tenderness. Starting here on your right side…
PATIENT: Alright. Go ahead. This ain’t the most comfortable, but I’ve been through worse. Used to liftin' heavy stuff, you know? So a little bit of pressin' ain’t gonna bother me too much. Just… don't go pokin' around too much, alright? My stomach’s been a bit sensitive lately. And… yeah, that’s a little tender, right under my ribs. A dull ache, like I said. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, Brad. I'm noticing some mild tenderness under your ribs, consistent with what you’ve described. No guarding or rigidity, which is good. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that could be due to anxiety. Now, let's get those blood work and stool tests ordered. The blood work will help us assess your overall health and check for anemia. The stool test will confirm the presence of blood. I’ll get the paperwork started now. And we can discuss the endoscopy procedure in more detail after we have the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds like a plan. Paperwork… I reckon I can handle paperwork. Just… try not to keep me waitin’ too long, alright? I ain't a fan of hospitals, and the longer I'm here, the more anxious I get. And… yeah, the endoscopy talk can wait until after the results. Just… let me know when I need to be here, and I’ll show up. I gotta be honest, doc, I’m a bit worried. This ain’t like me, gettin' sick like this.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Brad, and I'll do everything I can to make this process as smooth and quick as possible. I’ll personally go over the results with you as soon as they are available, and we'll discuss the next steps. I'll also have my nurse explain everything to you in detail before any procedures. In the meantime, try to relax and drink plenty of fluids. Avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. And if you experience any severe abdominal pain, vomiting blood, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I'll have the nurse come in now to draw your blood and collect a stool sample. She'll explain the process to you. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: Nah, I reckon that’s alright for now. Just… try not to keep me waitin’ too long, alright? And… thank you, doc. For… bein’ patient with an old man like me. This ain’t easy, gettin’ poked and prodded and… thinkin’ about a camera goin’ down my throat. But… I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen. And… yeah, tell the nurse to be gentle, alright?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Brad. I understand it's not easy, and I'll make sure to tell the nurse to be as gentle as possible. We’ll take good care of you. I’ll leave you in the nurse’s capable hands now. She’ll be in shortly. .
