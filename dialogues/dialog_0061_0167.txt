DOCTOR: Bula! And good morning to you, Emiliano. My name is Dr. Kimm. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Kimm. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, my foot… it’s been bothering me. A sore, you see. A bad sore that won't get better. It hurts to walk, even with slippers.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that’s been causing you trouble with walking. I understand. How long has this sore been bothering you, Emiliano?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s been… maybe two, three months now? It started small, I thought it was just a little cut. But it hasn’t gone away, and now it’s… well, bigger. And it hurts more. I try to keep it clean, but it’s hard.
DOCTOR: Two to three months, starting as a small cut that's grown and become more painful. And you're having trouble keeping it clean, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s on the bottom of my foot, so when I walk… dirt gets in it. And I’m not as quick as I used to be, you know? Hard to bend down to wash it good. My wife… she always took care of it. But she’s gone now.
DOCTOR: I’m so sorry to hear about your wife, Emiliano. That must be very difficult. It makes sense that it's harder to manage things on your own now. Okay, so the sore is on the bottom of your foot, and you're having trouble keeping it clean because of its location and difficulty bending down. Has it changed in any other way since it started?
PATIENT: Well… it sometimes gets a little… wet. And smells a bit. Not always, but sometimes. And I noticed… the skin around it is red. It’s not puffy, just red. And it feels… warm to the touch, if that makes sense. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… ache, all the time. Even when I’m resting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sometimes gets wet and has a smell, the skin around it is red but not puffy, and you’re feeling a constant ache even when resting. That gives me a better picture. Have you noticed any drainage from the sore – any pus or anything like that?
PATIENT: Drainage… hmm. Sometimes… yes. A little bit. It’s not much, but it’s… yellowish. And it sometimes makes the sock sticky. It’s not a lot, like I said, but it’s there. I wipe it away with a wet cloth. I hope that makes sense. I’m not good with these… medical things.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Emiliano. You’re explaining everything very clearly. Yellowish drainage is good information to have. Now, have you had any fever or chills recently?
PATIENT: Fever… chills? Not that I know of. I haven’t felt hot, and I haven’t been shaking. I get a little cold sometimes, but that’s just because the house is cool. I don’t think it’s a fever. No, no fever, I don’t think so. But I have been… more tired than usual. Just… sleepy all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or chills, but you've been feeling more tired than usual. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk about your overall health a bit. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh yes. The doctor… my old doctor, he told me I have the sugar sickness. Diabetes, he called it. I take pills for it, every morning. And… well, my legs aren’t so good. They swell up sometimes. The doctor said it was from the… the heart. I don’t remember everything he said.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have diabetes that you manage with pills, and you also have some leg swelling related to your heart. Do you know the name of the pills you take for your diabetes?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… the bottle is at home. They are… small, white pills. Round ones. I think… Metformin? Is that right? Yes, I believe it’s Metformin. I take two of them every morning with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Metformin. That's good to know. And are you taking any other medications besides the Metformin?
PATIENT: Let me think… Yes, I take a water pill, for the swelling. The doctor said it would help my legs. It’s a small, yellow one. And… oh! Sometimes I take something for my blood pressure, when it gets too high. But not every day. Just when the doctor tells me to.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take a water pill for swelling and something for your blood pressure when needed. Do you happen to know the names of those medications as well?
PATIENT: Oh dear… No, I’m sorry, Doctor. I just… I don’t remember all the names. My wife always handled the pills. She knew everything. I just take them when she told me to, or now… when the bottle says to. I have a hard time keeping track, you know?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Emiliano. It’s completely understandable. We can figure things out. It’s good you’re being honest with me. Alright, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything my wife used to make. Never had a problem with food. And the doctor… he gave me some shots when I was young, but I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. No, I don’t think so. No allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Now, before we take a look at your foot, let me ask about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. My wife didn’t like smoking. And I didn’t want to upset her. So, I never started. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And I don’t drink much alcohol either. Just a little glass of wine with dinner sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, you don’t smoke and only have a little wine with dinner occasionally. That’s good to know. And, do you live alone currently?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I do. My wife… she passed away last year. I live in the same house we always lived in. It’s… quiet now. Too quiet sometimes. I have some neighbors who check on me, that’s nice. But mostly, it’s just me.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry for your loss, Emiliano. It sounds like you’re managing as best you can. Okay, let’s take a look at your foot now. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That would be good. Please. It’s been bothering me for so long. I just want to know what’s going on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Emiliano, I’ve had a look at your foot. The sore is on the bottom of your foot, it’s about two centimeters across, and it’s red and tender. There is some drainage and a faint odor. Your pulses are a little weak, but present. It looks like there’s some inflammation around the sore, which is causing the redness and tenderness. Given your history of diabetes and the fact that the sore isn’t healing, it’s important we take this seriously.
PATIENT: Oh dear… that doesn’t sound good, does it? What does it mean, Doctor? Is it… serious? Will I have to… lose my foot?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Emiliano. It doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll lose your foot, but we need to address this promptly. Given your diabetes, you're at higher risk for foot ulcers and infections that don't heal well. What’s happening is likely a combination of poor circulation from the diabetes, some nerve damage, and a possible infection. We need to find out how serious the infection is, if any. To do that, I'd like to order some tests. I want to do a blood test to check your blood sugar levels and look for signs of infection. I also want to send a swab of the sore to the lab to see what kind of bacteria are present, if any. And I think an X-ray of your foot would be helpful to see if there’s any bone infection. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Tests… yes, that sounds… sensible. If that’s what you think is best, Doctor, then please do them. I just want to get better. I want to be able to walk again without pain. And… I don’t want anything bad to happen. Will these tests hurt? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: The blood test will be a simple prick of the finger, just like getting your sugar checked at the doctor's office. It shouldn't hurt much, just a little pinch. The swab of the sore will also be quick – I’ll gently clean the area and take a small sample with a cotton swab. It might feel a little uncomfortable, but shouldn't be painful. The X-ray is painless – you’ll just stand or sit while the machine takes a picture of your foot. The lab results usually take about 24 to 48 hours. We should have them by the end of the week. Once we have those results, we can discuss the best course of treatment. In the meantime, it’s very important to keep the sore clean and dry, and to avoid putting too much weight on your foot. I'll give you some specific instructions on how to do that. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense, Doctor. A little pinch, a quick swab, and a picture. And keep it clean and dry. I can do that. My wife… she always said I was good at following instructions. So, you’ll tell me what to do when you get the results? And I just need to try and stay off my foot? Is there anything else I should be doing now? Any special creams or bandages?
DOCTOR: That's right, I’ll review the results with you as soon as they come in and we'll make a plan. And yes, trying to stay off your foot as much as possible will help. For now, I recommend keeping the sore covered with a clean, dry bandage. I'm going to give you some special dressings that will help absorb any drainage and keep the wound moist – that actually helps it heal. Avoid using any over-the-counter creams or ointments, as some of them can actually slow down the healing process. I'm also going to write you a prescription for a course of antibiotics, just in case there’s an infection. It’s better to start treatment early if we suspect one. I'll also give you a referral to a podiatrist – a foot specialist – who can help with ongoing wound care. They can trim any dead tissue and make sure the sore is healing properly. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very thorough, Doctor. Special bandages, antibiotics, and a foot specialist. I appreciate you taking such good care of me. So, you’ll give me all the papers and prescriptions before I leave? And I should call the podiatrist to make an appointment? Is there a particular one you recommend?
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ll get everything ready for you before you leave – the prescriptions, the instructions for wound care, and the referral to the podiatrist. And yes, please do call the podiatrist to schedule an appointment as soon as you can. I recommend Dr. Keanu Silva. He’s excellent and has a lot of experience with diabetic foot ulcers. His number is on the referral sheet I’ll give you. I'm going to give you a handout with information about diabetes and foot care as well, so you have something to refer to at home. Do you have any other questions for me right now, Emiliano?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything for now, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I feel a little better knowing what’s going on and what we’re going to do. I hope the tests don’t take too long.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emiliano. I'm glad I could help. I understand it’s worrying when something’s not right, and I’ll do everything I can to get you back on your feet. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw your blood now, and then I’ll get the prescriptions and referrals ready for you. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Take care, and try to rest.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. And thank you again.
