DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Chilla. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure, I suppose. Though I do wish these waiting rooms weren’t quite so… common. I requested to speak with someone about those forms – the ones regarding end-of-life wishes. Advance Directive, was it? And the POLST form. My husband thought it prudent to have these things in order, and while I find the whole topic rather… morbid, I agreed.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. Those are very important considerations, and your husband is wise to be proactive. It’s perfectly normal to find the topic difficult; many people do. We can absolutely discuss both the Advance Directive and the POLST form today. To ensure I understand your needs and preferences correctly, perhaps we can start with your understanding of these documents?
PATIENT: Well, honestly, Doctor, my understanding is… limited. My husband did most of the research. He said something about making sure my wishes are known if I become… incapacitated. He used that word, “incapacitated.” It sounds dreadful. Something about not wanting tubes and machines and… well, you can imagine. I just want to be sure it’s all done properly, and that it reflects what I would want, not… other people’s ideas. Is that making sense? I'm not particularly good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Chilla. You are articulating your concerns very clearly. It's entirely reasonable to want to ensure your wishes are respected, and to have a clear understanding of the process. Let’s break it down. The Advance Directive is a legal document that outlines your preferences for healthcare decisions if you are unable to communicate them yourself. This can cover a broad range of situations. The POLST – Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment – is a more specific form, typically for individuals with serious illness or frailty. It translates your wishes into actionable medical orders. To start, have you had any preliminary conversations with your husband regarding specific treatments you would or would not want in the event of a serious illness?
PATIENT: Yes, we've discussed it… somewhat. He is very insistent on “no heroic measures,” as he calls them. No feeding tubes, no ventilation, no resuscitation if my heart stops. He showed me some rather graphic videos, which I found quite unnecessary, frankly. I told him I don’t want to be kept alive artificially, if there’s truly no hope. But I also don’t want to be… abandoned. Is there a difference, Doctor? It feels like a very fine line, and he seems to think it’s all very simple. He’s a lawyer, you see, so he's used to things being black and white. But life isn’t like that, is it?
DOCTOR: You’ve highlighted a very important distinction, Ms. Chilla. It’s excellent that you’re able to articulate these nuances. Your concern about not wanting to be “abandoned” is absolutely valid, and it’s crucial to address that feeling. There is a difference between withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment and providing comfort and palliative care. “No heroic measures” can mean different things to different people, and it's important to define what that specifically entails for you. It doesn't necessarily mean a complete lack of medical intervention. It can include focusing on pain management, symptom control, and emotional support, even if life-sustaining treatment is not pursued. To get a clearer picture of your wishes, could you tell me a little more about what "quality of life" means to you?
PATIENT: Quality of life… That’s a rather philosophical question, isn’t it? I suppose… being able to think clearly is important. And being able to interact with my family, to have some semblance of dignity. I don’t want to be a burden, obviously. And I certainly don't want to be in constant pain. I’ve seen what happens to people in hospitals, the indignity of it all. I used to volunteer at a nursing home, briefly. It wasn't a pleasant experience. I don't want that, Doctor. I simply don't. But defining it… it’s difficult. He keeps asking me about specific scenarios, like, “What if you’re unable to feed yourself?” or “What if you can’t recognize anyone?” It’s all so… morbid.
DOCTOR: You’re right, Ms. Chilla, it is a difficult and, understandably, morbid conversation. It's excellent that you’ve identified those key aspects of quality of life – cognitive function, social interaction, dignity, and avoiding pain. And your experience volunteering at the nursing home provides valuable insight into your preferences. Let's focus on those points. Regarding the scenario of being unable to feed yourself, would you want to be offered artificial nutrition, such as a feeding tube, even if your prognosis for recovery is poor?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I’ve seen what those tubes do to people. The discomfort, the infection risk… it’s not a life, Doctor, it’s merely an existence. My husband says I need to be “realistic,” but I am being realistic. I don’t want to prolong suffering unnecessarily. If I can’t eat, if my body is failing… then it’s time to let nature take its course. He thinks I should at least consider it, in case there’s a chance of improvement. But I’ve made up my mind. No tubes. Absolutely not. And no ventilation, either. I want to be comfortable, as comfortable as possible, and I want to be allowed to die with dignity. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Chilla, that is not too much to ask at all. It's perfectly reasonable to have those wishes, and it’s important that we document them clearly. You've articulated your preferences very firmly and thoughtfully. So, to summarize, you are declining artificial nutrition and mechanical ventilation should you become unable to eat or breathe on your own, with the understanding that this is based on a desire to avoid prolonged suffering and maintain dignity. Is that a correct understanding?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly correct, Doctor. You’ve understood me perfectly. It’s a relief to finally have someone listen and understand. My husband means well, of course, but he's so focused on the legal aspects of it all that he forgets the human element. He wants everything to be precise and unambiguous, which is all well and good, but… it’s my life, isn’t it? And I want my wishes respected. So, yes. That is a correct understanding. Now, what about this POLST form? Is it just a more detailed version of this Advance Directive?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Chilla, you are absolutely right – it’s a relief to ensure we’re aligned on your wishes. And you are correct to point out that it's your life and your preferences that matter most. Regarding the POLST form, it is indeed related to the Advance Directive, but it's more specific. Think of the Advance Directive as your overall plan, and the POLST as the actionable orders that healthcare professionals will follow in an emergency. It addresses specific medical treatments – resuscitation, intubation, artificial nutrition – and outlines your wishes regarding those interventions. Unlike the Advance Directive, which may not be readily available in an emergency situation, the POLST is a brightly colored form designed to be easily visible and portable. It's often used for individuals with serious illness or frailty, ensuring that their wishes are known and respected by emergency medical personnel. Would you like me to explain the specific sections of the POLST form in more detail?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be very helpful. I must admit, I find all of this rather… overwhelming. My husband has a copy of the form, but he expects me to understand it without explanation, which I find rather unreasonable. So, yes, please. Explain it to me, in simple terms. And perhaps we can go through it section by section, so I can be sure I understand what I’m signing. I don't want any surprises, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. It’s perfectly reasonable to want a clear explanation, and I’m happy to go through it with you section by section. It’s important that you feel comfortable and informed. The POLST form is organized into several sections. The first section pertains to your goals of care. It asks about your overall wishes regarding the extent of medical treatment you desire. The options typically range from full treatment, to selective treatment, to comfort-focused care. The next sections address specific interventions. For example, there’s a section on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation, or CPR. This asks whether you want to be resuscitated if your heart stops or you stop breathing. The options are typically “Full Treatment,” meaning CPR will be attempted, “Selective Treatment,” meaning CPR will only be attempted in certain circumstances, and “Comfort Focused Care,” meaning CPR will not be attempted. There are also sections on artificial ventilation, artificial nutrition, and antibiotics. Each section outlines your preferences regarding those interventions. Do you understand this basic structure so far?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so, Doctor. It sounds… a bit morbid, but I understand the structure. So, it’s essentially a checklist of things that might happen, and I have to decide whether I want them to happen or not. My husband keeps talking about “burdensome interventions,” which I find a rather clinical way of putting it. But I suppose that's what he means. So, let's start with the resuscitation section. You said it's about whether I want to be “brought back” if my heart stops. What happens if I choose "Comfort Focused Care"? Does that mean they just… let me go? That sounds rather frightening, frankly. And what does "Selective Treatment" even mean? It sounds rather vague.
DOCTOR: You are articulating your concerns perfectly, Ms. Chilla, and those are very valid questions. It is a difficult topic, and the terminology can be unsettling. If you choose "Comfort Focused Care" regarding resuscitation, it means that the healthcare team will focus on providing comfort and symptom management, rather than attempting to restore your heartbeat or breathing. This decision is made when the potential benefits of resuscitation are deemed unlikely, and the focus shifts to a peaceful and dignified death. It does not mean that you will be abandoned or neglected. It simply means that the medical team will prioritize your comfort and quality of life. "Selective Treatment" is indeed a bit vague, and it’s a good question to ask for clarification. It typically means that resuscitation will only be attempted if there's a reasonable chance of survival and a good quality of life after resuscitation. This decision is often made in consultation with your healthcare team and based on your specific medical condition and wishes. To give you a more concrete example, if you have a serious underlying illness with a poor prognosis, your healthcare team might recommend "Selective Treatment," meaning that they will only attempt resuscitation if there's a sudden and reversible cause for your cardiac arrest. If the cause is related to your underlying illness, they might recommend "Comfort Focused Care." Does that clarification help?
PATIENT: Yes, that helps a bit, Doctor. So, if I choose "Selective Treatment," they’ll basically decide whether it’s worth trying or not, based on… what? My overall health? The specific circumstances? It sounds rather… arbitrary. I prefer to make my own decisions, if possible. And I certainly don’t want a lawyer deciding my fate. My husband is very good at analyzing things logically, but he doesn’t understand the human element. He’s always talking about “quality-adjusted life years,” which I find utterly dehumanizing. So, I think… I think I prefer “Comfort Focused Care.” If there’s no reasonable chance of recovery, I don’t want to be subjected to… heroic measures. I want to be comfortable, as I said before, and I want to be allowed to die with dignity. But I’m worried about the pain. I’ve heard that… well, never mind. It’s probably best not to dwell on it. But can you assure me that I won’t be in pain if I choose “Comfort Focused Care”?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to want to make your own decisions, Ms. Chilla, and your concerns are entirely valid. “Selective Treatment” can feel arbitrary, and it’s understandable that you prefer to have a clear and definitive plan. You've articulated your wishes very clearly, and it sounds like "Comfort Focused Care" is the best option for you. We will absolutely honor your preferences. Regarding pain, that is a very important concern, and I want to assure you that we will do everything possible to manage your pain and discomfort. Palliative care focuses on providing comfort and symptom management, and we have a range of medications and therapies available to help alleviate pain. We will work closely with you to assess your pain levels and adjust your treatment plan accordingly. It is our goal to ensure that you are as comfortable as possible. It’s important to remember that “Comfort Focused Care” does not mean that you will be neglected or abandoned. It simply means that we will prioritize your comfort and quality of life. We will continue to provide you with compassionate care, emotional support, and any other assistance you may need. Would you like me to document your decision to choose "Comfort Focused Care" for resuscitation?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. Document it. And thank you. You’ve explained everything very clearly, and you’ve made me feel much more comfortable. My husband means well, but he tends to get bogged down in the details. You’ve actually listened to me, and you’ve understood my concerns. So, yes, document “Comfort Focused Care” for resuscitation. And perhaps we can move on to the other sections now. I suppose it’s best to get it all done, so I don’t have to worry about it anymore. It’s a morbid topic, but it’s best to be prepared, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. “Comfort Focused Care” documented for resuscitation. And you are very welcome. It is my pleasure to help you navigate this process and ensure that your wishes are respected. Now, let’s move on to the next section, which pertains to artificial ventilation. This asks whether you want to be placed on a ventilator if you are unable to breathe on your own. The options are typically “Full Treatment,” meaning a ventilator will be used, “Selective Treatment,” meaning a ventilator will only be used in certain circumstances, and “Comfort Focused Care,” meaning a ventilator will not be used. Would you like me to explain the potential benefits and risks of artificial ventilation before we discuss your preferences?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. Explain it to me. I know what a ventilator is – I’ve seen them in movies – but I don’t know what it actually does, and what the potential consequences are. My husband says it can be “life-saving,” but he also says everything is a “risk-benefit analysis,” which I find utterly dehumanizing. So, please, explain it to me in simple terms. What are the benefits? What are the risks? And what would it mean for me, if I were on a ventilator?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. Artificial ventilation, or being placed on a ventilator, involves using a machine to help you breathe if you are unable to breathe on your own. The machine delivers air into your lungs, providing oxygen and removing carbon dioxide. The potential benefits of artificial ventilation include allowing your lungs to rest and recover, providing oxygen to your vital organs, and giving your body time to fight off an infection or illness. It can be life-saving in certain circumstances, such as pneumonia, severe asthma attacks, or after a major surgery. However, there are also potential risks associated with artificial ventilation. These include lung damage, infection, discomfort, and difficulty speaking or eating. It can also require a long hospital stay and may not always be successful. If you were on a ventilator, you would likely be sedated to ensure your comfort. A tube would be inserted into your airway, either through your nose or mouth, and connected to the ventilator. You would not be able to speak while on the ventilator, and you may experience some discomfort or difficulty breathing. It’s important to remember that being on a ventilator is not always a comfortable or pleasant experience, and it may not always improve your quality of life. Does that explanation help?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s very helpful, Doctor. It sounds… unpleasant, to say the least. And it sounds like it would be very isolating. I can’t imagine being unable to speak, and being dependent on a machine to breathe. My husband says it can be “temporary,” but he also says everything is “provisional,” which I find utterly frustrating. So, given that it sounds so unpleasant, and given that it may not always be successful, I think… I think I’d rather not. I think I’d rather decline artificial ventilation. I’d rather focus on comfort and symptom management, as we discussed before. I want to be comfortable, and I want to be allowed to die with dignity. So, please, document “Comfort Focused Care” for artificial ventilation. And perhaps we can move on to the next section now. I’m starting to feel a bit overwhelmed, but I want to get it all done, so I don’t have to worry about it anymore.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. “Comfort Focused Care” documented for artificial ventilation. You are absolutely right to prioritize your comfort and dignity, and I commend you for making these difficult decisions. The next section pertains to artificial nutrition. This asks whether you want to receive nutrition and fluids through a feeding tube if you are unable to eat or drink on your own. The options are typically “Full Treatment,” meaning a feeding tube will be used, “Selective Treatment,” meaning a feeding tube will only be used in certain circumstances, and “Comfort Focused Care,” meaning a feeding tube will not be used. Would you like me to explain the potential benefits and risks of artificial nutrition before we discuss your preferences?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. Explain it to me. I know what a feeding tube is, but I don’t know what it actually does, and what the potential consequences are. My husband says it can “prolong life,” but he also says everything is “contingent,” which I find utterly exasperating. He seems to think it’s a matter of principle, rather than a matter of quality of life. So, please, explain it to me in simple terms. What are the benefits? What are the risks? And what would it mean for me, if I were on a feeding tube?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. Artificial nutrition, or receiving nutrition and fluids through a feeding tube, involves delivering nutrients directly into your stomach or small intestine if you are unable to eat or drink on your own. This can be done through a nasal feeding tube, which is inserted through your nose, or a gastrostomy tube, which is surgically inserted into your stomach. The potential benefits of artificial nutrition include providing your body with the nutrients it needs to maintain its weight and strength, preventing dehydration, and improving your overall quality of life. It can be helpful for individuals who are unable to eat or drink due to a medical condition or injury. However, there are also potential risks associated with artificial nutrition. These include infection, discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It can also require a long hospital stay and may not always be successful. If you were on a feeding tube, you would likely experience some discomfort or nausea. You may also have difficulty speaking or swallowing. It’s important to remember that being on a feeding tube is not always a comfortable or pleasant experience, and it may not always improve your quality of life. Does that explanation help?
PATIENT: Yes, that helps, Doctor. It sounds… unpleasant, to say the least. And it sounds like it would be very restrictive. I can’t imagine being dependent on a tube for nourishment. My husband says it can “maintain functionality,” but he also says everything is “subject to change,” which I find utterly infuriating. He seems to think it’s a moral obligation, rather than a matter of personal choice. So, given that it sounds so unpleasant, and given that it may not always improve my quality of life, I think… I think I’d rather not. I think I’d rather decline artificial nutrition. I want to be comfortable, and I want to be allowed to die with dignity. So, please, document “Comfort Focused Care” for artificial nutrition. And perhaps we can move on to the final section now. I’m starting to feel quite exhausted, but I want to get it all done, so I don’t have to worry about it anymore. It’s a morbid topic, but I’m glad we’ve discussed it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. “Comfort Focused Care” documented for artificial nutrition. You have articulated your wishes very clearly, and I commend you for your courage in making these difficult decisions. The final section pertains to antibiotic use. This asks whether you want to receive antibiotics if you develop an infection. The options are typically “Full Treatment,” meaning antibiotics will be used, “Selective Treatment,” meaning antibiotics will only be used in certain circumstances, and “Comfort Focused Care,” meaning antibiotics will not be used. Would you like me to explain the potential benefits and risks of antibiotic use before we discuss your preferences?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. Explain it to me. I know what antibiotics are, but I don’t know what the potential consequences are. My husband says they can “combat illness,” but he also says everything is “provisional,” which, frankly, is starting to grate on my nerves. He’s so focused on extending life, regardless of quality. So, please, explain it to me in simple terms. What are the benefits? What are the risks? And what would it mean for me, if I were on antibiotics?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. Antibiotics are medications used to treat bacterial infections. They can be very effective in combating illness, but they also have potential side effects. The potential benefits of antibiotic use include resolving an infection, relieving symptoms, and preventing complications. They can be life-saving in certain circumstances, such as pneumonia or sepsis. However, there are also potential risks associated with antibiotic use. These include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, allergic reactions, and the development of antibiotic resistance. Overuse of antibiotics can also contribute to the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, making infections more difficult to treat in the future. If you were on antibiotics, you may experience some side effects, such as nausea or diarrhea. It’s important to remember that antibiotics are not always effective, and they may not always improve your quality of life. In the context of your overall wishes, considering "Comfort Focused Care," you may choose to forego antibiotics if the infection is not life-threatening and would primarily prolong suffering without significantly improving your quality of life. Does that explanation help?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s very helpful, Doctor. It sounds… complicated. And it sounds like there are risks either way. My husband says they can “eradicate pathogens,” but frankly, I’m starting to tune him out. He’s so focused on the technical aspects, he forgets the human element. So, given that there are risks either way, and given my overall wishes for comfort and dignity, I think… I think I’d rather decline antibiotics, unless it’s absolutely necessary to relieve severe suffering. I want to be comfortable, and I want to be allowed to die with dignity. So, please, document “Comfort Focused Care” for antibiotics, with the caveat that they may be used to relieve severe suffering. And then… then I think we’re done. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient and understanding. I feel much better now, knowing that my wishes have been documented. It’s a morbid topic, but it’s important to have these conversations.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Chilla. “Comfort Focused Care” documented for antibiotics, with the caveat that they may be used to relieve severe suffering. And yes, we are done. I commend you for your thoughtful and courageous decisions. It is a difficult topic, but you have handled it with grace and clarity. I have documented your wishes on the POLST form, and a copy will be kept in your medical record. It will also be visible to emergency medical personnel, should they need to provide you with care. Do you have any further questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. I feel much better now, knowing that my wishes have been documented. Thank you again for your patience and understanding. You’ve actually listened to me, and you’ve understood my concerns. My husband means well, but he tends to get bogged down in the details. I suppose… I suppose that’s all. I’m quite exhausted now, but I’m glad we had this conversation. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Chilla. It was my pleasure to assist you. Remember, these wishes are not set in stone and can be revisited at any time. If you have any questions or concerns in the future, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Take care of yourself, Ms. Chilla. And please, rest well.
