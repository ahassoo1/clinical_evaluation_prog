DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Shely, is it? Yes, well, it’s about my bruising. It's… concerning. I’m on that blood thinner, you see, Warfarin, and I seem to be getting bumps and discolorations just from… existing, practically. It's not like I’m throwing myself down stairs. It’s just… happening. And frankly, it’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Farson. It’s understandable that you’re concerned about unexplained bruising, especially while on Warfarin. We certainly want to investigate that. To start, could you tell me a little more about these bruises?
PATIENT: Well, where to begin? They just… appear. I noticed one on my forearm yesterday, and I have absolutely no recollection of hitting it on anything. Another one popped up on my leg, same thing. They aren’t huge, mind you, but they’re noticeable. And they seem to be… multiplying. It’s not like I’m a child, getting scrapes and bruises all the time. I take care of myself. I just… don’t understand it. They also feel… tender, more than they should, perhaps. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, the tenderness is certainly something we should note. It’s good you’re paying close attention to those details. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the bruises themselves?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. They’re… purplish, naturally. At first, they’re a darker, almost wine-colored shade, and then they fade to a sort of… bruised plum, I suppose. Not a particularly attractive color, I assure you. They're not raised, thankfully. Just flat discolorations. And… they’re not particularly painful to the touch, just tender when I move the area. It’s a subtle difference, but it bothers me. They're also… varying in size. Some are the size of a quarter, others are smaller, like a dime. Is that… typical?
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s very helpful. Varying sizes are not uncommon with bruising, but we still need to determine the cause. Now, let's talk about your Warfarin. How long have you been taking it, and what is the dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… It’s been… nearly five years, I believe. Since… after my wife passed. The doctor – Dr. Abernathy, lovely man, retired now – put me on it for… well, it was a blood clot, I think. Something in my leg. As for the dosage… I want to say 5 milligrams daily. But honestly, I leave that to the pharmacy. They package it up nicely, and I just take what they give me. I go for regular blood tests, of course, to make sure the levels are right. Though, frankly, I don’t always understand the results they give me. All those numbers... it’s quite confusing.
DOCTOR: I understand your confusion with the numbers, Mr. Farson. It’s perfectly alright to rely on your doctor to interpret those for you. We can certainly review your recent INR results here, if you'd like. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me about any other medications you are taking, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Let me think… I take a little something for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I believe. Small dose. And… I take a multivitamin, just a standard one, you know, for older gentlemen. And… occasionally, I take ibuprofen for aches and pains. Not often, thankfully. My knees bother me sometimes. And… oh! I do take fish oil. Dr. Abernathy recommended it for… something. Heart health, perhaps. Is ibuprofen a problem? I try to avoid it when possible, but it’s tempting when my knees are acting up. I don’t take much, truly. Just when absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that thorough list, Mr. Farson. Ibuprofen can interact with Warfarin and increase your risk of bleeding, even in small doses. It’s good you're trying to limit it. The fish oil is generally safe, but it's good to be aware of everything you're taking. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past, aside from the blood clot you mentioned?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A rather unpleasant experience, I assure you. And… I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. Nothing… major, really. I’ve always been a fairly robust fellow, despite my age. I did have a rather nasty fall last year, tripped over a rug, but thankfully, nothing was broken. Just a few scrapes and bruises. Though, I am beginning to wonder if this current bruising is related to that fall… perhaps I sustained some internal damage that I didn’t realize at the time? Is that possible? I hadn't really thought of it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That’s a good thought, Mr. Farson, and it’s definitely something we should consider. Internal damage from a fall could potentially contribute to increased bruising. Now, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any bleeding disorders or easy bruising in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a difficult one. My mother… she was a bit prone to nosebleeds, I suppose. Nothing terribly serious, but she did get them fairly often. And my uncle… on my father’s side… he had some sort of… blood condition, I believe. He was always rather frail. But beyond that… not that I’m aware of. My father was a very healthy man, and so was my grandfather. They were both… sturdy, you know? Not like some of these delicate modern constitutions. Though, truthfully, I wasn’t terribly close to either of them, so I wouldn’t necessarily know if they had any hidden ailments. It’s all rather hazy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Farson. That’s helpful to know. Finally, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I live alone, since my wife passed. I keep busy. I enjoy gardening, mostly roses. It's a calming activity. I read a great deal, mostly history. I don't drink excessively, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I used to be quite the golfer, but my knees… well, they don't allow for that anymore. I try to eat a healthy diet, lots of fruits and vegetables. I don't smoke. Generally, I’d say I’m a… responsible individual. I keep a tidy house. I try to stay active, within my limitations, of course. I do worry about falling again, though. It’s… unsettling, to lose your balance. And frankly, this bruising is making me even more anxious about it. It’s all rather… frustrating. I just want to get back to my roses.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that with me, Mr. Farson. It paints a very clear picture. It sounds like you lead a thoughtful and active life. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'd like to gently examine the areas where you've been experiencing bruising. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, proceed. I suppose it’s necessary. Though I must say, I don’t anticipate finding anything particularly alarming. I’ve always been a rather… resilient fellow, as I mentioned. But I trust your expertise, of course. Just… be gentle with my knees, if you wouldn’t mind. They’re rather sensitive.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Farson. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Regarding the bruises, I’m noting some tenderness to the touch, as you mentioned, and the discoloration varies in size, as you described. There’s no palpable swelling or warmth, which is reassuring. I also don’t feel any obvious masses or abnormalities. Your knees do exhibit some tenderness upon palpation, but no acute signs of injury. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical examination, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause of your bruising. Several factors could be contributing, including your age, Warfarin use, occasional ibuprofen intake, and potential minor trauma from falls. Your slightly elevated blood pressure and knee tenderness are also worth noting, but don’t appear to be directly related to the bruising at this time. To further investigate, I’d like to order some blood tests. We’ll check a complete blood count to assess your platelet levels, a coagulation panel to evaluate your Warfarin levels and clotting function, and a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function. These results will help us rule out any underlying medical conditions and optimize your Warfarin dosage. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Blood tests are always a good idea. Better to be thorough, I suppose. As long as it doesn’t involve too much poking and prodding, I’m quite agreeable. And if it helps me get back to my roses, then all the better. Just… please let me know when and where I should go to have them drawn. I prefer to schedule it in the morning, if possible. I don’t function terribly well on an empty stomach. And… is there anything I should avoid before the tests? Anything I need to fast from? I wouldn’t want to skew the results with a late-night snack.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Farson. I completely understand your concerns. We’ll schedule the blood draw for tomorrow morning, as you requested. You will need to fast for 8-12 hours before the test, meaning no food or sugary drinks after midnight tonight. You can still drink water. The lab is located just down the hall, room 203. They're expecting you. Once the results are back – typically within 24-48 hours – we’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding ibuprofen as much as possible. If you experience significant pain, acetaminophen is a safer alternative. And please, be mindful of fall risks. Consider using a cane or walker for added stability, and ensure your home is well-lit and free of tripping hazards. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and… reassuring, actually. It’s comforting to know someone is taking this seriously. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns, and for explaining everything so clearly. I’ll avoid the ibuprofen and be extra careful with my balance. And I’ll remember to fast before the tests tomorrow morning. Thank you again for your help. I look forward to hearing from you once the results are in. Hopefully, it’s nothing too alarming. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I believe I’ll go home and prune my roses. It's a much more pleasant activity than worrying about bruising, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Indeed, Mr. Farson, pruning roses sounds far more agreeable. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment tomorrow. Take care, and enjoy your roses. .
