DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Can you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some… pressure in my bladder, and it’s been bothering me for a little while now. I wanted to get it checked out, just to be sure everything is alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Bladder pressure can be uncomfortable. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a little more about this pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, it’s not exactly painful, more of a… constant feeling like I need to go to the bathroom, even when I don’t really need to. It's been happening pretty regularly throughout the day, and sometimes it wakes me up at night too. It doesn’t seem to be related to how much I drink, honestly. I've tried to keep track, and it happens whether I've had a lot of fluids or very little.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, a constant feeling of urgency, even when you don’t necessarily have a full bladder, and it’s not correlating with your fluid intake. And it’s disrupting your sleep. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this – any burning when you urinate, blood in your urine, lower abdominal pain, or fever?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, none of those. No burning, no blood, and no fever. My abdomen feels… normal, I suppose. Just the pressure, really. It’s mostly just… annoying and tiring, to be honest. Waking up multiple times a night is quite disruptive. I don’t recall any pain, though. Just the constant urge.
DOCTOR: Alright. No burning, blood, fever, or abdominal pain. Just the persistent urge and nighttime awakenings. Have you experienced anything like this before, or is this a new development?
PATIENT: This is a new development, Doctor. I’ve never had anything quite like this before. I’ve always had a regular bathroom schedule, and never felt this constant pressure. It started maybe… three weeks ago, I would say? It was gradual at first, but it’s become more noticeable in the last week or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, new onset over the past three weeks, becoming more noticeable recently. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t. I'm generally very healthy. I do have Medicare, so I have regular check-ups, and everything has always been normal. My husband and I try to eat well and stay active. I don’t have any diagnoses of any chronic conditions. I’m married, by the way, in case that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know. That’s good to hear you generally have good health. And thank you for mentioning your husband – family history can sometimes be important. Has anyone in your family – mother, sisters, aunts – experienced anything similar, like urinary problems or frequent UTIs?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… My mother had some bladder issues when she was older, but it was more related to… weakening muscles, I think, after having children. She didn't really talk much about it, to be honest. My sisters are both healthy as far as I know, and I don’t recall any urinary problems on either side of the family, no. It wasn't something that was openly discussed, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly. Sometimes these things aren’t discussed openly. And have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven't. I've been very fortunate and haven't needed any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything. Just routine check-ups with my primary care physician, and the occasional flu shot. I’m generally quite healthy, as I mentioned before. I don’t really have much of a medical history, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No prior surgeries or hospitalizations. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I’m not. I try to avoid medication as much as possible. I take a daily multivitamin, just a standard one, but that’s it. No prescriptions, no over-the-counter remedies, nothing at all. I don't have any allergies, either, by the way.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No medications, no allergies. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’d like to figure out what’s causing this, so a physical exam sounds good. Just let me know if it will be uncomfortable in any way.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. I will explain everything as I go, and please stop me if you feel any discomfort at any point. First, I’ll listen to your abdomen, and then I’ll do a brief pelvic exam. I will use a lubricated speculum, and it may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. We’ll also do a quick neurological exam to assess your reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds alright. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. A little pressure is fine, as long as it's not anything too concerning. I trust your expertise. Please let me know if you see anything that’s unusual, or if you think further testing is necessary. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, I’m not feeling any tenderness in your abdomen, and your reflexes are normal. Internally, everything appears normal as well. I don’t feel any masses or abnormalities. However, given your symptoms and the fact that this is a new onset, I'd like to order a urinalysis and a urine culture to rule out a urinary tract infection. I'd also like to check your post-void residual volume to see if you are completely emptying your bladder. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable, Doctor. A urinalysis and urine culture seem like a good idea to rule things out. And checking the residual volume makes sense, too. I want to be thorough, so whatever tests you recommend, I’m happy to do. Hopefully, we can get some answers soon. Where would I go to have those tests done?
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. I’ll write you a referral to the lab at Suburban General Hospital. They are very efficient and will get the results back to me quickly. You’ll need to provide a urine sample, and then the technician will measure your post-void residual volume after you urinate. It's a quick and painless procedure. The results should be available within 24-48 hours. I will review them as soon as I receive them and contact you to discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink your normal amount of fluids. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. That all sounds very clear. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly and for being so patient with me. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and investigate this. I will head to Suburban General Hospital as soon as I can to get the tests done. I’ll look forward to hearing from you with the results. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Creagh. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before I get the results back. I’ll be in touch soon. Have a good day.
