DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pithan. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Pfennig. It’s good to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… coughin’ a lot. Been goin’ on for a while now, and I get tired easy. Seems like I’m always fightin’ a sinus thing too. I just want to get it sorted, if that’s alright. I don’t have a lot of time today, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A cough, fatigue, and sinus issues. We’ll try to be efficient. “A while now” is a bit vague – could you give me a rough estimate of how long you’ve been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let’s see. Probably… six, maybe eight months now? It comes and goes, but it’s been pretty consistent lately. Worse in the winter, naturally, but it hasn’t really gone away completely, even now. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. Six to eight months of consistent symptoms, with worsening in the winter. And it hasn’t fully resolved even now. Is the cough producing any mucus?
PATIENT: Yeah, it is. It’s… well, it’s pretty thick. Sometimes clear, sometimes kinda yellow-ish. Not a ton of it, but enough that I gotta cough it up. Sorry if that’s… graphic. I just figured you’d need to know.
DOCTOR: No, that's perfectly alright, Mr. Pithan. That’s important information. Yellow mucus can indicate a possible infection. Do you have any fever, chills, or body aches that accompany the cough and sinus issues?
PATIENT: Not really. Sometimes a little achy, like after a hard day, but nothing major. No chills, and I haven't taken my temperature, but I don’t feel feverish. Mostly just tired. And this cough keeps me up at night.
DOCTOR: Okay. No fever, chills, or significant body aches, but fatigue and a cough that disrupts sleep. Have you noticed any shortness of breath or wheezing with the cough?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get winded easy, but that’s just… bein’ my age, I guess. Never really wheezed or nothin’. It’s just a… deep cough, mostly. A chest cough. Sorry, I’m probably not explainin’ this very well. I just feel… worn down.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining perfectly fine, Mr. Pithan. It's helpful to get a clear picture. No wheezing or shortness of breath, just fatigue and a deep chest cough. Do you have any pain in your chest?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. Sometimes it’s a little sore from all the coughin’, but not like a sharp pain or anything. Just… irritated, I guess. It’s more of an annoyance than anything. And this tiredness is… really gettin’ to me. I used to be able to get a lot more done.
DOCTOR: Okay, no chest pain, just irritation from coughing. Fatigue is a significant concern. Let’s move on to some other things. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve taken some over-the-counter cough syrup and cold medicine, and those seem okay. I don’t really take much else, to be honest. Simple life, simple medicine, I always say.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you’ve tried some over-the-counter medications with no adverse reactions. Do you have any past medical conditions – things like asthma, COPD, heart problems, diabetes, or anything else that a doctor has previously diagnosed?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, that kinda thing. But nothing serious. I get my blood pressure checked at the pharmacy sometimes, and it’s usually a little high, but nothing they ever really worried about. I try to watch my salt intake. Other than that… pretty healthy, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant past medical history other than childhood illnesses and occasionally elevated blood pressure. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Never been in the hospital. Knock on wood. I try to stay out of those places if I can. Just… not my favorite. So, is this cough something serious, Doctor? I got things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about needing to get back to your routine, Mr. Pithan. We’ll work to figure out what’s going on. No surgeries or hospitalizations is good to know. Now, thinking about your family – do any of your close relatives have a history of lung problems, like COPD, asthma, or lung cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my grandpa on my mother’s side, he smoked his whole life. Had some kinda lung trouble towards the end, I think. But nobody else that I know of. My mom lived to be eighty-five, healthy as a horse, and my dad, he was a rancher, always outdoors. Strong lungs, both of ‘em. I don’t think there’s much of a family history. What do you think it could be, Doctor? This is really draggin’ me down.
DOCTOR: Okay, a smoking history in your maternal grandfather, but otherwise, no significant family history of lung problems. It’s good we’ve covered that. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: Nope, never smoked. Never even tried it. Always thought it was a silly habit. And I don’t drink much, either. Maybe a beer with dinner now and then, but that’s about it. I spend most of my time outdoors, workin' on the land. That’s probably the healthiest thing I do. What about this cough? Is it somethin’ I caught?
DOCTOR: Good to know you have no smoking or drinking history. Spending time outdoors is generally healthy, though we’ll need to consider potential exposures. It could be something you caught, a viral or bacterial infection, but given the length of time you've been experiencing symptoms, we need to explore other possibilities. Do you work with animals or spend time in dusty environments?
PATIENT: I do a little bit of everything on the land. I raise some cattle, so I'm around 'em a lot. And yeah, it gets dusty, especially during hayin' season. I try to wear a mask when I can, but it’s not always practical. I’ve been doin’ this for a long time, though. Never had trouble before. Is this somethin’ I need pills for? I really don’t like takin’ medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay, exposure to cattle and dusty environments is important to note. It's possible this could be related to that. And I understand your reluctance to take medication. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your lungs and get a better idea of what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Alright, fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I got things to do, remember? Just… quick, please. I’m not a fan of doctors, if you don’t mind me sayin’ so. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Pithan. I’ll be as quick and thorough as possible. Please sit up straight and take a deep breath in… and out. Okay, another deep breath… and out. And one more time. I hear some mild wheezing in your lower lungs, and there’s a slight decrease in airflow on both sides. Your heart sounds normal. I also notice some mild congestion in your sinuses when I tap on your forehead. No significant swelling or tenderness. Now, I'd like to check your oxygen saturation with this little clip on your finger.
PATIENT: Okay, wheezin’… that doesn’t sound good. I figured it was somethin’ serious. What does it mean? And what about this oxygen thingy? Is my number low? Just tell me straight, Doctor. I don't need sugarcoat. I got things to do. Is it somethin’ I can fix with some rest and fresh air? I really don't want to take no pills.
DOCTOR: Your oxygen saturation is 92%, which is slightly below normal. A normal reading is usually between 95% and 100%. The mild wheezing and decreased airflow, along with the congestion and slightly low oxygen, suggests some degree of airway obstruction, potentially due to inflammation or narrowing of the airways. It’s unlikely this will resolve on its own with rest alone, Mr. Pithan. The six to eight months of symptoms, combined with your fatigue and low oxygen, indicates we need to investigate further. I’m not saying it’s anything catastrophic, but ignoring this could lead to more serious problems down the line. Given your history and the exam findings, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of your lungs and rule out any underlying conditions like pneumonia or COPD. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A chest X-ray… Great. Just what I needed. More time wasted at the doctor’s office. Fine, whatever. If it gets me back to work faster, I guess I’ll do it. But promise me it won’t take all day. And no pills, right? You said you weren’t sayin’ it was somethin’ catastrophic… is it catchin’? I don’t want to get nobody else sick. And what if it’s somethin’ serious? What then? Just tell me straight, Doctor. No beatin’ around the bush. I’m a simple man, I need simple answers.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Pithan. The X-ray will be quick, and we’ll get the results as soon as possible. Regarding medication, we don’t necessarily need to start pills right now. The X-ray results will help us determine the best course of action. If it’s a simple infection, a short course of antibiotics might be all you need. If it’s something else, we’ll discuss other options. As for it being “catchin’”, it depends on the cause. A bacterial infection is contagious, but other conditions aren't. We’ll know more once we have the X-ray results. And if it is something serious, we’ll discuss all your options, including referrals to a specialist if needed. I want to assure you that we’ll work together to get to the bottom of this and develop a plan that’s right for you. For now, let's focus on getting this X-ray done. I’ll write you a referral order, and you can take it to the radiology department. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Okay, fifteen minutes, alright. I can manage that. Just… don’t want to be stuck in there all day. And no specialist, if you can help it. I don’t trust those fellas. They just wanna run more tests and charge more money. So, X-ray it is. Then what? Do I just wait for a phone call? And what if it’s bad? Tell me honestly, Doctor. Is it somethin’ I should be really worried about? I need to know. I gotta get back to work, you know. I got a ranch to run.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask those questions, Mr. Pithan. I completely understand your concerns. After the X-ray, the radiology department will send the results to me. I’ll review them as soon as I receive them – usually within 24-48 hours – and then I’ll call you to discuss the findings. As for whether it's something to be worried about, it’s too early to say. The X-ray will give us a clearer picture, and we’ll take it from there. It’s possible it's a simple infection, but it’s also important to rule out other possibilities. I assure you, I won’t recommend any unnecessary tests or referrals. And if a specialist is needed, I’ll explain the reasons why and discuss your options with you. Here’s the referral order for the X-ray. The radiology department is located on the second floor, just past the cafeteria. They’ll need your insurance card and photo ID. Once you’ve had the X-ray, just let me know, and I’ll get started on reviewing the results. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you go?
