DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I already told the nice lady at the front desk. This… shaking. It's in my hands. Been happening for a while now, honestly. Not sure why I’m here again, to be frank. Waste of my time, probably.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see a note about the shaking. While it may feel like a waste of time, Mr. Baide, it’s important we investigate any new or concerning symptoms. “A while now” is rather vague, though. Could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Specific? What do you mean, specific? It’s been… months, I guess. Maybe longer. Time flies when you’re old, you know? It just started being noticeable, that’s all. When I try to… hold a glass, mostly. Or write. Which I don't do much of anymore, thankfully. Look, is this going to take long? I have a lunch reservation.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide, and I will try to be as efficient as possible. However, a proper assessment requires some detail. When you say “noticeable,” has it been gradually worsening, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Worsening, I suppose. It's always there, just… sometimes it's worse than others. Like if I'm stressed. Or tired. Though, honestly, what isn't worse when I'm tired? It's just… annoying, that's what it is. I was a producer, you know. Directors need steady hands! Can't be shaking all the time. It doesn’t look good on camera.
DOCTOR: I see. A steady hand is certainly important in your line of work. Now, aside from the shaking, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? What kind of changes? I'm eighty years old, everything's changing! My knees ache, I forget where I put my keys… is that what you want to know? Honestly, I don't keep track of these things. It's just… old age, Doctor. That's all. This tremor, though, it’s new-ish, and it's bothersome. Not debilitating, but irritating. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: It’s good to know you’re aware of these changes, Mr. Baide, and you are right, some changes are expected with age. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. You mentioned knee pain and memory lapses - are those new, or have you been experiencing those for a while as well?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. The knees have been bad for years. Pulled a muscle on set back in '98, never fully recovered. And the memory… well, ask my daughter. She'll tell you I've been forgetting things since… well, a long time. Look, are you going to do anything about this shaking or just ask me about my entire life? I really need to be going. Lunch reservation, remember? I don't want to be late. It's a good Italian place. You probably wouldn't know it.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the thorough questioning, Mr. Baide. It's simply my standard procedure to gather a complete medical history. Now, let's focus on the shaking. Has it spread to other parts of your body besides your hands?
PATIENT: No! Just the hands. Mostly when I try to do something delicate, like… well, anything that requires precision. It's not like it's shaking constantly. It's just… there. Look, is this going to involve needles? Because I hate needles. Truly despise them. And I'm not keen on any tests, if you don’t mind. Waste of time and money, really. Everything's a waste of time these days. .
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Baide. We may not need any invasive procedures, but a brief physical examination would be helpful to assess the tremor and rule out other potential causes. Would you be willing to let me take a look?
