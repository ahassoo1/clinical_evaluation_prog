DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Honcoop. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you. Honcoop is the name. Look, I ain't got all day, so let's get this over with. I need a… a paper. A clearance paper, for somethin’ I wanna get done. It's about my face. A… a cosmetic thing. Don't rightly remember all the details, though. Just need your signature, if that's possible.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Honcoop. I understand you need a clearance for something related to your face. To make sure I can complete that paperwork accurately and safely for you, could you tell me a little more about what you're planning?
PATIENT: Look, lady, I told ya, I don’t remember! It was somethin' to… smooth things out. Wrinkles, maybe? Somethin' like that. A young fella told me about it, said I needed a doctor's say-so. He did all the arrangements, I just need you to sign the paper. Is that so hard? Honestly, I got better things to do than sit here explainin’ every little detail to someone.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Honcoop. It’s not about making things difficult, it's about ensuring your safety. Even if you don’t recall all the specifics, it’s important for me to have some information about the procedure you're considering, and your medical history. Could you at least tell me the name of the young man, or the name of the clinic or practice where you're planning to have this done?
PATIENT: Now you're askin' questions I don't like. Look, I don't go 'round sharin' my business with just anyone. This is my face, and I can do what I want with it. And frankly, I don't see what that young man has to do with your job. I just need the paper signed. Are you gonna do it, or am I wastin' my time? I got things to do, ya know. Important things. This whole thing is just… ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your reluctance to share information, however, without knowing what procedure you're seeking clearance for, I cannot ethically sign the paperwork. It would be irresponsible of me to approve a medical intervention I know nothing about. Even a basic understanding – what type of procedure, the clinic's name – allows me to assess if it’s appropriate for you, given your health. Do you have any allergies or current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good Lord, lady. I’m sixty-four years old, not a child. I've lived a long life, and I know what I'm allergic to. And my health? Fine. Just fine. I work. I climb towers. Doesn’t sound like someone with a laundry list of problems, does it? Look, I ain’t tryin’ to cause trouble. I just need this paper. Are you gonna sign it, or not? I haven’t got all day to sit here and be interrogated. This is absurd. Absolutely absurd. I’m a busy man, and I'm frankly gettin' tired of this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I appreciate you telling me you work and climb towers. That is good information. However, stating you are in good health isn’t the same as me knowing your medical history. I would need to know about any existing conditions, medications you take, or previous surgeries to ensure this procedure won't pose a risk. I understand you're frustrated, but I cannot proceed without some basic medical information. Because you are unwilling to provide any details about the procedure or your health, and given your weight of 52kg with a height of 165cm, I am concerned about potential underlying health issues. I am unable to sign this clearance form. I recommend you consult with a primary care physician for a full evaluation before proceeding with any elective procedures. Would you like me to provide you with a list of local physicians?
PATIENT: Now listen here! You’re questioning my health? You think I don’t know my own body? I’ve been climbin’ those towers for forty years! Forty years! And you, a little lady, are tellin’ me I might have problems? This is an outrage! Absolutely ridiculous! No, I don’t want your list! I’m leavin’. I’ll find someone else. Someone who doesn't insult their patients. Wasting my time, that’s what this has been. A complete waste of time. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Honcoop, I understand your frustration, however, my priority is your wellbeing. I wish you all the best and encourage you to seek a full medical evaluation before proceeding with any procedures. .
