DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi. Nice to meet you too, Doctor. Um… well, I just moved here, and I think I need to, like, get set up with a doctor? I have Medicare, and… I guess I'm supposed to come in? It’s all a bit new.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh, it is a bit of a process getting settled with new insurance and a doctor. We’ll get you all sorted out. So, establishing care is a great first step. To start, let's just go over some general health information and see if there's anything specific you're concerned about. Before we dive into that, do you have any current health problems or things that are bothering you at the moment?
PATIENT: Um… not really? I mean, nothing major. I get tired sometimes, but… doesn't everyone? And my back… it kinda aches after I’ve been working. I do some fixing stuff for work, you know? Mechanical things. But it’s okay, I think. I don't really worry about it. I forget things easily though, if that counts? Like, I had to write down to come here today.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and some back pain after work, and a bit of forgetfulness. That's good information to start with. Let's unpack those a little. When you say tired, is it just feeling generally run down, or is it more like you’re exhausted even after a good night's sleep?
PATIENT: Hmm… it’s kinda both, I think? Like, I can sleep okay, but I still wake up feeling… not really rested. It’s hard to explain. I just… don’t have much energy, even after sleeping. It’s been happening for a while, I guess. Not sure how long. I forget things, remember? So time… is fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Right, time being fuzzy. That's perfectly understandable. So, feeling tired even after sleep, and it's been going on for a while... That does give us something to look into. And you mentioned the back pain is related to work – what kind of fixing do you do, and could you describe the pain a little more?
PATIENT: Um… I work on engines, mostly. Small ones, like for boats and… stuff. And sometimes I have to lift heavy things. The pain… it’s in my lower back. It kinda feels like a dull ache, and it gets worse if I bend over or twist. It doesn’t hurt all the time, just after I’ve been working hard. And if I sit for too long. It’s… just annoying, really. I usually just take some… I think it's called ibuprofen? It helps a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lower back pain with engine work, lifting, bending, and sitting, relieved somewhat by ibuprofen. Good to know. Now, just to get a broader picture, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and back pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I… sometimes I get headaches. Not really bad ones, just… there. And I think I've been a little more… clumsy lately? I dropped a wrench the other day, and I never drop wrenches. It’s silly, I know. And… I don't know. Sometimes I feel kinda… down? Like, not really sad, just… not happy. It comes and goes. Oh! And my hands get cold easily. Even inside. Is that something?
DOCTOR: Okay, headaches, clumsiness, feeling down, and cold hands. Those are all helpful things to know, Emileigh. Let's talk about your medical history a bit. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of? I mean, I went to a doctor back home, but it was… a long time ago. I think they just gave me shots when I was a kid. I don’t really remember. My mom… she always took me. She’s gone now. And… I don't think I’ve ever been told I have anything wrong with me. Does that make sense? I'm kinda bad at remembering things like that. I just feel tired.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Emileigh. It's perfectly alright if you don't have a clear medical history. We'll work with what you remember. And it's understandable that it's hard to recall details. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, never. I haven't had any surgeries, and I’ve never been in the hospital. Not even when I was little. I broke my arm once, but my mom just took me to the doctor and they put a cast on it. That was all. I think. I'm pretty sure. I’m really bad at remembering stuff before… well, a little while ago. Does that make sense? I just feel a bit confused sometimes.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Emileigh. It sounds like you haven’t had any major medical interventions. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Um… that’s hard. My mom… she had headaches a lot. And… I think my grandpa, on my dad's side, had something with his heart? But I don't really know. My dad wasn't around much, and my mom didn’t talk about family stuff much. It’s all a bit… fuzzy. I’m sorry, I wish I could tell you more. I just… don't really remember. I feel bad I can't be more help.
DOCTOR: You’re doing great, Emileigh. Don't apologize at all. It’s perfectly alright that you don't have a detailed family history. We'll work with what you know. Now, just a few more questions, and then I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Um… just the ibuprofen sometimes, for my back. And… I take a multivitamin, every now and then. I forget to take it a lot, though. I think that's it? Oh! And I drink a lot of coffee. Does that count? I need it to stay awake. But that’s not a medicine, right?
DOCTOR: Coffee doesn't count as medicine, though it certainly feels like it sometimes! Okay, so ibuprofen occasionally for back pain and a multivitamin sometimes. And are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of? I’ve never had a really bad reaction to anything. I’m pretty sure. I mean, I get itchy sometimes, but I just thought that was the bug bites. We have a lot of bugs where I used to live. And… I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. But I can't really remember. Sorry. I just feel… I feel like I’m forgetting things again. Is that bad? I’m sorry to be such a mess.
DOCTOR: You're not a mess at all, Emileigh. It's perfectly alright to feel a little unsure, and it’s good you're being honest about your memory. We'll take things slowly. Okay, let's move on to a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. Just a routine check-up. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Um… okay. That sounds… okay. I guess. As long as it doesn't take too long? And… it won't hurt, right? I don't really like being poked and prodded. I just… get nervous. Is that okay? I'm sorry. I feel like I'm being a bother.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, it won't hurt, I promise. It’s a very quick and gentle exam. And you’re not a bother at all – it’s my job to make you feel comfortable. We'll go as slow as you need, and if you feel uncomfortable at any point, just let me know, and we’ll stop. Great. Okay, if you could just sit up straight for me… and I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay… I’m trying to breathe normally. It’s… hard to relax when you’re nervous. I think I’m breathing too fast. Is that bad? I just… I don't like doctors very much. I just want to get this over with. Sorry. I’m just… jittery.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It’s normal to feel nervous. I’m just listening to your heart and lungs. Everything sounds… a little fast, but otherwise clear. Okay, everything sounds okay so far. Now, let's just check your blood pressure and pulse.
PATIENT: Okay… is that cuff tight? It feels a little tight. And… it’s squeezing. I don’t like squeezing. I just want it to be over with. Sorry. I’m just… anxious. Is my blood pressure high? That’s what my mom used to worry about. But I don’t remember. I'm forgetting everything again.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but that's very common when you're feeling anxious. It’s nothing to worry about right now. It’s likely just a temporary increase. Your pulse is a little fast, which again is likely due to your anxiety. Now, let's just have a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat, if you're comfortable with that. It will just be a quick glance.
PATIENT: Oh… that light is bright. And… is that going inside my ear? I don't really like things going inside my ear. I get… weird feelings. Is it cold? I just… I don't like it. I’m sorry. I’m being a mess again. Can we just… skip that part? I just want this to be over with. I’m getting really nervous.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Emileigh. We can definitely skip that part. You are not being a mess. It’s completely alright to feel uncomfortable, and we’ll do whatever makes you feel safest. Okay, let's just stop there for the physical exam. It sounds like you’re feeling quite anxious, and that's perfectly understandable. So, to summarise, you've been feeling tired, with some back pain, headaches, clumsiness, cold hands, and forgetfulness. Your pulse and blood pressure are a little elevated, likely due to anxiety. We've established you haven't had any major surgeries or hospitalizations, and you’re not currently taking many medications. Now, based on everything you've told me, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. The tiredness and forgetfulness could be related to stress or mild anxiety, but we should also rule out any underlying medical causes. The headaches and cold hands could be related to stress as well, but again, we'll want to investigate further. Do you have any thoughts on what might be causing this?
PATIENT: Um… I don't know. I just moved here, and I'm… lonely, I guess? I left everything behind. My friends, my job… everything. And I’m worried about finding a new job. And I miss my mom. I just feel… lost. And I keep forgetting things. It's scary. I don’t even know why I'm forgetting things. I feel like my brain isn't working right. Is that stupid? I'm probably just overthinking it. I just… don't know what's happening. Sorry. I'm rambling again. I just feel overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Emileigh. It's perfectly understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed. Moving to a new place, leaving everything behind, and missing your mom – that’s a huge adjustment, and it’s completely normal to feel lost and anxious. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like a lot of this could be related to stress and adjustment disorder. However, we can’t rule out other possibilities. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood work to check for things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other potential causes for your symptoms. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Blood work… is that going to hurt? I don’t like needles. But… if it helps figure things out, I guess. I just… I don't want anything to be seriously wrong. I just want to feel normal again. I want to remember things. And I want to stop feeling so tired all the time. Okay… blood work is fine. If you think it’s necessary. Just… try to be quick, okay? And… can I bring someone with me next time? I don’t really like being alone for things like this. Sorry. I’m being a bother again.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely not a bother, Emileigh. And yes, you can definitely bring someone with you next time. That's a great idea, and I encourage it. The blood work will just be a quick prick, and it shouldn’t hurt too much. It's a standard procedure, and the nurses are very good at it. Okay, I’m going to write you a lab order now. You can go to any lab that accepts your insurance. I'll also give you a list of some local labs. Once you've had the blood work done, they’ll send the results to me, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a low-dose anti-anxiety medication. It may help with your sleep and overall anxiety levels. We'll start with a low dose and see how you respond. I also want to recommend some resources for dealing with stress and adjustment to a new place. There are some local support groups and counseling services that may be helpful. I'll give you a list of those as well. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Um… lots of questions, probably. But… I don’t even know where to start. What kind of side effects does the medication have? And… how long will it take to work? And… what if it doesn't work? I just… I’m scared to try new things. What if they make things worse? And… the blood work… how long will that take? And… will I have to fast? I just… I'm getting confused again. Sorry. I just feel… anxious. I just want this to be over with. And… thank you. For being patient with me. Sorry. I’m rambling again.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed and have lots of questions. Let’s take them one at a time. The medication I’m prescribing is a low dose, and the side effects are usually mild, if any. Some people experience slight drowsiness or dizziness, but those usually go away within a few days. It may take a few weeks to feel the full effect of the medication. If it doesn't work, we can adjust the dose or try a different medication. We'll work together to find what's best for you. Regarding the blood work, you don’t need to fast. The lab will just need a small sample of your blood, and it shouldn’t take long. It should be in and out within 30 minutes. And you're absolutely not rambling. You're asking good questions, and it's important that you feel comfortable with everything. I want you to know that I'm here to support you through this. We'll take things slowly, and we'll work together to find what's best for you. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. For now. I just… I’m scared. But… I guess I have to try something. Thank you. For being so patient. And… for not judging me. I just… I’m not used to people being nice to me. Sorry. I’m rambling again. Okay… I’ll try to get the blood work done tomorrow. And… I’ll take the medication. Thank you. Really.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Emileigh. And you don’t need to apologize for anything. I’m glad you’re willing to try. Remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And please, take care of yourself. Have a good day, Emileigh. And I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
