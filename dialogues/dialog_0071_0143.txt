DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verrall, good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Um… well, it’s a bit… complicated. My… someone I care about, she’s thinking about having a baby. And I thought… maybe I should check if I am okay for that? It’s… a bit of a worry, you see. I’m not so young anymore.
DOCTOR: I see. That’s very thoughtful of you, Mr. Verrall. It is wise to consider your health when planning something like that. So, just to clarify, you’re wanting a general check-up to see if you’re fit for… potential parenthood?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Fit… yes, that’s a good word. I don’t… I don’t remember the last time I had a proper check-up. Everything is a bit… fuzzy these days. I just want to be sure I can… be a good… support. And not cause any problems.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll get everything checked out. “Fuzzy” is perfectly alright, Mr. Verrall – it happens. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems… anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. High blood pressure… the doctor said something once, a long time ago. I think. Maybe? I was living in… somewhere else then. I don’t really remember taking any pills for it. And… no, not diabetes, I don’t think. My father had something with his… his stomach, but not me. Everything is so long ago, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, possible history of high blood pressure, but no current medications and no diabetes. That’s helpful. And how about any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, that I remember. And… oh, yes! A small thing on my leg, years ago. A… a growth, they called it. Nothing big. They took it off and I was fine. That was… a long time ago, though. Before I came to this country, I think.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy and a small growth removed from the leg. Okay. Now, thinking about your family… are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Significant… hmm. My mother, she had trouble with her heart. It got bad when she was older. And my father… like I said, his stomach. He was always complaining about it. And… my sister, she had something with her… her nerves, I think. Always very worried, she was. I don't know what it was called. It wasn't… catching, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so family history of heart trouble, stomach issues, and possible nerve condition in your sister. That gives us something to work with. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle… Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no drugs. Never. Smoking… I used to, when I was young, a very long time ago. Stopped years and years ago. And… a little bit of wine, sometimes. With dinner. Not every day, though. Just… a small glass. I don't drink beer, it doesn’t agree with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, former smoker, occasional small glass of wine. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I don’t like taking pills. Always worried about the side effects, you see. Just… nothing. I try to eat healthy, mostly. But I forget sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, no current medications. That simplifies things. Now, Mr. Verrall, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and a few other basic things. It shouldn’t take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment. Just… don't make it too complicated, please? My… my memory isn’t what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Verrall. Nothing complicated at all. Just a routine check-up. If you could just have a seat here on the table, we’ll get started. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly… muffled. Could be normal for your age, but we’ll want to keep an eye on it. Lungs are clear, good breath sounds. Blood pressure is 145/90. A little elevated. Okay, Mr. Verrall, blood pressure is a bit high, as is your weight. At 141 lbs and 5’5”, that puts your BMI at 24.7. That is borderline overweight. Do you have any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. Sometimes, yes. Especially at the end of the day. I thought it was just… old age, you see. I sit a lot, working. Sales… it’s a lot of sitting. And I don't exercise, I'm afraid. I used to walk more, but… my knees aren’t so good anymore. They ache sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, occasional ankle swelling and knee pain. We’ll need to investigate that a little further. Now, just a quick look in your ears, nose and throat. Open your mouth and say "Ahhh." Throat looks clear. And your ears look fine as well. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Everything seems generally okay, Mr. Verrall, but your blood pressure is definitely something we need to address. And we’ll want to get some blood work done to get a better picture of your overall health. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds sensible. Blood work… fine. Anything that will help. Just… don’t tell me too much detail, please? I get worried easily, you see. And I forget things. Just tell me… what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Verrall. I’ll keep it simple. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. This will give us a good baseline. I’m also going to order a urinalysis. We’ll need a urine sample for that. The nurse will give you a cup when we’re done. In the meantime, I recommend we start with some lifestyle changes. Try to reduce your salt intake, and increase your physical activity – even a short walk each day can make a difference. And while a small glass of wine is probably fine, it’s best to limit alcohol consumption. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, I think so. Less salt… I can try. More walking… that will be harder, with my knees. But I’ll try. And less wine… yes, I can definitely do that. It’s just… everything feels a bit overwhelming, you see? I just want to be sure… everything will be alright. For… for her.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Verrall. It is a lot to take in, but you’re taking the right steps by coming in for a check-up. We’ll take it one step at a time. I’ll explain everything clearly, and we’ll work together. I’m going to schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to review the blood work results. The nurse will set that up for you. For now, focus on those lifestyle changes. And please, don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very good, Doctor. Thank you. Two weeks… I’ll remember that. And I’ll try to walk more. And less salt. And… thank you again. It’s… a relief, talking to you. I think… I think that’s all I can remember for now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verrall. That’s perfectly alright. We’ll take things at your pace. The nurse will come in shortly to get your urine sample and schedule your follow-up appointment. And remember, don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up. Take care of yourself, and we’ll see you in two weeks.
PATIENT: .
