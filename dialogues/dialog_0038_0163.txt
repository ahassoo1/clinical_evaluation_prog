DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to make your acquaintance as well. Well, it’s rather…embarrassing, actually. I’ve gotten myself into a bit of a mess with one of these newfangled diets, and my daughter insisted I come and have someone sensible take a look at things. It involves a lot of…cabbage water, if you can believe it.
DOCTOR: Cabbage water, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, quite. And very little else, for a rather extended period. I read about it online – a complete detox, apparently. One simply must cleanse, you see. My late wife always said I worried too much about my health, but I felt I needed a bit of a…reset. It sounded terribly efficient, and I do appreciate efficiency. Though, in retrospect, perhaps I didn’t fully consider the…ramifications. I'm starting to feel rather weak, and my daughter, bless her heart, is quite insistent I seek professional advice.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. A bit of a cleanse gone awry. And you’re feeling weak as a result. Can you tell me a little more about how long you've been on this cabbage water diet?
PATIENT: Precisely. “Awry” is a very diplomatic way of putting it, Doctor. It’s been…let me see…eighteen days, I believe. Started on the 15th of July. Eighteen days of mostly just…the water. A small piece of grilled fish now and then, purely to prevent scurvy, my daughter pointed out. She’s remarkably thorough, that one. And a single apple, on Wednesdays. It felt…disciplined, you see. A proper regimen. Though, the lack of…substance is beginning to take its toll. I’m afraid I’ve lost quite a bit of weight, and I’m feeling…rather foggy, if you understand what I mean. Not quite myself at all.
DOCTOR: Right, eighteen days on a very restricted diet. And you've noticed weight loss and some mental fogginess. Okay. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Well, yes, now that you mention it. My digestion…isn’t quite what it used to be, naturally. Rather…unpredictable, shall we say. And I've found myself quite tired. Not merely a pleasant tiredness, but a deep, bone-weary fatigue. It takes a considerable effort to even walk to the garden now, and I used to potter about there for hours. Also, my hands…they tremble a little. Not constantly, but frequently enough to be noticeable. And I've been feeling rather…cold, despite the rather pleasant summer we’re having. I haven’t taken my temperature, mind you. I leave that sort of thing to my daughter. She’s the practical one, as I said.
DOCTOR: Okay, so unpredictable digestion, fatigue, tremors in your hands, and feeling cold. That’s quite a bit. Have you noticed any dizziness or lightheadedness?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. That's a very good question, Doctor. I have been feeling rather…off-balance at times. It’s not a constant spinning sensation, more of a…wooziness, if you understand. It happens when I stand up quickly, usually. I simply assumed it was due to my age, to be honest. One expects a certain amount of…unsteadiness at eighty-five. But now that you ask, it seems rather more frequent than usual. And I had a rather alarming moment yesterday when I nearly stumbled while walking the dog. Fortunately, he’s a rather sturdy fellow and provided some…stabilisation. A very sensible dog, that one.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. Dizziness when standing, especially, is something we need to look into. And the tremors, fatigue, and weight loss are also concerning, especially with this restrictive diet. To get a better understanding, would you mind if I take a look at your medical history?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Please do. I keep it all meticulously organised, you see. My late wife was a nurse, and she instilled in me the importance of a thorough record. It's all in that folder – chronologically arranged, naturally. Allergies are on page three, previous surgeries on page seven, and I’ve included a list of all current medications, though it’s rather short, as you’ll see. Mostly just a mild blood pressure tablet. I’ve also included a note from my daughter detailing my recent…dietary indiscretion. She’s very thorough, as I mentioned. Do let me know if anything is unclear.
DOCTOR: Right, let's see. Blood pressure medication, no known allergies… and here’s your daughter’s note detailing the cabbage water diet. Eighteen days… right. It looks like your blood pressure has been generally well-controlled. Now, before we go any further, would you mind if I just quickly listen to your heart and lungs, and check your pulse and blood pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. My late wife always said a good listening is half the battle. And I trust your judgment implicitly. Do take your time. I haven't been prodded and poked in quite some time, and I’m rather enjoying the attention, to be honest. It's a bit like being a particularly uninteresting specimen, isn't it? But a necessary one, I suppose. Please, proceed.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Vantine, take a nice deep breath for me… and again… Good. Your heart sounds a little fast, actually, and your blood pressure is quite low. Pulse is 98, and blood pressure is 108/62. That's lower than we'd like to see. Now, could you stand up slowly for me?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I shall endeavour to do so with all due caution. Did that meet with your approval? I do feel a bit…lightheaded, but that’s hardly surprising, given my recent…regimen. And the lack of sustenance. It’s rather like being a particularly wilted flower, isn’t it? But a resilient one, I hope. Do let me know if you require further…calisthenics.
DOCTOR: Yes, that was good. Thank you. Now, let me check your orthostatic blood pressure – that means checking it again while you’re standing. Alright… your blood pressure dropped quite significantly when you stood up – down to 90/50. That confirms orthostatic hypotension – a drop in blood pressure upon standing. This, combined with your symptoms of dizziness, fatigue, and the restrictive diet, is concerning. We need to rule out dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. I think we should do some blood work – a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count – to get a better picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Dehydration and…electrolyte imbalances? Oh dear. That sounds rather…technical, doesn’t it? But yes, Doctor, if that is what is required to ascertain the extent of my…predicament, then please do proceed. My daughter will be immensely relieved to know you are taking such a thorough approach. She’s been fretting over me constantly, you see. And frankly, I’m rather tired of feeling like a particularly frail antique. So, yes, blood work sounds…sensible. And do let me know if there is anything I should…abstain from beforehand. Aside from cabbage water, naturally. That is firmly off the menu.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No need to abstain from anything specifically, just come in on an empty stomach if possible. We'll get those labs ordered right away. In the meantime, it’s really important you rehydrate. I recommend sipping on fluids throughout the day – water, broth, even a diluted electrolyte solution. Avoid anything caffeinated or alcoholic. We need to get your blood pressure back up and stabilize things. And please, no more cabbage water. I'm also going to recommend a small, easily digestible snack – maybe some crackers or toast – just to get a little something in your system. Do you think you could manage that?
PATIENT: Most certainly, Doctor. Crackers or toast sounds… eminently sensible. And I shall adhere to your instructions regarding fluids with the utmost diligence. No more cabbage water, I promise you. The very thought of it now…is rather unappealing. My daughter will be delighted to hear I’m finally taking your advice seriously. She’s been warning me about the dangers of “extreme cleansing” for weeks. And frankly, I’m rather grateful for her…nagging, at this point. So, yes, crackers and fluids it is. And I shall endeavor to remain horizontal for the majority of the afternoon. Is there anything else I should be doing, or avoiding, besides the aforementioned…dietary indiscretions? Perhaps avoiding steep hills?
DOCTOR: Avoiding steep hills is a very good idea, yes. For now, just focus on rehydrating, getting a little bit of nutrition back in, and resting. Avoid any strenuous activity. Once we get the lab results back, we'll have a better idea of what's going on and can tailor a plan specifically for you. I'll have my nurse come in and draw the blood, and then we'll get those results back as quickly as possible. In the meantime, if you feel significantly worse – increased dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, perfectly. Rehydration, gentle nourishment, rest, and avoidance of steep inclines. And emergency room attendance should the situation deteriorate. A rather comprehensive list, actually. My late wife would be immensely proud of my newfound adherence to medical advice. And I shall endeavor to follow it with the utmost diligence. Although, frankly, the thought of the emergency room is rather…unappealing. But a necessary precaution, I suppose. So, yes, I understand completely. And I shall await your results with…patient anticipation. Is there anything else I should be aware of, or any questions I should be asking? Perhaps the optimal angle for reclining?
DOCTOR: The optimal angle for reclining is a matter of personal preference, Mr. Vantine! As long as you’re comfortable and not putting undue strain on your body. I think we’ve covered everything for now. My nurse, Sarah, will be in shortly to draw your blood. She's very gentle, and will explain everything to you. Just focus on resting and rehydrating, and we’ll get these results back as soon as possible. I’ll give you a call with the results as soon as they're in. Do you have any questions for me before Sarah arrives?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you have covered everything with admirable thoroughness. And I shall await Sarah’s arrival with…resigned anticipation. It's rather like being a particularly delicate specimen under examination, isn’t it? But a necessary one, I suppose. And I trust her gentle touch. So, no, I have no further questions at this juncture. Thank you for your time and attention, Doctor. And please, do extend your regards to Sarah. I believe I shall simply…recline now. And await the inevitable.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Vantine. You rest now. I'll let Sarah know you're ready. And I’ll be in touch as soon as we have the results. Don’t hesitate to call if anything changes or if you have any concerns. .
PATIENT: .
