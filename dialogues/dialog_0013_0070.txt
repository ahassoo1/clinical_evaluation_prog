DOCTOR: Hi Kile, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello. Yes, good to meet you too. I… just moved here. New area, you know? Need someone for… the old people things. Medicare, and all that. Not feeling bad, just… checking. It’s good to have a doctor when you get… this age.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly understandable. It is smart to establish care when you're settling into a new place. And absolutely, preventative care is a great idea. So, just to be clear, you’re not experiencing any specific symptoms or feeling unwell currently – you’re mainly looking to get a baseline check-up since you're new to the area and have Medicare?
PATIENT: Baseline… yes, that sounds right. No aches, no pains, nothing broken. Just… old. You know? I work with the… faces. Makeup, for the theatre. Lots of young people, very dramatic. I need someone to make sure… everything works. I forget things these days, so maybe you check that too? If that's okay.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, that's perfectly fine. We can definitely assess your overall function, including memory. It's very common to experience some cognitive changes with age, and it’s good to have a starting point. So, just to get a better picture, when did you move here?
PATIENT: Move… hmm. Not long ago. Maybe… two months? Three? It's all a blur. From… a little town. Far away. Lots of snow. I left… a wife. Divorced. A long time ago, but… still makes things blurry. Does it matter where I was? I just need… a check-up.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t necessarily matter where you were, but knowing your history helps me get a complete picture. Knowing about major life events like a divorce can sometimes provide context. Okay, so about two or three months ago, you moved here from a colder climate. And you mentioned working with theatre makeup – is that full-time?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, theatre. Mostly. Sometimes weddings. The young girls… they want to look… perfect. It keeps me busy. Full-time… mostly. I used to do bigger things, but… the snow, and… everything. It's enough work now. I don't need fancy. Just need… someone to poke around and make sure I haven’t fallen apart.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And it sounds like you’re still active, which is excellent. Let's do a quick review of your medical history then, if you don’t mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, the history… Doctors always want the history. Not much to tell, really. High blood pressure… maybe, a long time ago. The old doctor gave me pills. I stopped taking them. They made me… tired. Everything else… no. Never broken anything important. Just… old. The usual old things. Aches, and… forgetting.
DOCTOR: Alright, so high blood pressure in the past, treated with medication you discontinued due to fatigue. We'll definitely want to check your current blood pressure today. Have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. My tonsils. When I was a boy. And… something on my leg. A long time ago. A scrape, I think. The doctor cut it open and… stitched it up. Small thing. Not important. Everything else is just… bumps and bruises from life, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils as a child and a minor leg surgery. Good to know. Now, regarding medications, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Vitamins? Maybe. The wife used to buy them. Little pills. Orange ones. I don't remember. I stopped taking them when… well, when everything stopped. Nothing else. No pills for aches, no heart stuff. Just… hoping for the best. And trying not to fall apart.
DOCTOR: Okay, so possibly some vitamins in the past, but nothing currently. We'll make a note of that. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Dust, maybe. Makes me sneeze. And… sometimes the young girls’ perfume. Too strong. But not a real allergy. I don't swell up, I just… cough. Nothing serious. No pills make me sick. I used to be allergic to… something when I was a boy, but I forgot. Old age, you know? Everything gets… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Right, dust and strong perfumes – noted. It sounds like those are more sensitivities than true allergies. Okay, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, or dementia?
PATIENT: Family… That’s… a long story. My mother… she got… weak. Old age. Something with her heart, I think. My father… he worked in the snow, very hard. He got sick, but I don't remember what. Cancer, maybe? Lots of coughing. They all… just got old. And died. It’s what happens. Not much to tell you, really. Everyone just fades away.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of heart problems and possible cancer in your family, with general decline due to old age. That’s helpful to know. Now, to get a baseline, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam… yes, fine. Just don’t poke too hard. I’m a delicate flower, you know. Used to working with the pretty girls, not with… instruments. Quick is good. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be gentle. We'll start with your height and weight, then listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a basic neurological assessment. If you could step over here when you’re ready. First, let’s get your height and weight. You said you’re 160cm, is that correct?
PATIENT: Hmm… 160, yes. Maybe. It’s been a long time since anyone measured me. I'm… shrinking, you know? It's what happens when you get old. Don’t make a fuss if it's less. Just… quick, please.
DOCTOR: No fuss at all. Okay, it's actually 158 centimeters. And your weight is 128 pounds. That gives you a BMI of… …25.8, which puts you in the overweight category. We can discuss that later if you’d like. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Overweight? I’m not fat. Just… solid. Like a good Russian. All the bones. And… history. Listen to the heart, yes? Quick, please. It doesn’t beat so strong anymore. Like a little bird.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's listen. Your heart sounds are regular, but a little bit muffled. I hear some slight crackling in your lower lungs, which could indicate some congestion. Nothing too alarming at this point, but we'll want to keep an eye on it. Now, let's check your reflexes. Can you sit here, and I’ll test your knees?
PATIENT: Crackling? What does that mean? Is something broken? Like a little bird with a broken wing? I told you I'm old. Everything is falling apart. Do it quick, and be gentle. I need my legs for the makeup, you know. Pretty girls need good legs.
DOCTOR: It just means there's a little bit of fluid in your lungs, which is common with age and can be caused by many things. It doesn't mean anything is broken, and it's likely not serious at this point. We can look into it further if needed. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, which is also normal with age. Now, I want to do a quick memory check. Can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Date… hmm. August… …the second? Or is it the first? Everything is blurring together these days. It's a Tuesday, I think. Or maybe Wednesday? The days… they all feel the same.
DOCTOR: Okay, today is August 2nd, 2025. That's perfectly alright that it's a bit difficult to recall. Now, can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Words? What kind of words? I'm not so good with words. I work with faces, not… talking. But alright. Say the words. Quick now. Before I forget.
DOCTOR: No pressure at all. The words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Please try to remember them. I’ll ask you to repeat them in a few minutes. Now, let’s just go over a few more basic questions. Have you experienced any changes in your vision or hearing recently?
PATIENT: Vision… Everything is a bit blurry, yes. Like looking through a fog. And the ears… not so good. I have to ask people to repeat themselves. Mostly the young girls, they talk so fast. They whisper. It’s better to just… look at the faces. It’s easier.
DOCTOR: Alright, some changes in vision and hearing, as expected with age. Do you experience any dizziness or balance problems?
PATIENT: Dizziness… hmm. Sometimes. When I stand up too fast. Like the world is… tilting. Not often, just… sometimes. I hold onto the wall. Old age, you know? Everything… unstable. Like a little bird in the wind.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional dizziness upon standing. Now, I’d like to quickly check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148/92. That is slightly elevated. We should keep an eye on that, and discuss some lifestyle modifications or potentially medication if it remains high. Do you have any questions for me so far?
PATIENT: 148… what does that mean? High? Is something broken in the pressure machine? I told you I’m old. Everything is… failing. Medication? I don't like pills. They make me tired. I just want to be checked, not… fixed. And the bird… is it still broken?
DOCTOR: It just means your blood pressure is a little bit higher than the ideal range. It doesn't mean anything is broken, and it’s quite common at your age. We don’t have to “fix” anything right away. It simply means we need to be aware of it and make some small changes to potentially lower it, like watching your salt intake and getting regular exercise. We can discuss medication if needed, but it's not the first step. And no, the bird isn’t broken! I was just using that as an example to describe how things can feel when you're experiencing some dizziness or balance problems. Everything feels a little unstable, like a little bird in the wind. Now, let's go back to those three words I asked you to remember: Apple, Table, Penny. Do you recall any of them?
PATIENT: Words… Apple… yes. I think. Something round. Red. But… the others? Table… maybe? It had legs. But Penny… no. The fog is too thick. Everything is… lost. Just… apple. One word. Is that good enough? I'm an old man, not a memory machine.
DOCTOR: Apple is excellent! It’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember the others. Memory can be affected by many things, and it's normal to have some difficulty recalling things at your age. Okay, to summarize, you've reported some changes in vision and hearing, occasional dizziness, and a slightly elevated blood pressure. We've also established a history of high blood pressure in the past, and a bit of difficulty with short-term memory. I recommend we schedule a follow-up appointment in one month to recheck your blood pressure and discuss some lifestyle modifications, like reducing your salt intake, staying hydrated, and getting regular, gentle exercise. I’d also like to order some basic blood work to rule out any underlying issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood work… more poking? And another appointment? Fine. But quick, please. I have pretty girls waiting. And no needles, if you can help it. Just… get it over with. The less poking, the better. And remember, no pills unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. We’ll keep everything as quick and comfortable as possible. We’ll just need a small blood sample for routine testing. No pills are required at this time. We can always discuss them if your blood pressure remains elevated during the follow-up appointment. I’ll have the nurse schedule your follow-up appointment and draw your blood before you leave. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms—like chest pain, shortness of breath, or sudden dizziness—please don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions or concerns for me today?
PATIENT: No. No more questions. Just… let me go. The pretty girls… they need their makeup. And I need a nap. A long nap. And no poking. Please. Just… thank you. I think.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome. I'll have the nurse come in to schedule your follow-up and assist you. And don’t worry, we'll try to keep everything as quick and gentle as possible. Have a good day, Kile. And get that nap.
