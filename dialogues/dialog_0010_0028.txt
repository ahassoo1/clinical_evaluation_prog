DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Annesley. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away, and my heart… it hasn’t been feeling the best lately either. It feels a bit…fluttery sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough and some heart palpitations. Let's start with the cough. How long have you had the cough, Ms. Sadhu?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it’s been… about three weeks now, I’d say. Maybe a little longer. It started mild, just a tickle in my throat, but it’s gotten worse. Especially at night. It keeps me up.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, getting worse, worse at night… and is the cough producing anything – any mucus, or is it dry?
PATIENT: It does bring up some stuff, yes. It’s… clear, mostly. Sometimes a little bit… white. Not much, though. It’s not a productive cough, if that makes sense. Mostly just makes my chest feel tight.
DOCTOR: It does sound like it's become more than just a tickle. And you mentioned your heart feeling fluttery. Can you describe that feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, it’s hard to explain. It’s not pain, exactly. More like… skipping a beat, or like it’s racing for a moment. Then it settles down. It happens when I’m walking, mostly, or if I climb the stairs. Not when I'm resting. It worries me a bit, because… well, the doctor before you, Dr. Ramirez, he told me I have some trouble with my heart. Something about it not pumping as strong as it should. I don't remember all the details.
DOCTOR: Okay, palpitations brought on by exertion, and a history of some heart trouble mentioned by Dr. Ramirez… I’m going to make a note of that. Do you recall when Dr. Ramirez told you about this heart issue, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it must have been… five years ago, maybe six? He did some tests, an EKG, I think. And then he put me on some medicine. A little white pill. I've been taking it ever since, religiously. I can tell you the name, if that helps. It's… Furosemide. Yes, that's it. Furosemide.
DOCTOR: Furosemide, good. We’ll definitely check that. And are you taking any other medications or vitamins, Ms. Sadhu?
PATIENT: Just the Furosemide, Doctor. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I’ll take some ibuprofen. But not every day. Only when I really need it. I try to avoid it, though, it bothers my stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, so Furosemide regularly, ibuprofen as needed. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything, tried everything, in my eighty-nine years! Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I'm a pretty sturdy Salvadoran woman, you know. We eat a lot of spices!
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history, aside from what Dr. Ramirez mentioned. Have you had any other significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my gallbladder out, oh, must be twenty years ago now. And I broke my wrist a few years back when I tripped on the rug. Nothing major, though. Mostly just aches and pains from getting old, you know? I had the flu a couple of times, but nothing serious enough to go to the hospital. And…oh! I had pneumonia when I was younger, maybe in my fifties. That was bad, I was very sick then. But I recovered fully.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, broken wrist, pneumonia in the past… and no other major illnesses. And how about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother, she lived a long life, almost ninety-five. She had high blood pressure, but that was it. My father… he had some trouble with his heart too, I think. He died when I was young, though, so I don’t remember the details very well. And I have three children, all grown up now. They’re all healthy, as far as I know. My son, Carlos, he has diabetes, but he manages it with medicine.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart trouble and diabetes. And finally, Ms. Sadhu, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband, he used to smoke, but I made him quit years ago. And I don’t drink alcohol either. A little bit of wine with dinner sometimes, when I was younger, but not anymore. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not! I'm a God-fearing woman, Doctor. I've lived a good, honest life.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Go right ahead. I'm used to doctors poking and prodding! Just be gentle, my bones are a little brittle these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Sadhu, take a deep breath for me… and another one… good. I’m hearing some crackles in your lungs, mostly at the base of your right lung. And your heart rate is a little irregular. I also note some mild edema in your ankles. Blood pressure is 140/90. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a better look at your lungs and heart. And I’m also going to order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel to check your overall health. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Crackles, you say? In my lungs? Is that bad? And the EKG… will that show what’s going on with my heart? I’m a little worried now, I must admit. Is this serious?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re telling me how you feel, Ms. Sadhu. The crackles can indicate fluid in the lungs, which is why we want to get the X-ray. And the EKG will give us a detailed picture of your heart’s rhythm and any potential problems. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s important to investigate, especially given your history and symptoms. We’ll get the results back quickly, usually within a few hours. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a diuretic to help with the fluid buildup, just as a precaution. And I want you to avoid salty foods and limit your fluid intake to about six cups a day. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes sense. A diuretic… so something to help get rid of the water. Six cups… that’s not too bad. No salty foods… I can do that. My daughter, Elena, she’s always telling me I add too much salt anyway. So, what about the medicine I’m already taking? The Furosemide? Should I keep taking that, or stop?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Ms. Sadhu. We’ll continue the Furosemide for now, but I want to review the dosage after we get the results of the tests. It's possible we may need to adjust it. The X-ray and EKG will help us determine that. We are going to take things one step at a time. Right now, let's focus on getting these tests done. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. Do you have any questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and not dismissing my worries. It’s… comforting to know someone is taking this seriously. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sadhu. That’s my job. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. I’ll come back to discuss the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, like shortness of breath or chest pain. The nurse will be with you shortly. Have a good day.
