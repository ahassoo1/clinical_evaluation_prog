DOCTOR: Well, good morning, Melvenia. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… these forms. They want me to get them notarized, something about verifying my health stuff. I just… I don’t really understand all the paperwork, and I figured it’d be easier to have someone explain it while I’m here. I hope that’s alright.
DOCTOR: Notarized paperwork… Honestly, the administrative side of things is a mess these days. Alright, let's see… It looks like these are for some sort of assistance program, possibly housing. And they need verification of your medical history. It's standard, though incredibly inconvenient. Now, before we get bogged down in these documents, tell me – besides needing these forms filled out, is there anything you are experiencing health-wise that I should know about?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Housing, yes, that’s right. Well, nothin’ major, Doctor. Just… getting older, you know? A little creaky in the mornings, and my eyesight isn't what it used to be. I mostly just want to make sure I can still live on my own, and these forms… they seemed important for that. I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, to be honest. Just trying to take care of things.
DOCTOR: "Just getting older." Right. Well, "just getting older" can still mean a lot of things. “Creaky in the mornings” – is that in your joints?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly my knees and hips. And my back, sometimes. It’s not… sharp pain, you know? More like a stiff, achy feeling. Makes getting out of bed a little… difficult. I manage, though. I’ve always managed. I just don't want to complain, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this stiffness been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's hard to say exactly. A few years, maybe? It comes and goes. Worse in the winter, definitely. I just thought it was the weather. And old age, like I said. I didn’t really pay it much mind until these forms… they make you think about things, you know?
DOCTOR: A few years… and just worse in the winter. Do you notice any swelling in those joints when they’re particularly achy?
PATIENT: Swelling… Hmm. Not usually, no. They might look a little… thicker sometimes, but I just figured that was my weight. I don’t know. It’s hard to tell. I haven't really looked closely, to be honest. I’m not very good at noticing those things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And outside of the joint stiffness, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me see… I get tired, sometimes. More tired than I used to, anyway. And my appetite isn’t what it used to be. I just… don’t feel as energetic, I guess. It’s probably just getting old, though. Everything aches, you don’t have much energy… it all just goes together, doesn't it?
DOCTOR: Tiredness and decreased appetite… common complaints. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything significant?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I had the flu, badly, when I was younger. And I broke my arm once, when I was a little girl. Nothing serious, though. I don’t think so. The doctor always said I was a healthy woman, strong as an ox, he used to say. I’ve just… never really had much trouble with my health, to be honest. That’s why I haven’t been to a doctor much. I’m not sure if that’s good or bad.
DOCTOR: "Strong as an ox"… Right. Well, people change. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. Not a one. I always avoided them if I could. I don’t like hospitals. Or doctors, really, if I’m being honest. But I’m here now, getting these forms done, so… It's just… a lot of trouble, all this paperwork.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Oh… my family. My mother… she had arthritis, badly, when she got older. In her hands, mostly. And my father… he had heart trouble. He passed away when I was young. I don’t really know much about it, to be honest. It was a long time ago. I have a brother, but we don’t see each other much anymore. He’s always been… different. Not much help with family history, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, none. Never have. I don’t like taking pills. Always thought they did more harm than good. Just try to eat healthy and get enough sleep, that’s what I always did. Though, lately, sleep hasn’t been coming so easy. But no medications, definitely.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. I need to check your joints, listen to your heart and lungs, and take your blood pressure. Just so we have a baseline, you understand.
PATIENT: Oh. Alright. A physical exam. I haven't had one of those in… well, a very long time. Is it going to be… unpleasant? I don't like being poked and prodded. But if it’s necessary for these forms… Just try to be gentle, please?
DOCTOR: It won't be unpleasant. It’s a routine exam. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me. 140 over 85. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let’s listen to your heart. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. A slight murmur, but not concerning at this point. Now, your lungs… Deep breath… and exhale. Clear. Now, let's check your knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. A murmur, you say? That doesn’t sound good. Oh, that’s… not very comfortable. They feel… stiff. And a little creaky, like I said. Is everything alright? They haven’t felt this bad in a while.
DOCTOR: Crepitus noted on knee flexion, range of motion limited. No visible swelling or redness. Alright. And your hips?
PATIENT: Oh, my hips… They’re not much better. Stiff, mostly. And achy. It’s… hard to explain. It’s just a general discomfort. I don’t think I can move them as easily as I used to. Is this… bad? I’m starting to worry. Are these forms causing me to think about things too much?
DOCTOR: Limited range of motion in hips, discomfort with movement. Now, let's check your reflexes. And now the other one… Normal reflexes. Alright. Based on your history and this exam, you’re experiencing symptoms consistent with osteoarthritis. It’s a degenerative joint condition, common with age. The forms don't cause the condition, they simply bring it to your attention.
PATIENT: Oh! That’s… startling. Osteo… what was that? Arthritis? Like my mother had? Is it… serious? Will I end up in a wheelchair? And you say the forms didn't cause this? But I hadn't even thought about my knees hurting this badly until I started filling them out! This is… a lot. What do I do?
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis is wear and tear on the joints. It's not the same as your mother's condition necessarily, though it can be similar. And no, you won't end up in a wheelchair. Not unless you completely ignore it, which you are not doing now. It's manageable. We can start with some conservative treatment. Over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen, can help with the inflammation. Weight management, if you're able, can reduce the stress on your joints. And physical therapy could help strengthen the muscles around your knees and hips, improving your range of motion. I'm going to order some blood work just to rule out anything else, but I highly doubt that is necessary. We can revisit this in 6 months to see if you need anything further. And I will fill out those forms for you, so you can get on with your life. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Over-the-counter pain relievers… and weight management… and physical therapy… It sounds like… a lot of work. But… alright. If it will help. I suppose I can try. Blood work… okay. Just… please don’t find anything too serious. And you'll fill out the forms? Oh, that would be wonderful. Thank you, Doctor. Six months… that feels like a long time. But if it means I can continue to live on my own… then yes. That’s acceptable. Just… please be gentle with the needle. I don't like needles.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll write you a prescription for ibuprofen and a referral to a physical therapist. The lab order will be sent electronically to the lab down the hall, they’ll call you to schedule an appointment. And I’ll have the nurse fill out those forms for you. As for the needle, the phlebotomist is very experienced. They will be quick. Now, do you have any other questions for me before I finish up?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s all. Just… thank you again, Doctor. For filling out the forms, and explaining everything. And for not finding anything too serious. I appreciate it. Hopefully, this ibuprofen will really help. I just want to be able to walk without pain again. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It's not too much to ask. But remember, it's a process. Don't expect overnight miracles. The nurse will be in shortly to finish up and give you your prescription. Have a good day, Melvenia.
