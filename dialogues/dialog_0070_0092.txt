DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh, good mornin’ to you too, Doctor. Abady, you say? Sounds… foreign. Anyway. I’m here ‘cause I can’t… breathe so good, I guess. And my mouth feels like the Sahara. Eyes too. Real dry. It’s botherin’ me. Been happenin’ a while now, nothin’ sudden. Just… gets worse, slowly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Mr. Guilds. And yes, Abady is Spanish, originally. It’s alright if it sounds foreign! So, you’re experiencing shortness of breath and a feeling of dryness in your mouth and eyes, and this has been developing gradually over some time. Could you tell me a little more about the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Shortness… yeah. It’s like… I gotta work harder to get air, you know? Not like I’m coughin’ or wheezin’, just… tired when I do stuff. Walkin’ up the stairs, makin’ the bed… even talkin’ sometimes. It wasn't always like this, I used to be able to do anything. Now? Forget about it. I just get… winded. And it’s worse when it’s hot. Everything’s worse when it’s hot, though, right? This Florida heat… brutal.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, it’s an exertion-related shortness of breath – meaning it gets worse when you’re active. You don’t have a cough or wheezing, just a feeling of being tired when breathing, and it's particularly noticeable with heat. That’s very helpful. Now, can you estimate how much activity brings this on?
PATIENT: Estimate…? Look, Doctor, I ain't a scientist. I used to walk a mile every mornin’, no problem. Now? Maybe half a block, if I’m lucky. And even that leaves me feelin’ like I ran a marathon. Makin’ breakfast, that can get me puffin’. It ain’t like I’m layin’ in bed all day, mind you, I still got things to do. But I gotta stop and catch my breath a lot more than I used to. It’s… frustrating, you know? I used to be a strong man. Traffic Technician, workin’ out in the sun all day. Now… Now I'm slow.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration, Mr. Guilds. It sounds like this has significantly impacted your ability to do the things you enjoy. It’s good you’re still active, even with the limitations. Okay. And aside from the shortness of breath and the dryness, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else…? Hmm. Let me think. My ankles… they been a little puffy sometimes. Not always, just… now and then. And I wake up a couple times at night to pee. Used to sleep like a log, now it’s… interrupted. I don’t know if that matters. Old age, maybe? Everything aches, you know? Back, knees… the usual. I've been drinkin' more water too, tryin' to fix the dry mouth. Does that count as somethin' else?
DOCTOR: That’s all very helpful information, Mr. Guilds. The ankle swelling and waking up at night to urinate are definitely things that matter, and I appreciate you bringing those up. Drinking more water to combat the dryness is a good idea, though. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, such as diabetes, heart problems, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh boy. That's a long time ago. I think… I think the doctor told me somethin' about my blood pressure bein' a little high, years ago. Maybe ten, fifteen years ago? He put me on a little pill for it, I took it for a while, then… I don't remember. Stopped feelin' sick, so I figured I was okay. Never got around to seein' another doctor after that. Traffic Technician, busy man! And now, well... Medicare don't remind you of things, you know? Never had anythin' serious, not that I remember. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothin' like that. Just… old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you were diagnosed with high blood pressure some time ago and were on medication for it, but you stopped taking it when you felt better and haven’t been regularly followed up with a doctor since. That's good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. When I was a boy, I had my tonsils taken out. That’s it. And once, I broke my arm fallin' out of a tree. That was a long time ago too. Hospitalized… yeah, for the arm. Couple days. Never been in the hospital for anythin' serious, like a heart attack or somethin'. Traffic Technician, strong man! Mostly just bumps and bruises, you know? Workin' out in the sun, dealin' with traffic. Nothin' to write home about.
DOCTOR: Alright, so tonsillectomy as a child and a broken arm that required a hospital stay. No other significant surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… Nope. Not really. I take a little somethin' for my arthritis in my hands, sometimes. Just when it's really botherin' me. It's a white pill, I think. Can't remember the name. Got it at the drugstore, over the counter. And sometimes I take a little somethin' for heartburn, if I eat somethin' spicy. But that's it. Mostly just water. Tryin' to stay hydrated, you know? Old age and the Florida heat, it’s a bad combination.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take an over-the-counter medication for arthritis in your hands when needed and occasionally something for heartburn. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… complicated. My mother, she lived to be… oh, I don’t know, maybe eighty? She had… somethin’ with her heart, I think. Not sure. My father, he died young. Workin’ in the sugar cane fields. Never knew him very well. And my sister… she had high blood pressure, I think. Like me. But nobody really talked about these things back then. Just… people got sick and they… got sick. Not much of a family history, really. Mostly just hard work and… Florida heat.
DOCTOR: Alright, so your mother had some sort of heart condition and your sister had high blood pressure. That's helpful to know. Now, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Bad for you, you know? My father used to smoke a cigar sometimes, but I always thought it was a silly habit. Traffic Technician, gotta have good lungs! Too important. Never even been around a lot of smokers. Stayed away from that stuff. Bad for your health. Never, never, never.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… Well, I used to have a beer with dinner sometimes. A cold Presidente, maybe. When I was younger, of course. Traffic Technician, long day, you know? But I haven’t had a drink in… oh, must be twenty years. Not much of a drinker, really. Never liked the taste that much. And it makes you sleepy. Can't be sleepy when you're workin'. So, no. Not a drinker. Used to, maybe. Now, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you used to drink a beer occasionally but haven’t had alcohol in about twenty years. Now, let's talk a little bit about your current living situation and daily activities. Do you live alone or with someone?
PATIENT: Live alone. Always have. Never got married, never had kids. Traffic Technician, always too busy. Got a little apartment, near the beach. Not fancy, but it's quiet. I keep myself busy. Watch a little TV, walk to the store, visit with the neighbors sometimes. Do a little gardening. Keep myself movin', you know? Gotta stay active. Important. No one to worry about, no one to take care of. Just me. Just me.
DOCTOR: Alright, you live alone in an apartment near the beach and keep yourself active with various activities. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anythin’. I eat pretty much anything. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy in the sun, but that's just the Florida heat, you know? And a little bit of poison ivy once, when I was a boy. But that's not an allergy, is it? Nothing serious, really. Never been to a doctor about it. No allergies. Just me and the Florida heat.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay, Mr. Guilds, thank you for that thorough history. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Eh, alright. Whatever you gotta do, Doctor. Just don’t poke around too much, alright? Old man, you know. Everything aches. Traffic Technician, always workin' hard. My body ain't what it used to be. Do what you gotta do. Just… be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Guilds. I will be as gentle as possible. We'll start with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 160 over 95. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. I'm listening to your heart and lungs now. I hear a normal heart rhythm, but I also hear some mild crackling sounds in the lower part of your lungs. I’m going to listen to your back as well. Okay. Now, I'm going to take a look at your ankles to check for swelling. I see a little bit of swelling in your ankles. And finally, I’m going to check your oxygen saturation with this little clip on your finger. Your oxygen level is 92 percent, which is a little low. Alright, Mr. Guilds, that completes the exam. Now, based on everything you've told me and what I've found during the exam, I have a few ideas about what might be going on. Do you have any questions before I share my thoughts?
PATIENT: Crackles…? Swellin’? Low oxygen…? Sounds… bad. What does it mean, Doctor? Is it the heat? I always thought it was just the heat. What’s goin' on with me? Traffic Technician, strong man… Now I'm cracklin' and swellin'? Tell me, Doctor. Just tell me what's wrong. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Guilds. It doesn’t necessarily mean something is seriously wrong, but it does require some investigation. The crackles in your lungs, the swelling in your ankles, and the low oxygen saturation, combined with your shortness of breath and your history of high blood pressure, point towards the possibility of congestive heart failure. What that means, simply put, is that your heart isn’t pumping as efficiently as it should, causing fluid to build up in your lungs and other parts of your body. It's often a gradual process, and it can be managed with medication and lifestyle changes. The heat certainly can exacerbate symptoms, but it’s unlikely to be the sole cause of all that you’re experiencing. Now, to confirm this, I'd like to order a few tests. I want to get an EKG to look at your heart’s electrical activity, a chest X-ray to see the condition of your lungs and heart, and some blood work to check your kidney function and look for certain markers that can indicate heart failure. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Congestive… heart…? Never thought about my heart. Always been strong. Traffic Technician, workin’ hard all day. Heart failure…? Sounds… terrible. EKG…? Chest X-ray…? Blood work…? More pokin' and proddin'? More waitin'? Will these tests… will they tell me if I'm… dyin', Doctor? Is that what you're lookin' for? And if it is heart failure… can it be fixed? Can I still… walk to the store? Can I still… watch TV? Just tell me, Doctor. Straight. Can I still live? And how much is all this gonna cost? Medicare… sometimes it don't cover everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Mr. Guilds, and those are all very valid concerns. Let me address them one by one. First, no, these tests are not to determine if you are dying. They are to understand what is causing your symptoms so we can determine the best course of treatment. These tests give us information, they don’t provide a death sentence. Regarding the tests themselves: The EKG is a painless procedure where we place stickers on your chest to record your heart’s electrical activity. The chest X-ray is a quick image of your lungs and heart. The blood work involves taking a small sample of blood from your arm. None of them are particularly invasive or painful. Now, regarding your ability to live a full life: If this is heart failure, it is often manageable. With medication and lifestyle changes – such as a low-sodium diet, regular exercise as tolerated, and fluid restriction – many people with heart failure can live full and productive lives. Whether you can still walk to the store and watch TV depends on the severity of the condition and how well it responds to treatment. We will work together to help you maintain your quality of life. As for the cost: Medicare should cover the majority of these tests, but there may be some co-pays or deductibles. Our billing department will contact you to discuss the potential costs in detail once the tests are ordered. I can also put in a referral to a financial counselor to help you navigate any potential expenses. Does that help to alleviate some of your concerns?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. Stickers and pictures… not so bad. And pills… I can take pills. Manageable… you said manageable. That’s good. Still walk to the store… still watch TV… important. Medicare… the billing department… I'll talk to them. Financial counselor… sounds… complicated. So… what happens next? Do I gotta stay in the hospital? Do I gotta change everything? And will these pills… will they make me tired? Traffic Technician, gotta stay awake. Gotta be alert. Just tell me… straight. What’s the plan, Doctor? Lay it out for me. One step at a time. I'm an old man, I don't move fast.
DOCTOR: You’re right to ask for a clear plan, Mr. Guilds. I understand you don’t move fast, and I’ll be as straightforward as possible. Step one: I’m going to write orders for the EKG, chest X-ray, and blood work. The lab and radiology departments are right down the hall, and the staff will guide you through the process. It shouldn't take more than a couple of hours to complete all the tests. Step two: Once the results are back, I’ll review them with you in detail. This will likely be in a few days, once everything is processed. Step three: Based on the results, we’ll discuss the appropriate treatment plan. This may include medication to help your heart pump more efficiently, control fluid buildup, and lower your blood pressure. We'll also talk about lifestyle modifications, such as a low-sodium diet and regular, gentle exercise. Regarding hospitalization: At this point, there's no indication that you need to be hospitalized. We’re doing these tests to determine the best course of action on an outpatient basis. Regarding the pills: Some medications for heart failure can cause fatigue, but there are many different options, and we can work together to find one that minimizes side effects. We'll start with a low dose and monitor your response closely. For now, I want you to continue with your normal activities as tolerated. Don’t overexert yourself, but don’t stop doing the things you enjoy. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Stickers and pictures… normal activities… low dose… Sounds… okay. Better than stayin’ in the hospital. Low sodium… What does that mean? I like my Cuban sandwiches. And my wife used to make a great roast pork… lots of salt. Gotta ask her… Gotta call her. Alright. Stickers and pictures. Then the results. Then… low sodium. I'll do it. I'll try. Thank you, Doctor. For layin’ it out straight. It’s… a lot. But you made it manageable. And tell me, one more thing. Will these pills… will they affect my… appetite? Gotta eat, you know. Gotta stay strong. Even if it's just… low sodium.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Guilds. I’m glad I could make it manageable. And yes, that’s a very good question. Some medications for heart failure can affect your appetite, but it’s not a common side effect. If you do experience a loss of appetite, we can discuss strategies to help you maintain your weight and nutrition. We can also refer you to a registered dietitian who can provide personalized guidance on a heart-healthy diet that still allows you to enjoy your favorite foods – even Cuban sandwiches – in moderation. The goal isn’t to deprive you of everything you enjoy, but to make healthy choices that support your heart. For now, let’s focus on getting those tests done. The staff will come get you when they’re ready. Do you have any other questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that's all. Stickers and pictures… low sodium… Cuban sandwiches in moderation… Thank you, Doctor. For your patience. For listenin'. It’s… good to know someone cares. Alright. Let's get this over with. Stickers and pictures… here we go. .
DOCTOR: You take care now, Mr. Guilds. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. .
