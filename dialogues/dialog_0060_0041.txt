DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Astore. I’m Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Dorman. Well, it’s this… weakness. It’s been getting worse, you see. Not all at once, but… little by little. It's in my legs mostly, but sometimes my hands feel it too. It makes things… difficult.
DOCTOR: Hmm, weakness, you say. And it's been developing gradually. Okay. Can you tell me a little more about how it’s difficult?
PATIENT: Well… It’s hard to explain. Things I used to do… just walking, even. Now I gotta think about it. Like, lift my feet, don't drag 'em. And standin' for long is… no good. It feels like they're gonna give way. My wife helps a lot, but… I don’t want to need her help all the time, you know? And writing… holdin' a pen… that's gettin' harder too. My hand… it shakes sometimes.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. It sounds like this is really impacting your daily life, and it’s frustrating to feel like you're losing some of your independence. So, to clarify, the weakness started in your legs, but it's now affecting your hands as well?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Started in the legs, definitely. Felt it first when I was walkin' the dog. Just a little bit of… draggin', I thought. Then it slowly got worse. And then… maybe six months ago, my hands started feelin’ it too. Not all the time, but… when I try to do small things, like button my shirt or… hold a cup of tea steady. It’s… not a big shake, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything specific made it worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Not really… not that I can tell. It doesn’t seem to be worse on hot days or cold days. Doesn’t seem to matter how much I rest either. Some days are better than others, but… I can’t figure out what makes the difference. I try to stay active, walk when I can, but even that… gets harder. It's just… there, always gettin’ a little bit worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms along with the weakness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. Sometimes my vision gets blurry, but I figured that was just my age. And… well, I get tired easily. Very tired. More tired than I used to. But… that could be anything, right? I sleep alright, I think. Not as good as I used to, but… I don’t wake up feelin’ awful or anything. And… now that you ask… sometimes I feel a little… numb, in my feet. Not all the time, and it comes and goes. It’s hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision, increased fatigue, and some numbness in your feet. That’s helpful. Now, have you had any recent falls, or any injuries to your legs or hands?
PATIENT: No, no falls, Doctor. Not recently, and not for a long time. I’m careful, you see. My wife worries about me, so I try to be extra careful. And no injuries… I haven't had a bad fall or bump. Nothing like that. It's just… this weakness. It came on slow, like I said. Not a sudden thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your medical history a bit. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Well… I had high blood pressure for a while, but the doctor got that under control with medicine. And… years ago, I had some trouble with my back, but that's all better now. Oh! And… about ten years ago, a different doctor told me… something about my nerves. Something about… multiple… sclerosis, I think? I don’t remember much about it. He did some tests, told me it was mild, and… I haven’t really thought about it since.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of high blood pressure – and that’s currently controlled?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's right. Controlled with medicine. I take a little pill every day. And I see the doctor regular to check it. I don't worry about it much, to be honest. It’s just part of gettin’ older, I reckon. But… this multiple sclerosis thing… you said it? That's what I meant. That's what the other doctor told me. I just… haven't been back to that doctor in years.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you happen to know what medication you are taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Now that’s a good question. My wife handles most of that stuff. I just know I take a little white pill every morning. Let me see… Here, maybe this will help. It says… “Lisinopril” on the bottle. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, Lisinopril is correct. Thank you. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a young man. That was a long time ago. And… I had a knee replacement maybe fifteen years ago. That’s about it, Doctor. Nothing else that I can remember. It was a good surgery, though. Helped my walkin’ for a long time. But this weakness… it's different than the knee pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal and a knee replacement. Good to know. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a tough one. My mother… she had some trouble with her heart when she was older. And my brother… he had diabetes. He had to watch his sugar all the time. I don't know about anything else, to be honest. My family… we didn't talk about health much. We just… dealt with things as they came.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't. Not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medicine… as long as it doesn’t make me sick! I've always been pretty lucky that way.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No, no, no. I haven't had a drink in… well, a very long time. Not since I was a young man. And I never smoked. Never touched a cigarette in my life. And definitely no drugs. I’m a simple man, Doctor. Just tea and… tryin’ to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s very good. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, I just want to quickly review: you've been experiencing gradually worsening weakness in your legs and hands, associated with fatigue, some blurry vision, and intermittent numbness in your feet. You have a history of controlled high blood pressure, a past knee replacement, and a remote diagnosis of mild multiple sclerosis. You have no known allergies, and you don't smoke, drink, or use drugs. Does that sound right?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s right. You explained it very well. That’s exactly how it is. It’s… good to hear you say it all back like that. It makes me feel like… maybe we can figure somethin’ out. The weakness… it's been worryin' me. And that old multiple sclerosis diagnosis… I never really understood it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astore. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels… strange.
DOCTOR: Okay. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Your heart and lungs sound good. Now, I'm going to check your strength in your arms and legs. Your strength is a little weaker in your legs than it is in your arms. And finally, I'm going to check your sensation in your feet and legs. Okay, your sensation seems a little diminished in your feet. Based on this exam, the weakness and decreased reflexes in your legs, along with the decreased sensation in your feet, are concerning. It sounds like your previous diagnosis of multiple sclerosis may need to be revisited.
PATIENT: Multiple sclerosis… That’s what I was thinkin’ too, maybe. It’s just… I never really got a clear explanation back then. It’s good to hear you say it. It makes sense of everything. So… what happens now, Doctor? What do we do?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astore. The next step is to get some further testing done to confirm whether this is a recurrence of your multiple sclerosis, or if there's another explanation for your symptoms. I'm going to order an MRI of your brain and spinal cord. This will give us a detailed look at your nervous system and help us identify any areas of inflammation or damage. I'm also going to order some blood tests to rule out other potential causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or autoimmune conditions. Do you have any questions about those tests?
PATIENT: An MRI… That’s the one where you lay in that big machine, right? And blood tests… yes, I can handle that. It sounds… thorough, which is good. I don't know much about the machine… is it dangerous? And how long will it take to get the results? I'm just… a little worried about the waitin’.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. The MRI uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain and spinal cord. It's a very safe procedure, but it is important to let the technician know if you have any metal implants or pacemakers. It’s also quite noisy, but you’ll be given earplugs or headphones to help with that. The scan itself usually takes about 30-60 minutes. As for the results, it usually takes a few days to a week for the radiologist to read the scans and send the report. Once I receive the report and the results of your blood tests, I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings with you and develop a plan. Do you have any other concerns about the tests, or would you like me to explain anything further?
PATIENT: No metal, Doctor, and no pacemakers. Good. And a week… I can manage a week. It’s the not knowin’ that bothers me, but… I understand. It's good you're being thorough. No, I think I'm okay for now. Just… gettin’ the tests done is the next step, right? When can we schedule those? And… will the insurance cover it? I'm on Medicare, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, getting the tests done is the next step. We'll schedule an MRI of your brain and spinal cord, and order some blood work. I have a scheduler here, and we can get you set up for next week, either Tuesday or Thursday. Which works better for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday would be better, Doctor. Yes, Tuesday works. My wife has a book club on Thursday, so… Tuesday is good. And… the Medicare… is that all taken care of? I worry about those bills sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, Tuesday it is. And don’t worry, we’ll handle the Medicare authorization for you. Our billing department is very familiar with the process. They will submit the necessary paperwork, and we’ll let you know if there’s anything you need to do on your end. The scheduler will just need a few details from you now, and then we'll be all set. Could you please schedule Mr. Astore for an MRI of the brain and spinal cord on Tuesday?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s a big weight off my mind. I appreciate you takin’ care of the insurance stuff. It’s… it’s a lot to worry about these days. Just tell me what time and where to go for the scan, and I'll be there.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Astore. The scheduler will give you all the details, but it's at the imaging center downtown, at 9:00 AM on Tuesday. Please arrive 15 minutes early to fill out any necessary paperwork. In the meantime, please try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that's all for today. 9:00 AM on Tuesday… I’ll write that down. Thank you so much for your time and for explainin' everything so clearly. You’ve been very helpful.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Astore. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And remember, we'll be in touch once the results are available. Have a good day, and I’ll see you on Tuesday.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Goodbye.
