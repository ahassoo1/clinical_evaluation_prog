DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shaub. I'm Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you're 64 years of age. I see you’re presenting today for a consultation. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, Tierney Shaub is correct. And… well, to be frank, I’d like to be tested for… the HIV virus. I just… I want to know my status. It’s something I’ve been putting off, but I feel it’s time.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shaub. It's certainly prudent to be proactive about one’s health. And you’re right, knowing your status is important. Before we proceed with testing, I need to ask you some questions to get a better understanding of your risk factors. This is standard procedure, of course. Let’s start with this: have you ever had any blood transfusions?
PATIENT: Blood transfusions… hmm. Let me think. No, not that I recall. Not intentionally, anyway. I was quite unwell as a child, growing up in Nigeria, but I don’t remember receiving a blood transfusion. We relied more on… traditional remedies, if I’m being honest. Is that… relevant? Perhaps they used something at the hospital then, but I wouldn’t know. It was a very long time ago.
DOCTOR: While I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Shaub, relying on traditional remedies does present certain… uncertainties regarding medical procedures received. However, we’ll proceed with the assumption that you have not had a transfusion. Now, have you ever shared needles for any reason – for drug use, tattooing, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not. I’ve never… indulged in such things. Never any drug use, and I would never share a needle with anyone. That sounds… very dangerous. And a tattoo? No, I haven’t had a tattoo either. I’m a rather… reserved woman, you see. It wouldn’t be appropriate. My husband wouldn’t approve.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your sexual history, Ms. Shaub?
PATIENT: Oh… that is… a rather personal question, Doctor. I’ve been married to my husband, Olu, for… forty years. A very long time. We haven't… been with anyone else. Not since our wedding day. Is that sufficient information? It feels… improper to delve into such details. With all due respect.
DOCTOR: That is… satisfactory for the purposes of this initial assessment, Ms. Shaub. However, it’s important to understand that HIV can be transmitted through sexual contact, even within a long-term monogamous relationship, if one partner has been previously exposed. Now, have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, or STIs, diagnosed?
PATIENT: Oh dear. No, never. Not at all. My husband and I… we were very careful when we were younger. We were both raised with strict morals, you see. And we’ve always… prioritized each other. I can assure you, Doctor, I have never had an STI. I would be deeply distressed if I had. It simply wouldn’t be… dignified.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shaub. We’ve covered the primary risk factors. It seems, based on your account, your risk is… low. However, testing is still the most accurate way to determine your status, regardless of perceived risk. Before we proceed with the blood draw, I must inform you that this test will be performed at your own expense, as you are currently uninsured. The cost is approximately $150. Are you prepared to cover this cost?
PATIENT: Oh… $150? That is… quite a lot. I hadn't anticipated such a price. I… I hadn’t fully prepared financially for this. I’m afraid I don't have that amount readily available. My husband, Olu, manages our finances, and I would need to discuss this with him. Perhaps… is there any way to do this in stages? Or perhaps a lower-cost alternative? I truly want to know, Doctor, but I’m not sure I can afford $150 right now. It’s… rather difficult.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, Ms. Shaub, we do not offer payment plans or alternative testing options. This is a private practice, and we are unable to absorb the cost of testing. There are some public health clinics that offer free HIV testing, but availability may be limited, particularly in rural areas. I can provide you with a list of those clinics, but I must advise you that their standards of care may not be… comparable to those provided here. Do you wish me to provide that list?
PATIENT: A list… yes, please. That would be… helpful. It’s disheartening to think I must compromise on quality of care, but… I suppose I have little choice. It’s just… I was hoping for a more straightforward process. It seems every step is fraught with difficulty. Yes, please, the list would be greatly appreciated. And thank you… for your time, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It contains the contact information for the nearest public health facilities that offer HIV testing. I suggest you call ahead to confirm their hours and availability. Is there anything else I can assist you with today, Ms. Shaub?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that is all. Thank you for… your patience. And for the list. I will contact those clinics as soon as possible. I appreciate your time, and I wish you a good day.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shaub. Do take care. .
