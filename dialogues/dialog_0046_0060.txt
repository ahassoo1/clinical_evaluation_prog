DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Theriot. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. Can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's...Thair-ee-ot, actually. Look, it's probably nothing, honestly. My mother...well, she had a lot of health problems. A lot. And my grandfather too. I just want to make sure I'm not headed down the same path, you know? Preventative stuff, I guess. It's better to know, even if it’s bad news.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Thair-ee-ot. That's a very sensible approach – being proactive about your health, especially with a family history of illness, is excellent. It’s good you’re thinking this way. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little more about the health problems your mother and grandfather experienced?
PATIENT: Right. Well, my mother…she had heart trouble, mostly. Lots of visits to the hospital, then…then she had some kind of cancer. Lung cancer, I think. It was fast. Grandfather…he had diabetes, really bad. Lost a foot, eventually. And something with his kidneys, I think. Honestly, my aunt handled most of the medical stuff. I was…young. It was a long time ago. It all just feels like a blur of hospital rooms and…worry. I just don’t want to end up like them, you know? Especially not the cancer part. That was…rough.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot, and it's completely natural to be concerned given your family history. We'll definitely take that into account. So, to clarify, heart problems and lung cancer with your mother, and diabetes and kidney issues with your grandfather. Do you recall anything specific about the type of heart problem your mother had, or the type of cancer?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. Not really. It was all…arrhythmias, I think, with her heart. Something about the rhythm being off. And the cancer…it was in her lungs, obviously, but they never really explained it to me in a way I understood. She just…got sick quickly. Look, I wasn't a medical student, Doctor. I was a kid trying to finish high school while my mother was…you know. I just remember a lot of tests, a lot of coughing, and then…not much longer after that. It’s probably not very helpful information, I realize.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Thair-ee-ot. It’s not your responsibility to be a medical expert, and you’re providing exactly the information you have. Any details are helpful. Knowing it was arrhythmias and lung cancer gives us a starting point. Let's shift focus to you now. Are you currently experiencing any symptoms at all – anything that's concerning you, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. That’s the thing. I feel…fine. Perfectly normal. Which is why I feel silly even being here. But my sister, she had her checkup last month and the doctor did a whole panel of tests, just because of our mother. And she said I should get checked out too, just to be safe. She’s a nurse, so…I figured I should listen to her. No chest pain, no shortness of breath, no weird fatigue…just…anxiety, I guess. About what could happen.
DOCTOR: That’s very wise of you to listen to your sister, and it's definitely not silly to be proactive, especially with a family history. Anxiety about potential health issues is completely understandable, and a very valid reason to come in for a checkup. To get a comprehensive picture, let's go through a brief review of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I've always been pretty healthy, knock on wood. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, a few colds – but nothing serious. No surgeries, no hospitalizations…I've really avoided doctors for most of my life, to be honest. Which is probably why I'm so clueless about all this now. I just…tried to stay active, eat reasonably well, and hope for the best.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent! Staying active and eating well are fantastic preventative measures. It sounds like you’ve been taking good care of yourself. And no previous surgeries or hospitalizations – that’s good to know. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing. I don't even take a multivitamin. I just…never really saw the point, I guess. My sister always tells me I should, but I just haven’t gotten around to it. I drink coffee, obviously. Does that count? Other than that, I'm pretty clean. I really try to avoid putting anything unnecessary into my body.
DOCTOR: Coffee doesn’t count! That’s perfectly fine. It's good to hear you're generally avoiding unnecessary medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies. None that I know of, anyway. I've eaten pretty much everything. My mother tried to make me eat a lot of weird things when I was a kid – some kind of Indian spices, I think – but I never had a reaction to anything. My sister's allergic to pollen, but that's about it in the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies – that's good. Let’s talk a little bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. None of the above. I find all of that…detrimental, frankly. I don't even like the smell of cigarette smoke. My grandfather used to smoke, and it smelled awful. I avoid people who smoke, if possible. Alcohol…maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but very rarely. And I've never touched drugs in my life. I have a perfectly good brain, I don't need to alter my state of consciousness.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Mr. Thair-ee-ot. A healthy lifestyle is certainly beneficial. Finally, let's briefly discuss your family history again, beyond your mother and grandfather. Are there any other significant illnesses that run in your family – perhaps heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, or any other chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. My uncle, on my mother’s side, had a stroke a few years ago. He was a bit of a…partier, to be honest. And my aunt, her sister, has high blood pressure. That’s about all I can think of, really. Everyone else seems to be relatively healthy, or at least, they haven’t told me about any major illnesses. I’m not particularly close to most of my extended family, so I wouldn't necessarily know.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know – stroke in your uncle and high blood pressure in your aunt. Now, to get a better understanding of your current health status, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. Just…try to be quick, okay? I have a bit of a…busy schedule. And honestly, I'm not a fan of doctors poking and prodding. But if it's necessary, go ahead. Just…be gentle.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Thair-ee-ot. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. We’ll start with your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and briefly examine your abdomen. It shouldn’t take long. First, let's just have you sit here on the table.
PATIENT: Alright. Let's get this over with. Just…try not to startle me, okay? I don't like surprises.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relaxing your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 122 over 78 – that’s within the normal range. Pulse is 68 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 – also normal. And respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses or organomegaly appreciated. Everything seems within normal limits so far. I’m going to briefly check your reflexes and listen to your joints.
PATIENT: Fine. Just…hurry it up, okay? This is all a bit…unnecessary, if you ask me. But if you have to do it…get it over with. I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Thair-ee-ot. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Joints are within normal limits. No tenderness or swelling noted. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. Everything appears normal at this time. Given your family history, however, I do recommend a few baseline blood tests to screen for potential issues. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests? What kind of blood tests? And what are you looking for, exactly? I don’t want you poking around for things that aren’t there. I just want to make sure I'm not going to end up like my mother, you know? But I don’t need a full-body scan just because she had cancer.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Thair-ee-ot. We’re not looking for things that aren’t there, simply establishing a baseline given your family history. I recommend a Complete Blood Count to assess your overall blood health, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel to evaluate your kidney and liver function, and a Lipid Panel to check your cholesterol levels. Given your mother’s history, I’d also suggest a Prostate-Specific Antigen test, as it can provide some information about prostate health, though it's not definitive. Finally, given your grandfather’s diabetes, we'll check your fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c to screen for diabetes. These tests will provide a good starting point and help us identify any potential risks early on. It's preventative care, Mr. Thair-ee-ot. Do you have any questions about any of these tests?
PATIENT: PSA test? I’m twenty-four years old! That’s…that’s for old men, isn’t it? And hemoglobin A1c…that sounds complicated. Look, I just want to know if I’m going to drop dead from heart disease or cancer. Do I need all of these tests? Can’t we just…do the basic ones? The ones that actually matter? I don’t want to spend a fortune on tests I don’t understand, just to be told I’m perfectly fine.
DOCTOR: You’re right to question, Mr. Thair-ee-ot. That’s a very valid concern. The PSA test is typically recommended for men over 50, but given your family history of cancer, some guidelines suggest earlier screening. It’s not a definitive test, and we can discuss the pros and cons. As for the hemoglobin A1c, it provides a longer-term picture of your blood sugar control. It's not just about finding out if you currently have diabetes, but assessing your risk for developing it in the future. We can absolutely tailor the tests to your comfort level. If you're hesitant about the PSA and A1c, we can start with the CBC and CMP. That will give us a good baseline assessment of your overall health. Would that be more comfortable for you?
PATIENT: Okay. Fine. The CBC and CMP. That’s…that’s acceptable. I still don’t see the point of all the other tests, but I don’t want to argue about it. Just those two, okay? And how long will it take to get the results? And will I have to come back for another appointment to discuss them? I have a very busy schedule, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Thair-ee-ot. The CBC and CMP are a good starting point. We'll get those ordered right away. The lab results typically take about 3-5 business days to come back. Once we have them, we'll review them together. I’ll have my nurse call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. It’s a quick appointment – about 15-20 minutes – to discuss the results and any necessary next steps. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think that’s it. Just…try not to scare me with bad news, okay? I just want to be reassured that I’m not going to end up like my mother. That’s all.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Thair-ee-ot. And I will certainly do my best to provide you with clear and honest information. We'll take things one step at a time. Remember, preventative care is about being proactive, not about predicting the future. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and schedule your follow-up. Thank you for coming in today. .
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you. .
