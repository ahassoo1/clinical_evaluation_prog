DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarotta. Welcome to my office. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. I need to get a card so I can keep driving… a commercial driver’s card, I think? For the ride-sharing, you know. I drive for a couple of apps part-time, and they said I need to get checked out first. I hope it's not too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Sciarotta. That’s perfectly alright. We perform those examinations frequently. It sounds like you need a Department of Transportation – or DOT – physical. Let me just pull up your chart here… Okay, I see you're 70 years of age. That's good information. To start, can you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right, 70. Feels older some days, I won’t lie! Generally, I’m… okay. I have my aches and pains, what old person doesn’t? My doctor – back home – says my blood pressure runs a little high sometimes, but we're managing it with a little pill. Otherwise, I think I’m pretty good for my age. I still get around, you know? I wouldn’t be driving if I couldn’t.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear that you're still active. And it's good that your blood pressure is being managed. Could you tell me the name of the medication you’re taking for your blood pressure, if you recall?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s a white pill… small, and I take it every morning. Oh! I remember now. It’s Lisinopril. Yes, Lisinopril. My old doctor, Dr. Ito, prescribed it. He’s a good man. Retired now, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sciarotta. That's helpful. Are you currently experiencing any symptoms – anything at all – that brought you in today, besides the need for the commercial driver’s card?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing specific. No dizziness, no blurry vision, no chest pain… just the usual old-lady stuff. A little stiff in the mornings, but that’s about it. Honestly, I just want to make sure I’m still fit to drive. I like my independence, you know? And the extra money helps.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Sciarotta. Maintaining independence is very important. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history to get a better picture of your overall health. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, heart disease, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. Dr. Ito did a lot of tests over the years, and he always said I was… remarkably healthy for my age. He did mention something about a little bit of arthritis in my knees, but it wasn’t anything serious. Never been told I had diabetes or heart disease, thankfully. Just the knees, and the usual aches and pains. I think I’m pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Sciarotta. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Let me see… Yes, actually. Years ago, when I was in my fifties, I had my gallbladder removed. It was causing a lot of trouble. And… oh! And I had a hysterectomy, also a long time ago, when I was in my forties. That's it, I think. Nothing else. It was all a long time ago, and I recovered well from both.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And are you currently taking any other medications, besides the Lisinopril?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me see… I take a Vitamin D supplement, the doctor said my levels were a little low. And… oh yes, I take something for my knees, sometimes. When they’re really bothering me. It’s Ibuprofen, just the over-the-counter kind. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Vitamin D and Ibuprofen as needed. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Dr. Ito tested me for allergies when I was younger, and I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take most pills… I'm pretty lucky that way too. I don’t even get seasonal allergies, which is amazing.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Now, let's talk a little about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or stroke?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, like me. And she died of a stroke when she was in her seventies. My father… he had some kind of cancer, I think, but it was a long time ago, and I don’t remember the details. Other than that… not really. My siblings are both healthy, as far as I know. It wasn’t a particularly healthy family, if I’m being honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you. And finally, do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I haven't smoked a cigarette in my life. My husband used to, but I made him quit years ago. And I only drink a little bit of wine with dinner, sometimes. Very rarely. And definitely no drugs. Never have, never will. I’m a very healthy woman, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s all very good information, Ms. Sciarotta. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam to assess your overall health and ensure you meet the requirements for your commercial driver’s card. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get this done and get back to driving. Let’s get it over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: Certainly. First, I’m going to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your eyes, ears, nose, and throat. After that, I’ll check your reflexes and strength, and do a quick neurological exam. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 82. We’ll keep an eye on that. Pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears are clear, no signs of infection. Nose is clear as well. Throat looks good, no redness or swelling. Your pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Good range of motion with your eyes. Your reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Good strength in your hands. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. Overall, your physical exam is within normal limits, with the exception of your slightly elevated blood pressure. Do you have a recent blood pressure log from home that I can review?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Elevated, you say? I do, actually. Dr. Ito made me keep one, just in case. It's in my purse somewhere... Here it is. It’s a little messy, I warn you. He said it fluctuated, but usually stayed around 130/80. Sometimes a little higher, especially if I was stressed or hadn’t had my medication. It’s been pretty consistent lately, I think.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Sciarotta. These readings are consistent with what you described. There is some variability, as you noted, but overall, they are reasonably well-controlled. Given your blood pressure readings, your overall health, and the results of your physical exam, I believe you are fit to drive commercially, with a few caveats. I recommend continuing to monitor your blood pressure at home and keeping a log. If your blood pressure consistently exceeds 140/90, please follow up with your primary care physician to discuss potential medication adjustments. It’s also important to maintain a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management techniques. I will document these recommendations on your DOT physical form. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: That sounds reasonable. I can definitely keep logging it. And I do try to eat healthy, mostly. Though I do love my sweets… No, I don’t think I have any questions. Just glad I passed! How long is this card good for, anyway? And will it be sent to me, or do I get it today?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The medical certificate is valid for 24 months, as long as you continue to meet the medical requirements. Here’s your completed DOT medical examiner’s certificate. You will need to present this to your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles to obtain your commercial driver’s card. The DMV will likely require additional documentation, such as your driver’s license and proof of insurance, so I recommend checking their website for specific requirements. I’ve also included this pamphlet with additional information about the DOT medical requirements and resources. Do you have any other questions or concerns before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor Rakosky. You made this whole process very easy. I appreciate your patience and kindness. I'll get this taken to the DMV right away. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sciarotta. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns in the future. Have a safe and pleasant day, and thank you for choosing my practice.
