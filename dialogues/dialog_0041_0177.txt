DOCTOR: Hi Jimmi, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. Dr. Pol-chin-ski, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s… down there. Something’s leaking. Not good, you know? Not good at all. A man… a nice man… noticed it. Said I should come get it checked. It’s embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Down there” – so you’re referring to your vaginal area?
PATIENT: Vaginal? Is that what you call it now? I just… it’s where a woman… you know. It’s wet. And… not supposed to be. It smells funny too, not like flowers. Definitely not flowers.
DOCTOR: Yes, “vaginal area” is the medical term. And it’s perfectly alright to talk about these things, Jimmi. It sounds like you’re experiencing some vaginal discharge, and you’re right to get it checked out. The change in smell is also something we want to investigate. Can you tell me a little more about this discharge?
PATIENT: Investigate? What’s to investigate? It’s just… wetness. And a smell. Like old fish, maybe? I don’t know fish, really. Haven’t been to the market in ages. It’s been happening… oh, I don’t know. A week? Maybe longer. Time goes so fast these days. It’s just… bothersome. And that nice man… he’ll think I’m dirty.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week or longer. And you described it as wetness with a smell… like old fish, you thought. It's good you noticed the change, and it's understandable to be concerned. To help me figure out what's going on, could you tell me if you've noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… well, it doesn’t hurt, not exactly. Just… itchy sometimes. Down there, of course. And… a little burning when I… you know. When a woman goes to the bathroom. It’s not a lot, but it’s there. And I’ve been… tired. Very tired. But that’s just old age, isn’t it? Everything hurts when you get old.
DOCTOR: Itchy and a little burning when you urinate… okay. And you’ve been feeling tired. It’s good you’re telling me everything, Jimmi. While tiredness can be a sign of aging, it’s important to rule out other causes, especially with the other symptoms you’re describing. Have you noticed any changes in your bathroom habits, like more frequent urination, or difficulty going?
PATIENT: Bathroom habits? Now you're asking me things I don't think about! Hmm… I go when I need to, I suppose. Maybe… maybe a little more often than before. But that could be the water I drink, you know? I like my water. And… no, no difficulty. Just… regular. Old-lady regular. Is that a thing? It probably is. Everything gets regular when you get old. This is a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: It is a lot of questions, I apologize. We just want to get a clear picture of what’s going on. “Old-lady regular” is not a medical term, but I understand what you mean! Okay, so more frequent urination, but no difficulty. Now, have you been sexually active recently?
PATIENT: Goodness gracious! What kind of question is that? I am a respectable woman! I don't discuss such things with… with doctors! That’s… that’s private! Honestly, I’ve been alone for a long, long time. A very long time. This is very uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Oh, Jimmi, I am so sorry. That was inappropriate of me to ask, and I apologize for making you uncomfortable. I didn’t mean to pry, and I should have phrased that differently. Please disregard that question. Let’s move on. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Well. Diabetes? No. High… high what? I get a little dizzy sometimes, but that’s just… old age. And the heat. It’s been very hot lately. Dr. Alvarez used to give me pills for my water, but I don’t remember what for. He retired years ago. A very nice man, Dr. Alvarez. He always listened. You don’t seem to listen very well.
DOCTOR: I apologize if I seem like I’m not listening, Jimmi. I am listening, and I’m trying to gather as much information as possible. It’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be, and I want to be thorough. You mentioned pills for your water… do you still take those pills?
PATIENT: Pills… pills… oh dear. I take so many! For my bones, for my heart, for my… something. I don’t even remember what half of these are for anymore! My daughter brings them over. She’s very organized. This one… this one’s for my water, I think. Yes, this one. I take it every morning. Or maybe it's every other morning... It all blurs together, you know?
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re taking quite a few medications, and it’s understandable that it’s hard to keep track. That’s perfectly alright. To be safe, could you bring all of these medications with you when you come back for your next appointment?
PATIENT: Next appointment? Oh. Are you going to give me more pills? I have so many already! What’s wrong with me? Is it something serious? Is it… is it catching? My daughter visits every week, I don’t want to get her sick.
DOCTOR: Jimmi, please don’t worry. I’m not going to give you more pills without a good reason. Right now, I’m just trying to figure out what’s causing your symptoms. And no, it’s not “catching.” It doesn’t sound like an infection. I think it would be best if I did a quick physical exam, just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical exam? What does that mean? Are you going to poke and prod? I don’t like being poked and prodded! And… and what if you find something bad? I don’t want to know if something is bad. I’m too old for bad news. No. No, I don't think so. I think I just need a good rest. And maybe a cup of tea. This is too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Jimmi. You’re right to be cautious, and I apologize if I made you uncomfortable. A physical exam would just involve me taking a look and listening with my stethoscope. It’s a standard part of a medical evaluation, and it helps me to get a better understanding of what’s going on. However, if you’re not comfortable with that right now, that’s perfectly alright. Perhaps we can start by just talking a little bit more. We can review your symptoms again, and I can explain some possible causes. And if you change your mind about the exam later, we can always schedule another appointment. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Well… talking is alright. I like talking. But no poking and prodding. Not today. So, what are the possible causes? Is it… is it something serious? Like… like cancer? My neighbor, Mrs. Rodriguez, she had cancer. It was very sad.
DOCTOR: It’s good we're talking. And I understand your concern about cancer. It’s natural to worry, but let me assure you, your symptoms aren’t necessarily indicative of cancer. There are several possible causes for your symptoms. One common cause is a vaginal infection, like yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis. These are usually easily treated with medication. Another possibility is a change in hormone levels, especially after menopause. And sometimes, symptoms like these can be caused by skin irritation or dryness. Now, just to be thorough, I would like to ask you about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: High blood pressure? Diabetes? Oh dear, it's all so confusing. Dr. Alvarez… he used to check everything. He was a good doctor. Wait… here! My daughter wrote it down. She’s very organized. There. That should have everything. Or maybe not. I don’t always remember what Dr. Alvarez told me. He talked very fast.
DOCTOR: Thank you, this is very helpful. Okay, it says here you were diagnosed with mild hypertension about ten years ago, and you’ve been taking medication for it since then. You also have a history of osteoarthritis, which explains some of your joint pain. And… it looks like you had a hysterectomy about twenty years ago. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. The hysterectomy… oh, that was a long time ago. I don’t remember much about it, to be honest. Just… a lot of pain. And then… nothing. My daughter said it was the best thing. No more babies, she said. I didn’t want any more babies anyway. It’s just… sometimes I feel… empty. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel that way after a hysterectomy, Jimmi. It's a major surgery, and it can have a significant emotional impact. It's good that you have your daughter to support you. Now, going back to your current symptoms… you mentioned the wetness and the smell. Has the amount of discharge changed recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… changed? I think… I think it’s a little more than usual. And the smell… it’s stronger, definitely stronger. It used to be just a little… off. Now it’s… fishy. Like old fish left out in the sun. My grandson likes to fish, but I don’t eat it. It smells too strong. It’s just… unpleasant. And embarrassing. I don’t want anyone to notice.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's increased recently, and the smell is stronger, described as fishy. That's helpful information. Given your history of hypertension and hysterectomy, and your current symptoms, it's important to rule out a few possibilities. One common cause for these symptoms is bacterial vaginosis, which is an imbalance of bacteria in the vagina. Another possibility is a yeast infection, although the fishy smell is more typical of bacterial vaginosis. To get a definitive diagnosis, I would recommend a simple test to check the pH level of your vaginal discharge. It's a quick and painless procedure, and it can help us determine the best course of treatment. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A test? What kind of test? Are you going to… poke and prod? I don’t like being poked and prodded! No. No, I don’t want any tests. I just want it to go away. Maybe it will go away on its own. Or maybe I just need a good night’s sleep. I don’t want any tests. It’s too much. Too much poking and prodding and testing. I’m too old for this.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Jimmi. You’re right to be cautious, and I respect your decision. However, without a proper diagnosis, it’s difficult to determine the best course of treatment. And sometimes, these conditions can worsen if left untreated. I won’t force you to undergo any tests you’re not comfortable with. But I strongly recommend that you consider it. It's a quick and painless procedure, and it can provide valuable information. If you’re not comfortable with a test today, perhaps we can try a different approach. I can prescribe an oral antibiotic to treat a potential bacterial infection. However, it’s important to understand that this is just a guess, and it may not be effective if the cause is something else. Would you be willing to try that?
PATIENT: Oral antibiotic… no poking and prodding? Maybe… maybe that would be alright. As long as you don’t poke and prod. And if it doesn’t work, I don’t want any tests. Promise? No tests.
DOCTOR: I promise, Jimmi. No tests, unless absolutely necessary. Okay, I’m going to prescribe a course of oral metronidazole. It’s an antibiotic that’s commonly used to treat bacterial vaginosis. You’ll need to take one tablet three times a day for seven days. It’s important to complete the full course of treatment, even if your symptoms improve before then. Here you go. And it’s important to avoid alcohol during the treatment, as it can interact with the medication. If your symptoms don't improve within a week, or if they worsen, please come back and see me. And if you experience any side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, let me know right away. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: No alcohol… I don’t drink much alcohol anyway. Just a little wine with dinner sometimes. And… no poking and prodding? Definitely no poking and prodding?
DOCTOR: Definitely no poking and prodding, Jimmi. I understand your concerns, and I want you to feel comfortable and safe. If you change your mind about anything, or if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other concerns I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… thank you. For not poking and prodding. And for listening. I hope this medicine works. I just want to feel normal again. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jimmi. I hope it works too. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Goodbye, and take care.
