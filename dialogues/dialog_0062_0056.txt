DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. DeCosta. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Though frankly, I wish this didn’t have to be happening. Workplace stress, they said. A young man suggested I come. Honestly, it's all rather… unnecessary. I’ve been a teacher for… well, a very long time. And I assure you, I know my profession.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be frustrating when others suggest a visit, especially when you feel perfectly capable. Still, it’s good you’re here. Workplace stress can manifest in unexpected ways. And it's always best to rule things out. Could you tell me a bit more about what’s been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s just… the students. They lack discipline, respect. And the administration… well, let’s just say they favor… enthusiasm over competence. It’s a long story, and frankly, a tedious one. I mostly feel… tired. A great deal of tiredness. And a little… short-tempered, perhaps. Though that’s more their fault than mine, naturally.
DOCTOR: I can certainly appreciate how frustrating that must be, Mr. Schlatterer. A demanding job and difficult situations can definitely lead to fatigue and irritability. When you say tiredness, is that just feeling generally worn out, or are you finding it hard to stay awake during the day?
PATIENT: Well… both, I suppose. Though mostly the former. Staying awake isn’t the problem. It’s… keeping my focus. I find myself rereading paragraphs, forgetting what I was about to say mid-sentence. It’s…unacceptable. I always prided myself on my sharp mind. And now… it's simply… diminished. Though I doubt it’s anything serious. Probably just… age.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds concerning, and it’s good you’ve noticed these changes. While age can certainly play a role, changes in concentration and memory deserve a closer look. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Good heavens. Where to begin? I've lived a long life, Doctor. A very long life. I’ve had the usual ailments, I suppose. A touch of influenza here and there, a bad back in my youth… nothing significant. My ex-wife, bless her soul – though we didn't get along, naturally – she handled all the details. I really couldn’t tell you about any specific conditions. And frankly, I don't see the relevance. It’s my mind that’s the problem, not my… internal organs.
DOCTOR: I appreciate that, Mr. Schlatterer. And you’re right, your concerns about your mind are the most important thing right now. However, sometimes physical conditions can affect cognitive function, so it's helpful to get a general picture. Do you remember roughly when you last saw a doctor for a general check-up?
PATIENT: A check-up… Let me see… Oh dear. It must have been… decades ago. Perhaps when I was still married? No, no, even before that, I think. Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the faintest idea. I only visit the doctor when absolutely necessary. And this… this is just a waste of time, if you ask me. Young people these days, always worrying about everything. It’s… unsettling.
DOCTOR: I understand. Well, no problem at all. We can certainly proceed without a detailed medical history right now. Let's focus on what’s been happening lately. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Heavens, no. I pride myself on my health. I've never been one for pills and potions. A bit of chamomile tea perhaps, to aid sleep. But that's hardly a medication. And vitamins… well, my ex-wife used to try to get me to take them. Multi-vitamins, I think. But I always forgot. Honestly, Doctor, I barely remember what I had for breakfast. This is becoming quite… tiresome. Are we nearly finished? I have a rather important book I need to re-shelve.
DOCTOR: Yes, we're getting there, Mr. Schlatterer. Just a few more questions. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies? Doctor, I’ve lived eighty-seven years! If I was allergic to something, I’d know it by now. No, no allergies. Perfectly robust constitution, I assure you. Though the dust in the library is rather bothersome. But that's hardly an allergy. It’s… dust. One expects dust in a library. Honestly, are you quite finished? I really must get back to work. The Dewey Decimal System isn’t going to maintain itself.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. We'll move on then. Now, just to get a better understanding of what's going on, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Absolutely not! What for? I’ve told you everything I need to tell you. I’m perfectly healthy, thank you very much. This is… preposterous. I came here because someone suggested I was… stressed. Not because I needed a prodding and poking. No, no, I absolutely refuse. This is a complete waste of my time. I’m leaving now. Good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Schlatterer, please, wait a moment. I understand your reluctance, but a quick exam would just help me rule out any underlying physical causes for your symptoms. It doesn't have to be extensive. Just a basic check of your vital signs, and a brief neurological assessment. I'm concerned about the changes you've described in your concentration and memory, and I want to ensure we're not missing anything. If you're truly adamant about not having an exam, I respect your decision. However, I strongly recommend you reconsider. Without a proper assessment, it's difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms, and we may not be able to provide you with the most appropriate care. If you're not comfortable with an exam here, perhaps we could schedule a consultation with a neurologist?
