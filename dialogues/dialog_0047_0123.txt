DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It's driving me crazy, really. It started a few weeks ago, I think, and it just won’t go away.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, maybe four or five weeks now? It’s all over, mostly my arms and back, but even my legs are getting it now. It’s not… a rash, exactly. No bumps or anything, just…itchy. Really, really itchy. I've been using lotion, but it doesn't seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Lotion, alright. And has anything changed recently, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really. I haven’t started using any new soaps or detergents, and I haven’t been traveling. Oh! Well, I did start gardening again this year. I haven't gardened in a while, but the weather's been nice, so I thought I'd get back to it. Could that be it? I mean, getting dirt on my hands and all?
DOCTOR: Gardening, yes. That could be a factor. Do you use gloves when you’re gardening, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: No, I don’t usually wear gloves, no. I like to feel the soil. My grandmother always said you had to connect with the earth when you garden. Sounds silly now, maybe, but that's what she always did.
DOCTOR: Connecting with the earth is…nice, but it also exposes you to a great many things. Now, besides the itch, are you noticing anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else… well, now that you mention it, my skin feels a little dry, even with the lotion. And sometimes, especially after I’ve been scratching – which is a lot, I’ll admit! – it feels a little…rough. Not scaly, exactly, but just…not smooth. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Roughness, dryness…and how is your energy level generally?
PATIENT: Oh, my energy is… okay, I guess. I'm 70, so things aren't what they used to be! But no, nothing drastically different. I still do my walking, I still see my friends. I haven’t been feeling tired because of the itching, if that’s what you mean. It just… distracts me, you know? It's annoying, more than anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any known allergies, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Not that I know of. I've never really had any serious reactions to anything. Maybe a little bit of hay fever in the spring, but that's it. Nothing that requires medicine or anything like that. I don’t take any medications regularly, either. Oh, wait… I used to be allergic to penicillin, but that was a long time ago. I haven't had it in decades.
DOCTOR: Penicillin, yes, I see that noted in your chart. Good to know. Now, let’s have a look at the skin itself. Please, if you'll just turn around for me.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Here you go, Doctor. Let me know if you need me to adjust anything. It’s probably not much to see, honestly, just a bit red maybe. It doesn’t look bad, it just feels awful.
DOCTOR: Hmm. There’s some mild erythema—that’s redness—and very subtle textural changes. Not significant scaling or weeping, thankfully. No visible hives or lesions. It does appear consistent with a mild irritant dermatitis. Possibly contact dermatitis related to the gardening.
PATIENT: Oh, “dermatitis.” Sounds fancy! So, you think it is the dirt, then? From the garden? That makes sense, I suppose. I've been using the same fertilizer for years though. Could a new batch be different somehow? I wouldn’t know the first thing about it.
DOCTOR: It's possible a new batch of fertilizer could contain an irritant. However, it could also be other plants you’ve been handling. Or even just the consistent exposure to soil, bacteria, and fungi. I’m going to prescribe a topical corticosteroid cream. Apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice daily for two weeks. And, Ms. Cassimatis, I strongly advise you to wear gloves while gardening. Even if it means sacrificing some of that “connection” with the earth. It’s for your own good.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. A cream, that sounds manageable. Gloves… alright, you’re right. I suppose it’s worth it if it stops the itching. A thin layer, twice a day? I can remember that. Is it…a strong cream? I don't want anything that will hurt or make things worse. I have sensitive skin, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s a mild potency steroid cream, Ms. Cassimatis. We’re starting conservatively. If it doesn't provide relief within a week, then we can discuss something stronger. Now, I'll also advise you to avoid scratching as much as possible. I know it's difficult, but it only exacerbates the inflammation. Here you go. Do you have any other concerns today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Avoiding scratching… that’ll be the hardest part! But I’ll try. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I'll get this filled right away.
DOCTOR: Very well. If the condition worsens or doesn't improve within two weeks, please schedule a follow-up appointment. And do try the gloves, Ms. Cassimatis. It really will make a difference. Have a good day.
