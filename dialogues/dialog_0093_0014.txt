DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm… well, my wife, she mostly handles these things, but I think it has to do with… papers. For when you need time off, or… if you can’t work. Something like that. She said I needed something from you, for my job. I'm Ronnald, by the way. Limtiaco. Directors… religious stuff, mostly. It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ronnald. It sounds like you're referring to a medical leave of absence or perhaps a disability evaluation. Your wife is quite right to bring this to medical attention. To properly assist you, I need to understand the situation a little better. Could you tell me what's been going on that prompted you to consider time off from your work as a director, or perhaps led your wife to believe you may need some documentation?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… it’s hard to say exactly. Things just feel… slower, you know? I get tired easier. And my memory… it’s not what it used to be. I forget names, sometimes even faces. It doesn’t happen all the time, but often enough to be… bothersome. It’s been going on for a while, I guess. Months, definitely. Maybe longer. I'm not sure. It just… crept up on me. I still do the work, mind you, but it takes more effort. It’s like wading through water sometimes. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ronnald, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like you're experiencing some changes in your cognitive function and energy levels. Fatigue and memory difficulties can certainly be concerning. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to ask a few more detailed questions, if you don't mind. We'll start with your memory. Could you describe a specific instance where you experienced a memory lapse recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… a specific instance… let me think. Oh! Just last week, we had a meeting with the elders… about the youth program, I think. And… and there was a name. A young man who’s been volunteering. A good lad, very enthusiastic. But his name… it was right on the tip of my tongue. I knew I’d met him before, his mother is a singer in the choir, but… it just wouldn’t come. I had to ask my assistant. It was terribly embarrassing. She’s a lovely girl, but still… it felt awful. I knew I should remember. It’s things like that, you see? Not forgetting grand things, just… the little details. Names, dates… where I put my glasses, even.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ronnald. That's a very helpful example. It sounds like you're experiencing difficulties with recall, specifically names and recent events. These types of memory lapses can be caused by a number of factors. Now, let's talk a bit about the fatigue you mentioned. Could you describe what that feels like for you?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not like being… physically tired, not exactly. It's more… a draining feeling. Like all my energy is being… sucked away. Even after a good night’s sleep, I wake up feeling… heavy. And then throughout the day, it just gets worse. I used to be able to work for hours, no problem. Now, I need to take breaks, often. Just to sit and… gather myself. It’s hard to concentrate when I’m feeling like that, too. Like trying to focus on something through a fog. It’s… unpleasant. It doesn’t stop me from doing things, but it makes everything… harder.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ronnald. That’s a very helpful description. It sounds like you’re experiencing both cognitive fatigue and a general lack of energy. To help me understand the broader picture, could you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me think. My wife says I’ve been more… irritable lately. Snapping at her, things like that. I don’t mean to, of course. I just… get frustrated easily, I suppose. Especially when I can’t remember something, or when I’m trying to concentrate. And… sometimes I feel a little… off balance. Not dizzy, exactly, but just… unsteady on my feet. It doesn’t happen often, but it’s enough to make me cautious. And… oh! And my sleep isn’t as good as it used to be. I wake up several times during the night. Not because of anything specific, just… restless, I guess. It’s… a lot, when you put it all together.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that, Ronnald. It sounds like you’re experiencing a cluster of symptoms that could be related to a number of things. To get a clearer understanding, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… that’s another thing my wife keeps track of! Let me see… I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… nothing serious. And I had my appendix out when I was a young man. Other than that… I’ve always been quite healthy, I think. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for years now. And… oh! A few years back, I had a bout of shingles. Quite painful, that was. But that’s about it, I think. Nothing major. I haven't seen a doctor regularly, to be honest. Only when something was really wrong.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ronnald. That’s helpful. High blood pressure, managed with medication, and a history of shingles. And you haven’t seen a doctor regularly otherwise. Do you currently take any medications for your blood pressure, or any other conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Let me see… my wife has a list, of course. It’s… Lisinopril, I think? For the blood pressure. And I take a small dose of… something for cholesterol. Atorvastatin, perhaps? She’s very good at keeping track of these things. I just take them every morning with breakfast. Nothing else, I think. Just those two. I really should pay more attention, shouldn't I?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Ronnald. Many people find it helpful to have a caregiver manage their medications. Lisinopril and Atorvastatin, both common medications. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My wife has asked me that question many times, and I’ve never had a reaction to anything. No hives, no trouble breathing… nothing. I’ve always been able to eat anything, and I haven’t had any bad reactions to medications. I think. I’ve certainly never told her about any allergies, so I must not have any. She would definitely know about it if I did!
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ronnald. No known allergies. Now, let's talk a little bit about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, stroke, dementia, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history… that’s a tricky one. My mother… she lived a long life, but she had some trouble with her heart in her later years. And my father… he had some sort of… memory problems when he got older. Not dementia, exactly, but he was forgetful, confused sometimes. And… my aunt, on my mother’s side, she had cancer, a long time ago. Lung cancer, I think. Other than that… not that I know of. My family wasn't really one for talking about these things. We mostly kept to ourselves. It's hard to say, really. I don't have much information.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ronnald. A history of heart issues in your mother, some memory problems in your father, and lung cancer in your aunt. That’s helpful information. Finally, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s about it. And definitely no recreational drugs. I’m a religious man, you see. I live a quiet life. Mostly I spend my time with my wife, attending church, and working with the youth group. I keep myself busy, but in a… wholesome way.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ronnald. That gives me a very good understanding of your overall health and lifestyle. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgement. I haven’t had a proper check-up in years, so I suppose it’s overdue anyway. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. Then, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I'll do a brief neurological exam to assess your reflexes, balance, and cognitive function. Your blood pressure is 135/85. That’s a little elevated, but not significantly concerning given your history. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Your heart sounds are regular with no murmurs, rubs, or gallops. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical. Now, I’m going to ask you to close your eyes and follow my finger. Can you tell me what it is?
PATIENT: Hmm… it feels… warm. And round. It’s… a finger, I suppose. Yours, Doctor. Is this a trick question?
DOCTOR: No trick question, Ronnald. That was just to assess your basic sensory perception. Now, I’m going to ask you to repeat three words after me. Remember them, and I’ll ask you to recall them later. The words are: Apple, Table, Penny. Can you repeat those words for me?
PATIENT: Apple… Table… Penny. Yes, I think I’ve got them. Apple, Table, Penny. It’s… a bit of a challenge, to be honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be. But I’ll try my best.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ronnald. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions to assess your cognitive function. What is today’s date?
PATIENT: Hmm… today’s date… let me see… it’s… August… the 2nd? Yes, August 2nd. Is it 2025? I think it is. I hope I’m right. My wife would know for sure.
DOCTOR: That's correct, Ronnald. August 2nd, 2025. And finally, can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. It’s… a doctor’s office, of course. A clinic, I think. In town… somewhere. It’s… a nice office, very clean. I don’t know the exact address, to be honest. I'm not very good with directions, you see. Or names of places.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ronnald. That concludes the brief physical and neurological exam. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings of the exam, it appears you’re experiencing some cognitive difficulties, including memory lapses and mild difficulties with recall and orientation. You also report fatigue and irritability. Given your age, family history, and these symptoms, I suspect we may be dealing with Mild Cognitive Impairment, possibly related to early-stage dementia, or another underlying cause. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or medication side effects. To do that, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, thyroid function tests, vitamin B12 and D levels, and a basic metabolic panel. I’d also like to order a brain scan, such as an MRI or CT scan, to get a better look at the structure of your brain. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. That sounds… serious, Doctor. Dementia… my father… But yes, of course. Whatever you think is best. If that’s what it takes to find out what’s going on, then yes. Blood tests, a brain scan… whatever you need. Just… please let me know what you find out. My wife… she’ll want to know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ronnald. I understand your concern. We'll proceed with the necessary tests to get a clear diagnosis. I’ll arrange for the blood tests to be done today. The brain scan will require a separate appointment, which we can schedule for next week. In the meantime, I recommend that you continue to live as normally as possible. Avoid stressful situations, get plenty of rest, and maintain a healthy diet. It's also important to stay socially active and engage in mentally stimulating activities. I'll review the test results as soon as they're available and contact you and your wife to discuss them in detail. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. I suppose we just need to wait for the tests, then. My wife will probably have a lot of questions, though. She’s very… thorough. But thank you, Doctor. For listening, and for taking the time to help. It’s… reassuring to know that you’re looking into this. Perhaps, if you don’t mind, when you contact us, could you explain the results in… simple terms? I don’t want to get overwhelmed with medical jargon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ronnald. I understand. I will make sure to explain the results in a clear and simple manner, avoiding any unnecessary medical jargon. And I’m happy to answer any questions you or your wife may have. Here is a written request for the blood tests and the referral for the brain scan. Please schedule the brain scan as soon as possible. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or experience any new symptoms. It was a pleasure meeting you today, Ronnald. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to discussing the test results with you soon.
