DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Meigs. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi. Thank you, Doctor Havird. It’s my back. It’s been really, really bad. Worse than usual, I think. It started a few days ago, but it’s not getting better. It hurts to even… well, to even sit, really.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. “Back pain, worsening over a few days.” Right. And you say it’s worse than usual… can you describe what “usual” is like for you?
PATIENT: Well… I had cancer a long time ago. They took some things out, and it’s been okay for a while, but my back always… aches. Like a dull ache, most of the time. I can usually work with it, you know? I work at the factory. But this… this is different. It’s sharp. And it goes down my leg sometimes.
DOCTOR: “Sharp pain radiating down the leg…” Okay. And how long ago was this cancer treatment?
PATIENT: Oh, a long time. Maybe… fifteen years ago? It was breast cancer. They did surgery and… radiation, I think. It was a while ago, so I forget some of the details. But the doctors said it was all good after that. They checked me every year for a long time, and then… less often. I still go, but not as much.
DOCTOR: Right, fifteen years ago, breast cancer, treated with surgery and radiation. And you've been followed up since then. Okay. And this pain… is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes. But it’s been more come than go the last few days. Like, even when I’m trying to rest, it’s there. It’s just… a constant ache with sharp pains on top of it. Especially when I try to stand up or bend over.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you tried anything for it so far?
PATIENT: Yes. I took some… Tylenol, I think. The regular kind. It didn’t really help much. And I tried putting a hot pack on it, but that just made it feel a little better for a little while. Nothing seems to really take the edge off.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let me just pull up your records here… hmm. Alright. And are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in your leg, or any weakness?
PATIENT: Sometimes… yes. A little tingling in my toes, mostly. And my leg feels… heavy sometimes. Not all the time, but when the pain is really bad. It's hard to explain. Like it’s hard to lift it up.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in the toes, heaviness in the leg with the pain. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder habits?
PATIENT: Oh… no. Everything is… normal there. I haven't noticed anything different. Sorry, that’s a… personal question, right?
DOCTOR: It is, but it’s important to rule things out. Just checking. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, okay?
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I just want it to stop hurting.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on your stomach for me, please. I’m going to start by just feeling along your spine and checking your range of motion. Okay, I'm noticing some tenderness right here… and a bit of limited range of motion when bending forward. And when I lift your leg straight up like this… does that cause any pain radiating down your leg?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, that hurts. A lot. And… yes, lifting my leg like that… that sends a sharp pain all the way down my leg. It’s the same pain I’ve been feeling.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you’re likely experiencing a radiculopathy – meaning a nerve root is being compressed or irritated. Given your history of cancer and surgery, and the location of the pain, we need to be a little cautious. It’s possible this is related to previous treatment, or something new. I'm going to order an MRI of your lumbar spine to get a better look at the nerves and discs. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and an anti-inflammatory to help with the pain. And I want you to avoid any heavy lifting or bending. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: MRI… okay. That sounds… serious. Is it bad? And muscle relaxant… will that make me sleepy? I need to go to work, you know? I don't want to lose my job.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily bad, Ms. Meigs. It’s just the best way to see what’s going on. And yes, muscle relaxants can sometimes cause drowsiness, but it varies from person to person. We'll start with a low dose. If it makes you too sleepy, you can always cut it back. Look, I understand you need to work. But it's important to take care of yourself, and if you push yourself too hard, you could make things worse. I'm going to write a note for your employer explaining that you have some back pain and may need to avoid heavy lifting for a bit. I also want you to follow up with a specialist, a neurosurgeon, to review the MRI results and discuss treatment options. I’ll give you a referral. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Okay… a neurosurgeon. That sounds… scary. But I guess if you think it’s best. And a note for work… that would be good. Thank you. I just… I don’t want to be a bother. I just want the pain to go away.
DOCTOR: Alright, here’s the referral to Dr. Chen. He’s a good neurosurgeon. And here’s the note for your employer. As for being a bother, that’s what I’m here for. I’m also going to write you a prescription for the muscle relaxant and the anti-inflammatory. Take them as directed, and if the pain gets worse, or you develop any numbness or weakness, call my office immediately. Any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor Havird. I appreciate you taking the time. I hope… I hope it’s not too bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. We’ll see what the MRI shows. Try to rest, Ms. Meigs. And don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns. .
PATIENT: Okay. I will. Thank you again. .
