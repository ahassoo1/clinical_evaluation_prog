DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Um... well, I have been coughing up some blood. It scared me very much, so I thought I should come see someone. It’s… not a lot, but it is definitely there.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Weichers. I understand. Coughing up blood, even a small amount, is definitely something we need to investigate. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a little more about the cough?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… it started maybe two weeks ago? At first, it was just a normal cough, like a cold. But then, maybe five days ago, I noticed… the red. It happens mostly in the morning, when I first wake up. Sometimes, if I cough very hard later in the day, it happens then too. It is not every time I cough, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started as a typical cold then progressed to include blood about five days ago, primarily in the morning, but occasionally with harder coughing throughout the day. And it’s not with every cough. That’s helpful to know. Can you describe the blood?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. Um… it is bright red. Not dark. And it is… mixed with the mucus. Not… a lot, like I said. Maybe a teaspoon each time? It is… difficult to explain. Not like a nosebleed, just… in the spit. I’m sorry, I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Weichers. Bright red blood mixed with mucus, about a teaspoon each time, primarily in the morning. Okay. Have you had any other symptoms alongside the cough?
PATIENT: Yes. Um… I have been very tired. More tired than usual. And I think… maybe a little short of breath? Not all the time, just… when I walk up stairs, or if I try to do something quickly. No fever, though. I checked my temperature every day. It is always normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and some shortness of breath with exertion, but no fever. That's good to know. Now, let's go over some general medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. When I was a little girl, I had bronchitis once. But that was a very long time ago. And… oh! My husband, he passed away last year from… heart problems. But I don't have heart problems. I have been generally very healthy. The doctor always said so. I did have a very bad flu two years ago, but I recovered fully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of bronchitis in childhood, a recent bad flu two years ago that you recovered from, and your husband’s heart condition. Thank you. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the flu?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No surgeries. No other hospital visits. I’ve always been… lucky, I think. I broke my arm when I was a child, but that was it. Just a cast. Nothing serious. I really haven’t been to the doctor much over the years.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations beyond a broken arm as a child. Good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not take any medications. Not even vitamins. I try to eat healthy, so I don’t think I need them. Sometimes I take something for a headache, but that is very rare. Just… regular pain relievers, like ibuprofen.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just occasional ibuprofen for headaches. And finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not have any allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. My husband was allergic to peanuts, but I am not. I think that is everything?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Weichers. No known allergies. That's good. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and take a look at your throat. Then, based on what I hear and see, we can discuss potential causes and next steps. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds perfectly okay. Please, go ahead. I want to find out what is happening. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Weichers, please take a deep breath in… and out… good. And again… In… and out… Okay. Your heart rate is a little elevated, but otherwise normal. I’m hearing some mild wheezing in your lungs, mostly on the left side. Your throat looks a little red, but no obvious signs of infection. Based on what I’m hearing, and your history of coughing up blood, we need to investigate further. There are several possibilities, ranging from a mild bronchitis to something more serious. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a sputum test – that's a sample of the mucus you’re coughing up – to check for any infection or other abnormalities. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… wise. Please, do both things. An X-ray and the… sputum test. I want to know what is going on. I am a little scared, but I trust you. Will the X-ray… show everything?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to be scared, Ms. Weichers. We're just taking these steps to get a clear diagnosis and rule out anything serious. An X-ray will give us a good look at your lungs and heart, to see if there are any signs of pneumonia, tumors, or other abnormalities. The sputum test will help us identify any bacteria or viruses that might be causing the infection. I'm going to write an order for both tests, and the nurse will help you schedule them. They can usually be done at the imaging center across the street. Do you have any questions about the tests themselves?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. The nurse can explain it to me, I’m sure. Just… how long will it take to get the results? I’m very anxious, and I just want to know what is happening.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Weichers. We'll get these results back as quickly as possible. Typically, the X-ray results come back within a few hours, and the sputum test usually takes 24 to 48 hours, as they need to grow any potential bacteria. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild cough suppressant to help manage the coughing, and I recommend you get plenty of rest and drink lots of fluids. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. Do you have any questions about the cough suppressant, or anything else before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That sounds… very good. Rest and fluids… and the cough medicine. I can do that. Thank you very much for listening to me and for being so kind. I feel a little better now, just knowing we are doing something. Is there anything I should avoid in the meantime? Like certain foods or activities?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your anxiety. In the meantime, there aren’t any specific foods you need to avoid. Just try to eat a healthy, balanced diet. Avoid strenuous activities that make you short of breath, and definitely avoid smoking or being around smoke. It’s also a good idea to avoid people who are sick to prevent any potential infections. The nurse will come in shortly to give you the prescription and schedule the tests. If you experience any worsening symptoms – like a high fever, severe chest pain, or difficulty breathing – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is everything. Thank you again. You have been very helpful. I will listen to the nurse, and I will take care of myself. I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Weichers. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns. We’re here to help. Get some rest, and I’ll see you soon. Have a good day, and take care.
