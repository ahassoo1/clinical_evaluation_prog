DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Engelhaupt. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you're a new patient with our clinic. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Doctor…GonzalezPerez, is it? Honestly, it’s all rather…procedural, isn’t it? New area, new doctors. My husband insisted I come for a “check-up.” Something about Medicare requiring it. I suppose it’s just a general…looking over. I haven’t been ill, if that’s what you’re asking. Just…settling in. And filling out endless forms. Is that all there is to it?
DOCTOR: I understand your…frustration, Ms. Engelhaupt. While Medicare may necessitate certain preventative measures, a thorough examination is always beneficial, regardless. It allows us to establish a baseline and address any potential concerns before they become problematic. Now, while you haven’t specifically mentioned being “ill,” can you tell me if you've experienced any changes in your health recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Goodness. At my age? Everything changes. My knees ache more, certainly. And I seem to nap…rather frequently these days. Is that what you mean? It’s hardly a cause for alarm. I’ve always been…delicate. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, naturally. But I have glasses. Honestly, Doctor, are we going to spend the entire morning cataloging the infirmities of old age?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Engelhaupt, that is not our intention. However, these “infirmities,” as you call them, can be indicative of underlying issues. The knee pain, for instance – is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. It comes and goes. Mostly when I…when I move. Or when it’s damp. It’s the weather, Doctor. Everyone knows damp weather is bad for the joints. My mother always said so. Are you going to ask me about my mother now? Because frankly, I’ve already told this story dozens of times. It’s… tedious. Just put down “aches” and let’s move on. I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: Very well. However, to ensure a comprehensive evaluation, I must ask a few more questions. We'll try to be brief. Have you noticed any swelling or redness in your knees along with the aches?
PATIENT: Swelling? I suppose…a little. It’s difficult to tell with these old bones. Everything seems a bit…puffy these days. Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t been examining my knees for redness. I have better things to do. Are you a specialist in geriatric complaints, or are you expecting me to diagnose myself? This is…rather unhelpful. And a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Engelhaupt, I am a fully qualified physician. A little swelling can be significant. Now, beyond the knees, have you experienced any pain in other joints – your hands, wrists, or ankles, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. Well, yes, actually. Now that you mention it, my fingers are a bit stiff in the mornings. And sometimes they ache. But that’s just…arthritis, isn’t it? Everyone gets arthritis when they get old. It's hardly news. My sister had it terribly. Needed special…contraptions to open jars. I'm not at that stage yet, thankfully. Honestly, are we building a medical history of my entire family now? This is preposterous.
DOCTOR: Right. And is this pain constant, or does it come and go like the knee pain?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. It comes and goes. It’s worse when I… when I’m doing something with my hands. Knitting, mostly. I enjoy knitting. But it does make my fingers ache. Is that a crime now, Doctor? Enjoying a harmless hobby? Honestly, I’m beginning to feel like I’m on trial for simply…existing. Can we please move on? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Very well. To conclude the initial assessment, could you please tell me about any medications you are currently taking, and any allergies you may have?
PATIENT: Oh, heavens. Medications… let me think. My husband handles all of that, you see. He’s very organized. I take…a little pill for my blood pressure, I believe. And something for my…cholesterol, perhaps? Honestly, I can’t recall the names. They all sound so…scientific. And allergies? Not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite robust, despite everything. Except for the occasional…sensitivity to dust. But that’s hardly an allergy, is it? Honestly, Doctor, I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. Can we just say “takes medications as prescribed” and be done with it? I really must insist. This has taken quite long enough.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Engelhaupt. Just a few quick physical observations, if you’ll permit. Could you please sit back down for a moment?
PATIENT: Oh, really? Must I? Honestly, Doctor, I fail to see the point. I’m an old woman. What exactly are you expecting to find? But very well. Get it over with. Just please be quick. I have a luncheon. And I haven’t even started getting ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Engelhaupt. Your heart sounds…regular, though a bit faint. Your lungs are clear, but breathing is somewhat shallow. I note some slight tremor in your hands and a restricted range of motion in your neck. I’d also like to check your reflexes and a quick neurological assessment. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Neurological assessment? Honestly! Are you implying something is wrong with my…my brain? I assure you, Doctor, my mind is perfectly sharp. Perhaps a little…forgetful at times, but perfectly functional. I have no intention of being subjected to a…a brain examination. This is outrageous! I believe I’ve had enough. I came for a simple check-up, not a…a medical inquisition. I think I’ll be taking my leave now. And I highly recommend you find a new patient.
DOCTOR: Ms. Engelhaupt, please, sit down. I am simply following standard protocol to ensure a complete assessment. It’s not an accusation, simply due diligence. But very well. If you are unwilling to proceed, we can conclude the examination. However, given your report of aches, stiffness, and limited range of motion, I recommend a referral to a specialist in rheumatology for further evaluation. It is best to rule out any underlying conditions. Would you be amenable to that?
