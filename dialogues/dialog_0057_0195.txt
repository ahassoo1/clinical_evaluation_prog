DOCTOR: Good morning, Janeth. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s…fine to meet you too, I suppose. Well, it's not a real problem, you understand. My daughter, she said I should come. She worries too much. I just...I wanted a card. A “Get Well” card, or one of those encouraging ones. You know, something nice to put on the fridge. It's just…a little pick-me-up. Not like I'm sick sick.
DOCTOR: I see. So, your daughter is concerned and suggested you come in for a check-up, and you're hoping for a little reassurance, perhaps?
PATIENT: Reassurance? Well, I don't need reassurance. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. A good life. But my daughter, she's always saying I don't take care of myself. Honestly, she treats me like she’s the mother and I’m the child! But she paid for the visit, so…I figured I’d let you write a nice card. Something with flowers, maybe? Not too flashy though. I prefer tasteful things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re generally feeling well, but your daughter has some concerns. We can absolutely write a lovely card for you with flowers – tasteful, of course. But even if you’re feeling well, it's always a good idea to do a quick check-up, just to be sure everything is alright. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: A “quick check-up”? Honestly, Doctor, I haven't been to a doctor in…well, a very long time. I don’t really do check-ups. It's a waste of time, if you ask me. But… if you must. Just don't poke and prod too much. And no needles, absolutely no needles. I detest needles. Are you going to listen to my heart? That always makes me anxious.
DOCTOR: Of course. We can definitely take it slow, and I promise no unnecessary poking or prodding. And absolutely no needles today if you prefer. We can start by just talking about how you've been feeling overall. And yes, I would like to listen to your heart and lungs, if that’s alright – it’s a quick and simple part of a general check-up. We can skip it if it makes you too anxious, but it does give us a good baseline. Before we get to that, could you tell me a little bit about any health problems you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, past health problems…well, let me think. Nothing serious, you understand. When I was a girl, I had the measles, of course. Everyone did. And a bit of…stomach trouble, now and then. But I always recovered. My mother, she had a weak heart, but I don’t think I inherited that. I’ve always been strong. Really, I don't believe in dwelling on things that happened a long time ago. What good does it do? Are you writing all this down? It seems like a lot of fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am writing everything down, Janeth. It’s important to get a complete picture of your health history. Even things that seem minor can be helpful. So, measles as a child and some occasional stomach trouble. And your mother had a weak heart, you mentioned. Have you ever been diagnosed with any conditions, like high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Oh, goodness, no! I eat perfectly well. Not too much sugar, you know. I prefer savory things. My husband, he likes sweets, but I don’t. And blood pressure… I don’t know about blood pressure. No one ever mentioned it. I’ve never had any trouble with my blood, as far as I know. Honestly, Doctor, I think your daughter is sending you on a wild goose chase. I feel perfectly fine. A bit tired sometimes, perhaps. But that’s just…life, isn’t it? You’re writing all this down, aren’t you? Are you going to ask me about my bowels next? It’s terribly impolite.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Janeth. I apologize if my questions feel intrusive, but it’s important to ask about everything to get a complete picture of your health. And you’re right, your daughter may be overly concerned, but it’s always better to be thorough. Yes, I was going to ask about your bowels, but we can skip that if you’re uncomfortable. But sometimes changes in bowel habits can indicate underlying issues. It’s perfectly normal to ask about these things. Let's move on to something else. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Oh, heavens no! I’ve never had a surgery in my life. I’ve always been very careful, you see. I avoid unnecessary risks. My mother…she had a gallbladder removed, a long time ago. But that was before my time. And it was a terrible ordeal, so I’ve always been very cautious about anything medical. Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel quite anxious now. All these questions…it’s making me quite nervous. Can’t we just get to the card? I really just want a nice card. With flowers, preferably. Not too bright, you understand. Something…subtle.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right. We can absolutely get to the card. I apologize for making you feel anxious, Janeth. It wasn’t my intention. I just wanted to make sure I had a complete understanding of your health. Before we write the card, would you mind if I just quickly check your blood pressure and listen to your heart?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I told you, I don’t do check-ups. And I don’t want my blood pressure taken. It’s…it’s a violation, Doctor. Honestly. My daughter is going to hear about this. She shouldn't send me to doctors who try to…to examine me when I haven’t even asked for it! Just write the card, please. With flowers. Pastel colors. And something encouraging. That’s all I ask. Is that so much to ask? Really, I think I'm going to need a cup of tea after this. It's terribly stressful.
DOCTOR: You're right to feel stressed, and I apologize for pushing the issue. I respect your wishes, Janeth. We will skip the check-up. Let's focus on the card, then. Pastel colors and something encouraging. I can certainly do that. How about one of these?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Those are…rather garish, aren’t they? Too bright. And that one with the kittens? Really, Doctor. I’m a grown woman, not a little girl. Do you have anything…more sophisticated? Something with landscapes, perhaps? Or flowers…but not those neon pink ones. Something muted. And that message… “Thinking of you”? It’s terribly generic. I would like something more…personal. Something that acknowledges that I’m perfectly fine, but my daughter worries too much. Can you write something like that? Honestly, this is proving to be quite a difficult task. It's just a card, isn't it?
DOCTOR: You're right, it shouldn’t be this difficult. My apologies. I seem to be having trouble finding something to your liking. How about this one?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s…better. Yes, that’s much more tasteful. The landscape is quite nice. Not too flashy. And the blank interior is good. I can’t abide pre-written messages. Alright, Doctor. You can write this. But listen carefully. I want you to write: “To my dear daughter, I am perfectly healthy. Please stop worrying.” And then, underneath that, add: “With love, your mother.” Do you think you can manage that? And please, write neatly. My daughter is very particular about handwriting. And no exclamation points! They’re terribly vulgar.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Janeth. I can certainly manage that. “To my dear daughter, I am perfectly healthy. Please stop worrying.” And “With love, your mother.” No exclamation points, and neat handwriting. Consider it done. Here you go. I hope your daughter appreciates it. Is there anything else I can do for you today?
PATIENT: Hmm…yes. That’s…acceptable. The handwriting is a little shaky, but it will do. And the message is perfectly clear. My daughter should be quite pleased. No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Just…thank you. I suppose. Although, honestly, it shouldn’t have taken this long just to write a simple card. Well, goodbye. And please, don’t send me to doctors again unless absolutely necessary. It’s terribly stressful.
