DOCTOR: Hi Sharifa, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor. Though I have to say, this office is… cozy. Anyway, it's my legs. They just… gave out on me, practically. After a nasty cold, of course. Not that colds usually do that to a person. I mean, I keep myself healthy. It’s just…strange.
DOCTOR: Okay, legs giving out after a cold – that is strange. And you’re right to question it. Let's unpack this a little bit. When you say "gave out," can you describe exactly what happened?
PATIENT: Honestly? It felt like jelly. Like someone removed the bones, you know? I was just walking – going to the grocery store, very normal – and suddenly my knees buckled. I didn’t fall, thankfully. I grabbed onto a shopping cart, but it was a very undignified moment. Both legs at the same time. It wasn’t painful, just…weak. Completely unreliable. And it happened a couple of times after that, too, though I managed to catch myself each time. It's not something that happens to people who take care of themselves, honestly.
DOCTOR: Right, “jelly legs” and buckling knees, happening several times after the cold. That’s helpful. And no pain, just weakness. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me how long ago you had this cold?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it was about ten days ago now, maybe a little more. The usual – sniffles, a sore throat, a bit of a cough. Nothing serious, I didn’t even bother with a doctor for it. I just rested, drank plenty of fluids, you know, the normal things. It was gone in about five days, then this started a couple of days after that. It's just… inconvenient, really. I have a tour group coming next week. I cannot be laid up with weak legs.
DOCTOR: Okay, so the weakness started a few days after your cold symptoms resolved. And you’re concerned about your tour group – understandably so. I'm going to check your reflexes and strength, and then we’ll talk about what might be going on. Do you have any other symptoms at all – any numbness, tingling, or changes in your skin?
PATIENT: No numbness, no tingling. Skin feels… normal. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a very observant person. I notice these things. It’s just weakness. And frankly, a little embarrassment. I’m used to being the one leading the tours, not needing to be helped around. I suppose… maybe a little bit of fatigue, but that could be from worrying about this whole situation. It’s all very disruptive.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other neurological symptoms, just weakness and some worry – that's good to know. Let's do a quick exam of your legs and feet, then we’ll discuss potential causes. Could you please sit on the examination table and swing your legs down?
PATIENT: Alright. Though I must say, this isn’t very comfortable, is it? I hope whatever is wrong isn’t serious. I have a very busy schedule, you know. I really don’t have time for a lot of tests or… whatever it is people do. Just tell me what’s going on and how quickly I can get back to normal.
DOCTOR: Okay, your reflexes are a little diminished, and there’s some mild weakness in your ankles and feet. Your gait is a little unsteady, but not significantly so. Do you have any history of diabetes or any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Absolutely not! I eat very healthily, I maintain a good weight. My mother had some issues with her blood pressure, but that was when she got older. And I don't take any regular medications. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, if needed. I really pride myself on taking care of my health. I just don't understand what’s happening. It’s completely out of character.
DOCTOR: Okay, no history of diabetes, no medications, and you're generally very healthy. That's helpful. Given your history and the timing of your symptoms – weakness following a cold, diminished reflexes – it's possible this could be something called Guillain-Barré syndrome, or GBS. It's a rare autoimmune condition sometimes triggered by infections, and it causes weakness and tingling. However, it's important not to jump to conclusions. To rule out other possibilities and get a clearer diagnosis, I’d like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, and a nerve conduction study. This will help us assess your nerve function and see if there’s any inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Guillain-Barré… sounds dreadful. Autoimmune? Honestly, Doctor, that sounds rather… serious. And blood tests? A nerve conduction study? That sounds… unpleasant. Is there anything else it could be? Something less… dramatic? I really don’t see why a simple cold would cause something like that. I mean, I’m a professional. I need to be on my feet. And I have people relying on me. Are you absolutely certain these tests are necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Sharifa. It does sound alarming, and I wouldn’t suggest these tests if I didn’t think they were important to get a clear picture of what’s going on. GBS is rare, but it’s important to rule it out, especially given the timing of your symptoms. Other possibilities include vitamin deficiencies, particularly B12, or a more common nerve issue. However, those usually don’t present with the sudden onset of weakness after an infection like this. The blood tests are relatively simple, and the nerve conduction study… isn't comfortable, I'll be honest, but it's not usually painful. It involves placing small electrodes on your skin to measure the electrical activity in your nerves. It will give us a much clearer understanding of whether there’s any nerve damage. We can start with the blood tests, and if those are inconclusive, we can discuss the nerve conduction study. What do you think?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood tests. But I expect a quick turnaround. I don’t have time to sit around waiting for results. And if those don’t show anything, I’m not doing any of these… conduction studies. Honestly, it sounds barbaric. And please, Doctor, don't tell me it's the only way to know. I'm a very practical person. There must be something else. Just get me back on my feet, quickly. And thoroughly.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Sharifa. I'll order the blood tests immediately, and we'll do our best to get the results back as quickly as possible. I’ll also write you a prescription for a B12 supplement, just in case a deficiency is contributing to your symptoms. I’ll explain the results as soon as they’re available, and we can discuss the next steps based on what we find. We'll try to find a solution that works for you and your schedule. And if the blood tests are inconclusive, we can explore other options before considering the nerve conduction study. In the meantime, please try to avoid any strenuous activity and let me know if your symptoms worsen or if you develop any new ones, like numbness or tingling. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. Just…get the tests done. And quickly. Honestly, the thought of missing my tour group is far more concerning than anything you’ve mentioned. This is all very inconvenient. But I suppose… I suppose that’s what doctors are for. Just… don’t keep me waiting. And tell me when I can expect to hear back. Specifically. I need to plan.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Sharifa. I'll make sure the lab prioritizes your tests, and I expect we’ll have results within 24-48 hours. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, if anything changes, please don't hesitate to call the office. Here’s the lab requisition and the prescription. And please, try not to worry too much. We'll figure this out.
