DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bombara. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't usually bother with doctors, to be honest. But… well, I’ve been, uh, losing blood. Not a little, either. It’s coming from… down there. It started a couple days ago. Honestly, it's a mess. And it’s not something a man likes to talk about, you know? Is this something serious?
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. I understand it’s not easy to discuss these things, Mr. Gentz, and you’ve done the right thing coming in. Losing blood is always something we need to investigate. A couple of days ago… can you tell me a bit more about when it started, and how much blood you’ve been losing?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, a couple of days. Maybe Tuesday? It wasn’t much at first, just… spotting, really. Thought it was nothing. But then yesterday it got worse. And this morning… well, let's just say I needed a couple of extra pairs of underwear. It’s… dark, if that makes any sense. Not bright red. More like… coffee grounds. Does that tell you anything? I don’t know what all those doctor words mean, honestly. I just know it's not right. And it's tiring, to be honest. I feel weak.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tuesday… and increasing since then. Dark blood, like coffee grounds, you said. And you’re feeling weak… that's important. Dark, coffee-ground-like blood can sometimes indicate bleeding higher up in the digestive tract, but we need to figure out where it's coming from, specifically. Do you have any abdominal pain, or cramping?
PATIENT: Pain? Not really pain, exactly. More like… discomfort. A sort of dull ache, low down. It comes and goes. And, uh, I’ve been… gassy. A lot. More than usual. Look, is this something I got from eating bad food? Because I had some… questionable lamb last week. Could it be that simple? I really don't want a bunch of tests if it's just a bad stomach. My wife… she would have hated this. She always worried about everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, discomfort, a dull ache… and increased gas. It's good you mention the lamb, we always consider recent food intake. While it could be related to something you ate, the dark blood and your feeling of weakness are concerning enough that we need to investigate further. Just to be thorough. Do you have any history of stomach problems, like ulcers, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Ulcers? No, never. Not that I know of. My wife always took care of all that doctor stuff. She was the healthy one, always eating right, always going for check-ups. I just… ate. And worked. She said I needed to slow down. Always said I was pushing myself too hard. Look, is this going to involve… sticking things up my backside? Because I really don’t like that idea. I’ve heard stories… I don’t want to be poked and prodded if it can be avoided. Honestly, I just want to know if it’s serious and what I need to do to stop it.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gentz. We will do everything we can to make you comfortable, and I won’t do anything without explaining it to you first. We might need to do a physical exam, which would involve checking your abdomen and possibly a rectal exam to assess the source of the bleeding. It's the most direct way to get information, but we can discuss alternatives if you're very uncomfortable. Before we get to that, though, let's talk about your overall health. Do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Never really needed any. A painkiller now and then for my back, but that's it. Just over-the-counter stuff. Ibuprofen, that sort of thing. And I used to smoke, but I quit… oh, maybe ten years ago? My wife… she made me. Said it was killing me. I haven’t touched a cigarette since. She was always right, you know? Always looking out for me. It's just… hard, without her. But back to the blood… is it definitely something serious? You said you were concerned. What exactly are you concerned about? Is it cancer? Is that what you think?
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, past smoking history. And yes, it’s good you asked directly. The dark blood could indicate a few things, and it’s important to rule out anything serious. While it could be something as simple as a hemorrhoid or a minor irritation, it can also be a sign of bleeding in the stomach or intestines. We need to find out the source of the bleeding to determine the cause. Cancer is certainly one possibility, but there are many other less serious causes we need to rule out first. To get a better idea of what's going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, and then I’ll order some blood tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests… fine. I suppose. I don’t see any way around it, do I? Physical exam… I really don’t like the sound of that, but… alright. Just… be quick about it, please. And explain what you’re doing as you go. Don't just poke and prod without telling me. And… please, try not to find anything terrible. I’m not sure I could handle much more bad news right now. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Gentz. I will explain everything as I go, and I'll be as gentle as possible. We’ll start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope, and then I’ll gently press on different areas to check for any tenderness. After that, a rectal exam will help me to assess the source of the bleeding. It won’t be pleasant, but it’s important. Just lie down on the table, and we'll take it one step at a time.
PATIENT: Just… get on with it, then. The sooner this is over, the better. And please, try not to make a mess. I hate hospitals… and doctors. They always smell like… death.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I’m listening to your abdomen now. Sounds are present in all four quadrants… somewhat diminished, but present. Now I’m gently pressing on your abdomen. There’s a little tenderness here, on your left side, but nothing too concerning. Are you feeling any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: A little. Not… sharp pain, exactly. More like a dull ache. It’s the same ache I told you about earlier. It comes and goes. And it's worse when I… well, when I need to go to the bathroom. It feels… full, sort of. And uncomfortable. Just… hurry up, please. I don't like lying here. It reminds me of… bad times.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Just a little discomfort, and related to bowel movements. Now, I’m going to put on a glove and perform a rectal exam. This will allow me to check for any abnormalities, such as hemorrhoids or other sources of bleeding. It may be uncomfortable, but I’ll be as gentle as possible. Please let me know if you feel any pain. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Just… get it over with. Quickly. I really, really don't like this. And… don't say anything, just do it. I don't want to hear details. Just… be done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I’m just going to start now. I do feel some stool present. There are some small, internal hemorrhoids, which could be contributing to some minor bleeding, but they don't seem to be the primary source. I don’t feel any masses or other abnormalities. The stool is… dark and tarry, which is consistent with the coffee-ground-like appearance you described. Given your symptoms and the findings of the exam, I'm concerned about the possibility of bleeding higher up in your digestive tract. I'm going to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count and a stool test to check for hidden blood. We may also need to consider a colonoscopy to visualize the entire colon and identify the source of the bleeding. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? You mean… sticking a camera up there? Look, is it cancer? Just tell me straight. Is that what you're going to say? Because I need to know. My wife… she always said I should get checked. She was always worried about something. And now… Just… tell me the truth. Please. Is it cancer? And if it is… how bad is it? I need to know. I just want to know. Don’t sugarcoat it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your fear, and you deserve an honest answer. At this point, I cannot tell you definitively whether or not you have cancer. The dark stool and the bleeding are concerning, and they could be a sign of cancer. However, they can also be caused by other, less serious conditions, such as ulcers, polyps, or inflammation. The colonoscopy is the best way to determine the cause of the bleeding. It allows us to visualize the entire colon and take a biopsy if necessary. I know it’s not a pleasant procedure, but it’s essential for getting a diagnosis. Right now, we need to focus on getting those tests done. We will start with the blood work to assess your overall health and check for signs of anemia. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps, including the colonoscopy. I will be with you every step of the way, and we will discuss all of your options. I understand this is a frightening time, and I want to assure you that you are not alone. Do you want me to explain the blood tests in more detail?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t need details. Just… do the tests. Get it over with. Find out what’s wrong. If it’s cancer… then I guess I’ll deal with it. But… if it is… what are the options? Surgery? Radiation? Chemotherapy? My wife… she went through chemotherapy. It nearly killed her. I don’t want to end up like that. Just… tell me what to expect. If it’s bad… what am I looking at? How long… how long do I have? I need to know. I just… I need to be prepared. For the worst. Is there a point in even trying… if it’s that bad? Just… be honest with me, doctor. Please. Don’t sugarcoat it. I can handle the truth. I think.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, your feelings are completely valid, and it’s brave of you to ask these difficult questions. I want to be as honest with you as possible, but it's important to remember that we don't have a diagnosis yet. Speculating about treatment options or prognosis before we know what we’re dealing with would be irresponsible. However, I can tell you generally what the options might be if it is cancer. Surgery is often used to remove tumors. Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. The specific treatment plan would depend on the type and stage of the cancer, as well as your overall health. I understand your concerns about chemotherapy, especially given your wife's experience. There have been many advancements in cancer treatment since then, and there are often ways to manage the side effects. Right now, the most important thing is to get a diagnosis. Once we have the results of the blood tests and the colonoscopy, we can discuss your options in detail and develop a treatment plan that is right for you. I will be with you every step of the way, and I will answer all of your questions honestly and compassionately. You are not alone in this. Do you want me to explain the blood tests in more detail now?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t need details about the tests. Just… get them done. And then… the colonoscopy. Just… get it over with. And… if it’s bad… who do I talk to? About… arrangements? About… what happens after? I don’t want to bother anyone. Everyone… everyone’s moved on. It’s just me. I don’t want to be a burden. Just… tell me when I can schedule the tests. That’s all. Let’s just… get it over with. The sooner I know… the sooner I can… deal with it. Whatever “it” is.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I’ve ordered the complete blood count and the stool test. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I'll also have my nurse schedule a consultation with a gastroenterologist to discuss the colonoscopy. Regarding your question about arrangements… we have a social worker here at the clinic who can help you with those types of things. She can provide information about financial assistance, hospice care, and other resources. And if you'd like, I can also connect you with a grief counselor. Here’s her contact information. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. And remember, you’re not alone in this. We’re here to support you. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Just… get the tests done. That’s all I ask. Thank you… I guess. For… everything. I think… I think that’s all. Just… let me know when the tests are ready. And… thank you. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I will be in touch as soon as the results are available. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. .
