DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Schwer, yes. Seventy-three… Hmm. Well, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: My… family. Lots of… bad things. My mother, she… heart trouble. My brother, cancer. I… I want to make sure I don't get it, you know? Just… peace of mind. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, family history is… relevant. Though, frankly, anxiety about inherited conditions is quite common. "Peace of mind" isn't a medical term, Mr. Schwer. Let’s try to be specific. Are you experiencing any symptoms currently?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… feeling sick? No. Not really. I… I feel okay. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but who doesn't? I just… worry. It’s hard to explain. I don't feel bad, but… what if something's starting? That's what I'm afraid of. Is that… silly?
DOCTOR: It’s not “silly” to be concerned, Mr. Schwer, though vague anxieties aren't particularly helpful. You’re requesting a… screening, essentially, based on family history. And feeling “tired” is… extraordinarily nonspecific. Do you have any other complaints?
PATIENT: Complaints… No. No pain. No… nothing like that. I eat okay, I think. Maybe too much salt? My wife… she always said so. But she… well, she's gone now. Anyway, no. Just… the worry. And maybe I should eat less salt. But that's not a complaint, is it? It's just… being old, I guess. Everything starts to ache a little.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no acute symptoms. No weight loss, no fever, no changes in bowel habits?
PATIENT: Changes in… bowel habits? I… I go to the bathroom. Regularly. I think. Maybe not as regularly as when I was younger? But, you know… old age. Everything slows down. Is that what you mean? I don't… I don't have any… problems. Just… slower.
DOCTOR: We're getting somewhere, slowly. And "slower" is still relevant information, Mr. Schwer. Now, let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything at all?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… The doctor… a long time ago… said it was a little high. He gave me pills. I took them for a while. But… then I stopped. I didn't like taking pills. I felt okay without them. Was that… bad? I don't remember what he said exactly. It was years ago. And… no diabetes, I don't think. I like sweet things, but… never been told I have it.
DOCTOR: Untreated hypertension. Excellent. And any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. A long, long time ago. And… I had a bad knee, so they fixed that. A couple of times. When I was… working. But that was years ago too. Lots of years. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Appendectomy, knee replacements… noted. Now, medications. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No. Not now. Nothing. Like I said, I don't like taking pills. I try to stay away from them if I can. Sometimes I take… something for my joints. When they really hurt. But it's… a cream. You rub it on. Not a pill. I try to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Very well. Allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… Dust, maybe? I sneeze a little when I’m cleaning. And… I think I get a rash if I eat shellfish. But not always. It’s… complicated. My wife used to say I was making it up. But I think I’m allergic to shellfish. Sometimes. It's not serious.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a possible shellfish allergy, and seasonal dust allergies. And we've established a history of untreated hypertension. Let's move on to family history. Besides your mother and brother, were there any other significant illnesses in your family?
PATIENT: My father… he had heart trouble too. Not as bad as my mother, but… he died young. And my aunt… on my mother's side. She had… something with her stomach. The doctors said it was cancer, but it was a long time ago. They didn't know as much then. And… my cousin, he had… lung trouble. He smoked, you see. Lots of cigarettes. It's… a lot, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Family history of cardiovascular disease, gastric cancer, and lung disease… noted. Alright, Mr. Schwer. Let’s do a brief physical exam. Just to get a baseline. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay. Examination… You mean like… checking my heartbeat? That's okay. Just… be gentle, please. My back… it's not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. Just lie flat, if you're able. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll check your blood pressure. And I'll palpate your abdomen. Heart sounds… slightly diminished, but regular rhythm. No murmurs appreciated. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles. Blood pressure is elevated: 160/95. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with no masses palpated. Slightly distended. Alright. Blood pressure is a concern, and your abdomen is somewhat distended. I'd like to order some blood work and a urinalysis. And an EKG, just to be cautious.
PATIENT: Blood work… and a what-now? Is something wrong? Is it… serious? The blood pressure… is that bad? I didn’t even know it was that high. What does it mean? And what’s a… urinalysis? I don't like tests. They always find something.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, let’s not jump to conclusions. Elevated blood pressure simply means we need to investigate further. It doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious, but it requires monitoring. The blood work will give us a comprehensive overview of your overall health – cholesterol levels, kidney function, blood sugar, and so on. The urinalysis checks for infection and other abnormalities in your urine. An EKG – electrocardiogram – measures the electrical activity of your heart. It's a quick, painless test. I understand you're anxious about tests, but they are necessary to get a clear picture of your health and rule out any potential problems. We’ll discuss the results thoroughly. Do you understand?
PATIENT: I… I think so. Blood work… and pee in a cup. And the… heart thing. It's just… a lot. My wife always handled this stuff. I never paid much attention. Is it going to hurt? Will it take long? And… what if they do find something? I just want to be okay.
DOCTOR: No, none of it will hurt, Mr. Schwer. The blood work is a simple needle prick. The urinalysis is… exactly as you said. And the EKG involves placing some stickers on your chest. It’s all very quick and non-invasive. As for finding something… we’ll cross that bridge when – and if – we come to it. The goal is to identify any potential issues early on so we can address them appropriately. We'll discuss all your options, and I will explain everything in detail. I’m ordering the tests now. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and collect a urine sample. In the meantime, I’m going to write you a prescription for a low-sodium diet, and I’ll give you some information about managing hypertension. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results in one week. Do you have any immediate questions?
PATIENT: Low… sodium? That’s salt, right? I like salt. My wife used to yell at me about the salt. Is… is this going to be very difficult? I don't think I can give up salt. And one week… that seems like a long time to wait. What if something's really wrong? Just… promise me you’ll call if it is. Promise me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Schwer, I understand your concerns. Reducing your salt intake doesn't mean eliminating it entirely, it means moderating it. It’s about making healthier choices. And one week is standard for these results to come back from the lab. I assure you, if there’s anything concerning in your test results, I will contact you immediately. I cannot promise to call for every minor abnormality, but if it requires urgent attention, you will be contacted. I’m writing a referral to a registered dietitian who can help you with meal planning and sodium reduction. The nurse will be in shortly. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No. I… I guess not. Just… the nurse, you said? She’ll explain everything? I’m… I’m tired now. All this… worrying. I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will be in shortly. She’ll assist you with the blood work and urine sample. And she can answer any remaining questions you may have. Very well. I’ll see you in one week.
