DOCTOR: Hi Aurthur, good to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Aye, good to meet ye too, Doctor. Well, it's this mornin' sickness, really. Been feelin' it for a few weeks now, and it's a bit botherin', seein' as how I've got a dodgy heart already. It just... doesn't seem right.
DOCTOR: Okay, “morning sickness” for a few weeks now… and you’re concerned because of your heart condition. That’s very reasonable to think about. Just to clarify, when you say “morning sickness”, are you experiencing nausea and vomiting?
PATIENT: Aye, that's right. Mostly just the queasy feelin', to be honest. Not a lot of actual chuckin' up, thank goodness. But it's there pretty much as soon as I wake, and lingers on for a good few hours. Sometimes it's worse if I eat somethin' specific, but it happens even if I haven't touched a thing. It's... unpredictable, ye could say.
DOCTOR: Okay, so nausea is the main symptom, more prominent in the mornings, lasting a few hours, and doesn’t seem consistently tied to what you eat. Unpredictable is a good way to describe it. And just to get a better picture, have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the nausea?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Well, I've been a wee bit more tired than usual, aye. And my ankles... they've been swellin' up a bit more than normal, even with me puttin' 'em up. But I always get a bit of swellin', so I didn't pay it too much mind at first. It's hard to say if it's worse than usual, if ye understand.
DOCTOR: I do understand. Increased fatigue and some ankle swelling… those are good things to mention, especially with your heart history. It's definitely helpful to know if things feel different than your usual baseline. Now, could you tell me a little bit about your heart condition?
PATIENT: Aye, of course. It's heart failure, they said. Diagnosed about five years ago now. It's not...gettin' worse quickly, but it's definitely there. I get short of breath if I do too much, and I have to watch the salt intake, ye know? I'm on a couple of tablets for it, but the doctor said they can't fix it, just slow it down. I go for check-ups every six months or so. I can tell ye the names of the tablets if it would help.
DOCTOR: Yes, knowing the names of the tablets would be helpful. And it’s good you’re keeping up with those check-ups. Short of breath with exertion and watching your salt – that's good management. While you’re thinking of the medication names, let's quickly talk about other things. Have you had any recent changes in your diet or activity level?
PATIENT: Right, the tablets... let me see. There's Lisinopril, and...Digoxin. Aye, those are the two. As for diet and activity... not much changed, to be honest. I've been tryin' to walk a bit more, but just short distances. Maybe half a mile if I'm feelin' good. Diet's pretty much the same – I watch the salt, like I said, mostly eat soups and things. Not much red meat. I haven't started anythin' new, or stopped anythin', if that makes sense. It's just been...steady as she goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and Digoxin, good. And no recent changes to diet or activity level, which is helpful to know. “Steady as she goes,” as you say. Now, thinking a little broader… have you noticed any changes in how much you're urinating?
PATIENT: Hmm... that's a good question. I think I've been goin' a bit more often, aye. Especially at night, which is a bother. I usually have to get up once, maybe twice, but it's been more like three times the last week or so. Not a huge amount each time, just...more frequent, ye know? I thought it was just old age creepin' in, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, increased frequency, especially at night… that’s important information. And it’s good you noticed that change. It’s always best to mention these things, even if they seem minor. Let's talk about your past medical history, if you don’t mind. Besides the heart failure, have you been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Aye, no problem. Let me think... I had a bit of a dodgy knee a few years back, got it fixed with a replacement. Other than that... I had the usual childhood things, measles and all that. I've never been a sickly man, really. High blood pressure was diagnosed around the same time as the heart failure, but that's managed with the tablets, I think. No allergies, or anythin' like that. I used to smoke, years ago, but I gave that up when the doctor told me to.
DOCTOR: Okay, knee replacement, childhood illnesses, high blood pressure managed with medication, and a history of smoking but currently quit. That’s very good that you quit smoking. Now, a few questions about your family… Has anyone in your family had heart problems, kidney problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Aye, that's a fair question. My father had a heart attack when he was in his sixties. He smoked all his life, unfortunately. My mother had diabetes, but it wasn't too bad. She managed it with diet for a long time, then had to start injections towards the end. And my sister's husband had some trouble with his kidneys a few years back, needed dialysis for a bit. Not a lot of other serious illness in the family, if I'm bein' honest. Mostly just the usual aches and pains.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart attack, diabetes, and kidney problems. That's helpful to know. And finally, just a quick check – are you currently taking any medications other than the Lisinopril and Digoxin?
PATIENT: Aye, let me think... I take a wee bit of ibuprofen sometimes, for my knee if it's playin' up. Just the over-the-counter stuff, nothin' fancy. And I take a multivitamin every day, just to keep things topped up. That's it, I think. Nothin' else regular.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for your knee and a daily multivitamin. That's good to know. Thank you for all of that information, Aurthur. That gives me a really good picture of things. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your abdomen, and check your ankles. That will help me assess what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go ahead. I’m used to bein' poked and prodded, unfortunately. Just let me know if ye need me to do anythin'.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright, if you could just take a deep breath in and out for me… Okay… I'm hearing a slightly irregular rhythm, and there's a bit of a murmur. That’s not entirely unexpected given your heart failure history. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles that I can detect. Blood pressure is 148/88. A bit elevated, but not critically high. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. And as you mentioned, some mild pitting edema in your ankles. When I press on them, it leaves a slight indentation that takes a few seconds to go away. Okay, everything sounds consistent with your known heart failure. However, the increased frequency of urination, and the nausea, along with the ankle swelling, are things we need to investigate further. I think it would be a good idea to run some blood tests, including a kidney function test, an electrolyte panel, and a BNP level – that’s a blood test that can help assess the severity of your heart failure. I also want to get a urine sample to check for protein. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Aye, that sounds sensible, Doctor. I trust yer judgement. Blood tests and a urine sample… aye, I can do that. The sooner we know what's goin' on, the better, I reckon. I'd rather get it sorted now than wait for it to get worse. Is there anythin' special I need to do for the urine sample? And where do I go to get the blood drawn?
DOCTOR: Excellent. I'm glad you agree. For the urine sample, I’ll have the nurse give you a sterile cup. Please collect a mid-stream sample – that means start urinating, then collect the sample mid-way through, and finish urinating afterwards. This helps to avoid any contamination. And for the blood tests, the nurse will draw it right here in the examination room. She'll send it off to the lab, and the results should be back in a couple of days. While we’re waiting for the results, I want you to continue monitoring your symptoms. If you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant weight gain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Aye, that makes sense about the urine sample. Mid-stream, right. I can remember that. And no, I don’t think I have any questions at the moment. Just try to keep a level head and wait for the results, aye? And keep an eye out for those symptoms ye mentioned. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate ye takin' the time to listen and get to the bottom of it.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aurthur. It’s my job. And you’re doing the right thing by being proactive and coming in to get checked out. I'll have the nurse come in to collect the urine sample and draw the blood. In the meantime, if anything does change, even if it seems small, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We'll contact you as soon as the results are back to discuss them and come up with a plan. Thank you again for coming in today. I hope you have a good rest of your day.
PATIENT: Aye, thank ye kindly, Doctor. I will. And ye have a good day too.
