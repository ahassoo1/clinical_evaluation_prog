DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bulaong. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. StHilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… my chest hurts. Not all the time, but sometimes. It's… like a pain, you know? In my breast. It's been happening for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Chest pain can be concerning, and it's good you're getting it checked. When you say "a little while," could you be more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… maybe… two, three weeks? It comes and goes. Not every day. Sometimes when I move a lot, like… working on the roof, it hurts more. Other times, it's just… there. A dull ache. I don’t know. It’s hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, two to three weeks of intermittent chest pain, worsening with activity. That's helpful. Could you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Um… it’s not a sharp pain. More like… sore. Like after a hard workout, you know? But it's just in my chest. Not my muscles. It's… hard to explain. It doesn’t feel like a broken bone or anything. Just… uncomfortable. Like something is… heavy there.
DOCTOR: I understand it's difficult to describe. A dull ache, a feeling of heaviness… and it’s localized to the chest itself, not radiating anywhere else?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Not in my arm or back or anything. Just… there. In my chest. And it's… mostly just on one side. My left side, I think. Sometimes I feel it a little on the right, but mostly left. Does that make sense? It’s not… like a really bad pain, just… annoying. And worrying me a little.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's very helpful, Mr. Bulaong. Primarily left-sided chest discomfort, intermittent, described as a dull ache or heaviness. You mentioned it's worrying you, which is perfectly reasonable. Before we proceed, could you tell me about any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, no cough. I haven’t noticed anything… different about my breast itself. No lumps, no… leaking. Just the pain. My wife asked if I was losing weight, but I don’t think so. I’m always skinny, you know? But no… nothing else really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, cough, or any changes to the breast itself – no lumps, discharge, or observed weight loss. That’s good to know. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I mean, I get sick sometimes, like a cold. But nothing… serious. No heart problems or anything. I’ve never had any surgeries. My wife usually handles the doctor stuff. I just… work. I try to stay healthy. I eat okay, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior medical diagnoses or surgeries. That’s helpful. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Um… my mom… she had… problems with her stomach, I think. When she was old. But nothing… like chest problems or anything. My dad was healthy, I think. He worked hard all his life. My wife might know more about that. She remembers things better. I don't know of anyone with… breast problems, if that’s what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited family history available. We’ll make a note of that. Now, can you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What does that mean? You mean… like, do I have friends? I work a lot. I don’t go to parties. I go home to my wife. We watch TV. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Bulaong, that’s not what I meant. I was referring to things like smoking, alcohol consumption, and any recreational drug use. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any other substances?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no. I don't smoke. Never have. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a beer sometimes with dinner, but not every night. Just on special occasions. And definitely no… other substances. I just work, Doctor. I need to be strong for my job.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol consumption, and no recreational drug use. That’s good to know. And lastly, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My wife gives me medicine when I’m sick, and I haven’t ever had a problem. No reactions, no rashes, nothing. I think I'm okay. I don't think I’m allergic to anything. But if she’s given me something that made me sick, I probably wouldn’t remember. She does all the remembering!
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you for providing that information, Mr. Bulaong. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be causing your chest pain, I would like to perform a physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s wrong. Hopefully it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you could please have a seat on the examination table, that would be great. I will begin by listening to your heart and lungs, and then I will palpate your chest to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable during the exam. Okay, Mr. Bulaong, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and I don’t hear any wheezing or crackles in your lungs. That’s a good sign. Now I’m going to gently palpate your chest. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. Maybe… a little bit there. But it’s not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like when you press on a bruise. Not really pain, just… sensitive. A little.
DOCTOR: Okay, I do feel some mild tenderness in that area of your left breast. I don’t feel any lumps or masses. Now, I’m going to check your lymph nodes in your armpits to see if they are swollen. Your lymph nodes feel normal, not enlarged or tender. Okay, Mr. Bulaong. Based on the physical exam, your heart and lungs sound clear, and your lymph nodes are normal. You do have some mild tenderness in your left breast, but I don’t feel any lumps or masses. Given your symptoms and the physical exam findings, it is difficult to determine the exact cause of your chest pain at this time. However, the tenderness suggests the possibility of musculoskeletal pain, such as a strained muscle or inflammation of the cartilage in the chest wall. To rule out other potential causes and get a more accurate diagnosis, I would like to order some laboratory tests, including a complete blood count and a chest X-ray. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. A blood test and an X-ray… okay. My wife will be happy to hear we’re getting some answers. Does it cost a lot of money? I don’t have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Bulaong. I understand not having insurance can make things difficult. The cost of the blood test is approximately $75, and the chest X-ray is around $150. However, I can discuss options with our billing department to see if we can offer a discounted rate or a payment plan. We also have a social worker who can assist you with finding resources for affordable healthcare options. Before we proceed with the tests, I want to be upfront that there are other, less common possibilities we need to rule out, such as a bone injury or, in rare cases, a more serious condition. I don't want to alarm you, but it’s important to have a thorough evaluation. Would you like me to proceed with ordering the tests, and I can also connect you with our billing department and social worker?
PATIENT: Yeah, let’s do the tests. I want to know what’s wrong, even if it’s not good news. And yes, please, connect me with the billing people and… the social worker. My wife will be very happy to hear about that. It’s just… worrying, you know? But better to know.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Bulaong. I completely understand. It’s always best to be proactive, and I'm glad you're choosing to get this checked out. I'm ordering the complete blood count and the chest X-ray now. The lab technician will call you to schedule the blood test, and the radiology department will contact you to arrange the X-ray. I will also have our billing department contact you to discuss payment options, and I'm sending a referral to our social worker, Ms. Evans, who will reach out to you to explore available resources. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. It usually takes a few days for the results to come back. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or fever, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And thank you for helping me with the… money stuff. I appreciate it. I’ll wait for the calls.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bulaong. I'm happy to help in any way I can. Don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns or questions before your follow-up appointment. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day, and please take care.
