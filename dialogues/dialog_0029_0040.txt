DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Espinueva. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s the pain, mostly. In my side, you see. And… well, the waterworks have been troublesome again. Seems to happen quite a bit, now. It's been going on for a little while, this last bout feels… worse than usual, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain in your side and some trouble with urination. Let's start with the pain. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It's… hard to describe exactly. It’s not a sharp pain, not like a cut. More of a dull ache, really. It comes and goes, mostly on my left side, but sometimes it’s on both. It feels… deep inside. And it gets worse if I move around too much, or if I’ve been standing for a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, a dull ache on your left side, sometimes both, that’s worse with movement and standing. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. It's come and gone for… years, really. But the last few months, it's been more frequent. And lasting longer each time. Before, it would just be a little niggle for a day, maybe. Now, it can be a few days at a time, even a week.
DOCTOR: Okay, so intermittent pain for years, but more frequent and longer-lasting in the last few months. And you mentioned trouble with your waterworks… can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Yes, well… I need to go to the toilet a lot. More often than I used to, and sometimes it’s… difficult to get it all out, you see? And it burns a little, when I go. Not always, but often enough that it’s bothersome. I’ve noticed some… cloudiness, sometimes, in the water.
DOCTOR: Alright, frequent urination, difficulty emptying, burning sensation, and some cloudiness in your urine. Have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Hmm… I think maybe once or twice I’ve seen a little bit of pink, but I wasn’t certain. It could have been something else, a shadow, perhaps. It hasn't been a regular thing, not like the other symptoms. It’s hard to tell, Doctor, you understand. I'm not very good at noticing those things.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible pink tinge to the urine a couple of times. We’ll need to investigate that further. Now, let's go through some general health questions. Do you have any other medical conditions that you know of?
PATIENT: Well, the doctor before… he told me I have something with my kidneys. Polycystic… something. It means I have a lot of little sacs on them, he said. It doesn't bother me much, usually, but I suppose this pain might be connected. I have Medicare, so I see doctors when I need to, but honestly, I don’t always remember everything they tell me.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease… okay, that’s important information. And do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: Not really, Doctor. Just a little something for my blood pressure, a small white pill. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take one of those over-the-counter sleep aids. Nothing fancy, just when I really need it.
DOCTOR: Alright, medication for blood pressure and occasional sleep aid. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat everything, pretty much. And I don’t have any problems with pollen or animals, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And just to get a full picture, can you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. That's a bit tricky. My mother, she passed away when I was young. I don't really remember much about her illnesses. My father, he was a strong man, never sick a day in his life, as far as I know. I had a sister, but she lives on another island and we don't see each other much. I don’t know much about her health either, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited family history information. Now, finally, do you smoke or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I don’t drink much alcohol, either. Maybe a small glass of wine with dinner once in a while, if I’m feeling celebratory. But mostly, I drink water. Lots and lots of water.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol. Okay, Mr. Espinueva, thank you for that information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Can you please lie down on the exam table?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. My bones aren't quite as nimble as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Espinueva. I'm going to listen to your abdomen and back, and then gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Please tell me if anything is painful. First, let's listen to your stomach. Deep breaths for me, please. … Okay. Now I'm going to listen to your back. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. I’ll start on the right side. Any pain with this?
PATIENT: No, not on the right. A little pressure, of course, but no pain. There… yes, that's a bit tender. On the left side, down low. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. A bit like a dull ache, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness on the left side, low abdomen. That’s consistent with what you've been describing. I'm going to check your vital signs now. Blood pressure is 142 over 88, pulse is 78, and temperature is normal. Given your symptoms and the physical exam, I'm concerned about a few possibilities, including a urinary tract infection, a kidney issue related to your polycystic kidney disease, or possibly even a kidney stone. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a urinalysis and a complete blood count. We might also need to do a CT scan of your abdomen, but let’s start with the simpler tests first. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very sensible. Whatever you think is best. A urinalysis and… a blood count, you said? Alright. And a… scan, if needed. I trust your judgment. Hopefully it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the blood for the count, and we’ll collect a urine sample right here. The lab will need a "clean catch" sample, so the nurse will explain how to properly collect that. We can get those tests done quickly and hopefully have results back to me within a day or two. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a short course of antibiotics to cover the possibility of a UTI, while we wait for the results. Is there anything else you’re experiencing or any questions you have for me right now?
PATIENT: Antibiotics, yes, that sounds good. Better to be safe, I suppose. No, I don’t think so… just that pain, and the feeling of needing to go all the time. And, sometimes, a little tiredness. But I'm an old man, Doctor. Perhaps that’s just old age catching up with me. I suppose I’m mostly just worried about what the scan might show, if it comes to that.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Espinueva. It's understandable to be worried, but let's not jump to conclusions before we have the results. We're taking things one step at a time. The nurse will be in shortly to collect the urine sample and draw your blood. I’ll call you as soon as I have the results and we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, drink plenty of fluids, and if the pain worsens significantly, or you develop a fever, please don't hesitate to go to the emergency room. Do you have any difficulty getting to the hospital if needed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I'm alright for getting to the hospital. My son lives nearby, he can take me if I need it. He’s a good boy. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, and for not rushing things. It’s good to know you’re taking it slow.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know you have support nearby. I’ll let the nurse know to come in shortly. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. We'll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day, Mr. Espinueva.
PATIENT: You too, Doctor. And thank you again.
