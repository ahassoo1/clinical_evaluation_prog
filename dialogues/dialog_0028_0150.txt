DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Shteynberg, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. And please, let’s not waste time. I have things to do. I understand you’re Dr. Memmolo?
DOCTOR: Yes, Dr. Memmolo. Internal Medicine. Now, let’s just get straight to it, shall we?
PATIENT: Straight to it is good. I’m 51, divorced, perfectly healthy as far as I know – though I haven’t exactly been… testing that lately. I want to have a baby. Without any… complications. Is that even possible at my age? Don’t tell me it’s not, I don’t have time for that.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A baby. Right. Well, “perfectly healthy” and wanting a baby at 51 are… two different things. We’ll need to run some tests, of course. Don’t get your hopes up too high. It’s not impossible, but significantly more… challenging. Do you have any existing medical conditions, or take any medications?
PATIENT: Medicare covers everything, naturally. No, no conditions. And no medications. Never been one for popping pills. I eat reasonably well, though I do enjoy a good pastry. Honestly, I just want to know what needs to be done, and how long it will take. I don’t have years for this, doctor.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. “Reasonably well” is… helpful. Alright. We will need a full blood panel – hormone levels, complete metabolic panel, and a few others to assess your overall health. And I’d like to do a pelvic exam. That’s standard procedure. We also need to review your family history - are there any significant illnesses that run in your family?
PATIENT: A pelvic exam? Really? Must we? I assure you, everything is perfectly functional. But fine, get it over with. As for family history... my mother had high blood pressure, and my grandmother… she had something with her stomach, a long time ago. Nothing… particularly relevant, I wouldn’t think. Honestly, I’m not sure what exactly she had, it was decades ago in Hungary. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Shteynberg, I understand your… impatience. But a pelvic exam is necessary. And family history is relevant. High blood pressure can be genetic, and even a vague “something with the stomach” could indicate a predisposition to certain conditions. It’s my job to be thorough, regardless of your… timetable. Let’s just get it over with, then we’ll move onto bloodwork. Please, have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Fine. But don't expect a detailed account of my family's medical woes. They weren't exactly forthcoming with information, even when they were alive. And really, I’m perfectly capable of getting this done quickly. Don't slow me down. Just...try to be efficient, please.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Shteynberg, I am always efficient. This will only take a moment. I'm going to start with an external exam, then a speculum exam. Please let me know if you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: Honestly, it's rather cold. And… is there any way to expedite this? It's not exactly comfortable. Just tell me if something is wrong, don’t ask me about every little… sensation. I have a schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: Everything appears… normal. Cervix is closed, no obvious abnormalities. Uterus feels slightly enlarged, but that could be normal given your age. I will need to palpate your abdomen now to check your ovaries. Please try to relax. Are you experiencing any pelvic pain currently?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just… discomfort. This whole process is rather undignified, frankly. And “slightly enlarged” isn't exactly reassuring. What does that mean, exactly? Is it something serious? Don't beat around the bush, doctor. I need straight answers, not vague medical jargon.
DOCTOR: "Slightly enlarged" can mean a number of things, Ms. Shteynberg. It's not necessarily serious, it could be due to a number of benign factors. But we need further investigation to determine the cause. I want to order a transvaginal ultrasound to get a better view of your uterus and ovaries. And, as I said before, a comprehensive blood panel. We'll schedule those for tomorrow. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. Pastries included. Honestly, is this ultrasound going to be… unpleasant? Because I really don’t have time for anything lengthy or invasive. And will the blood panel take long? I have… commitments. Just tell me the practicalities, doctor. I’m not interested in a lecture on the intricacies of reproductive health.
DOCTOR: The ultrasound is not invasive, Ms. Shteynberg. A probe is inserted into the vagina to get a clearer image – it shouldn’t be painful, perhaps slightly uncomfortable. It will take about 20-30 minutes. The blood panel will take a few days to get results. You can get it done at the lab downstairs – they take walk-ins. Here. Take this to the lab. I'll call you when the results are in. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Fine. Twenty to thirty minutes… acceptable, I suppose. And a few days for results… barely tolerable. Just… call me promptly. And don’t bother with unnecessary explanations. I’ll be waiting. Thank you. Or… whatever. .
