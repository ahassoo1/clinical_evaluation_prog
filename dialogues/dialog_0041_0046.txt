DOCTOR: Hi Marialena, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’ve been experiencing some… pressure in my bladder, and it’s become rather bothersome lately. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, bladder pressure for a few weeks now. I understand. Can you tell me a little more about that pressure?
PATIENT: Certainly. It’s not necessarily painful, but it’s a consistent feeling of fullness, even after I’ve just gone to the bathroom. It’s… uncomfortable, and it makes me feel like I need to go quite often, even when there isn’t much to go. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does, yes. Frequent urge to urinate with a feeling of fullness even after emptying… Hmm. And is there anything that seems to make it better or worse?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I haven’t really noticed anything specific that makes it definitively better or worse, honestly. Drinking a lot of fluids doesn’t seem to change it much, and neither does limiting them. I suppose if I’m really focused on something else, I don’t notice it as much, but that’s not a solution, is it? I did notice it seemed a little more prominent yesterday after a long car ride, but I wasn’t sure if that was just coincidence.
DOCTOR: Right, so no clear triggers and maybe a little worse after a long car ride... Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this – anything like pain in your lower abdomen, back pain, fever, or changes in your urine – color, smell, anything like that?
PATIENT: No fever, thankfully. And no pain in my lower abdomen or back. My urine seems… normal, as far as I can tell. The color hasn’t changed, and I haven’t noticed any unusual smell. I do sometimes feel a little tired, but I attributed that to work. I'm a graphic designer, and deadlines can be… demanding. But no, nothing directly related to the bladder issue, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other related symptoms that you've noticed... Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I've always been quite healthy, thankfully. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. I broke my arm when I was ten, but that healed completely. I do have a bit of seasonal allergies, but I manage those with over-the-counter medication. I'm married, and my husband is healthy as well. I have Medicare, as I mentioned before, and I’ve had my annual check-ups, but nothing has ever come up. I don’t have any known chronic conditions, and I’m not currently taking any medications, besides the allergy pills when needed.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No chronic conditions, no current medications, seasonal allergies managed with over-the-counter meds… And have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No surgeries, and thankfully, no hospitalizations. I've been very fortunate in that regard. My tonsils were considered for removal when I was a child, but the doctor ultimately decided it wasn't necessary, so I never had that done. Otherwise, nothing. Just the usual doctor's appointments and yearly check-ups.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: That’s a fair question. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had diabetes, but other than that, nothing major on either side of the family. No history of bladder problems, kidney issues, or anything like that that I'm aware of. Both of my grandparents lived long, healthy lives as well. I don’t believe there’s anything genetically predisposed that might be contributing to this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no family history of related issues… And just to get a full picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work full-time as a graphic designer, so I spend a good portion of my day sitting at a computer. I try to eat a relatively healthy diet – lots of fruits and vegetables, lean protein – but I admit it can be challenging with a busy schedule. I don’t smoke, and I only drink alcohol occasionally – maybe a glass of wine with dinner a couple of times a week. I try to get some exercise when I can, mostly walking, but it’s not as consistent as I’d like. I'm married, and we enjoy spending time outdoors when the weather is nice. I drink about six to eight glasses of water a day, maybe more, and I try to get a full night's sleep when possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good sense of things. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to any medication before. I can take penicillin, and I haven’t had any issues with any other common antibiotics or over-the-counter drugs. No food allergies either. I have seasonal allergies, as I mentioned before, but that's just hay fever, not a true allergy that causes a severe reaction. I’m very careful about what I eat and drink, and I always check the ingredients list before trying anything new.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. Alright, Marialena, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. I’m happy to proceed with an examination. Please, let me know what I need to do. I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just go ahead and get on the examination table, that would be wonderful. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen, and then I’ll do a quick external examination. It’s fairly routine. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, your abdomen sounds normal. Now, I’m just going to gently palpate your lower abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Let me know if you feel any pain. Hmm... no significant tenderness here. Your bladder feels full, as you mentioned, but not distended. Everything else feels normal on the outside. I'd like to perform a quick urine test just to rule out any infection or other abnormalities. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible, Doctor. A urine test is a good idea. Absolutely, please go ahead. I'll try to relax. Just let me know if there's anything specific I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, I've sent the sample to the lab. It should be back within a few minutes. While we wait, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: That’s good to know. No, not at the moment, Doctor. I’m happy to wait and see what the results show. I suppose I’m just a little anxious to find out what’s causing this discomfort. Is there anything you suspect at this point, based on what we've discussed? I understand if you don’t want to speculate without the test results, of course.
DOCTOR: Well, based on what you've told me – frequent urination, feeling of fullness, no pain, normal physical exam, and no family history – a few things come to mind. It could be a simple urinary tract irritation, though the lack of pain makes that less likely. It could also be overactive bladder, which is fairly common, or a sensitivity issue. We’ll know more once the lab results are back. It's also possible it's something relatively minor, like diet or fluid intake, but we always want to rule out anything more serious first. Ah, here are the results. Everything looks normal - no sign of infection, no blood in the urine, and the other indicators are within the normal range.
PATIENT: That’s…reassuring, to hear there’s no infection. It’s good to know it’s not something serious. So, if the tests are normal, what does that mean? What are the next steps, Doctor? Is it possible this is something I just need to monitor, or is there anything I can do to alleviate the discomfort?
DOCTOR: Okay, that rules out a lot of things. Given the normal results, it sounds like we're dealing with a functional issue, meaning there's no underlying disease causing it. It could be related to bladder sensitivity or mild overactivity. A good first step would be to try a bladder diary for a week. Just write down every time you urinate, how much you drink, and the sensation you feel. This will give us a better understanding of your bladder habits. We can also try some behavioral modifications. Things like timed voiding – going to the bathroom on a schedule, even if you don't feel the urge – and pelvic floor exercises can help strengthen the bladder muscles. I’d also recommend avoiding caffeine and alcohol for a week and seeing if that makes a difference. They can both irritate the bladder. If these measures don't help, we can discuss further testing, like a urodynamic study, but I think let’s try these conservative approaches first. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. A bladder diary, timed voiding, pelvic floor exercises… I can definitely do all of those things. And I can cut back on the caffeine and alcohol. It’s good to know there are steps I can take without resorting to more invasive testing right away. Would you like me to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of the diary? And could you perhaps show me how to do the pelvic floor exercises correctly? I’ve heard of them, but I’m not sure I’m doing them right.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review the bladder diary. That should give us enough time to see if these measures are helping. As for the Kegels, it's fairly simple. Imagine you're trying to stop the flow of urine midstream – though don’t actually do that regularly, as it can weaken your bladder. Squeeze the muscles you would use to do that – it should feel like you're tightening around your urethra and rectum. Hold for a few seconds, then relax. Repeat 10-15 times, several times a day. You can do them anywhere – sitting, standing, lying down. The key is to isolate those muscles – you shouldn't be tightening your stomach or thighs. I’ll print out a handout with detailed instructions and some helpful resources. Do you have any questions about the exercises, or anything else we've discussed?
PATIENT: That’s very helpful, Doctor. Thank you for demonstrating the exercises, and the handout will be incredibly useful. No, I don’t think I have any further questions at the moment. I feel much more informed and empowered to manage this situation. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I’ll keep the diary, do the exercises, and cut back on the caffeine and alcohol. I look forward to seeing you in two weeks.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marialena. I’m glad I could help. Remember, it's often a process of trial and error to find what works best. Don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and I’ll see you in two weeks.
