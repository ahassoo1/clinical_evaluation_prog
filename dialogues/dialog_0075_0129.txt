DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Panjoj. It’s August 2nd, 2025. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's this stool. Black as night. I've been taking these pain pills for years, you know. The arthritis, it just...won't quit. And now this. It's probably something serious, knowing my luck. Just get on with it, please. I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta, I understand your concern and wanting to get straight to the point. Black stools can be a sign of something needing investigation, so it's good you're getting it checked out. You mentioned pain pills for arthritis – for how long have you been taking them, and which medication specifically?
PATIENT: Years, I told you! At least ten. Maybe twelve? It comes and goes, honestly, which ones the doctor gives me. Ibuprofen, naproxen… the ones with ‘profen’ in the name, usually. Whatever the little bottles are, you know? I don't keep track of these things, I just take 'em when it hurts. Honestly, I don't see what that has to do with my stool.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen and naproxen, intermittently for the last ten to twelve years. Those medications can sometimes cause gastrointestinal irritation, which could be related to the black stool. But we need to rule out other possibilities. When did you first notice the black stool?
PATIENT: About… oh, a week ago, maybe? Give or take a day. I thought it was something I ate, honestly. But it keeps happening. It’s not like a one-time thing, if that’s what you're asking. It's just… unsettling, you know? And messy.
DOCTOR: I understand. Recurring black stool definitely warrants investigation. Has there been any change in your appetite, any nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain along with this?
PATIENT: Appetite? What appetite? Old people don't have appetites, dear. And no, I haven't been throwing up. I’m not a delicate flower. As for pain… well, the arthritis is always there. That's why I'm on the pills! I'm talking about new pain. Maybe a little bit of cramping, now that you mention it. Nothing worth making a fuss over.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no change in appetite, no vomiting, but a little bit of cramping accompanying the black stool and the ongoing arthritis pain. Do you have any family history of gastrointestinal issues – things like ulcers, Crohn’s disease, or colon cancer?
PATIENT: Family history… honestly, who keeps track of that? My mother had… something. Stomach trouble, maybe? She complained a lot, if that counts. My father was a strong, silent type, never said a word about his ailments. Probably died of a broken heart, if you ask me. As for the rest of the family…distant cousins, mostly. I wouldn't know their medical histories if they paid me.
DOCTOR: Okay, some possible family history of stomach issues. I’m going to need to do a brief physical examination. I'll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Then, I’d like to order a stool test to check for blood, and a complete blood count. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: More poking and prodding? Honestly. Fine, get it over with. I suppose if it’s necessary. But don’t take too long, dear. I have things to do. And make sure the stool test doesn't involve too much…fuss.
DOCTOR: I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible, Dawnetta. The stool test is a very simple collection; I’ll give you clear instructions. Now, if you could lie down on the examination table, please. I’m just going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Take a few deep breaths for me…
PATIENT: Honestly, all this fuss over a little black stool. My mother always said doctors made mountains out of molehills. Just get it over with, dear. And don’t poke too hard. This arthritis makes me sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay, breathing normally… Good. I’m hearing normal bowel sounds. Now, I'm going to gently press on your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Does this cause you any pain here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes! Right there. That's where it hurts. It's not a bad pain, but it's definitely tender. Like a dull ache, you know? I always feel a little discomfort there, but it's worse now. See? I told you it wasn't just a little black stool. Something's wrong!
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta, I’ve noted the tenderness in the lower left quadrant. That’s helpful. Given your age, the black stool, and the tenderness, we need to investigate further. While it could be something relatively minor like medication side effects, it’s important to rule out anything more serious, such as diverticulitis or, less likely, a gastrointestinal bleed. I'm going to order that stool test, as we discussed, and also a complete blood count to check your hemoglobin levels. Additionally, I'd like to order a CT scan of your abdomen to get a better visualization of what’s going on. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Good heavens, dear! Is that really necessary? It sounds…serious. I just have black stool! I don’t want any radiation, and I certainly don't want to be poked and prodded anymore. Are you sure there aren't any other options? This sounds like a lot for a little bit of…unpleasantness.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Dawnetta, and I wouldn’t order a CT scan lightly. However, given your symptoms and the tenderness in your abdomen, it's the most responsible way to get a clear picture of what’s happening. The radiation exposure is minimal, and the benefits of accurately diagnosing the cause of your symptoms outweigh the risks in this case. It will help us rule out any potentially serious conditions. We can discuss alternative imaging options, like an ultrasound, but it's not as effective at visualizing the colon and detecting issues like diverticulitis. Would you like me to explain the CT scan procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Fine. Do what you have to do. But if it's nothing serious, I'm sending you the bill for the whole lot of fuss. And don't expect me to be happy about it. Just… get on with it. Explain this scan, then. Quickly, please. I have a lunch date.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Dawnetta. The CT scan – or computed tomography scan – uses X-rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of your abdomen. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a large, donut-shaped machine. It’s painless, but you’ll need to remain very still for a few minutes while the images are taken. Before the scan, you may be asked to drink a contrast dye – it helps highlight the structures in your abdomen and gives us a clearer picture. The scan itself usually takes about 15-20 minutes. We'll review the results with you as soon as they’re available. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Allergies? Honestly, at my age, I'm allergic to everything! I don't remember specifically, but probably something with dye in it. I react to things. And what does this “contrast dye” do? Is it safe? I don't want to end up glowing in the dark. And how long will I have to lie there? My back isn't what it used to be. This is all very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me check your record... Ah, yes. You had a mild reaction to iodinated contrast dye during a previous procedure in 2018 – a slight rash. So we’ll need to pre-medicate you with an antihistamine to minimize the risk of a reaction. The dye helps us see the structures in your abdomen more clearly – think of it like highlighting important parts of a map. It's generally very safe, but it’s important we take precautions given your previous reaction. As for lying down, it will be approximately 15-20 minutes, but the technician will help you get comfortable and provide padding for your back. We’ll make sure you’re as comfortable as possible. Do you have any kidney problems?
PATIENT: Kidney problems? Good heavens, I don’t know! How am I supposed to know if my kidneys are working properly? I go to the doctor when something’s wrong, not to check if my internal organs are functioning! I suppose…no. I’ve never been told I have kidney problems. Honestly, you ask the most ridiculous questions. Is this scan going to interfere with my lunch date?
DOCTOR: I apologize for the numerous questions, Dawnetta, but it's important to gather as much information as possible before any procedure. And yes, you're right – you shouldn’t have to know all the specifics of your internal organs! Given your age and the dye reaction, we need to be extra cautious. As for your lunch date, the scan will take approximately an hour, including prep time and the scan itself. So it may impact your lunch plans. We can schedule it for the afternoon if that works better for you. Would you like me to go ahead and schedule the scan, and get the pre-medication arranged?
PATIENT: Fine, just schedule it! Get it over with. Afternoon is better, I suppose. But if I miss my lunch because of this, you’re buying me a very nice meal, dear. A very nice meal. Just…make it quick, and don’t expect me to be pleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. I’ve scheduled you for a CT scan of the abdomen this afternoon at 2:30 PM. The nurse will contact you shortly to discuss the pre-medication with the antihistamine. Please fast for four hours prior to the scan, and drink plenty of water. I will also put in an order for the lab to draw some blood work to check your kidney function. We will review the results together as soon as they are available. And I'll make a note about the potential lunch reimbursement. Is there anything else I can address for you at this time?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely nothing. Just… get on with it, dear. I've wasted enough of my day. And don’t forget about that lunch! .
DOCTOR: Very well, Dawnetta. Have a good day, and we'll see you this afternoon. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions. .
