DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Bonck. Welcome. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um... hi. I just moved here, and I think I need to, like, get set up with a doctor? I have Medicare, and... I guess I'm supposed to come in? It's all a bit new.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, establishing care is… prudent. Most people do that before they need it, you know. It’s not terribly complicated. Okay. So, you’re new to the area and just want a general check-up to get things started?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. A check-up. I… don't really remember the last time I had one, honestly. Everything's been kind of blurry lately. Is that okay? I mean, is it bad that I don't remember?
DOCTOR: “Blurry” isn’t a medical term, Ms. Bonck. It's… concerning you don't recall. We'll get to the bottom of it. Let’s start with the basics. Do you have any current health problems?
PATIENT: Hmm... not that I know of. I feel… okay, usually. A little tired sometimes, but… I work a lot with machines, so that could be it, right? It's kinda noisy where I work, too. Does that count as a problem? I’m really not sure what’s normal and what isn’t.
DOCTOR: "Noise" is… a factor, certainly. And fatigue is… non-specific. We need specifics. Any pain?
PATIENT: Pain? Not… all the time. Sometimes my back hurts after work, from bending over the machines. And… sometimes my head aches, but it goes away if I rest. It's hard to explain. It's not like a bad pain, just… there. Do you want me to be more specific? I'm trying!
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Bonck, please be more specific. When did the back pain start?
PATIENT: Ugh… that’s a good question. Probably… a few months ago? When I started the new job? It wasn't bad at first, just a little stiff. Now it hurts more if I try to lift heavy things. I mostly work with smaller parts, though, so it’s not too bad. I don't really take anything for it. Is that…stupid? I should probably take something, right?
DOCTOR: It's not "stupid," it’s… suboptimal. Ignoring pain rarely leads to improvement. And "a few months" is still vague. Constant, intermittent, sharp, dull?
PATIENT: Oh, um... intermittent, I think? It's not there all the time. And... dull? Not a sharp pain, definitely. Like a heavy ache. It gets worse at the end of the day, after I've been working for a long time. Does that make sense? I'm sorry I'm not very good at explaining things. It all feels… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy. Right. Let's move on. Headaches... how often do you experience these?
PATIENT: Um… maybe two or three times a week? Sometimes more if I’m really stressed. They usually start in the afternoon and go away after I lie down for a bit. It’s kinda like a pressure, behind my eyes. Not a throbbing pain, just… uncomfortable. It’s not a really big deal, honestly. I just… get used to it.
DOCTOR: "Get used to it" is… a concerning attitude towards potential symptoms, Ms. Bonck. Alright. Any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! Sometimes I feel a little dizzy, especially when I stand up too fast. But that doesn’t happen very often. And… I’ve been feeling more tired lately, even when I get enough sleep. I just thought it was the job. I really don’t know what’s normal, like I said. Is there a list of things I should be looking out for?
DOCTOR: A "list"?
PATIENT: I just… sometimes I feel like I’m forgetting things. Small things, mostly. Like where I put my keys, or what I was just talking about. I thought it was just stress, but… it’s happening more often. I don’t know if that’s a symptom or not. Sorry, I'm probably just rambling. I feel silly even saying it.
DOCTOR: "Silly" is… not a clinical term, Ms. Bonck. Memory issues are… pertinent. When did you first notice these memory problems?
PATIENT: Ugh… that’s the hard part. It feels like it’s been happening for a while now. Maybe… a few months ago? Around the same time as the back pain, maybe? It started with small things, like forgetting where I put things. Now… it’s harder to remember things that happened yesterday. It’s kinda scary, honestly. I don’t want to… freak you out. Is this bad? I really don’t remember things very well.
DOCTOR: Right. We're going to need a more detailed history. Let’s back up. Past medical history – have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… not that I know of. I… I didn't really go to the doctor much when I was younger. Just for check-ups, maybe? My mom always took care of things, and I don’t really remember what she told me. I don’t think I have any serious illnesses. I had the usual childhood stuff, like chickenpox, but… that was a long time ago. Sorry, I’m not very helpful. I wish I could remember more.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Umm… let me think… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. I had my tonsils out when I was little, I think? But that was so long ago, I barely remember it. My mom handled everything, and I wasn’t really involved. Does that count as surgery? It was a long time ago. I’m really sorry I can’t give you much information. It’s like my brain is… foggy.
DOCTOR: Foggy. Right. Family history. Are your parents still alive?
PATIENT: Yes, both of them. My mom is… pretty healthy, I think. She’s a little forgetful, now that she’s older, but… nothing serious. My dad… he had some heart problems a few years ago, but he’s doing okay now. He takes medicine for it. I don’t really know much about their medical history, honestly. We don’t really talk about that stuff. I’m sorry. Is this important? I feel like I’m failing some kind of test.
DOCTOR: It's... relevant, Ms. Bonck. Let's move on. Social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, never. I don't like smoking. My mom always said it was bad for you. And… it smells terrible. I don't even like being around people who smoke. No, definitely not. I do drink sometimes, though. Just a glass of wine with dinner, maybe. Nothing too much. I’m not a big drinker. Is that okay? I just… want to be healthy.
DOCTOR: "Okay" is... subjective. Do you use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh! No, never. Definitely not. I don't like drugs. I've never even tried them. That’s… a bad idea, right? I just… I don't do that stuff. I work hard, and I like to keep things clean. No drugs, definitely not. I just want to get better, and I want to remember things. Is that okay? I hope this is helping. I feel like I’m rambling again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… I think I’m allergic to penicillin. I broke out in a rash when I took it as a kid. My mom always made sure I didn’t take it again. Other than that… not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. I don’t really have any food sensitivities. I hope that’s helpful. I feel like I’m just listing things now. It's kinda stressful trying to remember everything. Is it okay if I take a break? I just need a minute.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's do a quick physical exam, then we can pause. Please sit up and tell me if anything causes you discomfort.
PATIENT: Okay… um… sure. Just tell me what to do. And… I’ll tell you if something hurts. I hope it won’t be too bad. I don’t like doctors very much. It’s kinda scary, honestly. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: We'll keep it brief. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in... and out. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly tachycardic. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's check your blood pressure. 138/85. A little elevated. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. No masses palpated. Reflexes 2+ bilaterally. Pupils are equal, round, reactive to light and accommodation. Neurological exam is grossly normal. However, I'm noting some mild short-term memory deficits based on our conversation. And you reported intermittent headaches and dizziness. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable, but the subjective complaints and mild memory issues are concerning.
PATIENT: Concerning? What does that mean? Is something seriously wrong? My head’s starting to hurt a little now, just thinking about it. The dizziness too… it’s kinda hard to explain. It’s like… everything’s a little fuzzy, like I said before. Is it my brain? Am I… sick? I really don’t like this. Can we just… make it go away? I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bonck, I understand your anxiety. The symptoms you’re describing warrant further investigation. It’s too early to make a definitive diagnosis. However, given your reported memory issues, headaches, dizziness, and family history, we need to rule out several possibilities. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, a thyroid stimulating hormone test, and a Vitamin B12 level. I'm also going to order an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid strenuous activity and get adequate rest. I'm also going to give you a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: MRI? Like… a big machine? And a neurologist? That sounds… serious. What are you looking for? Is it… something bad? What if it is something bad? I… I don’t think I can handle this. I just wanted to get a check-up. Can’t you just… give me something for my headache? Please? I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bonck, it’s important to remain calm. An MRI is a non-invasive imaging test that allows us to visualize your brain. It does not involve any radiation. The neurologist is a specialist who can provide a more in-depth evaluation of your neurological symptoms. It’s too early to jump to conclusions. These tests are simply to gather more information and rule out any potential underlying causes for your symptoms. I understand you’re anxious, and I want to reassure you that we’ll proceed cautiously and systematically. I will prescribe you a mild analgesic for your headache. However, it's only a temporary solution. We need to address the underlying cause. I will also provide you with a list of local support groups and resources that may be helpful. I will call you with the test results as soon as they are available. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… I understand. Tests… neurologist… support groups… But… what if it is something bad? What if I… forget everything? Is there anything… anything I can do? Just to… make it stop? I’m really scared. I just want to remember my life. Please… help me.
DOCTOR: Ms. Bonck, while I understand your fear, catastrophizing will not help. We are taking the necessary steps to determine the cause of your symptoms. Until we have the test results, it’s impossible to say what is going on. I am recommending these tests for your benefit, and I will be here to support you throughout the process. We'll take it one step at a time. Here is a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist specializing in cognitive disorders. Her number is 555-123-4567. And the order for the MRI. Schedule the MRI as soon as possible. And if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – severe headache, dizziness, confusion, or weakness – please go to the emergency room immediately. I have other patients waiting, Ms. Bonck. Please take care of yourself. .
