DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Paguioto. Welcome. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Dr. Piet. It’s nice to meet you too. I’m here for a vaccination, I think? They sent me a notice… something about getting updated, and I figured it was best to come in. I get a little mixed up with all the different shots these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a vaccination update. Yes, we’ve been sending out notices. Let me pull up your record… ah, here we are. It looks like you’re due for the updated COVID-19 vaccine and the flu vaccine. Is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. Both of those. I’ve been trying to keep up, but it’s… a lot. Are they both necessary this year? I just want to make sure I understand everything.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mr. Paguioto. Yes, both are recommended this year. The COVID-19 virus is still evolving, so the vaccine is updated to protect against the newer strains. And flu season can be particularly bad, so the flu vaccine is important as well. They are separate vaccines, so we’ll give them today. Do you have any allergies to vaccines or any previous reactions?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve always gotten my shots without any problems. Nothing comes to mind, at least. I usually just feel a little sore afterward, but nothing serious. Is there anything I should be expecting differently this time?
DOCTOR: Good to know. No reported allergies, and just typical soreness. Sometimes people experience a little fatigue or mild headache after the updated vaccines, just because your immune system is reacting. It usually resolves within a day or two. Before we proceed, have you had any recent illnesses or been hospitalized in the past few months?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I've been pretty healthy, actually. Just the usual little colds here and there, nothing that required a doctor’s visit or anything. I try to eat well and stay active. Is there a form I need to fill out or anything? Or are we good to go?
DOCTOR: No, it looks like we have all your information up-to-date. We can go ahead and get started then. I'm going to have the nurse prepare the vaccines. Do you prefer the left or right arm for the injections?
PATIENT: Oh, good. That's a relief. Hmm… I think the left arm would be best. I use my right arm for most things, so it’s probably better to leave it strong. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Left arm it is. Just so you know, I'll be listening to your heart and lungs quickly before administering the vaccines, just standard procedure. And then the nurse will give you the shots and we’ll have you wait for 15 minutes afterward to monitor for any immediate reactions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. Standard procedure is good. I appreciate you being thorough. I always feel better knowing everything is being checked properly. Go ahead whenever you’re ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, then. Let’s get started. If you could please sit back and relax. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Your breathing sounds clear, and your heart rate is regular. Everything sounds good. Now I’ll let the nurse come in and administer the vaccines. Please let her know if you have any concerns.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Thank you, Dr. Piet. I will. I think I’m ready. Just a little nervous about the needles, I suppose, but I know it’s important.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly normal to feel a little nervous, Mr. Paguioto. The nurse is very skilled, and it will be over before you know it. I'll be right here if you need anything at all. Let me call her in now.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Dr. Piet. I appreciate your patience. I'll just sit here and try to relax, like you said. Hopefully it won't be too bad.
DOCTOR: "Patient is alert and oriented, no acute distress. Lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally. Heart rate regular rhythm. No murmurs auscultated." We'll be right back with the nurse. Just a moment.
PATIENT: Okay, perfect. I’ll be ready when she is. Thank you again for everything. It’s nice to have a doctor who takes the time to explain things and make sure I understand.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paguioto. That’s part of my job. It’s important to me that my patients feel comfortable and informed. Nurse, this is Mr. Paguioto, here for his updated COVID and flu vaccines. He has no known allergies. He prefers the left arm.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s good to know. Thank you, Dr. Piet. Hello. Nice to meet you. Left arm it is. I'm ready when you are. I just... don't love needles, so try to be quick if you wouldn't mind!
