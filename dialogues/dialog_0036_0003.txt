DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Baide. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, I don’t have all day, so let’s just get this over with. It’s my hand. It shakes. Been shaking for…well, a while now. Don't ask me specifics, I don’t remember dates anymore. It's just annoying, is all.
DOCTOR: I understand you’d like to get right to it, and we will. It’s frustrating when something like that happens. “Been shaking for a while now” is helpful, and we can definitely look into it. To help me understand what’s going on with your hand, could you tell me a little more about the shaking?
PATIENT: More about the shaking? What do you mean? It shakes! Like…trembling. You know, like an old man. Is this really necessary? I’ve lived a long life, things wear out. What else do you need to know? Is it when I'm doing something, or just…random? Honestly, I don’t pay attention to these things. I used to direct films, I didn’t have time to notice my own hands.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide, and I apologize if my questions seem tedious. You're right, it’s helpful to know if it’s constant, or only happens when you’re doing something. So, does the shaking happen when you're resting – like when you're sitting and not using your hands – or only when you're trying to do something, like writing, eating, or reaching for something?
PATIENT: Oh, good lord. I…think it's worse when I try to do something. Like, if I'm trying to hold a glass, or…button my coat. Simple things, you know? I used to have a very steady hand, very important in my line of work. Now…it’s just embarrassing. Doesn’t really bother me that much, to be honest. I just don’t want to fall or something. Is that making sense? I'm not good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Baide. And it's good you're thinking about the possibility of a fall – that’s a very practical concern. So, the shaking is more noticeable when you’re actively using your hands, and less so when you’re at rest. Okay. Have you noticed if anything specifically seems to make it worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. Coffee, maybe? I drink a lot of coffee. Always have. And…stress, probably. Though what isn't stressful these days? Look, I’m an old man, alright? Things just get worse as you get older. I’m not a science experiment. Is this going to involve a lot of tests? Because I really don’t have the patience for that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about tests, Mr. Baide, and we'll try to be as efficient as possible. Coffee and stress are definitely things that can contribute to shaking. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, I would like to do a quick physical exam of your hands and nervous system. It won’t take long, and it will help me narrow down the possibilities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just get it over with. But don't expect me to hold still for long. And please, no needles. I hate needles. Is this going to hurt? I have a very low tolerance for pain, you know. I used to direct actors, not endure torture. Hurry up, will you? I have things to do. Probably nap.
DOCTOR: Absolutely no needles, Mr. Baide. I promise. This will be a very gentle exam – just checking your reflexes, strength, and coordination. It shouldn't cause any pain at all. Okay, if you could just extend your arms for me, palms up. And then, could you try to tap your finger to your nose a few times?
PATIENT: There. Happy? See? Shaky. What does that even mean? Is it something serious? I don't want to end up in one of those homes… people just…fade away in those places. My wife…she didn’t want that. Just tell me if it’s something I need to worry about. And if I can still drink my coffee. That’s important.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Baide. Your reflexes are a little bit diminished, which is common at your age, and your muscle strength is good. The tremor is noticeable when you're extending your arm and attempting to touch your nose, and there is some difficulty with coordination. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I'm seeing in the exam, it's possible this is an essential tremor. It’s a common neurological condition that causes involuntary shaking, and it often worsens with movement. It’s rarely a sign of a more serious problem, but it can be bothersome. However, to be sure, and to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a few blood tests. This will help me check for things like thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies that can sometimes cause tremors. And I’d also like to schedule a neurological consultation with Dr. Anya Sharma. She’s a specialist in movement disorders and can give you a more thorough evaluation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests, a specialist… Honestly, it’s always something. Fine. Do what you have to do. But I'm warning you, I don’t do well with doctors. And I absolutely refuse to be poked and prodded all day. Just make it quick, alright? And don't expect me to remember any of this. I barely remember what I had for breakfast. And look, about the coffee… you’re not going to tell me to stop drinking coffee, are you? Because I will not accept that. It’s the only thing keeping me going at this point. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Baide, and I promise to keep everything as efficient as possible. We’ll just need a standard blood draw, and Dr. Sharma is very good at explaining things clearly. And no, absolutely not. I’m not going to tell you to stop drinking coffee. It sounds like it’s a very important part of your routine. We can discuss ways to manage your symptoms with your coffee, if needed. Okay, I'll have the nurse draw your blood now. And I'll get the referral to Dr. Sharma scheduled for you. They will contact you to set up an appointment. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
