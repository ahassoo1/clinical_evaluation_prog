DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Nini. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you too, dear. Hmm, let me see… My memory isn't what it used to be, you know. My son, he said something about needing to know… what’s it called… my blood type? Something about having it on file, just in case. He worries so.
DOCTOR: That’s very thoughtful of your son, Mrs. Nini. It’s always good to be prepared. Knowing your blood type is a useful piece of information to have, and we can certainly get that documented for you. Besides that, are you experiencing any other health concerns today?
PATIENT: Oh, no, dear, not really. Just… getting old, I suppose. A few aches and pains, but nothing I can’t manage. Mostly, it's just… trying to remember things! Do you need a lot of information from me? Because I'm afraid I won't be much help with specifics.
DOCTOR: We'll take things at your pace, Mrs. Nini. Don't worry about specifics. We can work around that. To start, could you tell me a little bit about any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a tricky one. I’ve seen a few doctors over the years, you know. I think… I think they said something about my pressure being a little high, a long time ago. And maybe… arthritis in my hands? But honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. I was living in Spain then, and the doctors… they spoke so fast! And it was years ago. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mrs. Nini, but don’t worry if you can’t recall everything perfectly. We can look up some of your records if you’ve been seen at other clinics before. High blood pressure and arthritis are both common, and easily managed. Do you recall if you were ever prescribed any medications for either of those conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… Hmm. I think I took a little white pill for my pressure. Just a small one, every day. And a yellow one sometimes, for the… the achiness. But I stopped taking them years ago. My doctor back home… he said I didn’t need them anymore. Honestly, I can’t remember his name. So many doctors! I hope that’s not too confusing for you, dear.
DOCTOR: Not confusing at all, Mrs. Nini. It's very common for patients to have trouble remembering details about past medications. Let me see if I can pull up any records from previous providers. Do you happen to remember the name of the clinic where you saw your doctor back home, or perhaps the city where it was located?
PATIENT: Oh, that's kind of you to try, dear. Let me think… The city was… Marbella. Yes, Marbella, in Spain. And the clinic… it was a small one, near the beach. Dr. Ramirez, I think his name was? Or maybe… Rodriguez? Oh, it's dreadful, isn't it? My mind just doesn’t hold onto things anymore. It was a very… blue building, I remember that. Does that help at all?
DOCTOR: Marbella… Dr. Ramirez or Rodriguez… Let's see. I'm finding a record for a Dr. Ricardo Rodriguez in Marbella. It looks like you were his patient about ten years ago. The notes mention hypertension, and some osteoarthritis in your hands, consistent with what you’ve told me. It also shows you were prescribed lisinopril for your blood pressure and a short course of naproxen for the arthritis. Does that sound right, Mrs. Nini?
PATIENT: Oh! Yes, that sounds… right. Ricardo Rodriguez, yes! That's it! He was a very nice man. Lisinopril… that does sound familiar. And… naproxen. Oh, dear, it's good to finally remember something! You’re a clever woman, Doctor. Now, about this blood type… how are we going to find that out?
DOCTOR: I’m glad we could piece some of that together, Mrs. Nini. It’s a relief to confirm information, isn't it?
PATIENT: Yes, it is dear, it really is. It’s like a little weight lifted off my shoulders, you know? My son will be so happy. So, this blood type… what do we do? Do you need to poke me with a needle? I’m not afraid, but… well, I’ve never been very good with needles.
DOCTOR: A small blood draw is the most accurate way to determine your blood type, Mrs. Nini. And you are right to mention your discomfort with needles. We can certainly take things slowly and make you as comfortable as possible. We’ll use a small needle, and I’ll be very careful. Would you prefer to look away while I do it?
PATIENT: Oh, that's very kind of you, dear. Looking away might be best, yes. I’m not a faint sort, but I don't like watching things go in and out. And… how long will it take? I have a little appointment with my friend later this afternoon, and I don't want to be late. She’s making paella, you see, and I wouldn’t want to miss that!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mrs. Nini. We’ll keep it quick. The blood draw itself will only take a few minutes, and then the lab will need about 10-15 minutes to process the sample. So, all in all, it shouldn't take more than 20-25 minutes. And paella sounds lovely! Let’s get this done so you don’t miss out. Would you like to roll up your sleeve now?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, paella is always worth it! Alright, let's get it over with then. You’re very efficient, Doctor. I appreciate that. Just… be gentle, alright? And tell me if it stings.
DOCTOR: I will be, Mrs. Nini. I’ll let you know exactly what I’m doing, and you can tell me if you feel any discomfort at all. Just a quick pinch, and then we’ll be done. Alright, here we go… There, all finished. Just a little pressure for a moment… See?
PATIENT: Oh! That was… not so bad, dear. Not bad at all. Just a little sting, like you said. You have a very steady hand. Now we wait for the results? Thank you. You’ve been very kind and patient with an old woman like me. It really means a lot.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Nini. It's my pleasure. And you're not an "old woman," you’re a lovely patient. The lab results are back. You are type A positive. I’ll document that in your chart and send a copy to your son as well. Is there anything else I can help you with today, before you go enjoy your paella?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! A positive… good to know. Yes, send a copy to my son, please, he worries so. And no, dear, I think that's all. Just getting old, you know. You’ve been a lifesaver. Thank you again, Doctor Alanes. Now, off to paella! Have a lovely day.
DOCTOR: You have a lovely day as well, Mrs. Nini! And enjoy every bite of that paella. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns in the future. .
