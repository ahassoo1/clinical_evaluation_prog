DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom! It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. Why don't you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about time someone asked. It’s… it’s my stool. There was blood in it. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to be concerning. And frankly, at my age, concerning is everything. It’s not something a man wants to be dealing with, let me tell you.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Rowbottom. Any change in your stool, especially noticing blood, is definitely worth checking out, and you’re right to be proactive about it, especially at your age. It's good you came in. Could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it? What do you mean more? It was red. In my… well, you know. Looked like someone mixed a bit of beet juice in there, though I haven’t had beet juice in years. And it wasn’t every time, mind you. Just… a couple of times this past week. Honestly, probably shouldn’t have bothered you with it, but my daughter insisted. She gets herself worked up over everything.
DOCTOR: No, please, it’s absolutely worth discussing, and I'm glad your daughter encouraged you to come in. It’s always best to be thorough. And it’s good you noticed it. When you say a couple of times this past week, can you recall exactly when those instances were?
PATIENT: Ugh, dates. Always with the dates. Let me think… Tuesday, I believe. Yes, Tuesday morning. And then… Friday, maybe? Or was it Thursday? Honestly, they all blur together. I had that fish for dinner on one of those nights, though. A lovely piece of salmon. Perhaps it was that? I haven’t had any trouble with fish before, but… you never know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Tuesday and potentially Thursday. And you had salmon one of those nights. That's helpful. Sometimes dietary changes can cause changes in stool color, but we need to rule out other possibilities, just to be safe. Now, besides the blood and the timing, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits? What do you expect me to say? I go to the bathroom when I need to go to the bathroom. Is that what you want to know? It hasn’t been different, not really. Maybe a little… looser than usual, but I’ve been eating more fruit, so… It's not like I'm running to the toilet every five minutes, if that's what you're getting at. Honestly, this whole thing is a waste of time, probably.
DOCTOR: No, not at all, Mr. Rowbottom. It’s not a waste of time. These details help me get a clearer picture. “Looser than usual” is good to know. And you’re right, the fruit could certainly be contributing. Have you experienced any abdominal pain, cramping, or discomfort along with these changes?
PATIENT: Abdominal pain? Well, I'm eighty-eight years old. Something aches all the time. My back, my knees, my… everything! But specifically with this… no. Not really. Maybe a little bit of a rumble, but nothing I’d call pain. It's just… old age, you know? Everything creaks and groans.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good to differentiate between your usual aches and any new discomfort. So, no new abdominal pain. Now, have you noticed any fatigue, weakness, or unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Fatigue? Well, I am tired, aren’t I? I’m eighty-eight! What do you expect? I don’t have the energy I used to, naturally. And weight loss… hmm. I haven’t been trying to lose weight, that's for sure. My daughter keeps bringing over those… those healthy salads. I don’t much care for them. Maybe I’ve lost a pound or two, but it’s probably just from not eating enough proper food.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue consistent with age, and potentially a slight weight loss, possibly related to dietary changes. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medical history… Hmph. Well, I used to smoke. A pack a day, for years. Quit about twenty years ago, thankfully. Doctor told me I had to. And my blood pressure’s been a bit high, but I don’t take anything for it. I don’t much like taking pills. Oh, and I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was… unpleasant. Other than that, not much. I’ve always been a fairly healthy man, despite what my daughter says.
DOCTOR: Okay, past smoking history – that's important. High blood pressure, and appendectomy as a child. No other significant medical history. And have you ever had any surgeries or procedures besides your appendix removed?
PATIENT: Let me think… No, not that I recall. The appendix was the only one. I had a bit of trouble with my knees a few years back, the doctor wanted to do something about it, but I refused. Didn’t want to be laid up in a hospital. I've always avoided hospitals if I could. Too many germs, you know. And frankly, I don’t trust doctors much.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about hospitals and procedures. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I told you, I don't like taking pills. Vitamins... sometimes my daughter slips a multivitamin into my breakfast. But I usually just push it aside. I prefer a good cup of coffee and a piece of toast, thank you very much. Supplements? No. Just good old-fashioned coffee.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications, vitamins, or supplements. Now, before we move on to a quick exam, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any instances of colon cancer, rectal cancer, or other digestive issues in your family?
PATIENT: Family history… Hmph. My father… he died young. Heart attack, I think. My mother lived to be a good age, but she didn’t talk much about her family. She was a quiet woman. I don’t recall anyone having… what was it? Colon cancer? No, not that I remember. We didn’t talk about such things. It wasn’t polite.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited family history available. Now, Mr. Rowbottom, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and then I'd like to do a rectal exam to check for any abnormalities. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A rectal exam? Honestly, Doctor, do you have to? It's… undignified. I’m eighty-eight years old, I’ve had enough poking and prodding in my life. Can’t you just give me something for it? Some kind of… pill? I really don’t see the point. But… alright. If you have to. But be quick about it, and be gentle. And don’t tell my daughter. She’ll fuss over me for weeks.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Rowbottom, and I completely respect your concerns. I promise to be as quick and gentle as possible. It’s an important part of the examination to help rule out any serious issues, and I will explain everything as I go. And I will absolutely respect your privacy and won’t mention it to your daughter without your permission. Okay. If you could please lie down on your left side with your knees drawn up towards your chest, that would be great. I’ll explain everything as I go. Alright, I'm going to gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. This may cause a slight sensation of pressure. Okay, I’m feeling some slight tenderness, but no obvious masses or significant abnormalities. There is a small amount of stool present, which I’ll send to the lab for a fecal occult blood test to confirm the presence of blood. I'm also noting some internal hemorrhoids, which are common at your age and could explain some of the spotting you’ve observed. Okay, that’s all done. Please lie on your back for a moment.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn't pleasant. Internal hemorrhoids, you say? I figured as much. My father had those too. Always complaining about them. So, what does this all mean, Doctor? Am I dying? Is it serious? Just tell me straight. No beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Mr. Rowbottom, it’s good that we got that done. Based on the exam, the hemorrhoids are likely the cause of the spotting you’ve seen, and that's a very common condition, especially at your age. It's rarely serious. However, because you did notice blood, and to be absolutely thorough, I want to rule out anything more significant. The fecal occult blood test will tell us if there is blood in your stool that we can’t see. If that comes back positive, we may need to consider a colonoscopy. A colonoscopy involves inserting a small camera into your rectum to examine the entire colon. It's the best way to rule out polyps or other abnormalities. Right now, I’m not overly concerned, but it’s important to be proactive. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy? That sounds… invasive. And unpleasant. I don’t like the sound of that at all. And what if they find something? I’m eighty-eight years old, Doctor. I don’t want to be going through a lot of tests and procedures at this stage of my life. I’ve lived a good life. So, you’re saying there is something wrong? Are you sure it’s not just… old age?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Rowbottom. You're right to be hesitant, and I wouldn't recommend anything unnecessary. I’m not saying there is definitely something wrong. The blood could very well be from the hemorrhoids alone. However, because of your age and the fact that you noticed blood, it’s important to rule out any other possibilities, just to be safe. Think of it as a precaution. A colonoscopy is the most thorough way to do that. If it comes back clear, then we can confidently say the blood is likely from the hemorrhoids, and we can focus on managing those. If it does find something, then we can discuss the best course of action, which may not involve any further treatment. We’ll cross that bridge if we come to it. For now, let's start with the fecal occult blood test. We'll get the results in a few days, and then we can go from there. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: A few days… waiting. I hate waiting. Alright, fine. The test. Get it over with. But if it's going to involve a lot of fuss, I'm not interested. I've had enough doctors in my life, thank you very much. And I still think it's just old age. Everything aches and creaks, as I said before. But… alright. The test. Just get it over with. And no telling my daughter. She’ll fuss over me for weeks, I tell you. Weeks!
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Rowbottom. No fuss, I promise. And I will absolutely respect your privacy and won’t mention it to your daughter without your express permission. Here's the kit for the fecal occult blood test. It’s a simple process. You’ll collect a small stool sample at home and then bring it back to the lab. The nurse will give you instructions on how to do it properly. I’ll write you a prescription for the kit, and I'll also make a note in your chart about your concerns. We’ll call you as soon as the results are back, usually within a few days. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms, like severe abdominal pain, weakness, or significant changes in your bowel habits, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Rowbottom?
PATIENT: No. I think that's enough poking and prodding for one day. Just get it over with, and let me get back to my coffee. And don't tell my daughter. That's all. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. Even if I don't trust doctors much. Now, if you'll excuse me… I need a nap. And a cup of coffee.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rowbottom. You take care, and get some rest. I’ll be in touch as soon as the results are back. And I promise to respect your wishes regarding your daughter. Have a good day.
