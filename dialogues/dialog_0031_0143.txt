DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rakosky. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um... well, it's a bit... complicated. My daughter, she wants a baby. And she thinks… she thinks I should come with her, just to… talk things over. Before it happens, you know? I'm not really sure what needs talking over, to be honest. It's been a long time since I thought about… all that.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like your daughter would like you to be involved in some pre-conception counseling, and perhaps you have some questions or concerns about the process. That's perfectly reasonable. It’s good you’re both thinking ahead. To get a better understanding of things, perhaps we can start with your medical history. Have you seen a doctor regularly over the past few years?
PATIENT: Regularly… hmm. Not really, no. I used to, when I was working more… outside. Sales Engineers, you see. Lots of travel. Hard to keep appointments. Lately… not so much. A bit of a pain in my hip, now and then, but nothing serious. I mostly just… take things easy. I don't really remember the last time I had a proper check-up, to be honest. Is that… important?
DOCTOR: It is important, yes, Mr. Verrall. A check-up will help us understand your overall health and identify any potential issues that might affect your daughter's pregnancy, or your own well-being as you become a grandfather. It's also good to establish a baseline for future comparisons. Before we do a physical exam, could you tell me a bit more about this hip pain?
PATIENT: Oh, the hip. Right. It's… it just aches sometimes. Mostly when I walk a long way. Or if I stand for too long. It's not bad bad, you understand. More of a… a dull ache. Comes and goes. I just figured it was… old age, you know? I’m sixty-six now. Things start to… wear out. I haven't done anything about it. Didn't seem worth bothering the doctor for. Is it… is it something I should have done something about? I don’t really understand what doctors even do about aches, to be honest.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re bringing this up now. While it may just be age-related wear and tear, it’s important to rule out anything more serious. We can do a quick examination of your hip to assess the range of motion and identify any specific points of tenderness. This will help me determine if further investigation, like an X-ray, is necessary. Before we do that, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you might have?
PATIENT: Other conditions… hmm. Let me think. I had… something with my blood pressure, years ago. High, I think. The doctor put me on a pill for it. I stopped taking it… a long time ago. Didn't like the way it made me feel. And… I think I had a touch of the flu a few years back, but everyone gets the flu, right? Oh! And my teeth… they’re not great. I should probably go to the dentist, but… I don't really like dentists either. I can't really remember anything else, to be honest. Does it matter? I don’t usually go to doctors. Is my daughter worried about something specific? Maybe if I knew what she’s worried about, it would help me remember things.
DOCTOR: It’s helpful to know about the blood pressure, even if you stopped taking medication. And it’s alright that you don’t recall everything. We'll take things slowly. It’s common for people to be hesitant about medical visits. Your daughter is understandably concerned about ensuring a healthy pregnancy, and that includes assessing your overall health to identify any potential risks. Knowing your medical history helps us do that. To clarify, do you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Chest pain… no, not really. Sometimes a little… discomfort, after I eat something heavy. But that's just indigestion, I think. Shortness of breath… no. Unless I'm climbing a very steep hill, which I don’t do anymore! Dizziness… sometimes. Just a little bit, when I stand up quickly. Nothing serious. Palpitations… what are palpitations? Is that… like a racing heart? I don't think so. I haven’t really noticed anything like that. I'm probably just getting old, Doctor. Everything feels a bit… wobbly these days. I apologize, I’m not very good at this doctor talk. My daughter is much better with remembering things.
DOCTOR: You’re doing perfectly fine, Mr. Verrall. It’s completely understandable to not be familiar with medical terminology. And you're right, describing things can be difficult. Palpitations are that feeling of a racing or fluttering heart. Given what you’ve described, we’ll proceed with a physical exam to get a more comprehensive picture of your health. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and examine your hip. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have a bit of an appointment later… with my daughter, actually. We're going to look at baby clothes. She’s very excited. I don’t want to keep her waiting. Is it going to be… uncomfortable? I don't like being poked and prodded, you see. Honestly, I’m not sure why she made me come here. Maybe she just wants me to be… involved. I’m still a bit confused about what she expects. But alright, yes, you can check things. As long as it doesn't take too long.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Verrall. I’ll do my best to make it as comfortable and quick as possible. We’ll take things at your pace. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope, checking your blood pressure, and a brief examination of your hip to assess its range of motion and identify any tenderness. First, let's take your blood pressure. Could you please sit comfortably with your arm relaxed?
PATIENT: Alright. Relaxed… yes, I can do relaxed. Though my arm does ache a little… from carrying all those baby clothes catalogs my daughter gave me. She’s very enthusiastic. Is this… the thing that squeezes? I don’t like that squeezing feeling. It always makes my arm feel numb.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is the cuff that squeezes, Mr. Verrall. I'll try to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. It will only be for a moment. Just breathe normally. Your blood pressure is 148 over 92. That's a bit elevated. We’ll need to discuss this further. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Elevated? Is that… bad? I don’t understand all these numbers. My father had high blood pressure, I think. He didn’t take care of himself very well. It feels a bit… strange, listening to my chest. Is something wrong? My heart feels… okay, I think. Just a bit… fluttery sometimes, like I said before. It's probably just nerves. I don’t like being in the doctor’s office. It makes me anxious. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to feel anxious in the doctor’s office, Mr. Verrall. Your heart sounds are a little irregular, but not significantly concerning at this point. The elevation in your blood pressure and the occasional irregularity warrant further investigation. We’ll discuss some options for monitoring and potentially addressing these issues. Now, let's move on to your hip. Could you please lie down on your side, with the affected hip facing up?
PATIENT: Affected hip… that’s the left one, I think. It’s the one that aches more. Be careful, please. It’s a bit tender. I haven’t used this hip properly in… well, a long time. My daughter keeps telling me I need to exercise, but… I just don’t have the energy for it. And I don’t really know what exercises to do. This is all very stressful. I just want to get this over with so I can go look at baby clothes with my daughter. She’s really excited about it. Is this going to hurt?
DOCTOR: I’ll be as gentle as possible, Mr. Verrall. I'm just trying to determine the source of your discomfort. Do you feel any pain with this movement?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. A little bit. Right there… It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache. It feels… tight. Like something is stuck. I used to be very active, you know? Hiking, climbing… but that was a long time ago. Now, just walking to the store is a struggle. Be careful, please. I don’t want to make it worse. Is it… bad? Do I need a special injection or something? I really don’t like needles. This is all very overwhelming. I just wish I had stayed home.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Verrall. We’ll take it slow. The discomfort you're describing suggests some possible hip impingement or bursitis. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but it warrants further investigation. I don’t believe a special injection is needed at this time. To get a clearer picture, I recommend an X-ray of your hip to assess the joint structure and rule out any underlying arthritis. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An X-ray… oh dear. Is it… safe? I’ve heard things about radiation. And… will it hurt? I really don’t like being poked and prodded. My daughter will be so disappointed if I can’t go look at baby clothes with her. She’s been planning this for weeks. Maybe… maybe I can just ignore the pain. It’s probably just old age, like I said before. Is an X-ray really necessary? Can’t you just tell me what’s wrong by… feeling it? Honestly, Doctor, I’m starting to feel a bit anxious. This is all too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Verrall. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about medical procedures. The amount of radiation from an X-ray is very low—similar to what you're exposed to during a cross-country flight. It's a quick and painless procedure. While I can assess some things through physical examination, an X-ray will provide a much more detailed view of your hip joint, allowing me to make a more accurate diagnosis and recommend the most appropriate treatment plan. It will also allow us to rule out more serious causes of your pain. If you are very uncomfortable with the idea of an X-ray right now, we can certainly proceed without it. However, I would strongly recommend it to get a clear picture of what’s going on. Would you like some time to think about it?
PATIENT: Time to think… yes, that would be good. I… I need to talk to my daughter. She’s very good at these things. She always knows what to do. And… she’s been so excited about this. Maybe she can explain it to me better. Yes, please. I need some time to think. And… maybe I need a cup of tea. All this talk about X-rays and radiation is making me nervous. Can I… can I go now? I have an appointment with my daughter in about an hour, and I really don't want to keep her waiting. I apologize for being so difficult, Doctor. It's just… I don't like hospitals. Or doctors. Or anything to do with… this.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Verrall. Absolutely. We can certainly hold off on the X-ray for now. It's important you feel comfortable with any decisions we make. I’ll write down my findings from the examination, and we can discuss them further after you've had a chance to talk to your daughter. I'll also give you a referral slip for a local imaging center should you decide to proceed with the X-ray. I'll also provide you with some resources on hip pain and potential treatment options. If you experience any worsening pain or difficulty walking, please don’t hesitate to call the office. You can go now, Mr. Verrall. I hope you enjoy your time with your daughter. And please, don’t apologize—it’s my job to make you feel comfortable and informed.
PATIENT: .
