DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Pitzel. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a…reset, I suppose. Or a jumpstart. I’m not sure I’m explaining myself very well. It’s just…everything feels a little sluggish, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: "Sluggish," alright. Can you be more specific about what feels sluggish, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It’s not a pain, exactly. More like…low energy, constantly tired, even when I’ve had enough sleep. And I’ve been having trouble concentrating. I used to be able to work for hours on my pieces, now I find myself…distracted very easily. It’s affecting my work, which is…important to me. I shape things, you see. Stone mostly, but sometimes glass. It requires focus.
DOCTOR: I see. So, fatigue and difficulty concentrating. And this is impacting your sculpting work. How long have you been feeling this way, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. It didn't happen overnight, that's for sure. Probably…six months, maybe? It started gradually, just a little more tired than usual. Then it was harder to get motivated. Now…well, now it feels like a real effort to do anything, even things I enjoy. It’s been slowly getting worse, I think.
DOCTOR: Six months of progressively worsening fatigue and difficulty concentrating. Have you noticed any other changes in your body during this time?
PATIENT: Let me see… not really anything major. I’ve been a little more…irritable, perhaps? My husband has certainly noticed! And I think I’ve been sleeping more deeply, but not necessarily longer. Does that make sense? It’s hard to explain. Like I need the sleep, but it doesn’t always feel…restorative, if you know what I mean. And maybe a bit of muscle ache, but I do physically demanding work, so…I always assumed that was just from that.
DOCTOR: Irritability, deeper but not longer sleep, and some muscle aches. You mentioned you do physically demanding work. Can you describe a typical day for me, Ms. Pitzel?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I run a small workshop, mostly from home. I get up fairly early, around six, and start preparing my materials. I spend most of the day shaping stone, sometimes glass, depending on the commissions I have. It involves a lot of lifting, hammering, chiseling…it’s quite physical. I usually work through lunch, taking only short breaks. In the evenings, I try to relax with my husband, but honestly, I’m often too tired to do much. And I do try to eat fairly healthily, mostly fruits, vegetables, and lean protein. Not much sugar, I try to avoid it. Does that give you a good picture?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My appetite…hasn’t been huge, I suppose. I eat because I know I need to, but I don't really crave things like I used to. And I think I’ve lost a little weight, maybe five or ten pounds? It’s hard to say exactly, I don’t weigh myself very often. My clothes feel a little looser, that's about it. It wasn’t intentional, that’s for sure. I like to eat! I just…haven’t been very hungry.
DOCTOR: Okay. Loss of appetite and unintentional weight loss, along with the fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, and deeper but unrefreshing sleep. Let’s move on to some other things. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to any medication, and I eat a pretty varied diet, as I mentioned. No pollen allergies, no animal allergies…nothing that I can think of. My husband always teases me about my iron constitution! He says I can eat anything. Though, perhaps that’s changed lately…given my lack of appetite. But no, I don't have any known allergies.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don't take anything regularly. Occasionally, if I have a headache, I’ll take ibuprofen, but that's it. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. I believe in letting my body heal itself, if you know what I mean. No vitamins, no supplements…nothing. Just the occasional ibuprofen for a headache.
DOCTOR: Alright. No regular medications. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, thyroid problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s… a bit complicated. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe. And my father…he had some heart trouble later in life, but he didn’t take very good care of himself, to be honest. He smoked, drank…not the healthiest lifestyle. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had diabetes, I think. And an aunt, a very distant aunt, had breast cancer, but she was quite old when she was diagnosed. So, nothing immediate, if that makes sense? Mostly just things that come with age, and perhaps a little bit of bad habits. I try to live a healthier lifestyle than my parents did, for sure.
DOCTOR: Family history of hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes. Okay. Finally, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no. Never. I’ve never touched a cigarette in my life. And I rarely drink alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, but that’s it. And absolutely no recreational drugs. My husband and I both believe in a very…clean lifestyle. We enjoy good food, good company, and a good night’s sleep. That’s about it. So, no, nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Pitzel. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to get a better sense of what's going on. We'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and do a basic neurological exam. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine, Doctor. Please, proceed. I trust your judgment. I’m ready whenever you are. Hopefully, we can figure out what’s causing all this sluggishness. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat on the table. First, I'll check your blood pressure and heart rate. Blood pressure is 118 over 72, pulse is 68 and regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Thyroid is normal in size and consistency, no nodules palpated. Alright. Physical exam is unremarkable. Given your symptoms and the physical exam, I’d like to order some blood work. It will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and a vitamin D level. This will help us rule out some of the more common causes of fatigue and sluggishness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Whatever tests you think are necessary, I’m happy to comply. I understand that’s the best way to figure out what’s going on. A complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid…and vitamin D, you said? Alright. When can I expect the results? And will I need to fast beforehand?
DOCTOR: Yes, a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, TSH, and vitamin D. You will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw – no food or sugary drinks, water is fine. The lab will call you within 24-48 hours with the results. I will also review them and contact you if I see anything concerning. In the meantime, please try to get adequate rest and stay hydrated. While we are awaiting the results, it's important to rule out any red flags. Ms. Pitzel, have you experienced any unexplained weight loss, fever, night sweats, or any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. No fever, definitely not. And no night sweats, thankfully. As I mentioned, I've lost a little weight, but it wasn't sudden or dramatic. And my…bowel habits haven’t changed, no. Everything is pretty regular, if you know what I mean. No, nothing like that. I just feel…tired, sluggish. That’s really it. Nothing alarming, I hope?
DOCTOR: Alright. No unexplained weight loss, fever, or night sweats, normal bowel habits. That's reassuring. We’ll proceed with the blood work. Once we have those results, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe headache – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. I'll schedule the blood work right away, and I’ll be sure to fast beforehand. Hopefully, we can get to the bottom of this soon. Thank you again for your time.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Pitzel. I’ll have the lab technician send the results directly to my office. And please, don't hesitate to call if anything changes. I expect we'll have a clearer picture soon. Here is the requisition form. It's a little far, but the best facility around. Feel free to call if you have trouble. I will see you again once the results are in.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate that. I will call if I have any issues scheduling the appointment. I look forward to hearing from you. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You as well, Ms. Pitzel. .
