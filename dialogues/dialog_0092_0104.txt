DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ottaviani. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's nice to meet you. Now, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t have all day. It's my throat. It hurts. Been hurting for… a little while now, I suppose. Not a big deal, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A sore throat. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: More about it? What is there to say? It’s… scratchy. And it feels… swollen, maybe? Like something’s stuck. I don’t know. I just want it gone. It's very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when did this soreness start?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you're asking me dates… Honestly, Doctor, I don’t keep track of such things. A few days, maybe? Last week, definitely. Before that… I haven't the slightest. It just is. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Ms. Ottaviani. We'll get through this as efficiently as possible. So, it started sometime last week. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the sore throat?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I don’t get sick often, you know. I’m a very… robust woman. Maybe a little tired, but that's from working, not… whatever it is you're getting at. No, nothing else particularly. Why does it matter?
DOCTOR: It matters because it helps me understand what might be causing the sore throat. Fatigue can sometimes accompany infections, but it's good to rule things out. Have you had any fever, chills, cough, runny nose, body aches, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Goodness. You ask a lot of questions, Doctor. Fever? I don’t feel feverish. Chills… no. A little sniffly, perhaps. Everyone gets a sniffle now and then. And swallowing… well, it’s a little uncomfortable, as I said. But I manage. Look, I’m not a delicate flower, alright? Can we just get a prescription or something? I have work to do.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Ottaviani. I want to help you feel better as quickly as possible, and getting the right treatment starts with understanding what's going on. Let's do a quick examination, if you don’t mind. I’ll take a look at your throat, listen to your lungs, and check your temperature. It will only take a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick, Doctor. Very quick. I really don’t have time for… poking and prodding. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you could just open your mouth and say "Ah," that would be great. Okay, Ms. Ottaviani, your temperature is slightly elevated, and your throat is quite red with some mild swelling. Your lungs sound clear, which is good. I don't see any white spots on your tonsils at this time. Have you had strep throat before?
PATIENT: Strep… throat? I don't recall. I get sick very rarely, as I've said. My mother always gave me… tonics, I believe. Helped keep everything at bay. Honestly, Doctor, all these questions about things I might have had… it's a waste of my time. Is this… serious? Because if it isn't, I'd like to be on my way.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Ottaviani. It's good that you rarely get sick. Given the redness and mild swelling, and the slight elevation in your temperature, it could be a viral pharyngitis - a common sore throat caused by a virus. However, because it could also be strep throat, and strep throat needs to be treated with antibiotics to prevent complications, I'd like to do a quick strep test just to be sure. It's a simple swab of the back of your throat. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Another test? Honestly, Doctor. Fine. Just… get it over with. But if it's negative, I expect you to send me on my way immediately. I have responsibilities, you know. I don't have time for this. Quickly now.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Ottaviani. This will only take a moment. It might be a little uncomfortable, but it will be very quick. Okay, Ms. Ottaviani, the strep test is negative. That means it’s likely a viral pharyngitis. Unfortunately, antibiotics won't help with a viral infection. The best treatment is supportive care - rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen to manage the discomfort. I can recommend a throat lozenge or spray to help soothe your throat as well. It should improve within a week or so. Do you have any allergies to either ibuprofen or acetaminophen?
PATIENT: No allergies, as far as I know. Look, I appreciate you ruling things out, I suppose. But honestly, all this fuss for a little sore throat… It’s a waste of good money. So, I just rest, drink water, and take some… pills? Fine. Can I go now? I really must be going.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Ottaviani, that's correct. Rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain relievers. If your symptoms worsen, such as difficulty breathing, a high fever, or a rash, please seek medical attention immediately. Here's a summary of our visit, including these recommendations, which I’ll also give you a printed copy of. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
