DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paguiio. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. I’m here for a vaccination, if that’s right? I think it’s time for a booster or something. I get a little mixed up with which ones I’ve had, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A vaccination, yes. It’s… admirable you're thinking proactively about your health, though a little disorganized, frankly. We'll figure out which ones you've received. Do you happen to have a record of your vaccinations?
PATIENT: Oh, you're very kind to say so! And yes, disorganized is a good word for it. I think I have a card somewhere… ah, here we are. It’s a little crumpled, sorry. It’s from last year, I believe.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, this shows you received a COVID-19 booster in February of last year. And… that's it?
PATIENT: That's all I could find, Doctor. I know I've had others over the years, probably when I was traveling, but I never kept good track of them. Things just… got lost in the shuffle. Is there a way to look it up somewhere? Maybe with my Medicare information?
DOCTOR: Let me access your electronic health record. Medicare should have a record, although it’s rarely complete. Alright, it appears you had a tetanus booster ten years ago, and a flu shot annually for the past five years. No records of anything else beyond that, unfortunately. What about travel?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to know about the tetanus and flu shots, at least! And yes, I did quite a bit of traveling… mostly to Brazil and Angola for work, over the past twenty years. I needed some shots for those trips, I remember that. Yellow fever, definitely, and something for… well, I can't quite recall the name, something about the brain… encephalitis, maybe? It was a bit scary, honestly. Would those travel records be somewhere?
DOCTOR: “Something about the brain”?
PATIENT: Oh, I'm sorry, Doctor, I don’t mean to be vague! It was a long time ago and the nurse explained it quickly, about protecting against something you could get from mosquitoes. Japanese encephalitis, I think? It was a requirement for Angola, definitely. I have a feeling my old employer might have records of what I needed. They had a whole travel health department.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, a complete vaccination history would be ideal, but it seems we’re working with… gaps. Regardless, the important thing is we protect you now. Given your age and travel history, and assuming you haven't had a recent booster, I recommend a Tdap booster – that’s tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis – and a pneumococcal vaccine. We'll also ensure you're up-to-date on your flu shot this fall. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best, really. Tdap and… pneumococcal, you said? Is that the one for… lung problems? I don't want to be a bother asking so many questions, but I like to understand things a little, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: It’s not “lung problems” precisely. Pneumococcal vaccine protects against Streptococcus pneumoniae bacteria, which can cause serious infections like pneumonia, meningitis, and bloodstream infections. It’s particularly important for people in your age group, and those with underlying health conditions—though you don't appear to have any documented ones. We administer it as a precaution. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before proceeding?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of, Doctor. Nothing I've ever reacted to, anyway. So, those two vaccines… the Tdap and the pneumococcal… are they given at the same time? And will I feel unwell afterwards? I have a bit of a busy week.
DOCTOR: Yes, they can be administered concurrently, although some patients experience more mild side effects. You may feel some soreness at the injection site, possibly a low-grade fever or fatigue. It's generally manageable, and resolves within a day or two. We'll monitor you briefly after the injections. Are you prepared to receive them now?
PATIENT: Yes, let's go ahead and do it, Doctor. The sooner it's done, the better, I suppose. I appreciate you explaining everything, even if I ask a lot of questions! Just let me know if there's anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please relax your arm. This may sting briefly. There. That’s the Tdap, and now the pneumococcal. We’ll have you sit here for fifteen minutes for observation. I’ll be back shortly to check on you. Do not hesitate to inform a member of staff if you experience any unusual reaction.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. That wasn't so bad, actually. Just a little pinch. I’ll sit tight and let you know if anything feels off. Fifteen minutes, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, fifteen minutes. And, Mr. Paguiio, I strongly recommend keeping a more thorough record of your vaccinations moving forward. It simplifies things considerably. I'll return shortly. Do not hesitate to call out if anything changes.
PATIENT: .
