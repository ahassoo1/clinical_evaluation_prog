DOCTOR: Hi Yamir, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Just... fitness check. For... referee. Need paper say I okay. Want to be quick, if possible.
DOCTOR: Right, a physical for refereeing. Absolutely. We can certainly do that. I just need to gather a little bit of information first, to make sure everything's in order. It won’t take long, I promise. First, let’s just confirm some basics… You said you’re 31, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes. Thirty-one. August is birthday month. But... not important right now. Just want check for referee.
DOCTOR: Happy early birthday then! No worries, we'll focus on getting you what you need for refereeing. Just covering all bases. Okay, and is there anything specific that's been concerning you lately?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I feel... okay. Work is hard, sometimes. Lifting heavy things. But... normal. No pain. No problem. Just… check.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to hear. So, no current pain or issues… just a routine check-up due to the demands of your work and refereeing. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Nothing I know. Wife… she take care of things. She… gone now. I don’t… go to doctor much. Just check now for referee. I think everything okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. We can certainly get a good baseline established today then. Just to be thorough, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgery. Never hospital. Small cut on hand at work once. But… nothing big. Just… work. Always work. Is there… form to sign? Want to be quick, please.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is a standard form we need you to fill out with your medical history and consent for the exam. It will help me get a clearer picture of your health. It’s fairly straightforward, and I’m happy to help if you have any questions. While you’re filling that out, I’ll just quickly jot down some notes. After that, we’ll do a quick physical exam – just checking your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and things like that. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. Form… alright. Quick is good. Where is form? I… not good with paper. Wife always do paper.
DOCTOR: Here you go. Don't worry about being perfect with it. Just do your best to answer what you can. The first few sections are basic – name, date of birth, insurance information. If you get stuck on anything, just raise your hand and I'll come over and help. Take your time.
PATIENT: Insurance… what is policy number? I… don’t have number. Just card. Is okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, the card is perfectly fine. The policy number is usually a long string of numbers printed on the card itself, right here… It’s okay if you don’t have it memorized, we just need the card to look it up. Do you see it?
PATIENT: Ah… yes. Here. Long number. Lots of numbers. Okay. I… write it down now. Thank you. This… difficult. Wife always do this.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, it is a bit confusing sometimes. Just take it one step at a time. The next section is about any medications you’re currently taking. Are you on any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I… sometimes take pain killer for back, when heavy lifting. But… not every day. Just when need. Ibuprofen, maybe? I don’t remember name. Just… pills. Small blue pills. From store.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for back pain. That’s helpful. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. No allergy. I eat everything. My wife… she allergy to peanuts. But… I not. I… never allergy to anything. I think.
DOCTOR: Good to know. Alright, just a few more questions on the history section, then we can move on to the exam. Have you had any serious illnesses in the past, like pneumonia, heart problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: No. Never sick. I… work. Always work. Never time to be sick. Sometimes… cold. But… not serious. Just… sniffles. Wife… she have flu bad one time. I take care of her. But I never.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant past illnesses. That's good. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… my father… he strong. Worked very hard. Died… old. Mother… she quiet. She… gone now too. No… no heart problems. No diabetes. Just… old. Healthy. I think. They… Chinese. Not much doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known family history of significant medical problems. We'll make a note of that. Alright, that’s almost all the questions on this form. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. No smoke. No drink. No… bad things. Wife… she sometimes drink small glass of wine. But I… never. Work is enough.
DOCTOR: Okay, excellent. Thank you for filling that out. Now, if you’re comfortable, we’ll just do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your general physical condition. It won’t take long. Would you like to change into a gown, or are you comfortable being examined with your clothes on?
PATIENT: Clothes okay. No need change. Want to be quick, remember? Just… check. Fast.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Fast is fine. Okay, if you could just sit up here on the table for me… I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a nice, deep breath in… and out… Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses noted. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric. Blood pressure is 128/76. Everything sounds good so far. Do you have any pain anywhere when I press here?
PATIENT: No. No pain. You… pressing hard, maybe? But… no pain. Just… pressing. I lift heavy things at work. Maybe… feeling? Not pain. Everything okay. I think. Quick now, please? Referee check need.
DOCTOR: You’re right, a bit of pressure is normal with lifting. Okay, everything seems normal on the physical exam. Blood pressure is good, lungs are clear, and I didn't find any areas of concern. To be absolutely thorough, and given your job, I might recommend a basic blood test to check your cholesterol and kidney function. It’s just a precaution, but it would give us a good baseline. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Blood test… need long time? Need paper for referee now. Just say okay? Say I healthy? I need paper. Not need blood test. Thank you, Doctor. Everything okay? Just say okay for referee?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You need the form for the referee check quickly, and you're understandably concerned about the time commitment of a blood test. Based on the limited information and the normal findings of this physical exam, I can state that you appear healthy and fit for refereeing duties. However, please understand that this is a limited assessment, and a more comprehensive evaluation would be ideal. I will fill out the necessary form stating that you have been medically cleared for refereeing. I will also note that a full blood workup is recommended for a more comprehensive assessment. Here you go. Please read the notes I've included about the recommended blood work. Does this work for you?
PATIENT: Okay. Okay! Yes. This… this work. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. You… good doctor. I… go now? Referee check need. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Yamir. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment if you have any concerns. And remember, consider the blood work when you have the time. Have a good day, and good luck with refereeing! .
