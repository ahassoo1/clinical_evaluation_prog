DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Aluia. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it's these bumps on my legs... my shins, mostly. They’re red and kinda painful. Been botherin’ me for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, bumps on your shins that are red and painful. “A little while now” – can you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… a couple of months, I guess? They weren't too bad at first, just a little itchy. But they’ve gotten bigger and more sore, especially when I’m standin’ for a long time. My wife, she noticed them first, actually. She always has a good eye for these things.
DOCTOR: Alright, a couple of months, starting as itchy and progressing to more painful with prolonged standing. That’s helpful. Do you recall anything specific that might have started them?
PATIENT: You know, that’s a good question. I honestly can't think of anything. I do a lot of work… movin’ things around, you know? At the warehouse. Maybe somethin’ there? I don’t remember gettin’ cut or anything, though. It's hard to say, Doctor. I'm an old man, I forget things easy these days.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It's common to not remember specifics. Working at the warehouse… that's good information. Let's talk a little more about the bumps themselves. Are they just on your shins, or have they spread anywhere else?
PATIENT: Just my shins, as far as I can tell. I checked my calves a couple times, and my feet… nowhere else. They're mostly on the front of my shins, right where my socks usually hit. They're kinda hard, too. Not like… soft bumps, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. Hard bumps on the front of the shins, where your socks hit. Okay. Have you noticed any drainage from them, or any changes in their appearance other than getting bigger and more painful?
PATIENT: No drainage, Doctor. Not at all. Just redder, harder, and more… well, more noticeable, I suppose. They haven’t changed color much, just gotten brighter red when they’re botherin’ me. And sometimes the skin around them feels a little warm. But no pus or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Alright, no drainage, just redness, hardness, warmth around them, and increased pain. Now, let’s quickly go over some other things. Do you have any other medical conditions – like diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I had high blood pressure for a little while, but the doctor got it under control with some pills. Other than that, nothin’ much. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ old, I guess. My wife takes care of most of the doctor stuff, so I don't always remember everything. I take a little pill for my blood pressure every mornin’, that’s about it. Do you need to know the name of the pill? She’d know it better than me.
DOCTOR: It’s okay, don’t worry about the name right now. We can look that up in your records. Just knowing you have a history of high blood pressure, now controlled with medication, is helpful. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… I had my appendix taken out when I was a young man. A long time ago, back in the Philippines. And I was in the hospital for a couple of days when I broke my arm a few years back. Fell off a ladder while tryin’ to fix the roof. But that’s about it, I think. Nothing major recently. Just the usual bumps and bruises from work.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed in the Philippines, and a broken arm a few years ago. Good to know. Now, I’m going to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, children – has had similar skin problems, or any other medical conditions like diabetes or heart disease?
PATIENT: That's a tough one, Doctor. My family... we don’t talk about medical stuff much. Back home, you know, people didn’t go to the doctor as much. My mother, she had some trouble with her legs when she got older, but I don’t know what it was. Maybe swelling? And my father, he had a weak heart, I think. He passed away when I was still young. I don’t really know much beyond that, sorry. It wasn't something we talked about a lot.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s common for families not to have detailed medical histories. So, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smokin’ for me. Never liked it. I used to drink a little beer sometimes, with dinner. But not anymore, my wife convinced me to stop. Said it wasn't good for my blood pressure. And no, definitely no drugs. Just an old man tryin’ to stay healthy! Mostly.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear! Now, just one last quick thing: Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. My wife always makes sure to check when I get a new prescription, but I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat just about anything, thankfully. She’s a good cook, so that’s a blessing!
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for all that information, Mr. Aluia. Now, would you mind if I took a look at your legs?
PATIENT: No, no problem at all, Doctor. Go ahead. They’re right here. Just let me know if you need me to move or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some erythematous, slightly indurated nodules on your anterior shins, consistent with your description. There’s no active drainage or ulceration. Palpation reveals some tenderness, but no warmth extending beyond the immediate area of the nodules. Peripheral pulses are intact, and capillary refill is normal. Based on what you've told me and what I'm seeing here, it's possible these are shin splints, although they're presenting a bit differently than typical. Another possibility is nodular vasculitis, an inflammation of the blood vessels, although that would require further investigation. We should rule out any infection as well.
PATIENT: Vascu-what-itis? That sounds serious, Doctor. Shin splints, I've heard of those, but these don’t feel like a muscle thing. They feel... hard, you know? Like somethin’ under the skin. What kind of investigation do you mean? Will I need more pills? My wife is always worried about me takin' too many. And do you think this is somethin’ from work? Should I ask my boss for a different job?
DOCTOR: Vasculitis is a bit of a complicated term, it simply means inflammation of the blood vessels. It can be serious, but we’re not jumping to conclusions yet. It’s just one possibility we need to consider. You're right to ask about work; repetitive stress or minor trauma could certainly be a factor, though it’s also important to rule out other causes. To investigate further, I’d like to order a blood test to check for inflammation markers and rule out any underlying autoimmune conditions. We may also need to do a skin biopsy – a small sample of skin from one of the nodules – to examine it under a microscope. That's the best way to determine exactly what's going on. As for medication, let’s not worry about that yet. We’ll see what the tests reveal first. We definitely don’t want to start any treatment unnecessarily. The biopsy is really the key. It's a quick procedure, done right here in the office, and we can discuss the results thoroughly. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A skin biopsy... that sounds a little scary, Doctor. Like... takin’ a piece of me? But I understand, you need to know what it is. If it helps find out what’s wrong, then I guess I can do it. My wife always says I’m a tough old man. So, if you think it’s the best thing, then go ahead. Will it hurt a lot? And how long will it take? I have to go back to work tomorrow, you know.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel a little apprehensive about a biopsy. It is just a small sample of skin, and it's a very quick procedure. We’ll numb the area completely with a local anesthetic, so you shouldn’t feel any significant pain – just a little pinch at first. The actual biopsy takes less than 10 minutes. Afterward, there might be some mild discomfort, like a scrape, but we’ll apply a bandage, and you can continue your normal activities, though it’s best to avoid strenuous exercise for a day or two. We’ll give you detailed instructions on how to care for the biopsy site. The sample will be sent to the lab, and it usually takes about a week to get the results. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them as soon as they're available. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A week… that’s not too bad, I suppose. A little scrape, I can handle that. Alright, Doctor, let’s get it over with. I trust you know what you’re doin’. Just… try to be quick, okay? And tell me if it’s gonna hurt. My wife will be mad if I come home complainin’ too much!
DOCTOR: I appreciate your trust, Mr. Aluia, and I’ll do my best to make it as quick and comfortable as possible. I’ll let you know exactly what I’m doing every step of the way. I’ll start by numbing the area with a small injection of local anesthetic… you might feel a brief stinging sensation, but it will quickly fade. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort. Alright, we’re all done. Just a little pressure here for a few minutes to stop any bleeding. I’m applying a bandage now. You can keep this on for 24 hours, and then you can remove it and clean the area with soap and water. Avoid strenuous activity for the next couple of days, and if you notice any signs of infection – redness, swelling, pus – please contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Just... try not to think about it too much, okay? My wife always worries when I get poked and prodded. I’ll just try to take it easy for a few days. Thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. I appreciate it. I’ll see you next week, then. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Aluia. And don't worry, we'll keep a close eye on everything. Just take it easy, and if anything concerns you, don't hesitate to call. I’ll see you next week. Have a good day, and please give your wife my best regards. .
