DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. Welcome. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice meetin’ you too. Um… well, I want to know… about my family. Where they come from, long time ago. I hear now you can… test things? With spit or somethin’? To see where people really from?
DOCTOR: Ah, yes. You're referring to genetic ancestry testing. It's become quite popular. It can give us some interesting insights into your heritage, tracing your roots through your DNA. It’s not a perfect science, mind you – there are limitations, and it doesn’t tell the whole story. But it can be a good starting point. Before we get too far into that, though, just to make sure I understand correctly…are you experiencing any health concerns at the moment?
PATIENT: No, no health things botherin’ me. I feel okay for my age. Just… always wonderin’ ‘bout my family. My mama, she never talk much ‘bout where her mama come from. And my papa… he gone a long time now. So… mostly just want to know. Is it hard test? And how long it take to get answer?
DOCTOR: No, the test itself is very simple. It's usually just a saliva sample – you’d spit into a little tube. Quite easy, really. As for how long it takes… well, that depends on the company doing the analysis. Usually, it’s several weeks – anywhere from four to eight weeks, sometimes longer. They need time to process the sample and compare it against their databases. Before we order anything, let me just ask a few quick questions, just to get a clearer picture. Do you have any idea at all about your family's origins?
PATIENT: Well… I born on Majuro, Marshall Islands. That’s where my mama and papa born too. I think… they say people come from other islands long time ago, but I don’t know which ones. Lots of tradin’ happen, you know? So maybe… people from many places. I mostly hear talkin’ ‘bout canoes and fishin’. Does test tell you ‘bout that? ‘Bout the canoes?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know, Mr. Scobie. Majuro, yes. A lot of history there, as you said. And trading does mean a mixing of people. The tests primarily focus on geographic origins – where your ancestors likely lived. It won’t necessarily tell you about canoes specifically, but it might point to regions known for seafaring traditions. Now, just to be thorough… have you ever had any genetic testing done before, for any reason?
PATIENT: No, never. I'm too old for all that fancy stuff. This is first time thinkin’ ‘bout it. My doctor back home, he just check my heart and sugar. That’s all. Always sayin’ I need to eat less coconut, but… what's life without coconut?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Scobie. Coconut is a good part of life! And that’s perfectly reasonable. No genetic testing before, good. That simplifies things. Before we proceed with ordering the test, let me quickly review your medical history on the computer here. Just to make sure there aren't any contraindications or reasons not to do it. It’s just standard procedure. One moment…
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Take your time. No rush. I sit here nice and quiet. Always trust what you doctors do. You went to school for long time, I just fish and make little boats.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie. I see here you've had regular check-ups with Dr. Keju, and your main concerns are heart health and blood sugar, which is good to know. No significant allergies listed, and you're currently taking no medications. Your height is 155 centimeters and weight is 56 kilograms… that’s all consistent with what you’ve told me. There doesn’t seem to be any reason not to proceed with the genetic ancestry test. Would you like me to go ahead and order the kit for you?
PATIENT: Yes, please, Doctor. That would be good. I want to see where I come from. And… how much it cost? I got my Medicare card here. Is it cover much?
DOCTOR: Alright, I'm ordering a kit from 23andMe. It's one of the more reputable companies. The cost is $199. Let's see about Medicare coverage… Unfortunately, Medicare typically doesn't cover genetic ancestry testing when it's done for personal interest, rather than a specific medical reason. However, it might cover a portion of the cost if we were to order a more comprehensive genetic health report along with the ancestry test. That report could provide information about your risk for certain conditions. Would you be interested in exploring that option?
PATIENT: Hmmm… a health report… I don't know. I feel pretty good, like I say. I don't want to know too much bad news. Maybe just stick to the ancestry test then? If that’s okay. I don’t want to bother you with too many things.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Scobie. We'll stick to the ancestry test then. No need to add anything you’re not comfortable with. We can always revisit the health report option later if you change your mind. Okay, I’m submitting the order now. The kit should arrive in about a week. It will come with clear instructions on how to collect the saliva sample. You’ll mail it back to the lab, and they’ll send you the results online in 4-8 weeks. Do you have an email address where they can send the information?
PATIENT: Yes, I have email now. My granddaughter, Leilani, she set it up for me. It’s… lauryscobie@majuromail.com. She says it good for keepin' touch with family. And… will you explain results to me when I get them? I not very good with computers.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Scobie. That’s what I’m here for. Once you receive the results, just give me a call or make another appointment, and we’ll go through them together. I'll explain everything in plain language – no confusing medical jargon, I promise. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That's all for now. Thank you very much for your help. I feel much better now, knowin’ I can find out ‘bout my family. You very kind.
