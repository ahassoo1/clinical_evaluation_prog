DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tati. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh... cough. I got cough. Long time already. And... tired also. Very tired. Sometimes my nose… blocked. Hurts a little.
DOCTOR: A cough, fatigue, and nasal congestion… for how long, precisely, have you been experiencing these symptoms, Mr. Tati?
PATIENT: Hmm… long time. Maybe… six months? Or more? I don't really keep track. A few times I had to take time off work because very bad. My wife... she keeps telling me to come, but I busy with tires, you know?
DOCTOR: Six months or more… and this has impacted your ability to work. I understand you are busy, Mr. Tati, but neglecting your health can unfortunately worsen these issues. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the cough itself?
PATIENT: Uh… it’s… wet cough. Sometimes. Sometimes dry. Lots of… phlegm. When I lie down, it’s worse. And… ... when I catch cold, it gets really bad. Sorry, Doctor, I not very good with explaining. Just… cough a lot. And tired. Very tired.
DOCTOR: A productive cough – meaning you bring up phlegm – that worsens when lying down and is exacerbated by colds. Fatigue as well. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside these?
PATIENT: Hmm… ... I think… sometimes fever. Not very high, just… warm. And… ache a little. All over. Like after hard work. But I always got ache from work, you know? Hard job. I forget things also. Maybe just old.
DOCTOR: Fever, body aches… and you've noticed some forgetfulness. I see. Now, Mr. Tati, have you experienced any shortness of breath or chest pain at any point?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… no, not really. Chest pain… sometimes a little ache, but I think that’s from lifting tires all day. Very heavy. No sharp pain. Just… tired pain.
DOCTOR: Very well. And regarding your past medical history, have you been diagnosed with any chronic illnesses, such as asthma, bronchitis, or pneumonia?
PATIENT: Chronic… what? Uh… no. Never been to hospital. Except… ... when I was small, I broke my arm falling from tree. But nothing else. Just cough, you know? Always cough. My wife said maybe allergies, but I don't know. I just fix tires. Not sick person.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, over-the-counter or prescribed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. Just… sometimes I drink herbal tea when cough very bad. My wife makes it. But it doesn't really help. Just warm.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your lungs and check your temperature, amongst other things. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Okay. That's okay. Whatever you need, Doctor. I just want cough to go away. And… maybe not so tired. Please be quick, I got tires waiting. But I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Tati. As quickly as possible. Please, if you would be so kind, lie down on the table. Take a deep breath in… and out… again… deep breath in… and out. I'm listening to your lungs now. Your lungs exhibit mild wheezing, particularly on exhalation. I will now check your temperature and blood pressure. Your temperature is 99.8°F, slightly elevated. Blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg. Now, let me examine your throat and ears. Throat appears mildly inflamed, but ears are clear. I'm also going to palpate your lymph nodes. Your lymph nodes are slightly enlarged, but not significantly concerning at this time.
PATIENT: Okay. Wheezing… what does that mean? A little sore. Inflamed… is that bad? My wife always says I need rest. Maybe she’s right. But tires… someone needs to fix them. What you think, Doctor? Just cough? Or something more serious? I got work to do.
DOCTOR: Wheezing indicates some narrowing of the airways in your lungs, which could be due to inflammation or constriction. The mild inflammation of your throat and slightly enlarged lymph nodes, coupled with your symptoms and the duration of your illness, suggest a possible upper respiratory infection, perhaps bronchitis. However, given the length of your symptoms and your fatigue, we cannot rule out other possibilities entirely. To get a clearer understanding, I recommend a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. These tests will help us determine if there is any evidence of pneumonia or other underlying condition. Would you be amenable to those tests?
PATIENT: X-ray… and blood count? That sounds… serious. How much it cost? I don’t have much money, Doctor. I just fix tires, you know? And… will it take long? I need to get back to work. But… if you think it’s important… then okay. I trust you, Doctor. But please be quick. What you think the problem is? Is it serious? Just cough?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns regarding the cost and time, Mr. Tati. The X-ray and blood count will provide us with valuable information to make an accurate diagnosis. I will see what we can do to minimize the cost; we may be able to explore options for financial assistance. The tests themselves shouldn't take long, perhaps an hour or two. Based on your symptoms and examination findings, it's unlikely to be a life-threatening condition, but the prolonged duration of your illness warrants further investigation. It could be a lingering bronchitis, but we must rule out other possibilities, such as pneumonia or, less likely, a more chronic lung condition. I will order the tests now. While we await the results, I recommend rest, plenty of fluids, and over-the-counter cough suppressants for symptomatic relief. If your symptoms worsen—such as increasing shortness of breath, high fever, or chest pain—please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions at this time, Mr. Tati?
PATIENT: Okay. Rest… fluids… cough suppressants. I can do that. My wife always tells me to rest. Pneumonia… that sounds bad. How long before we get results? And… how much it cost? I really need to get back to work. People need tires fixed. But… I trust you, Doctor. Do what you need to do. Just… please be quick. And not too expensive. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: The results should be available within 24-48 hours. I will have my staff contact you as soon as they are in. As for the cost, I will ask the billing department to provide you with an estimate and explore any available options for financial assistance. In the meantime, please prioritize rest and hydration. If your symptoms worsen, do not hesitate to seek medical attention. I will see you again once the results are in, Mr. Tati. Thank you for your patience and cooperation.
