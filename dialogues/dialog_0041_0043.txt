DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Gibbel. Good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. I’ve been getting this headache, right in the back of my head. It’s been happening for… oh, let me think… about two weeks now, I reckon. Not constant, comes and goes, but when it’s here, it’s a real bother.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache for about two weeks, coming and going… and you say it’s located in the back of your head. Can you describe the headache for me?
PATIENT: Hmm, how to describe it… it’s not a throbbing pain, not like a migraine my daughter used to get. It’s more… a steady pressure. Like someone’s tightening a band around my head, but just at the very back. And sometimes it feels a little… sensitive to the touch, if I rub back there. Not awful, but you notice it. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. A steady pressure at the back of your head, sensitive to touch… Okay. And would you say anything makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Now that you mention it… sitting at my computer seems to make it worse. I do a lot of financial planning work from home, you know, spreadsheets and all that. Being hunched over… that’s when it really starts to bother me. And lying down flat sometimes helps a little. Not a cure, but it takes the edge off. Oh! And strong smells, like perfume, they don’t help either. My ex-wife always wore a lot of perfume… Not that I’m blaming her, of course!
DOCTOR: No, not blaming anyone at all. Okay, so it seems to be aggravated by sitting at the computer, perhaps worsened by strong smells, and lying down offers some relief. Has anything like this happened before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Hmm, not exactly like this. I used to get tension headaches, years ago, when I was working a different job, a lot more stressful. But those were more all over, in my forehead and temples. This feels… different. More focused right at the back of my head. And it’s not as bad as those old tension headaches, thankfully. I haven't had one of those in… oh, must be twenty years or more. I’m a pretty good rememberer, you see.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. A different location and severity compared to previous tension headaches. You say you’re a good rememberer, which is helpful. Aside from the headache, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… no fever, no dizziness. Vision’s been fine, I can see the numbers on my spreadsheets just as well as ever. No nausea, thankfully. Hmmm… actually, now that you ask… my neck has been a little stiff lately. Not awful, but I’ve noticed I have to turn my head a bit to look to the side. Could be just from sleeping wrong, though. I do try to get a good eight hours, but sometimes… well, sometimes I wake up feeling a little creaky.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no dizziness, vision is fine, no nausea, and some neck stiffness. That's helpful. Do you have any problems with your hands or arms, any weakness or numbness?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Hands are steady as a rock, still able to type up reports all day. No numbness or tingling, nothing like that. I play a little checkers with my grandkids sometimes, still got a good grip on the pieces. Everything seems to be working just fine in that department, thankfully. I've always been pretty active, you see. Not running marathons, but I keep myself moving.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. Okay, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis, anything at all?
PATIENT: Well, let me see… the doctor told me years ago, maybe thirty years back, my cholesterol was a little high. He put me on a diet, cut back on the fried foods. Seems to have done the trick, hasn’t bothered me since. Other than that… I had my gallbladder out when I was in my fifties, but that was a long time ago and no trouble from it since. I've never been one for taking a lot of pills, if I can avoid it. And no arthritis or anything like that, thankfully. My mother had a bad hip, but I seem to have dodged that bullet.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high cholesterol managed with diet, gallbladder removed long ago, and no arthritis. Good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries besides your gallbladder?
PATIENT: No, not that I recall. Nothing else. Just the gallbladder. I broke my arm when I was a little boy, climbing a tree, but that healed up just fine, no surgery needed for that. I was a bit of a scamp when I was younger, always getting into mischief. My parents weren’t too pleased, but that’s another story… Mostly just the gallbladder, Doctor. That's the only surgery I've had.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother, like I said, had bad hips, needed a replacement eventually. My father… he had heart trouble when he got older, but that was more from smoking, to be honest. He was a stubborn man, wouldn’t quit. My older brother had diabetes, but he didn’t take very good care of himself. On my wife's side… I don’t know really. We weren’t very close to her family, to be truthful. So… heart trouble and hips, mostly. Nothing too serious that I’m aware of, nothing that I’m worried about inheriting, anyway.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. I've taken antibiotics a few times over the years, when I had a cold or something, and never had any reaction. My daughter always asks me that, she's a nurse, very cautious. She worries about everything! But no, I haven't ever had an allergic reaction to anything. Food, medicine… nothing. I can usually handle anything, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to avoid pills as much as possible, you see. No blood pressure medicine, no cholesterol drugs, nothing for arthritis… nothing. Just plain water and a healthy diet, mostly. And a little bit of checkers now and then to keep the mind sharp. My daughter keeps trying to get me to take a vitamin D supplement, says everyone needs it, but I haven't gotten around to it yet. But that's the only thing, really. No regular medications, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and do a quick neurological exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I don’t mind at all. I've always been pretty good about getting check-ups when I need them. Just let me know if anything feels strange or uncomfortable. I'm happy to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, good air entry on both sides. Reflexes are a little diminished, but that's not uncommon at your age. And your neurological exam is generally normal – good strength in your arms and legs, sensation is intact. Now, I'm going to gently palpate the muscles in the back of your neck and along your scalp. Do you feel any tenderness in a specific spot?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Right… about there. When you press there, it’s a little… sensitive. Not a sharp pain, more of a dull ache. It’s been feeling like that for a few days now. The rest feels alright, just that one spot. It’s not awful, but you definitely notice it when someone presses on it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I feel some tenderness there as well. It doesn't seem to be a muscle spasm, but it is definitely sensitive to the touch. Based on what you've told me – the headache location, the neck stiffness, the tenderness in that spot, and your lack of any other concerning symptoms – it sounds like you may have a tension headache, possibly with some referred pain from the muscles in the back of your neck. However, given your age and the persistent nature of the headache, I think it's prudent to get an image just to rule out anything else. Would you be agreeable to a quick X-ray of your cervical spine?
PATIENT: An X-ray, you say? Hmm… well, I’m not one for a lot of tests, if I can avoid it. But if you think it's best, Doctor, I trust your judgment. I’d rather be safe than sorry, I suppose. Yes, go ahead and take the X-ray. Just let me know if it's going to be expensive. I’m on a fixed income, you see. But if it’ll rule things out, then yes, let's do the X-ray.
DOCTOR: Okay. We can certainly discuss the costs beforehand, and we'll see if there are any lower-cost options available. The X-ray will help us rule out any underlying structural issues with your spine. While we’re waiting for the results, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, and I'd suggest applying a warm compress to your neck muscles a few times a day. Also, make sure you're maintaining good posture when you're sitting at the computer. I can give you some resources on proper ergonomic setup if you'd like. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Ibuprofen or naproxen… I think my daughter has some, I’ll have to ask her. And a warm compress, that’s a good idea. My wife used to make me a hot water bottle when I had a sore back, very soothing. And yes, please, some information on proper posture would be helpful. I think I slouch a bit when I’m working, always rushing to get things done. Yes, the pain relievers, the warm compress, and the posture tips… that sounds like a good plan. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'll have the nurse print out some information on ergonomic setup for you, and we’ll get the order in for the X-ray. After the radiologist reviews the images, we’ll discuss the results and determine the best course of action. In the meantime, if your headache worsens significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms like fever, dizziness, or vision changes, please don't hesitate to contact the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. You’ve put my mind at ease, thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and explain everything so clearly. I’ll let my daughter know about the ibuprofen and the X-ray. And I’ll try my best to sit up straight while I’m working, if I can remember. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Gibbel. I’m glad I could help. And don't worry too much about remembering, just do your best. If you have any concerns or questions down the line, please don't hesitate to call. The nurse will be in shortly to provide you with the information and the X-ray order. Have a good day, and try to relax.
