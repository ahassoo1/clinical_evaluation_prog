DOCTOR: Alright, Noelani, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor Billman. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. It’s my… down there, it’s been hurting. It started a few days ago, I think. Though, honestly, the days all seem to blend together lately. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache, really. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, “down there”... Right. And it’s a dull ache, you said, started a few days ago. Look, I need a little more detail than that if we’re going to figure this out. Is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I… I suppose it comes and goes. It’s not always there, but when it is, it’s… noticeable. It seems worse when I’ve been… moving around a lot. I do a fair bit of work with my hands, you see. Woodworking. Perhaps that has something to do with it? I truly can't recall exactly when it started, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Woodworking… alright. And you’re saying it’s worse with activity. Is it localized to one specific area, or is it more widespread?
PATIENT: Oh, um… localized, I believe. Yes, it’s… it’s on one side. Though, again, it’s hard for me to be precise. It doesn't radiate, if that’s the word? It just… is there, on one side. It’s not… all over. Is that helpful? I apologize for being so vague. I wish I could be more clear.
DOCTOR: It's alright, we'll get there. "Localized to one side"... Okay. Any bleeding, discharge, or changes in odor?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a rather personal question, Doctor. Let me see… no, I don’t believe so. No bleeding, no… discharge. And no change in odor, no. Everything seems normal, apart from the ache, of course. It’s just… worrying. I haven’t experienced anything like this before.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned you haven't experienced this before. Have you had any recent changes in your life – new soaps, detergents, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. New soaps… let me think. No, not really. I’ve been using the same things for… well, for as long as I can remember, really. Simple things. I try to keep things simple. No, no new detergents or anything like that. It’s just been… life, I suppose. Working in the shop, trying to make ends meet. I haven’t changed anything deliberately, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… well, that’s… a private matter, isn’t it? I… I am single, as my chart indicates. And… not currently. It’s been a very long time. Does that… answer your question? I apologize if I’m being unclear. It’s just… difficult to discuss.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. No need to apologize. Just trying to cover all the bases. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Any previous surgeries or serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I had my appendix removed when I was quite young, I believe. And… I had a rather bad bout of the flu a few years back, but nothing serious, really. Nothing that required a hospital stay. I’ve always been… fairly healthy, for the most part. Just the usual aches and pains that come with age, I suppose. I'm on Medicare, as you can see, so I do have a doctor who handles most of my routine things. I don’t recall anything major.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removal…flu. And you see your regular doctor. Do you know if they've noted anything relevant in your records, anything about pelvic pain or similar issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I truly don’t know, Doctor. I don’t often review my medical records myself. It’s all a bit… overwhelming, to be honest. I leave that to the professionals. I suppose I could ask, but… I haven’t had any specific reason to until now. I’m afraid I’m not very good with these things. I just hope this isn’t something too serious.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. Well, to get a better idea of what’s going on, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh. A physical exam… yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I suppose I should have anticipated that. Please, go ahead. Just… be gentle, if you would?
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie down on the examination table, that would be great. I’ll explain everything as I go. And yes, I’ll be gentle.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. It’s… a bit cold, isn’t it? I do hope this won’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax as much as possible. I'm just going to feel around a bit. Let me know if anything is particularly tender. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. A little. There. Not a sharp pain, but… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, just like before. It’s… a bit sensitive. Are you finding anything?
DOCTOR: There's some tenderness there, yes. And a bit of… guarding. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Any pain with this?
PATIENT: Oh… no, not particularly. It’s… just a bit strange, having someone listen to my stomach. No pain, though. It’s… quiet, isn’t it? Everything feels a bit… clinical. Is this normal? I hope it’s nothing too serious, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's normal to feel a bit uneasy during an exam. Alright. Based on what you've told me and the initial exam, it could be a number of things. It's difficult to say definitively without further testing. It could be musculoskeletal pain, perhaps related to your woodworking. It could be something gynecological, although you haven’t had recent issues. And, it's not ruling out diverticulitis. To be safe, I'm going to order a complete blood count, a urinalysis, and a pelvic ultrasound. I’ll also send a referral to a gynecologist for their opinion. I need to cover all bases. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… extensive. A complete blood count, a urinalysis, an ultrasound… and a gynecologist? It’s a bit overwhelming, Doctor. But… yes. If that’s what you think is best, then yes. Please, do whatever you think is necessary. I just want to know what’s going on and… get this sorted out. It's a bit frightening, to be honest. Is it… is it serious?
DOCTOR: Look, it's better to be thorough. It doesn't necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong, but we need to rule things out. These tests will give us more information. I'll have the lab orders and referral information ready for you before you leave. The lab is just down the hall. The gynecologist's office will call you to schedule an appointment. I'm prescribing you an over-the-counter pain reliever in the meantime – ibuprofen, 200 milligrams every 6-8 hours as needed. And try to avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh… ibuprofen. Yes, that’s… good. I have some at home, actually. And avoid heavy lifting. Yes, I can do that. It will be difficult, with the shop and all, but I will manage. No… I don’t think I have any questions at the moment. Just… when will I get the results? And how long will it take to get an appointment with the gynecologist? I’m a bit worried about the wait time, you see. I don't want this to drag on.
DOCTOR: The lab results should be back within a few days. The gynecologist… well, wait times can vary. I'll have my nurse send the referral with a note emphasizing your concerns. It typically takes a week or two to get an appointment, but it depends on their availability. I wouldn't worry too much about it at this point. I'll also put a note in your chart to follow up with you once the results are back. Here are the lab orders and the referral information. Any other concerns, or can I dismiss you?
PATIENT: Oh… a week or two. Very well. I suppose that’s… acceptable. I do appreciate you sending a note. No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you for your time and your… thoroughness. I hope it’s nothing too serious. I will schedule the tests as soon as I can. And I will try to avoid lifting anything heavy. Thank you again, Doctor Billman.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get well soon, Noelani. And try not to worry too much. .
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Thank you. Goodbye, Doctor.
