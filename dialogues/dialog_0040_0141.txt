DOCTOR: Right. Brendan Ferneding, 53. Well, let's not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: It's… this itching. Everywhere, really. Started a couple weeks ago, maybe three. It’s just…constant. Not like a rash, just…itchy skin all over. It's driving me a bit mad, to be honest. I've tried lotions, but nothing seems to help much.
DOCTOR: Itching, you say. Everywhere. Hmm. Lotions, of course. People always try lotions. Three weeks, you estimate. Alright. And you're…Russian, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Born in Russia, came over here…oh, goodness, almost thirty years ago now. Still get a bit homesick, but…this itching isn't helping my mood, that’s for sure. It's not painful, just…incredibly annoying. Like little ants crawling all the time.
DOCTOR: Thirty years. Right. Well, a bit of nostalgia never hurt anyone, although persistent itching can be disruptive. And no rash, you said. Just the sensation. Any fever, chills, weight loss?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. And I… I think I’ve actually gained a little weight, if anything! My wife… well, she always kept track of that sort of thing. It’s been a year since she passed, so it's hard to say for sure, but I haven't noticed losing any weight. I eat about the same as always.
DOCTOR: Passed, you say. A year ago. My condolences. It does throw things off, doesn’t it?
PATIENT: It does. Everything feels a bit… off-kilter. But, you know, life goes on. We just… have to deal with what is, I suppose. This itching just feels like another thing to deal with. It keeps me up at night, mostly. And it's hard to concentrate.
DOCTOR: Right. Insomnia. Well, it could be a number of things, really. Let's have a look at your skin. Just to rule things out. Please, lie down on the examination table. And try to relax. Though, frankly, with your…situation, I wouldn’t expect too much sleep anyway.
PATIENT: Oh. Right, yes, the examination table. Okay. It’s just… sometimes I feel like doctors assume everything is tied to… well, never mind. I’ll lie down. It's just…it’s been a rough year, and I appreciate you seeing me.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s just get this over with. Now, I'm going to examine your skin, starting with your back. Please, remove your shirt. I need a clear view. And don't worry, I've seen it all. Though, a healthy lifestyle would prevent most of these issues, you know. Now, quickly please. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh. Right, remove my shirt. Yes, of course. I do try to eat healthy, but… well, it’s hard when you're on your own. My wife did most of the cooking.
DOCTOR: Hmm. No obvious rash, as you said. Some dry skin, but nothing remarkable. A bit of age spotting, of course. It's not always easy to pinpoint these things. Now, turn over. Let’s have a look at your front. And please, try not to fidget. I need a decent look. It’s a waste of my time if I have to keep repeating myself.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. No fidgeting. It’s just…cold in here. And lying flat isn’t the easiest thing at my age.
DOCTOR: Right. No obvious lesions. Skin is reasonably healthy, all things considered. I’m not seeing anything that jumps out at me. It’s likely just…dry skin, exacerbated by stress. And perhaps the change in routine, after your wife’s passing. It can play havoc with everything. Now, sit up slowly. I'll listen to your heart and lungs just to be thorough. It’s always best to rule things out.
PATIENT: Yes, the routine… that’s a good point, actually. Everything is different. It's hard to explain. And yes, please listen to my heart and lungs. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, though a bit…faint. Lungs are clear. Alright. I'm not detecting anything concerning. Look, I suspect this is just a mild skin irritation, possibly related to stress and the change in your life. I recommend a good moisturizer, applied twice daily. And try to reduce stress. Easier said than done, I know. Now, do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had any trouble with food or medications. And yes, reducing stress… you’re right, that’s the hard part. I do try to keep busy, gardening mostly. But it's… lonely. Is there anything else I should be doing? Perhaps some kind of cream? Or a pill? I just want it to stop.
DOCTOR: Gardening. Well, that’s… something. And yes, a cream. I can prescribe a mild topical steroid cream. It won’t cure anything, but it might reduce the itching. Just apply a thin layer to the affected areas twice a day. Don't overdo it, though. And a pill… no. There’s no need for a pill. You don't want to be adding more problems. Now, I'll write you a prescription for the cream. And I recommend… perhaps a support group?
PATIENT: A support group… I hadn’t really thought about that. It’s not… my style, I suppose. I tend to keep to myself. But… I suppose it couldn’t hurt. If you think it would help. The cream sounds good, though. Anything to get some relief. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here’s the prescription. And I'll print out a list of local support groups. Just…consider it. Honestly, I’ve seen enough to know that bottling things up rarely helps. But, ultimately, it's your decision. Look, if the itching doesn't improve after a week, come back and we’ll discuss other options. Possibly a referral to a dermatologist. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just…thank you again, Doctor. For listening, and for the cream. I appreciate it. I'll… I'll try the cream, and maybe look at those groups.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Try not to scratch. It only makes things worse. Next patient.
PATIENT: .
