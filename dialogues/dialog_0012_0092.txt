DOCTOR: Hi Oreste, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Doctor, right? Yoshino… that’s a… different name. Well, I’m here 'cause I can’t… catch my breath good. And my mouth feels like the desert. Eyes too, feel like sand. It’s been… a while now. Don't remember exactly when it started, you know? Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It sounds like you’ve been dealing with shortness of breath and a dry mouth and eyes for a bit now. “A bit” is okay – we’ll figure it out. Old age can bring on some changes, but it's good you came in to get it checked out. Just to be thorough, can you tell me a little more about the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Thorough? Hmph. Look, it just… happens. I’m walkin’ around, maybe doin’ somethin’… nothin’ too hard, and then whoosh… gotta stop. Feels like I ran a mile, but I haven’t! And it's gettin’ worse, I think. Used to be just when I climbed stairs, now… now it's just… regular stuff. I used to work with… traffic, you know? Signals and things. Lots of walkin’ then, but never felt like this. Honestly, it's annoying. Very annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s happening with less exertion than it used to, and it feels like it’s getting progressively worse. That’s important to know. You mentioned working with traffic signals – was that recently, or are we talking about a job from a while ago?
PATIENT: A while ago! A long while ago. Retired… oh, goodness, must be… fifteen, twenty years now? Maybe more. I don’t keep track of dates so good anymore. Used to be important, schedules and all, but not so much now. Just me and the TV mostly. Don’t go out much. Too many… people. And the heat. This summer is awful. Probably that, too. The heat makin’ everything worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’re mostly at home these days, and the heat might be playing a role. It’s definitely been a hot one. Let's talk a little more about this shortness of breath. Does anything specifically trigger it, besides just activity?
PATIENT: Trigger it? Hmph. Like what? You want me to think of triggers? Look, sometimes it happens when I… lie down. Gotta prop myself up with pillows. And… dust. If I’m cleanin’… which I don’t do much of, mind you, but when I do… it gets bad. And… I don’t know. Just happens. It's unpredictable. Annoying, really. Like a bad radio signal. Always cuttin’ out.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's worse when you lie down, and dust seems to be a trigger. That’s helpful. And you're right, unpredictable is a good way to put it. Let's move on to the dry mouth and eyes. Is that constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant. Pretty much. Always feel like I swallowed sand. And my eyes… itchy, burnin’. Gotta put drops in 'em all the time. Used to be just in the winter, dry air, but now… all the time. Even with the AC on. Doesn’t help much. And it makes it hard to… taste anything. Food just… bland. What’s the point, really? Doctor, are you gonna give me some water or somethin’? My mouth is awful.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, here you go. Please take your time. And I apologize for not offering that sooner. Okay, so the dry mouth and eyes are constant, despite the AC, and it's affecting your taste. That's definitely impacting your quality of life. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with this – like a cough, any chest pain, or swelling in your ankles or legs?
PATIENT: Better. Thank you. A cough… sometimes. Not a bad one. Just a little tickle in my throat. Happens mostly at night. Chest pain… no. Not really. Maybe a little… tightness sometimes, but I figured that was just… old age. And swelling… no. Legs are pretty skinny, if anything. Always have been. Doctor, are you writin' all this down? You gotta remember things, you know. I sure don't. And… I don't sleep very good. Always waking up. Just… restless.
DOCTOR: Yes, I'm writing everything down, don't worry. A nighttime cough, no chest pain, skinny legs, and trouble sleeping. Okay. Now, let's go over some medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you've been diagnosed with in the past – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High… blood pressure? Maybe. The doctor told me somethin’ years ago, gave me a pill. Stopped takin’ it. Didn’t feel like I needed it. Diabetes… no. Never had that. Heart problems… well, my heart beats, doesn’t it? They never told me nothin’ about my heart. Honestly, I don’t go to the doctor much. Waste of time, usually. Just tell you to eat better and exercise. Like I haven’t heard that before. Medicare pays for it, though, so… here I am. Ugh. This is tiresome.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of high blood pressure, but you stopped taking medication for it. And you haven’t been diagnosed with diabetes or any other heart problems. I understand your frustration with being told to eat better and exercise, and I assure you I’ll try to be as thorough as possible here. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me think. Had my appendix out when I was a kid. A long time ago. And… I broke my arm once, fallin' off a bike. That’s about it. Never been in the hospital for anything serious. Just in and out for the arm and appendix. And… oh! I had a skin tag removed a few years back. Doctor just snipped it off. It was annoying, hangin’ there. That’s all. Honestly, I try to stay away from doctors and hospitals. Bad memories. Plus, all the waiting. Always waiting. Ugh. Are we almost done? My throat is scratchy again.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removal as a child, a broken arm, and a skin tag removed. No major hospitalizations. We're getting there. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmph. Not that I know of. I eat anything. I used to love Cuban food, of course. Mama made the best ropa vieja. But… I haven’t had that in years. Too much trouble to make. And… I don't take many pills, so I don't know about medication allergies. Maybe a little… itchy sometimes after I take somethin', but I just ignore it. It’s probably just old age again. Honestly, everything is probably just old age. Are we really almost done? I'm feelin' tired now.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. We're almost finished with the history. Just a few more questions. Do you currently take any medications, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Well… I take a little… something for my knees. They ache sometimes, you know? Can't remember the name. Little white pill. And… sometimes I take a pain reliever for my head. When it's really bad. Just… whatever’s on sale at the drugstore. And… I think I have some vitamins in the cupboard, but I don't take them regular. Honestly, I forget. Everything is a blur these days. Are we done now, Doctor? I really need a nap. My throat is awful again. I think I’m getting a cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, we’re finished with the history. You take something for your knees, occasional pain relievers, and some vitamins you don't take regularly. Thank you for your patience, Oreste. I know it was a lot of questions. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your throat. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… be quick about it. My throat is scratchy and… I’m tired. And… don’t poke around too much. I don’t like being poked and prodded. Just listen and… get it over with. Honestly, all this fuss. Probably just a cold. I'll probably just sleep it off. But… fine. Go ahead. Just be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as gentle as possible. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths for me. Okay. I'm hearing some… wheezing in your lungs, especially when you exhale. Your heart rate is a little fast, but that could be from the effort of breathing. Now, can you open your mouth for me?
PATIENT: Wheezing? What’s wheezing? Is that bad? Just tell me straight, Doctor. Don’t beat around the bush. And… don’t stick anything down my throat. Honestly, I don't like this at all. Is it a cold? Am I dying? Just tell me what’s wrong. My throat feels awful. It's scratchy and… dry. Very dry. Like the desert, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, your throat is a little red, but nothing too concerning. The wheezing I’m hearing suggests there might be some narrowing in your airways. Combined with your shortness of breath, dry mouth, and the nighttime cough, it sounds like you could be experiencing symptoms of COPD – Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. It's common in people who have a history of smoking, or exposure to irritants. Now, it’s not a definitive diagnosis yet, we'd need to do a breathing test to confirm that. But it's the most likely explanation for what's going on. It’s also possible that you have an upper respiratory infection – a cold or the flu – which could be exacerbating things. Do you know if you've been exposed to anyone with a cold or the flu recently?
PATIENT: COPD? What's that? Sounds… terrible. I never smoked a day in my life. Never liked it. My mama used to say it smelled like… burning leaves. And… burning money. Irritants? What kind of irritants? Dust? I told you about the dust. Is that it? Dust is causing all this? And… a cold? No. Haven't been around anyone. Just me and the TV. Honestly, I try to stay away from people. This sounds… serious. Am I gonna have to be on oxygen? Am I gonna have to go to the hospital? Doctor, tell me straight. Don’t sugarcoat it. Just tell me what’s gonna happen. This is… frightening.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's take this one step at a time. COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. It's a lung condition that makes it hard to breathe. While smoking is the most common cause, exposure to irritants like dust, fumes, or even pollution can also contribute. It sounds like the dust sensitivity might be a factor in your case. We need to do a breathing test – a spirometry – to confirm the diagnosis. It's a simple test where you blow into a tube. That will tell us how well your lungs are functioning. As for needing oxygen or going to the hospital, it's too early to say. Many people with COPD manage their symptoms with medication – inhalers and sometimes pills – and lifestyle changes. We'll start with the breathing test, and then we'll discuss the results and come up with a plan together. It's very unlikely you'll need to go to the hospital immediately. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Inhalers? Pills? More pills? Ugh. I hate pills. And… a breathing test? What if I can’t blow good enough? What if it’s really bad? Am I gonna have to… change my life? I just want to sit in my chair and watch TV. That’s all I want. Is that too much to ask? And… what about the dry mouth? Is that part of this COPD thing? Is that why my throat feels like sandpaper? Doctor, are you sure it's not just a cold? Maybe I just need some cough syrup and… a nap. Honestly, this is… overwhelming. Can’t I just get a prescription for something and… go home? I'm tired. Very tired. And… scared.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and your fear, Oreste. It's a lot to take in. You're right, it's not just a cold, and I apologize for not explaining things better sooner. The dry mouth can be a symptom of COPD, or a side effect of some medications used to treat it. It's also common as we get older. We can definitely address that with some simple remedies – like drinking more fluids and using a saliva substitute. As for changing your life, it doesn’t have to be drastic. The goal is to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. That might involve taking medication, using an inhaler when you feel short of breath, and avoiding irritants like dust. We can also discuss some breathing exercises that can help you strengthen your lungs. The breathing test is very simple. You just blow into a tube for a few seconds. It doesn't require any special effort, and it won't hurt. It's just a way to measure how well your lungs are functioning. And honestly, knowing what's going on is the first step towards feeling better. Would you be willing to schedule a breathing test for tomorrow?
PATIENT: Tomorrow? Hmph. I don’t know… I don’t like going to places. Especially… medical places. All the smells and… the waiting. And… what if it’s bad? What if I can’t blow good enough and… they tell me I’m really sick? Honestly, I just want to go home and… take a nap. Maybe drink some tea. But… I guess knowing is better than… not knowing. But… promise me, Doctor, promise me you won't… make me do anything drastic. No oxygen. No hospitals. Just… pills and tea. Is that okay? Can we do that? Just pills and tea and… a nap. And… please, be quick about it. I don't want to spend all day in a medical place. Can we schedule it for… first thing tomorrow? So I can get it over with? And then… I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Oreste. We can schedule the test for first thing tomorrow, and I promise we won't do anything drastic. No oxygen, no hospitals – we'll start with the simplest things first. Just medication and… a nice cup of tea and a nap, as you said. The test itself shouldn't take more than 30 minutes, and we'll discuss the results right away. We'll come up with a plan together, and I'll make sure you're comfortable with everything. I'll have my nurse schedule the test for you now. She’ll also give you a prescription for a cough suppressant to help with the coughing in the meantime. And please, if your symptoms get any worse before tomorrow, don't hesitate to call. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… get me home. I’m tired. Very tired. And… thank you. For… not yelling at me. And… for promising no oxygen. Honestly, that’s… a relief. Just… get me home. And… maybe a glass of water. My mouth is awful again. And… thank you. Really. For listening. And… for the promise. Just… home. I just want to go home and… take a nap.
DOCTOR: Of course, Oreste. Let's get you home. Here’s a glass of water for the road. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all. Get some rest, Oreste. And remember, we'll take things one step at a time. .
