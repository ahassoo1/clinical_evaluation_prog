DOCTOR: Good morning, Jahaad. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Alzoubi. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, it’s… about some swelling, yes. It’s a bit difficult to explain, honestly. My memory isn’t quite what it used to be, and details… they slip away. But I noticed it recently, and it’s a little concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We’ll take it slow. Swelling… where exactly are you noticing this swelling?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's the tricky part. It seems to be… mostly in my legs and feet, I believe. Though, sometimes it feels like it’s also in my hands. It's not constant, and the location shifts, if that makes sense? It's rather frustrating, to be honest, trying to keep track of it all.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds a bit confusing, and it's good you're getting it checked out. When did you first notice this swelling?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's… difficult. I would say within the last month, perhaps? It’s hard to pinpoint. Everything feels a bit… blurred lately. I remember noticing it more after a long day, particularly if I've been on my feet a lot with work, but I’m not entirely sure when it started specifically. Perhaps around the end of June? It’s just a guess, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly a month or so. And you mentioned it's worse after being on your feet for a long time with work. What kind of work do you do, Jahaad?
PATIENT: I'm a Speech-Language Pathologist. I work with patients of all ages, helping them with communication and swallowing difficulties. It’s a very rewarding job, but it does involve a fair amount of walking and standing. It keeps me busy, to say the least. Perhaps that's contributing to the swelling? I truly don't know.
DOCTOR: That could be a factor, certainly. Let's talk a little more about the swelling itself. Is it painful?
PATIENT: Not… intensely painful, no. It’s more of a… heavy feeling. A discomfort, really. And sometimes it feels a bit warm to the touch. It’s not a sharp pain, thankfully. Just… noticeable. And occasionally a little itchy, but not always. It’s hard to describe precisely. It’s not something that stops me from doing things, but it’s definitely there.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy, warm, sometimes itchy... and not sharply painful. Do you notice any redness accompanying the swelling?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I… don’t believe so. I haven’t noticed any redness, no. It seems to be more of a puffiness, if that makes sense. Like my legs are just… fuller than usual. But no visible red color, as far as I can tell. It’s difficult for me to check properly, I suppose. My flexibility isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently in your life – new medications, diet changes, increased stress levels, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm… New medications, no. My diet… I haven’t made any significant changes to my eating habits recently. Stress levels… well, work can be demanding, but I wouldn’t say it’s been more stressful than usual. I've been trying to be mindful of that, actually. I did start drinking a bit more water lately, as I was told it's important for overall health. Could that be related? I honestly don't know what could be causing it.
DOCTOR: That’s good you’re mindful of your stress and drinking more water – both are positive habits. More water usually isn’t a problem, but sometimes excessive fluid intake can contribute to swelling. Okay, let’s move on to some other questions. Do you have any other medical conditions – things like diabetes, heart problems, kidney issues?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been relatively healthy, thankfully. I have regular check-ups with my primary care physician, and they haven’t mentioned any concerns. I haven't been diagnosed with any of those conditions, no. Though, my memory being… unreliable, it’s possible I’m forgetting something. But to the best of my knowledge, no, I don't have any pre-existing medical conditions.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you take any medications currently, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… just a multivitamin, occasionally. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but not very often. Perhaps once or twice a month, if that. Nothing regular, no. No other prescriptions or supplements, to my knowledge. It’s a rather sparse medication list, thankfully. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – who have experienced swelling in their legs or feet, or have any history of heart problems, kidney disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: That's… a difficult question. My family is… quite large, and I haven't always been close to everyone. I believe my grandmother on my mother's side had some sort of heart condition, yes. But I don't recall the specifics. And I seem to remember my uncle having some issues with his kidneys, but again, the details are… hazy. As for swelling specifically, I don’t recall anyone explicitly mentioning leg or foot swelling. It's difficult to say for certain, though. My memory is proving to be rather unhelpful. I apologize.
DOCTOR: That's alright, it's good you're trying to recall what you can. We can move on if it's too difficult to remember. Okay, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your legs and feet for swelling and look at the skin. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s perfectly fine. Please, proceed. I understand it's necessary to get a better understanding of what's going on. I'll do my best to remain still.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jahaad. I listened to your heart and lungs, and everything sounded normal. I also checked your pulses, and they are good. However, I did notice some swelling in both of your legs and feet, up to your mid-calf. It's what we call pitting edema - meaning when I press on the skin, it leaves a temporary indentation. I also checked your skin, and it looks normal, no redness or anything concerning.
PATIENT: Pitting edema… So, the swelling is… significant enough to leave an indentation? That explains why it feels so… heavy. Is that… cause for concern? What could be causing that, in your opinion? I appreciate you explaining it so clearly, Dr. Alzoubi. It’s reassuring to understand what’s happening, even if the news isn't ideal.
DOCTOR: It's good you're asking questions. Pitting edema, as you said, means the swelling is holding fluid. There are many possible causes, and it doesn't automatically mean something serious. Some common causes include prolonged standing , being overweight, certain medications, and underlying conditions like heart problems, kidney disease, or liver problems. Given your history, prolonged standing is a likely factor, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your kidney and liver function, as well as your electrolytes and a complete blood count. We should also check a thyroid-stimulating hormone level, as thyroid issues can sometimes cause swelling. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That makes sense. Ruling out other possibilities is definitely the right approach. Yes, blood tests would be fine. Whatever is necessary to get to the bottom of this, I’m agreeable to. I understand it’s a standard procedure. What can I expect during the blood tests? And how long will it take to get the results? I just want to be prepared. I truly appreciate your thoroughness, Dr. Alzoubi. It’s very comforting.
DOCTOR: You're welcome. The blood tests will involve a small sample of blood being drawn from your arm. A phlebotomist will clean the area, insert a needle, and collect the sample. It usually takes just a few minutes. There might be a slight pinch, but it shouldn't be painful. The lab typically processes the results within 24-48 hours. Once I have them, I’ll review them and contact you to discuss the findings and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your legs whenever possible, wearing compression stockings, and limiting your salt intake. These measures can help reduce the swelling. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Elevate my legs, compression stockings, less salt… those seem like reasonable steps. I can certainly manage those. Compression stockings… are there any specific types I should look for? And regarding the salt intake… is there a particular amount I should be aiming for each day? I want to ensure I’m following your recommendations correctly. And… what if the blood tests do reveal something concerning? What would the next steps be then? I apologize for asking so many questions, but I prefer to be as informed as possible. Knowing what to expect helps me feel more at ease.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, those are good questions. For compression stockings, I recommend a mild to moderate compression level – 15-20 mmHg is usually a good starting point. You can find them at most pharmacies or medical supply stores. Regarding salt intake, aim for less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day. Ideally, you’d want to be closer to 1,500 milligrams, but 2,300 is a good starting goal. Reading food labels is key! If the blood tests reveal any abnormalities, we'll discuss them thoroughly. Depending on the findings, we might need to consult with a specialist – perhaps a cardiologist or a nephrologist . We’d also likely order further testing to pinpoint the underlying cause. I’ll also send you a handout with information about managing edema and dietary recommendations. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: 15-20 mmHg for the stockings, less than 2,300 milligrams of sodium… I’ll make a note of that. And a handout would be very helpful, thank you. I believe… no, I don’t think I have any other questions at this moment, Dr. Alzoubi. You’ve been very thorough and reassuring. I truly appreciate your patience and willingness to explain everything so clearly. I’ll schedule the blood tests, and I’ll be sure to follow your recommendations regarding elevation, compression, and salt intake. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I feel much better equipped to manage this now.
