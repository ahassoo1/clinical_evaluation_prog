DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I'm Dr. Nooruddin. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Nooruddin. It is a pleasure to meet you. Well, it is… a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I have… a lot of gas. More than usual. It is causing me some… discomfort. It started maybe a week ago, I think. Yes, exactly one week, on July 26th.
DOCTOR: Right. A lot of gas, starting about a week ago. Discomfort… can you describe that discomfort for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It is… bloating, mostly. My stomach feels very full, even when I have not eaten much. And… it bubbles. A lot. It is not pain, exactly, more like… pressure. And, well, the sound. It is… noticeable. I am sorry to be so… frank. It makes me feel… self-conscious. It is not constant, but it happens many times a day. I counted, yesterday, it was… seventeen times. Yes, seventeen. I was sitting and watching television.
DOCTOR: Seventeen times… alright. And is this gas accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… no pain, like I said. No… feeling sick to my stomach. No… changes in my… bathroom habits, if you understand me. I am eating normally. Maybe a little less bread, because I thought that might help, but it did not. I am sleeping okay. And… no fever, I do not think. I checked this morning. Ninety-eight point six degrees Fahrenheit. Yes, exactly ninety-eight point six. It is just… the gas. And the… bubbling. It is very disruptive. I apologize for mentioning it so much.
DOCTOR: No, it's alright. It's important to be thorough. So, no nausea, no changes in bowel movements, normal sleep, no fever. You've tried reducing bread intake with no improvement. And you said you’re eating normally… what does “normally” look like for you, Mr. Goodstein?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. “Normally” for me… Well, I have a sandwich for lunch, usually. Ham and cheese on rye bread. Sometimes turkey. And a pickle. And… a small bag of potato chips. And for dinner… I often have… chicken. Roasted chicken with potatoes and… carrots. Or… pasta. Spaghetti with tomato sauce. And… a small salad. I drink… water mostly. And… a cup of tea with dinner. I do not eat a lot of… spicy foods. Or… beans. I avoid beans, always. They cause… problems. And I do not drink… soda. Only water, and tea.
DOCTOR: Alright. That gives me a better picture. And how about any recent changes in your life?
PATIENT: Recent changes… hmm. Let me think. No… no major changes. I am retired, you see. I used to work at the… fast food place, but I stopped last year. It was… stressful, sometimes. But now… it is quiet. I spend a lot of time at home. Watching television, mostly. And… I walk in the park, sometimes. I see my neighbor, Mrs. Kowalski, almost every day. We talk about… the weather. And… the birds. No… new medications. I only take… vitamin D. The doctor recommended it. Because of… the winter. No… travel. Nothing like that. Just… the same routine, mostly. It is very… peaceful. Perhaps too peaceful, now that I think of it. But no… no changes to report. Except… the gas. It is the only new thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you mentioned vitamin D… how much do you take, and when did you start taking it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I take… two thousand International Units every day. Two thousand. The doctor, Dr. Schmidt, recommended it last November. Yes, November 15th, I believe. She said I was… deficient. Because I do not get much… sunshine. I spend a lot of time indoors, you see. And… the winter is long and dark. She said the vitamin D would… help my bones. And… my mood. It is a small, white pill. I take it with my breakfast. Every morning. With… my tea. It did not cause… any problems, until now. Just… the gas. It started a few weeks after I started the vitamin D. But perhaps it is… a coincidence? I do not know. It is… puzzling.
DOCTOR: It could be a coincidence, but it's good you mentioned it. Sometimes vitamins can cause gastrointestinal upset. Now, let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything else. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and then I'll gently press on it to see if anything feels tender. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That is perfectly alright. I understand. Listening and… pressing, you say? Yes, that sounds… sensible. I want to find out what is causing this… gas. I have been feeling… uncomfortable. And… a little worried. It is good you are… investigating. Please, go ahead. I will… remain still. I will try to… relax. It is… a bit embarrassing, but I want to feel better. I am… ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me… and another… Good. I’m not hearing any particularly concerning sounds. And there's no significant tenderness when I press here... or here... or on this side. Your abdomen is soft, but slightly distended. Distended, meaning it feels a bit fuller than normal. No masses or organomegaly appreciated. Do you feel any pain with this pressure at all?
PATIENT: No… no pain. Just… pressure. Like… a fullness. A bloating. Like… I have eaten too much. But I have not. I ate a small sandwich for lunch, you see. And… a pickle. It is… a strange sensation. A fullness, and… bubbling. It is… uncomfortable. But not… painful. Just… unsettling. It is… a bit like when I used to… travel on the bus, and it was very bumpy. A rumbling, and… a fullness. But I am not… on the bus. I am… here. In your office. It is… different. But the feeling is… similar. Not painful, just… unsettling. And… full. Very full. It is… difficult to explain. I do not mean to… complain. It is just… a strange sensation.
DOCTOR: No, you're not complaining at all. It's important to describe exactly what you're feeling, and you're doing a good job. So, no pain, just distention, fullness, and bubbling. Based on what you've told me, and the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing excessive gas, likely related to something you're eating or possibly a reaction to the vitamin D. To rule out any underlying medical conditions, and just to be safe, I’d like to order a few blood tests. Specifically, a Complete Blood Count to check for inflammation, and a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel to assess your overall organ function. We can also test your vitamin D levels to see if they're elevated. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood tests. To check… inflammation, and… the organs. And… the vitamin D. Yes, that is… a good idea. I want to find out what is causing this… gas. I do not want it to… continue. It is… disruptive. And… unsettling. Blood tests. Yes, please. Whatever you think is… necessary. I trust your… judgment. When will I… receive the results? And… what will happen next? I am… a little nervous, but I want to… cooperate. I want to… feel better.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Goodstein. We'll get those tests done right away. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll draw a few vials of blood, and it should only take about fifteen minutes. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, call you with the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I recommend trying a diet low in FODMAPs - those are certain types of carbohydrates that can cause gas in some people. I can give you a handout with a list of foods to avoid. Also, consider an over-the-counter simethicone product, like Gas-X, which can help relieve gas and bloating. If the gas worsens, or if you develop any new symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits, please call the office immediately. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very reasonable. Blood tests, a diet… low in FODMAPs. And… Gas-X. I will… remember that. And… call if it gets worse. I appreciate your… thoroughness. And… your kindness. I feel… a little better already, just knowing what is… happening. A little nervous about the blood tests, but… I will cooperate. And… I will try the diet. Low in FODMAPs. Yes. I will… ask my neighbor, Mrs. Kowalski, if she knows what that is. She is… very knowledgeable about… things. Thank you, Doctor Nooruddin. I appreciate your… help. And… your patience.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Goodstein. Mrs. Kowalski sounds like a good resource! Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions at all, about the FODMAP diet, the blood tests, or anything else. Sarah will be happy to help. Here's a handout on low-FODMAP foods, and a request form for the blood tests. Sarah will get you checked in and we'll get those ordered right away. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Now, do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I do not think so. You have… answered everything. I appreciate your… kindness. And… your patience. I will… try the diet. And… I will wait for the results. If anything… changes, I will… call. Thank you, Doctor Nooruddin. I think… that is all. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Goodstein. You take care now, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Sarah will see you out. It was a pleasure meeting you. .
