DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Geho. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s August 2nd, 2025. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, I got a letter… from the lab, I think? Saying my cholesterol is a little high. Hyper… something? It sounded a bit scary, so I thought I should come in and have it checked out. I don’t really know much about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're addressing this now. “Hyper…” likely refers to hyperlipidemia, which simply means you have high cholesterol. It's very common, and we can definitely discuss what that means for you and how to manage it. To get a better understanding of your overall health and what might be contributing to this, I'd like to ask a few questions. First, have you been experiencing any symptoms at all – perhaps any chest pain, shortness of breath, or fatigue?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that at all. No chest pain, no trouble breathing, and I'm not tired any more than usual, maybe a little tired after a long day, but who isn’t? I feel pretty good, actually. I walk every morning, about three miles, if the weather is nice. I eat fairly healthy too, mostly vegetables and fish. Though I do like a little dark chocolate sometimes… does that count against me?
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you're feeling well and staying active. Walking three miles is excellent! And a little dark chocolate is unlikely to be a significant concern – in fact, it can have some health benefits. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Well, let me think… I had the usual childhood things, measles, chickenpox, you know. Nothing serious. As an adult, I had my appendix out when I was 28, that was about… 1993, I think. And I broke my wrist a few years ago, tripped over the cat! Other than that… not much. No big illnesses, no operations. I see the dentist twice a year, and I had a mammogram last year, all clear. Oh, and I had a bout of the flu about five years ago, but everyone gets the flu, right?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, thank you. So, appendix removed in 1993, broken wrist, and routine dental and mammogram screenings – all good information. And yes, most people get the flu at some point! Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think about my family… My mother had high blood pressure, I believe, later in life. She was on medication for it. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had some kind of heart trouble. He didn’t take very good care of himself, smoked a lot of cigars. I don't think anyone else had cholesterol problems, but to be honest, we didn’t really talk about health much in my family. It wasn't a big thing, you know? I mostly know about the blood pressure and the heart trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's useful to know – a family history of high blood pressure and heart disease. Thank you. Now, could you tell me a bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, like I said, I walk three miles most mornings. I live alone, I’ve been single for… a long time. I don't smoke, never have. I used to drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but I’ve cut back on that recently. I try to eat healthy, lots of vegetables, fish, chicken. I do enjoy baking, but that’s mostly for special occasions! And I love to read, mostly historical novels. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Reading certainly counts! It’s a great way to keep your mind active. So, no smoking, limited alcohol, regular walking, and a healthy diet – that’s all very positive. Just a few more questions. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I don't really take anything. I get a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s about it. I try to get everything I need from my food, really. I don't like taking pills if I can avoid it. I take a calcium supplement every so often, because the doctor suggested it years ago, but I forget sometimes. Honestly, I don’t think I've taken it in a while.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin occasionally and calcium supplements, not consistently. And lastly, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, not even bee stings. I’m pretty lucky that way. I think that’s everything, isn’t it? I’m ready to hear what you think about this cholesterol business. Is it something I should be really worried about?
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Based on what you’ve told me and the lab results, it does appear your cholesterol is slightly elevated. It's good that you’re proactive about your health and want to address this. Before we discuss treatment options, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears and throat. It’s standard procedure, and will help me get a more complete picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… well, a while. So, anything you think is helpful is good with me. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 138 over 82. We’ll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Ears are clear. Throat appears normal. Overall, the physical exam is unremarkable. No acute findings. The slightly elevated blood pressure is something we will discuss. Now, I’d like to review the lab results in more detail with you. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, not yet. I’m just trusting you, Doctor. You’re the professional! I’m a little worried about the blood pressure being high though. Is that something serious? Should I be cutting out salt? Is it the wine? I really do try to stay healthy…
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re proactive about your health, and it’s perfectly normal to be concerned about elevated blood pressure. While it can be serious if left untreated, it’s often manageable with lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medication. Your blood pressure is only slightly elevated, and it's good that you’re already thinking about lifestyle factors. Cutting back on salt is a good idea, as is limiting alcohol intake. Let's focus on that first and see if it improves. Now, regarding your cholesterol, your total cholesterol is 230 mg/dL. Your LDL, the “bad” cholesterol, is 150 mg/dL. That’s slightly above the optimal range. Your HDL, the “good” cholesterol, is 50 mg/dL, which is good. And your triglycerides are 140 mg/dL, which is also within a healthy range. Does any of that make sense, or would you like me to explain those numbers in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a lot of numbers! The LDL is the bad one, you said? And the HDL is good? I think I understand that much. The other ones… not so much. I'm trying, Doctor. It’s just… a bit overwhelming. Maybe we should focus on the LDL being too high? And what does “too high” mean exactly? What will happen if it stays that way? I'm really worried about my heart…
DOCTOR: You're right to focus on the LDL. It’s the main contributor to plaque buildup in the arteries, which can lead to heart disease and stroke. And it's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed; there's a lot of information to take in. Your LDL is 150 mg/dL, and we ideally want it to be under 100 mg/dL, ideally even lower if you have other risk factors. Yours is elevated, but not dramatically so. What happens if it stays that way?
PATIENT: Well, that’s exactly what I’m worried about! Will it… block my arteries? Will I have a heart attack? I’ve seen things on television… my grandfather, he… well, he wasn’t very healthy. Is that what happens? That's what I'm afraid of. Do I need pills? Are you going to put me on pills? I really don't want to take pills, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, and you’re right to ask those questions. While elevated LDL can contribute to plaque buildup, leading to heart disease and stroke, it doesn't happen overnight. It’s a gradual process. And with proactive management, we can significantly reduce your risk. Regarding your grandfather, I’m sorry to hear about his health. It's good that you’re aware of your family history and want to take preventative measures. Now, let’s talk about treatment options. In your case, because your LDL is only moderately elevated, and you’re otherwise healthy, I recommend we start with lifestyle modifications first. We can monitor your cholesterol levels with a repeat blood test in three months to see how you respond. Lifestyle changes include: Diet: Reducing saturated and trans fats, increasing fiber intake, and incorporating more omega-3 fatty acids. Exercise: Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. You're already doing a great job with your walking! Weight management: Maintaining a healthy weight. If we don’t see sufficient improvement with lifestyle changes after three months, then we can discuss medication options. But let’s try this approach first. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… that sounds much better. No pills right away. I can do that. I can try harder with the diet… I do like my baking, but I suppose I can cut back. And I'm already walking, so that’s good. Three months, you said? And then we’ll check the numbers again? What kind of foods should I be focusing on? Should I see a nutritionist? I get so confused by all the information… Is there a special diet I should follow? I just want to make sure I’m doing everything right…
DOCTOR: Exactly. Three months, and then we'll recheck your numbers. You're already doing a great job with the walking, that’s a fantastic start. Regarding diet, the Mediterranean diet is a great option. It’s rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and healthy fats like olive oil. Limiting red meat, processed foods, and sugary drinks is also important. I have some handouts here with more specific information on the Mediterranean diet and healthy eating guidelines. As for a nutritionist, that’s a good idea, and I can provide you with a referral if you'd like. It can be very helpful to have personalized guidance. However, it's not essential. You can also find a lot of reliable information online through reputable sources like the American Heart Association and the National Institutes of Health. To summarize: we’re focusing on lifestyle modifications – diet and exercise – for the next three months. We’ll recheck your cholesterol levels then. We can discuss a referral to a nutritionist if you’d like, and I’ve given you some handouts with helpful information. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That’s… a lot to take in, but it doesn’t seem too overwhelming. The Mediterranean diet… I think I’ve heard of that. Lots of fish and olive oil, right? No, I think that’s everything for now. I don’t want to bother you anymore. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful, and you’ve really put my mind at ease. I feel much better knowing we’re trying this first, without the pills. Just… one last question. When should I schedule the follow-up appointment for three months from today? Is there anything else I need to do before then?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Geho. I'm glad I could put your mind at ease. Let's schedule your follow-up appointment for November 2nd, three months from today. Our receptionist can help you with that as you leave. Before then, just focus on incorporating the dietary changes and continuing your walking routine. There’s no need to do anything else specifically. If you have any questions or concerns before your appointment, please don’t hesitate to call my office. It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Geho. Have a good day, and please take care of yourself.
