DOCTOR: Good morning, Nixon. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. My left leg is very swollen. And, well, the doctors told me a while back I have… a funny heartbeat, sometimes. Atrial… something. It’s been happening on and off for a bit. I thought maybe it was connected.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nixon. Swelling in your left leg and a history of an irregular heartbeat – atrial… fibrillation, perhaps?
PATIENT: Yes, that's the word! Atrial fibrillation. It comes and goes. It's not… constant, thankfully. But when it is happening, it feels a bit… fluttery, and my leg gets worse. Is that… normal? I don't really understand how it all works.
DOCTOR: It's good you're able to describe those sensations. Yes, those symptoms can be related. The fluttering you feel is likely your heart beating irregularly, and the swelling in your leg could be connected. It sounds like we need to investigate further to understand the relationship. First, let's talk about the leg swelling. When did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe about a month ago? It was just a little bit at first. I thought I’d maybe just bumped it or something, but it hasn’t gone away. It’s gotten worse over the last week or so. It’s mostly in my calf, I think. And it feels… heavy. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Heavy and worsening swelling over a month, primarily in the calf… Okay. Have you noticed any pain with the swelling, or any redness or warmth to the touch?
PATIENT: No, not really pain. It’s… uncomfortable, definitely. And a bit achy, sometimes, especially if I stand for too long. But no redness, and it doesn't feel particularly warm. Just… swollen and heavy. Like I said, it's mostly my left leg. The right one is fine.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything made it better or worse – like elevating your leg, wearing compression socks, or any specific activities?
PATIENT: Oh, elevating it helps a little, yes. When I sit with it up, it goes down a tiny bit. I haven’t tried those… compression socks. I didn't even know those were a thing, to be honest. Standing makes it worse, like I said. And walking for too long is… not good. I get very tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Let's do a quick examination of your leg, and then we can talk more about your atrial fibrillation. I'm going to feel for tenderness, check the pulses, and compare both legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Please do. I'm happy to help in any way I can. Though… I do get a bit squeamish, if I'm honest. But I'll try my best.
DOCTOR: Okay. I do feel some tenderness in your calf when I press here. And I do see some swelling – pitting edema, meaning it leaves a small indentation when I press. Your pulses feel a bit weaker on your left side compared to your right, but they're still present. I'm also noting some mild discoloration on your lower left leg. It doesn't seem severe, but it's something to keep an eye on.
PATIENT: Oh… that doesn’t sound very good, does it? Discoloration? What does that mean exactly? Is it… serious? And weaker pulses… that’s concerning, isn’t it? I’m starting to worry a bit now, if I’m honest. I hadn’t realised it was that bad.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Nixon. It's good you're expressing your concerns. The discoloration isn't necessarily serious immediately, but it suggests we need to investigate further to rule out any underlying issues. It could be a sign of venous insufficiency or a blood clot, so we need to take it seriously. And the weaker pulses do warrant further investigation, as they could indicate reduced blood flow. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a D-dimer blood test to check for blood clots, and an ultrasound of your left leg to assess the blood flow and rule out deep vein thrombosis – a DVT. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: A… D-dimer? And an ultrasound? Those sound… complicated. Are they painful? And what will they do exactly? I mean, I trust your judgement, of course, but I like to know what’s happening. I’m not very good with medical things, as you can probably tell. Is it very expensive? I… don't have insurance, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Nixon. It's important to understand what we're doing, and I’ll explain everything as clearly as possible. A D-dimer is a simple blood test. We just take a small sample from your arm. It checks for a protein fragment that’s released when a blood clot breaks down. It’s not painful, just a quick pinch. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create an image of the blood vessels in your leg. It's also non-invasive and doesn't hurt. A technician will apply some gel to your leg and move a probe around. As for the cost… I understand you don't have insurance, and that's a concern. I can check the pricing for you and see if we have any options for financial assistance or a lower cost. We can also discuss prioritizing the D-dimer test first, as it's less expensive and can help us determine if an ultrasound is truly necessary. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds much better. Prioritising the blood test first is a sensible idea. And financial assistance would be… very helpful, to be honest. I didn't really think about the cost, I just knew my leg was getting worse. So, yes, please check the pricing. And… what happens if the blood test is positive? What does that mean? I'm probably asking too many questions, aren't I?
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Nixon. It’s good you're being proactive. It's much better to be informed. If the D-dimer test comes back positive, it means there could be a blood clot present. It doesn't automatically confirm a clot, but it would prompt us to do the ultrasound to get a definitive answer. If a clot is found, we'd discuss treatment options, which could include blood thinners and compression stockings. We’d also need to consider your atrial fibrillation in the treatment plan, as it increases your risk of clots. Let me just check the pricing for the D-dimer test… Okay, it's $75. We do have a program for patients without insurance that could reduce that to $50. Would you like me to apply that for you?
PATIENT: Oh, $50 is… manageable, yes. Please do apply the program. That’s very kind of you. And… blood thinners. Those sound… scary. Are they dangerous? And what are compression stockings? Are they comfortable? I feel like I'm bombarding you with questions. I just… I don't like not knowing.
DOCTOR: You're not bombarding me at all, Nixon. It’s my job to answer your questions and ensure you feel comfortable. Blood thinners, also known as anticoagulants, do have risks, like increased bleeding. But they're generally very safe when monitored properly. We'd start with a low dose and adjust it based on your blood tests. You'd need regular check-ups to ensure the medication is working correctly. Compression stockings are tight-fitting socks that help improve blood flow in your legs. They come in different levels of compression. They're generally very comfortable, although it might take some getting used to. They’re like a supportive hug for your legs, and can significantly reduce swelling and pain. So, if you're okay with it, let’s go ahead and draw the blood for the D-dimer test. Then, we’ll discuss the results and create a plan together. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that… that sounds like a good plan. Let's do the blood test. I suppose it’s better to find out what’s going on. Where do we… do it? And… is there anything I should do to prepare? Like, should I eat something? Or drink anything? I'm probably still asking too many questions, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions! Honestly. We’ll go to the lab just down the hall. It's a quick procedure. And yes, please drink some water before we go – just to make it easier to draw the blood. You don’t need to eat anything specific. Just stay hydrated. Let’s go ahead and head over there now.
PATIENT: Alright. Water, yes. I can do that. Thank you for explaining everything, Doctor. I feel… a little less worried now, to be honest. Though I'm still not very keen on needles. But I suppose it has to be done.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Nixon. It’s completely normal to be nervous about needles. We'll get through it. And the phlebotomist in the lab is very good – they’ll make it as quick and painless as possible. We're almost there. Here we are.
PATIENT: Right… this looks… clinical. I suppose it has to be, doesn't it? I hope they’re quick. And… will I be able to sit down? I don’t think I can stand for very long with my leg like this. Thank you again, Doctor. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I feel much better knowing what to expect.
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely you'll be able to sit down. And don’t worry, I’ll stay with you while they draw the blood. Just let me know if you feel faint or uncomfortable at any time. Here’s Sarah, the phlebotomist. She’ll take good care of you. Just relax, and we'll be done in a few minutes.
