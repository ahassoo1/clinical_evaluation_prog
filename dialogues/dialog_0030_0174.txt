DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Quicksey. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, good morning. Well, to be frank, I haven’t been myself lately. It’s… difficult to explain, but I just feel persistently down. I suppose that’s why I’m here. I’d like to get this sorted, if you don't mind. I haven't much time, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Derasmo. I understand. Feeling persistently down is certainly something we can explore. It's good you came in to address it. I will do my best to be efficient with your time. To start, can you tell me a little more about what you mean by "not yourself?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well, usually I'm… active. Always doing something. Volunteering, keeping the garden tidy, visiting my grandchildren. Now… I just don't feel like it. Everything feels like a tremendous effort. And I’m sleeping terribly. Waking up several times a night. It's been going on for a few months, I'd say. Maybe four? It’s hard to keep track, honestly. I just… lack motivation. And I find myself… crying easily. Over nothing, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Derasmo. It sounds like this has been quite disruptive to your usual routine. Four months is a significant period of time, and it's understandable that you're seeking answers. Just to clarify, when you say "sleeping terribly," are you having difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or both?
PATIENT: Both, Doctor. Both. Sometimes I lie awake for an hour, just turning and turning. And then I might finally drift off, only to wake up a couple of hours later and… well, it’s a cycle. I get a little sleep, but it’s never restful. I wake up feeling… drained. Not at all refreshed, you understand? It's most peculiar. And it's affecting my appetite, I've noticed. I'm not eating nearly as much as I used to.
DOCTOR: I see. Difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, non-restful sleep, feeling drained, and a decreased appetite… These are all important pieces of the puzzle. Have you experienced any major life changes or stressful events in the past several months that might be contributing to this?
PATIENT: Well… my divorce was finalized just about six months ago, now. It was… amicable, as far as these things go. We’d been separated for a long time before that. But I suppose… even an amicable separation is still a separation, isn't it? It's just… it’s left a void, I suppose. I keep busy, but… at night, when it’s quiet… it feels rather empty. I haven't really talked about it with anyone, if I'm being honest. Not really.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Derasmo. A divorce, even an amicable one, is a significant life event and can certainly contribute to feelings of sadness and loss. It's completely understandable that you're feeling this way, and that it's been harder at night when things are quiet. Now, aside from the changes related to your divorce, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Let me think… Oh! I suppose… my concentration hasn’t been the best. I used to enjoy reading, but now I find myself re-reading the same page several times without absorbing anything. And I get… irritated quite easily. Little things that wouldn’t have bothered me before now feel… intensely frustrating. My grandson, bless his heart, was telling me about his football game, and I found myself snapping at him. I felt terrible afterwards, of course. It's just… not like me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Derasmo. Difficulty concentrating and increased irritability are also important details. It sounds like these changes are significantly impacting your daily life. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I've been quite healthy, all my life. I have a bit of arthritis in my knees, the usual for someone my age, but it’s well-managed. I have a general practitioner, Dr. Adebayo, but I haven’t seen her in… oh, a year or so, I’d say. Just for routine check-ups. Everything was fine then. I take a multivitamin, that’s about it. No other medications. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. A glass of wine with dinner occasionally, that’s all. I try to keep a healthy lifestyle, you see. It’s all rather frustrating, this… feeling unwell, given how careful I’ve been.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Derasmo. A healthy lifestyle is certainly beneficial. It’s helpful to know you don’t have any significant past medical history or take any regular medications aside from the multivitamin. And, to complete the picture, have you ever been hospitalized or had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. Nothing like that. I've been very lucky, health-wise, as I said. A few broken bones as a child, climbing trees, being a mischievous girl, but nothing serious. No hospitalizations. No surgeries. I really must be getting on, if you don’t mind. All this talk about medical history… I feel like I'm wasting your time. I just want to feel normal again. Is there something you can do?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Derasmo. You’re not wasting my time. Gathering this information is crucial to understanding your overall health and finding the best course of action. In fact, knowing you have a good history of health is very helpful. Given your symptoms—persistent sadness, difficulty sleeping, decreased appetite, loss of concentration, increased irritability, and the recent divorce—and the fact that these symptoms have been present for several months, it's important to consider the possibility of depression. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to rule out any underlying medical causes for your symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Yes, of course. If it’s necessary. Anything to get to the bottom of this. I just… I hope it’s not serious. I feel rather weak, if I’m honest. But a quick examination, yes. That’s fine. Please, get on with it. I have a few errands to run this afternoon, you see. Not that they matter much, feeling like this.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your vital signs. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72, and temperature is 98.6 - all within normal limits. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Reflexes are normal. Now, I'm going to palpate your thyroid gland. Thyroid feels normal, no enlargement. Finally, let's do a brief neurological assessment. I'm just going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. And can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Yes, of course. I can follow your finger just fine. And I can squeeze your hands, yes. Though, honestly, I haven't much strength these days. I feel… quite frail, if I’m being honest. Is there anything wrong? Are you finding something? I really just want to know if there’s something seriously wrong with me. It's rather unnerving, all this poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Derasmo, everything appears physically normal at this point. Your neurological exam is also intact. That's good news. The physical exam doesn't reveal any immediate cause for your symptoms. Based on your history and the findings of the exam, I strongly suspect you're experiencing symptoms of major depressive disorder. It’s a common condition, particularly after a significant life change like a divorce. It’s not a sign of weakness, and it’s very treatable. To confirm this diagnosis, I’d like to administer a brief questionnaire called the PHQ-9, which will help me assess the severity of your symptoms. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A questionnaire? Yes, I suppose so. If it’s necessary. Honestly, Doctor, I feel rather silly filling out forms when I’ve already told you how I feel. But if it will help… yes, please. Go ahead. I just hope this doesn’t take too long. I’m afraid my memory isn't what it used to be, and I’m worried I’ll get confused. Perhaps you could read the questions to me?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Derasmo. I'm happy to read the questions to you. It will only take a few minutes. Please answer as honestly as possible, even if the answer is “not at all.” The questionnaire is simply to help me understand the extent of your symptoms and guide our treatment plan. Okay, let's begin. “Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well… Not as much as I used to. Not at all, really. I used to enjoy my gardening, but it doesn't appeal to me now. I suppose… not at all. It's… quite sad, really. Everything feels… bland. Even my grandchildren's visits don’t bring me the joy they once did. So, yes. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Derasmo. “Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?
PATIENT: Oh, quite often. Most days, I’d say. It’s… a persistent feeling. A heaviness in my chest, a sense of… emptiness. It’s difficult to describe, really. But yes, quite often. I wake up feeling that way, and it lingers throughout the day. It's just… exhausting, this constant sadness. So, yes. Quite often.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Derasmo. “Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or sleeping too much?
PATIENT: Oh, that one's easy. Quite often, indeed. As I told you before, I struggle to fall asleep, and I wake up several times during the night. And when I finally do sleep, it's never restful. So, yes. Quite often. It’s… a vicious cycle, really. Tired all the time, but unable to get a good night's sleep. It's… quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Derasmo. “Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling tired or having little energy?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Every single day. Absolutely every single day. I have no energy for anything. Even getting out of bed feels like a tremendous effort. I used to be so active, so full of life. Now… I just feel drained, completely and utterly drained. So, yes. Every single day. It's… debilitating, really. I just want to lie down and sleep all the time. It's just… awful.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Derasmo. “Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by poor appetite or overeating?
PATIENT: Well, my appetite isn't what it used to be, that's for sure. I don’t feel hungry, not really. I have to force myself to eat something, otherwise I wouldn't eat at all. So, yes, poor appetite. Definitely. I used to enjoy cooking, but now… food just doesn’t appeal to me. It’s… rather sad, really. Everything feels like such an effort. So, yes. Poor appetite.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Derasmo. “Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by feeling bad about yourself - or that you are a failure or let yourself or your family down?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor… that one's difficult. Yes. Quite often. I feel… worthless, really. Like I'm not contributing anything. My divorce… it made me feel like a failure. I feel like I've let my grandchildren down, not being the cheerful grandmother I used to be. So, yes. Quite often. It's… very upsetting. I try not to dwell on it, but… it's difficult to ignore. It’s just… awful.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Derasmo. “Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by having trouble concentrating on things, such as reading the newspaper or watching television?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Very often, I’d say. I used to enjoy reading, but now… I can’t seem to focus. My mind wanders, I re-read the same page several times without absorbing anything. It's… incredibly frustrating. It’s just… everything feels like such a struggle. So, yes. Very often. It's… quite worrying, really. I’m afraid my mind is starting to go. It's… awful. I just want to feel normal again. It's just… awful.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Derasmo. “Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by moving or speaking so slowly that other people could have noticed?
PATIENT: No, not really. I haven't noticed that, no. I don't think anyone has noticed me moving or speaking more slowly. I just feel… tired, generally. Not… physically slower, if you understand. So, no. Not at all. Perhaps I just feel that way internally. It’s… difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Derasmo. “Finally, over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by thoughts that you would be better off dead - or that you have no reason to live?
PATIENT: …Oh, Doctor. That’s… a difficult question. I wouldn't say I've had thoughts of actually ending my life. But… sometimes I wish I hadn't woken up. Sometimes I wonder what the point of it all is. It’s not a desire to die, exactly. More like… a feeling of hopelessness. A feeling that things will never get better. So… sometimes. Not often, but… sometimes. It’s… very upsetting to even admit.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that with me, Ms. Derasmo. That took a great deal of courage. It's very important that you felt comfortable enough to tell me that. Based on your answers to the PHQ-9 questionnaire, as well as everything you’ve told me today, it’s highly likely that you are experiencing moderate depression. The thoughts you’ve described, even if they aren’t actively suicidal, require careful attention. It’s important to remember that depression is a treatable condition, and there is hope for recovery. We have several options available, including medication, therapy, or a combination of both. Before we discuss those options, I want to assure you that you are not alone, and I will be here to support you every step of the way. Would you be comfortable discussing these treatment options with me now?
PATIENT: Treatment… yes. Yes, I suppose so. I just… I don't know much about medication. I've never taken anything like that before. And therapy… I've always been a private person. It’s difficult to talk about my feelings, as you can see. But… I do want to feel better. I want to be able to enjoy my life again. So… yes. Tell me about my options. Please. But… quickly, if you don’t mind. I do have errands to run, you see. And I’m not sure how much longer I can… sit here. It’s just… exhausting.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Derasmo. I completely understand. We’ll go as quickly as we can, and I’ll do my best to explain everything clearly. There are several types of medications that can help treat depression, known as antidepressants. They work by balancing certain chemicals in the brain that are thought to play a role in mood regulation. Some common ones include SSRIs, SNRIs, and bupropion. They can have side effects, but many people experience minimal or no side effects. We’d start with a low dose and monitor your response closely. As for therapy, there are different types as well. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is often very effective, as it helps you identify and change negative thought patterns. Interpersonal Therapy focuses on improving your relationships and social support. We could also explore group therapy, which can provide a supportive environment. Often, the best approach is a combination of medication and therapy. We can discuss which option—or combination of options—would be the most appropriate for you, based on your individual needs and preferences. Before we make any decisions, would you like me to schedule a follow-up appointment so we can discuss this in more detail?
PATIENT: A follow-up… yes, I suppose so. That sounds sensible. It’s all rather… overwhelming, to be honest. I need time to think about it. And perhaps… perhaps I could speak to my daughter about it? She's a nurse, you see. She might have some insights. But… quickly, Doctor. If you don't mind. I really do have errands to run. And I'm feeling rather… faint. Could we just… schedule the appointment, and I can think about it in the meantime? Please. Just… get me out of here. It’s just… too much.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Derasmo. I completely understand. Let’s schedule a follow-up appointment for next week, on August 9th at 2:00 PM?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… acceptable. August 9th, 2:00 PM. Thank you, Doctor. I think… I think that's all I can manage for today. Thank you for your time. Now, if you'll excuse me...
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Derasmo. Let me walk you to the door. Here’s the contact information for the clinic, should you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you’re feeling overwhelmed. We’re here to support you. Have a safe trip home, Ms. Derasmo. And please, take care of yourself. .
