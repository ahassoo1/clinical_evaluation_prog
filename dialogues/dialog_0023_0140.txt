DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schieber. I'm Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, it’s… irritating. Something with my mouth. It’s a bit embarrassing to even discuss, really. It’s just… white patches. My wife suggested I come, she thinks it’s something. I don’t usually bother with doctors for minor things.
DOCTOR: “Irritating,” you say. White patches in the mouth. Alright. It's good your wife encouraged you to come in. Even seemingly "minor" things can be worth checking. Can you tell me where exactly these patches are located in your mouth?
PATIENT: Well, mostly on my tongue. And… the insides of my cheeks, a little bit. It’s not all over, thankfully. It doesn't really hurt, just… looks unpleasant. I’ve tried rinsing with water, but it doesn’t seem to do much good. Is this… contagious, Doctor? My wife and I… well, you can imagine.
DOCTOR: Primarily on the tongue and buccal mucosa. Not painful, just a cosmetic concern. I understand your concern about contagiousness, Mr. Schieber. It’s a valid question. Before we jump to conclusions, let's gather a bit more information. Have these patches appeared suddenly, or have they developed gradually over time?
PATIENT: Gradually, I think. It wasn’t… one day, poof, there they were. More like… over the past few weeks, I noticed them getting… more noticeable. Honestly, I didn’t pay much attention at first. A bit of white stuff, who cares? It’s just… my wife is very particular. She worries about everything. And now I’m here. Is it some sort of… infection? I eat pretty well, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Over weeks, not sudden onset. I see. And you’ve noticed no other symptoms alongside these patches?
PATIENT: No, nothing else. No fever, no… other discomfort, really. Just the white patches. And the nagging from my wife. I mean, I haven't lost my appetite or anything. Everything tastes normal, as far as I can tell. Really, it's just… aesthetically displeasing. I hope it's not something dreadful. I have a business to run, you know. I don’t have time to be ill.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s have a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… try to be quick, Doctor. I have a rather important call scheduled this afternoon. Honestly, I'm not usually one for these… examinations. It feels rather intrusive, if you don’t mind me saying so.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, I see the patches you're referring to. They are primarily on your dorsal tongue and along the buccal mucosa. They appear somewhat irregular in shape and… slightly raised. No obvious ulceration or bleeding. Have you noticed any changes in your taste?
PATIENT: No, taste is fine. Perfectly normal. I enjoy my food, Doctor. I don’t have any… diminished capacity in that regard. I eat a very balanced diet. And I don't smoke, if that’s what you were going to ask. I find it a disgusting habit. Honestly, I'm not sure what could be causing this. Perhaps it’s just… stress? I've had a few difficult negotiations lately. Could stress cause something like this?
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly manifest in various ways, Mr. Schieber, but it's unlikely to be the sole cause of these particular findings. It could be oral thrush, though the presentation isn't entirely typical. Have you ever used any inhaled corticosteroids – for asthma, perhaps?
PATIENT: Inhaled corticosteroids? Good heavens, no. I have perfectly healthy lungs, thank you very much. I’ve never been afflicted with any… respiratory ailments. I maintain a very active lifestyle. I enjoy hiking, you see. I certainly don't require any… fancy inhalers. What is thrush, exactly? Is it… serious? And is it… spreadable? I’d prefer to know these things directly.
DOCTOR: Oral thrush, also known as oral candidiasis, is a fungal infection of the mouth caused by Candida yeast. It’s not always serious, especially in healthy individuals, but it can be uncomfortable. And yes, it is potentially spreadable through saliva, though it's not highly contagious. However, it's unusual in someone without typical risk factors – like a weakened immune system or recent antibiotic use. Do you take any medications at all, Mr. Schieber?
PATIENT: Medications… well, I take a daily multivitamin, of course. And occasionally, an antacid, if I’ve indulged in something… rich. But that’s all. Nothing regular, nothing prescribed. I generally avoid pharmaceuticals whenever possible. I prefer natural remedies, if anything. Is that… a problem? I’ve heard those doctors prescribe medication for everything these days. Is there really no other option?
DOCTOR: A daily multivitamin and occasional antacid. Alright. Look, Mr. Schieber, while I appreciate your preference for natural remedies, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. Given the location and appearance of these patches, and the lack of typical risk factors, I’d like to perform a quick swab to send to the lab. This will confirm whether it’s candidiasis or something else. It’s a simple procedure, takes only a few moments. Are you agreeable to that?
PATIENT: A swab? Really, Doctor? Is that absolutely necessary? It seems rather… excessive for something that’s probably just stress, or a bit of indigestion. But… fine. If you insist. Just please be quick about it. I truly do have a very busy schedule. And try not to poke around too much. It’s rather unpleasant. Get it over with, then.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s done. It was quite straightforward. The lab results should be back in a few days. I'll have my assistant contact you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding sugary foods and drinks, as they can exacerbate a potential fungal infection. I’ll also write you a referral to a dermatologist. While this may not be a serious condition, it’s best to get a specialist’s opinion to rule out any other underlying causes. Do you have any questions for me before I conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: A dermatologist? Really, Doctor. It seems rather… extreme. I suppose. No, I don’t believe I have any further questions. Just… send me the results as quickly as possible. I’d like to get this resolved efficiently. And please, ensure your assistant is… discreet. I’d prefer not to discuss my oral health with strangers. Thank you, Doctor. I believe that concludes this… ordeal. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schieber. My assistant will be in contact. Have a good day.
