DOCTOR: Good morning. Dr. Jules. Please, have a seat. Now, Mr. Brum, you're 90 years old, which is… considerable. Let's not waste time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, ninety years. A long time, isn’t it? I have… a headache. In the back of my head. It’s been there a few days now. Not terrible, but… always there.
DOCTOR: A headache, you say. For a few days. And where, precisely, in the back of your head?
PATIENT: Right… here. Not up high, more… down low. And it feels… tight. Like a band around my head, but mostly in the back. It doesn’t… throb, exactly. Just… pressure.
DOCTOR: “Pressure.” I see. And has anything… specific brought this on?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. Not that I can think of. I haven’t… fallen or bumped my head. I’ve been doing the same things as always. Working at the rail yard, you know. Not as much as I used to, but still… keeping busy. Maybe a little more tired lately, but that’s just old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: The rail yard… Yes. And how would you describe your typical level of activity at the rail yard?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I used to be a dinkey operator, mostly. Moving the cars around, fixing little things. Now… Now I mostly just… check things. Make sure the young fellas are doing it right. Hostling, you know. Moving the cars into the right place for loading. It’s not… heavy lifting anymore. Mostly walking and looking. A lot of walking. But I'm on my feet all day.
DOCTOR: Walking. All day. And is this headache… constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly constant. It’s not sharp pain, you understand. It's just… there. It gets a little worse when I’m tired, or if I’ve been walking a lot. But even when I’m resting, it doesn’t really go away completely. It's a dull ache, mostly. Like a weight. A small weight.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this “dull ache”?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Let me see… I haven’t been feeling sick to my stomach, no. No fever, that I know of. My eyesight's been a little blurry sometimes, but that’s been happening for years. I get a little dizzy sometimes when I stand up too fast… but I always have. Nothing new, I don’t think. Just… old man stuff.
DOCTOR: “Old man stuff.” Naturally. And your medications?
PATIENT: Medications? No, Doctor. None. I don't take anything. Never have, really. Just a little aspirin when my knees bother me, and that’s not… often. I try to stay healthy. Good food, keep moving. That’s what my mother always said. No pills for Mitchell Brum.
DOCTOR: Very well. Perhaps a brief examination is in order, then. Just to be thorough. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Examination is good. Always good to check. Just let me know what you want me to do.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is… regular, if a bit slow. Lungs are clear, no wheezing. Blood pressure is… acceptable, though on the lower end. No tenderness to palpation. Reflexes are diminished, as expected for someone of your age. Now, I'm going to check your eyes. Please follow my finger. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light, but… slightly constricted.
PATIENT: Constricted, you say? That doesn’t sound good, does it? I don’t feel anything wrong with my eyes. I just… see a little blurry sometimes, like I said. Especially when I haven’t had enough sleep. Is that serious, Doctor? The constricted… things?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious Mr. Brum, but it's… notable. It could be a number of things. Could be benign, related to your age, or… something else. Given your age and history, I suspect this is likely benign, but we will proceed with caution. Now, have you had any changes in your vision recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my vision… Let me think. Everything's been a little blurry for a long time, like I said. But… Now that you mention it, maybe it's been a little worse lately. Not a lot, just… a little. It's harder to read small print, and I need more light when I’m working. But I thought that was just getting older. Is that something to worry about, Doctor? The getting worse?
DOCTOR: It bears investigation, Mr. Brum. We will order some basic blood work to rule out any underlying causes, and I'm referring you to an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye exam. It is always best to be thorough. I suspect it will be nothing, but… we must rule things out. Do you have any family history of glaucoma or macular degeneration?
PATIENT: Glaucoma… macular… No, Doctor. Not that I know of. My mother… she lived a long life, but I don’t remember her ever having any trouble with her eyes. And my father… he died when I was young. I don’t know much about his health. We didn't talk much about those things, back then. Is that… bad? Those things? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Mr. Brum, worrying will not solve anything. However, these conditions can cause vision loss, which is why it’s important to rule them out. I've already ordered the blood work, and I’m sending a referral to Dr. Alvarez, a very competent ophthalmologist. He will evaluate your vision and determine if any further testing is needed. In the meantime, try to avoid straining your eyes, and make sure you have adequate lighting when reading or working. Do you have any questions for me before I conclude?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very well. Blood work and… Dr. Alvarez. I’ll do that. Thank you, Doctor. For taking the time. I appreciate it. My mother always said a good doctor is worth their weight in gold. And I think she was right. I guess I’ll go and get that blood work done then. Is there anything special I need to do to prepare?
DOCTOR: You need to fast for 8 hours prior to the blood draw. No food or drink, other than water. The lab will provide you with the necessary paperwork. And please, try not to overthink it. I've sent the referral electronically to Dr. Alvarez’s office; they will contact you to schedule an appointment. If you experience any sudden changes in your vision, such as double vision or complete loss of sight, go to the emergency room immediately. That will be all. Have a good day, Mr. Brum.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Eight hours, no food. And go to the emergency room if something changes. I will remember that. Thank you again, Doctor Jules.
