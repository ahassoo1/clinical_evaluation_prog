DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's my muscles, mostly. They just feel...weak. It's been going on for a little while now, and it’s starting to bother me more and more. I just want to figure out what’s going on, if that makes sense. I’d like to get it sorted quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, weakness… and you say it's been going on for “a little while”?
PATIENT: Yeah, “a little while.” Hmm... let me think. Probably about three months, give or take a week or two. It started slow, just noticing I was a bit more tired after work, but now it’s… harder to do things. Like, lifting stuff at work, even just carrying groceries. It's not painful, exactly, just… difficult.
DOCTOR: Right. Three months. And you describe it as difficulty, not pain. Can you be more specific about where you’re experiencing this weakness?
PATIENT: Mostly in my arms and legs, I'd say. My legs feel it more when I’m walking a lot, or going up stairs. And my arms… well, at work I appraise car damage, so I’m always reaching and lifting things, and that’s when I really notice it. It's both sides, not just one arm or one leg. Does that make sense? It feels… even, if that’s the right word.
DOCTOR: “Even,” alright. So bilateral arm and leg weakness. And it’s exacerbated by activity. Do you notice any other symptoms accompanying this weakness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. No numbness, no tingling. I have been a bit more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn't these days? I haven’t noticed anything else that’s definitely connected, no. I mean, sometimes I feel a little off balance, but I thought that was just… well, being tired. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: A little off balance… interesting. Have you had any recent changes in your weight, either intentional or unintentional?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Actually… yeah, a little. I think I’ve lost a few pounds, maybe five or so. Didn’t really try to, just haven’t been as hungry, I guess. It's not a huge amount, though. I’m usually around 170, maybe a bit more, and I think I’m closer to 165 now.
DOCTOR: Okay, unintentional weight loss of approximately five pounds. And this has occurred over the same three month period as the weakness?
PATIENT: Yeah, roughly the same time, I think. It all sort of started around the same point. The tiredness, the weakness, the not wanting to eat as much… it feels connected, but I’m no doctor, you know? It’s just what I’ve noticed.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, let's go through some of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. Nothing major, anyway. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, that sort of thing. But as an adult, I haven’t really been sick. No diabetes, no heart problems, no arthritis… nothing like that. I've always been pretty healthy, honestly. I mean, until now.
DOCTOR: Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never needed any. No surgeries at all. Broken a bone or two as a kid, but nothing that required an operation. Just sprains and bruises, the usual clumsiness. I'm lucky, I guess.
DOCTOR: And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… that's a bit tricky. My dad passed away a few years back. He had some problems with his heart, I think, but it was a long time ago. My mom is still alive, she’s 78, and she’s pretty healthy for her age, thankfully. No real history of anything major on either side of the family, if that makes sense. Mostly just the normal aches and pains of getting older.
DOCTOR: Okay. And currently, are you taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I’m not on any medication at all. Never have been. I try to avoid taking pills if I can, honestly. Just… over-the-counter stuff sometimes, like ibuprofen for a headache, but nothing regular. That’s it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've eaten pretty much everything, and never had a reaction. No problems with pollen, dust, or anything like that. I'm pretty lucky, I guess. I really don’t want to find out I do have an allergy now!
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. McKinnon, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if that's alright. It will involve checking your reflexes, strength, and a general assessment. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Honestly, I’m just glad we’re getting somewhere. I just want to figure out what's going on and get it fixed. The sooner the better, if you know what I mean. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay. Please have a seat here, and we'll begin. I'm going to start by checking your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then we’ll move on to a neurological assessment. Blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, I’d like you to relax your arms for me. Biceps reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Triceps are also 2+ bilaterally. Now, I’m going to assess your muscle strength. I’m going to ask you to resist my hand as I apply pressure. Can you squeeze my hands as hard as you can?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure, no problem. Here we go. I’ll try my best. Just let me know if I need to squeeze harder or anything. I'm a bit worried I won't be as strong as I used to be, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Grip strength is 4+/5 bilaterally. Now, let’s move on to your legs. I’m going to ask you to push against my hand as I apply resistance. Can you do that for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure thing. I’ll push as hard as I can. Just tell me when to stop or if I'm doing it wrong. This is a bit worrying, to be honest. I've always had pretty strong legs.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Quadriceps strength is 4/5 bilaterally, and hamstrings are also 4/5 bilaterally. I’m also going to check your reflexes in your knees and ankles. Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, and Achilles reflexes are 1+ bilaterally. Now, I want to perform a quick balance test. Can you stand with your feet together and close your eyes for a moment?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Feet together, eyes closed… Here we go. Oh, woah… I'm a bit wobbly, to be honest. It feels like I'm going to fall. Should I open my eyes?
DOCTOR: Yes, please open your eyes, Mr. McKinnon. That’s alright. A slight Romberg sign is present. Okay, thank you. That’s all for the physical examination for now. Based on the history and physical examination, your symptoms – progressive weakness, unintentional weight loss, and a slight balance issue – are concerning. Given your age and lack of significant medical history, a few possibilities need to be investigated. I want to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and vitamin B12 and D levels. I’d also like to order a creatinine kinase level to rule out muscle damage. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, that all sounds… sensible, I guess. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Blood work, tests… fine. I just want to know what's going on, and get it sorted. The sooner the better. Just… is it something serious? You sounded a bit… concerned. I don't want anything too scary.
DOCTOR: It’s prudent to be thorough, Mr. McKinnon. The combination of symptoms warrants investigation, but I don’t want to alarm you unnecessarily. The tests will help rule out several possibilities, including vitamin deficiencies, thyroid disorders, and potential neurological conditions. It's possible these tests will reveal something benign, but it’s important to be comprehensive. I'm going to order these tests now. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll take a small sample of your blood. It shouldn’t take more than 15 minutes. Once the results are back, which usually takes a few days, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Okay… a few days… Alright. No, I think that covers it for now. Just… what should I do in the meantime? Should I be resting more? Avoiding lifting things? I work as an insurance appraiser, so it’s hard to avoid lifting sometimes. I don’t want to make things worse. Just… is there anything I should avoid doing?
DOCTOR: Good question. I would advise against any strenuous activity, including heavy lifting, until we have the results of the blood work. Try to limit reaching and bending as much as possible, and prioritize rest. If you experience any new symptoms – such as numbness, tingling, difficulty breathing, or severe pain – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay, no strenuous activity, rest, and watch for new symptoms. Got it. No numbness, tingling, or difficulty breathing. I understand. That sounds… reasonable. Alright, then. I’ll go get the blood work done. Thank you, Doctor. Hopefully it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. We’ll get to the bottom of this. The lab technician will guide you through the process. Once you’ve completed the blood work, please schedule a follow-up appointment with the receptionist. I’ll see you then. Do you have any trouble getting to the lab, or do you need assistance scheduling your follow-up?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm alright getting to the lab. It's just down the hall, right? And I can schedule the appointment with the receptionist after. I can manage. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your help. I'll go get this over with.
