DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. Perhaps you could start by telling me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh. Good morning to you too, Doctor… Kalinski, yes? Brings me in? Well… I just moved here. New place, you know? Need to find a… a doctor. Medicare lady said I should come. Something about checking… things. Old man things, I guess. I don’t really remember what she said, to be honest. It was a long wait.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. It’s very common to need to establish care when moving to a new area, and a comprehensive check-up is an excellent idea. We’ll cover everything thoroughly. So, to clarify, you’re primarily here to establish a new patient relationship and have a general health assessment?
PATIENT: Assessment… yes, that sounds right. A check… to see if everything still works. I used to be very good with… faces. Making them pretty. Theater work. A long time ago, though. Not so much now. My hands… they shake a little. But assessment… yes. That’s what she said. A new… assessment. Is that like a test? I don’t like needles.
DOCTOR: Yes, an assessment is a good way to put it. It involves a review of your medical history, a physical examination, and potentially some tests – bloodwork, for instance – to give us a complete picture of your health. And I understand your concern about needles. We can certainly discuss minimizing any discomfort, and we don’t need to do anything you’re not comfortable with. Before we get to the physical part, let's talk a bit about your medical background. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. My ex-wife… she had a lot of surgeries. Very vain woman. Always wanting to change something. But me? Not much. I broke my wrist once, falling off a ladder. Setting up lights. Very clumsy, I was. A long time ago. And… I think I had the measles as a boy. Or maybe it was mumps? It was a long time ago, you understand. Everything blurs together after a while. And my teeth… they’ve had a lot of work. But not a big surgery, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a broken wrist that required surgery, and childhood measles or mumps. And some dental work. That's helpful, thank you. Do you recall when the wrist injury occurred – roughly what year?
PATIENT: Roughly… oh dear. That was a long time ago. I was… young. Just starting out, really. Theater was booming then. Hmm… let me see. Before the Wall came down, definitely. So… before 1989? Maybe early 80s? I’m terrible with dates, truly. I focus on the faces, not the years, you see. It's all about the light and shadow, not when things happen.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. Before 1989 gives us a good timeframe. Now, regarding any significant medical conditions – have you been diagnosed with things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything of that nature?
PATIENT: High… pressure? Hmm. My ex-wife always complained about my blood pressure. Said I got too stressed with the shows. But me? I don't know. Never really checked. The doctor back then… he wasn’t very thorough. Just gave me pills for everything. Diabetes? No, I like sweets too much to have that. I eat… well, I used to eat a lot of pierogi. Good pierogi. But I don’t think I have… diabetes. Heart problems… I get a little breathless sometimes, climbing the stairs. But that’s just because I’m… not as young as I used to be, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, so no formal diagnosis of high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems, though you do mention occasional breathlessness with exertion. That's good information. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, stroke, or dementia?
PATIENT: Dementia… oh, my mother. Yes. She… she didn’t remember things. Towards the end, she didn’t even know who I was. Very sad, that. Always a beautiful woman, though. Used to sing… beautifully. But yes, dementia. That ran in her family, I think. My father… he smoked too much. Always coughing. I don’t know if that was… something that runs in the family. He died young. Very sudden. Heart, I think. But he wasn’t a good man. Didn’t care much for anyone. So, I don’t really count that.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, a history of dementia on your mother’s side and your father had a heart condition, though perhaps not a particularly reliable history. Now, let's move onto your current medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, the pills. Yes. The Medicare lady said I was on a lot of pills. I think… something for my blood pressure, maybe? And something for my… knees. They ache, you see. Especially in the winter. And a little blue pill… but that’s not important. I don't really remember the names. I just take what the doctor tells me. The little white one, the little blue one, the little red one… they all look the same after a while. I have a bag full of them at home. It’s a mess, really. I should probably sort them out, but I never get around to it.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Szmyd. We can certainly sort through this together. It’s very common for medications to accumulate over time. Would you be comfortable bringing in the bag of pills with you on a future visit so we can identify each one?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That would be good. Very good. I should probably do that. It’s just… a mess, you understand? A big mess. I’ll find it. Somewhere. In the kitchen, I think. Or maybe the bedroom? My apartment is… small. Everything gets piled up. But yes, I’ll bring the pills. If I can find them, that is.
DOCTOR: Excellent. That would be very helpful. Now, before we move on to a physical examination, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. No, I don’t think so. I used to be allergic to cats, but I haven’t been around a cat in… oh, a very long time. And… no, nothing else that I can think of. I eat everything. I used to love shellfish, but my ex-wife didn’t like it, so I stopped. But that wasn’t an allergy, just… her. No, I don't have any allergies, Doctor. None that I know of.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, I'd like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Oh, no. Never. My father… he smoked too much. Terrible habit. I always hated the smell. Alcohol… I used to have a glass of vodka with dinner, sometimes. Just one. But not anymore. Too old for that now. Makes me sleepy. And… recreational drugs? Oh, no. Never. I was a theater man, you understand. We had enough drama without those. No, Doctor. I live a… quiet life now. Very quiet.
DOCTOR: A quiet life, that's good. Now, let’s move on to the physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Physical… examination? Oh. Yes. Alright. Just… be gentle, Doctor. My hands… they shake, you see. And I don’t like surprises. Just tell me what you’re doing, okay?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Szmyd. I will explain everything as I go, and we'll take things at your pace. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’d like to check your vital signs – your blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and respiratory rate. Then, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Blood pressure… yes, that’s the one my ex-wife always complained about. Alright. Just… don’t poke me too much, okay? And… if I flinch, it’s just because I’m nervous. My hands, you see. They shake. Alright. Go ahead, Doctor. Just be gentle.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd, I'm just going to wrap this cuff around your arm. It will tighten for a moment – it might feel a little snug, but it shouldn't be painful. Deep breaths, please. Okay, your blood pressure is 148/85. That’s slightly elevated. We’ll want to monitor that. Your heart rate is 72 beats per minute, which is normal. Your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, also normal. And your respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Just relax and breathe normally. I’m hearing a normal rhythm, but there is a slight murmur. It’s not concerning at this point, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Your lungs sound clear, but there is some slight decreased breath sound at the bases. Have you had any cough lately?
PATIENT: Murmur? Decreased breath sound? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Cough… a little. Just a tickle in my throat, really. Mostly in the mornings. I used to smoke a pipe, you know. Years ago. A long time ago. But I stopped. Is that… is that what this is? From the pipe? Oh dear. Is it serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: It’s good you told me about the pipe, Mr. Szmyd. A history of smoking can contribute to changes in the lungs. The slight decreased breath sound could be related to that, but it could also be due to a number of other factors. It’s not necessarily serious at this point, but it warrants further investigation. Now, I’d like to examine your abdomen, listening for any unusual sounds and checking for any tenderness. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Abdomen… oh. Well… alright. Just be gentle, Doctor. I… I had a little trouble with my stomach once. Years ago. Too much pierogi, probably. It’s just… sensitive. And I… I don't really like people poking around down there. But alright. Go ahead. Just be quick, okay? And tell me what you’re doing.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Szmyd. I'll be very gentle. I'm just going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope, and then I'll gently press on different areas to check for any tenderness. I'll explain each step as I go. Your bowel sounds are normal. Now, I'm going to gently press here, and here... Does that cause any discomfort?
PATIENT: Ooh… a little. There. On the left side. Just… a little tender. It’s not… sharp pain. Just… uncomfortable. It feels… gassy, maybe? I have trouble sometimes, you know. With my stomach. Especially after… after I eat something rich. Pierogi, mostly. I should probably stop eating so much pierogi, shouldn't I?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful information, Mr. Szmyd. Tenderness on the left side, and potentially related to dietary habits. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, I’d like to check your reflexes. This involves lightly tapping on your knees and ankles with this small hammer. It’s perfectly normal, and doesn’t hurt. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Reflexes? Oh. I don’t like hammers. Even small ones. Will it… will it hurt? My hands are shaking, you know. I might jump. Just… be careful, Doctor. Very careful.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Szmyd. It’s perfectly normal to be nervous. It’s just a very gentle tap, it shouldn’t hurt at all. I’ll be very careful. I’ll start with your knees. Just relax your legs, and I’ll do a quick tap. Okay, your knee reflexes are a little diminished on both sides, but that’s not necessarily cause for concern. Now, I’ll check your ankle reflexes. And your ankle reflexes are also a little diminished. Now, I’d like to check your feet and legs for any swelling or abnormalities. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Ooh! That was… surprising. Diminished? What does that mean? Is something wrong? My legs… I get cramps sometimes, you know. Especially at night. And I think my feet are a little swollen. Just a little. I have trouble with circulation, I think. It’s just… old age, mostly. Alright. Go ahead. Check my feet. Just be gentle, Doctor. Very gentle.
DOCTOR: Diminished reflexes can sometimes be a normal part of aging, but it’s something we need to consider in the overall picture. Cramps and some swelling are also common. Let’s take a look at your feet. Okay, I do notice some slight swelling in your ankles and feet. The skin is a little dry. I don't see any open sores or unusual discoloration. Now, I’m going to check the pulses in your feet. Your pulses are a little weak, but present. Overall, the examination is consistent with some mild peripheral vascular disease, which is common in older adults. Alright, Mr. Szmyd. We’ve completed the physical examination. Now, based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found, I’d like to discuss some possible next steps. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Oh, good. It’s over. Peripheral… what did you call it? Sounds serious. Is it serious, Doctor? I just… I want to live a quiet life, you understand? I don’t want any big problems. What do you suggest? What kind of tests do I need? And… will they hurt?
DOCTOR: Peripheral vascular disease means there's some reduced blood flow in your legs and feet. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it’s something we should investigate to rule out any underlying causes and prevent it from getting worse. I recommend a few tests, Mr. Szmyd. First, a blood test to check your cholesterol, blood sugar, and kidney function. These can help us identify any risk factors. Second, an EKG to check your heart rhythm. And third, a simple test called an ankle-brachial index, which measures the blood pressure in your ankles and arms to assess the blood flow in your legs. The blood test involves a small needle prick, so there will be some mild discomfort. The EKG is painless – we just attach some electrodes to your chest. And the ankle-brachial index is completely painless – we just use a blood pressure cuff. None of these tests should cause you significant discomfort. Would you be comfortable scheduling these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Oh dear. I don’t like needles, you know. And I don’t like being poked and prodded. But… if you think it’s necessary… alright. I suppose I can do it. But… can I have a little break afterwards? And… maybe a cup of tea? I get… nervous, you understand. And… can I bring someone with me next time? Just… someone to hold my hand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Szmyd. We can absolutely schedule a break for you afterwards, and a cup of tea would be lovely. And you can definitely bring someone with you next time for support – that’s a wonderful idea. We want you to feel as comfortable as possible. I’ll have the nurse schedule the blood test, EKG, and ankle-brachial index for you. They’ll be able to answer any specific questions you have about each test. In the meantime, I recommend you continue with a healthy diet and regular exercise, as tolerated. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns or questions before your next appointment. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh, good. That’s… that’s very kind of you, Doctor. Healthy diet… regular exercise… I used to walk a lot, you know. Before my knees started hurting. Maybe I can try that again. Hmm… questions? Let me see… Yes. The Medicare lady said something about… a specialist? Do I need to see a specialist? Is something seriously wrong? I don't want a specialist. They always do… more things.
DOCTOR: That’s a valid question, Mr. Szmyd. Based on the initial examination, I don't believe you need to see a specialist right now. However, if the results of the tests show any significant abnormalities, I might recommend a consultation with a vascular specialist. That would just allow us to get a more in-depth evaluation and discuss any potential treatment options. But let's not worry about that yet. We'll wait for the test results first, and then we can discuss everything in detail. I want to assure you that I’ll be with you every step of the way. We’ll make decisions together, and I’ll only recommend a specialist if it’s absolutely necessary. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. You’ve been… very kind, Doctor. And patient. I’m not very good at… remembering things, you understand. And I get nervous easily. Just… thank you. Can I… can I go now? I feel a little tired. And I think I need that cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. You’ve been very brave today, and I appreciate you coming in and sharing your concerns with me. Let’s get you settled with that cup of tea. The nurse will escort you to the waiting area, and she’ll let you know when your tests are scheduled. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. And remember, we’re here to help. Take care, Mr. Szmyd.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. Hopefully, nothing too serious… .
