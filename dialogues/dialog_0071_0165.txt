DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Brege. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon, Doc. Look, I ain’t got a lot of time, if you don’t mind. Been gettin’ these fevers… keep comin’ back. It’s been a couple of weeks now, I think. Feels like the flu, but it goes away then comes right back.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of weeks of recurring fevers… I understand wanting to get to the bottom of this quickly. Let's see… just to clarify, when you say "recurring," about how often are these fevers coming back?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s not every day, Doc. More like… every three or four days? Sometimes five. It’s hard to keep track, honestly. I just know it’s annoying as heck. It knocks me right down each time.
DOCTOR: Right, every three to five days. And when you get these fevers, do you have any other symptoms along with them?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little bit. Mostly just feelin’ tired, you know? Real beat. And achy. Like I got run over by a truck. Sometimes a little cough, but nothin’ major. No stuffy nose or anything like that. It's just… the fever and feelin’ awful.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and aches accompany the fever… and a mild cough. Have you been checking your temperature when you feel these fevers coming on?
PATIENT: Nah, I don't really bother with thermometers. My wife usually takes a look at me and says I'm burnin' up. She's usually right. I mostly just try to sleep it off. Ain’t got the energy to mess with all that thermometer stuff when I feelin’ bad.
DOCTOR: I understand. Alright, well, we'll have to get a temperature reading here in the office to get a better idea. Before we do that, have you noticed any chills or sweats with these fevers?
PATIENT: Yeah, definitely chills. When the fever first hits, I get the shivers real bad. Then, later on, I get kinda sweaty. Not soaked, but… clammy. You know? It’s like a wave washes over me. Then the tiredness kicks in hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, chills followed by sweats... that's helpful. Now, have you traveled anywhere recently, even within the country?
PATIENT: Nope. Haven’t been nowhere. Been right here in town, workin’ and tryin’ to stay outta the heat. My wife and I, we used to travel, but… not anymore. Too much hassle, ya know? Plus, she's not really up for it these days. So, just here. Always here.
DOCTOR: Alright, staying local. Now, before we do a quick exam, can you tell me about any medical conditions you have, or have had in the past?
PATIENT: Well, I got a bit of arthritis in my knees, keeps me from bendin' down too easy. And my blood pressure gets a little high sometimes, but I don't take nothin' for it. The doc said to watch my salt intake. Other than that… not much. Oh, and I had the flu pretty bad a couple years back, but that's it. No serious illnesses or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis, occasional high blood pressure, and a bout of the flu a couple of years ago. Do you take any medications regularly, even over-the-counter things like pain relievers?
PATIENT: Nah, not really. Maybe some ibuprofen now and then for the arthritis, if it's really botherin' me. But that's it. I try to avoid pills if I can, honestly. Don’t like the way they make me feel. My wife, she's always tryin' to get me to take somethin' for somethin', but I usually just tough it out.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen occasionally for the arthritis. Any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had no allergies. My wife’s the one with the allergies, she’s always sniffin’ and sneezin’. Me? I can eat anything, take anything. Lucky, I guess. Or maybe not, with these fevers keepin' me down.
DOCTOR: Alright, no allergies. Last question for now: do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Nah, Doc. I gave up smokin' years ago, bad for ya. I might have a beer with dinner sometimes, but that's it. And definitely no drugs. Never been my thing. I just want to feel better, that's all. This is takin' too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, occasional alcohol. I understand your frustration. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, take your temperature, and feel your abdomen. Nothing to worry about. Please have a seat on the examination table.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Just hurry it up, alright? I got patients waitin’ on me back at the office. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, though a little diminished breath sounds on the lower lobes... could be normal. Okay, your temperature is 101.8 Fahrenheit. A bit elevated. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. No masses or organomegaly that I can feel. I'm going to check your lymph nodes now. Lymph nodes are slightly enlarged in your neck, but not significantly concerning right now. I'll note that as well.
PATIENT: Enlarged what now? Look, Doc, I ain't a medical man, ya know? Is this somethin’ serious? I just want somethin’ to knock this fever down. Is it the flu or somethin’? I got people dependin’ on me. This is makin' me nervous.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brege, I understand your concern. Enlarged lymph nodes just means your body is reacting to something, like an infection. It doesn't necessarily mean anything serious, but we need to investigate further. Your temperature is consistent with a fever, and it could be the flu, but the recurring nature and the enlarged lymph nodes are making me consider other possibilities. To be safe, I'd like to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray. These tests will help us determine the cause of your fever and rule out anything serious. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more waitin’, more hassle. Look, Doc, I don't like tests. I just want a shot or somethin’ to make me feel better. Can't you just give me somethin' for the fever? I got appointments all afternoon, can't be spendin' all day in here. What if it’s just a bad cold? This is givin' me a headache.
DOCTOR: Mr. Brege, I understand your frustration, and I wish I could just give you a shot and send you on your way. However, it’s important to find out what’s causing the fever before we treat it. Giving you medication without knowing the cause could mask the symptoms and potentially delay proper treatment if it is something more serious. While a cold is possible, the recurring nature and the lymph node swelling warrant further investigation. The tests I've ordered will give us a clearer picture. We can draw the blood now, and the X-ray can be done right here in the clinic. It shouldn't take too long. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, I can prescribe you something to help manage the fever and aches. However, it’s important to remember that this is just symptomatic relief and won’t address the underlying cause. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Fine. Do the tests. But hurry it up, Doc. And yeah, give me somethin' for the fever. Anything to get me through the afternoon. I ain't got time to be laid up. Just… don't keep me waitin' all day. What time are we lookin' at for these results? And where do I go for the X-ray?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Brege. We'll get the blood drawn right away. The X-ray is just down the hall, room 3. The technician is already expecting you. The results usually take about an hour, sometimes a little longer depending on the lab. I’ll have the nurse call you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you ibuprofen 600mg every 6 hours as needed for fever and aches. The nurse will give you the prescription and instructions on where to fill it. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. An hour, huh? Well, let's get this over with. Just tell the nurse to hurry things up. I got patients waitin', remember? And I'm expectin' a call as soon as those results are in. Don't keep me in the dark. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Brege. I understand. I’ll make sure the nurse is aware of your concerns and will expedite the process as much as possible. We'll call you immediately with the results. The nurse is just down the hall, room 1. She’ll take it from here. Please let us know if you experience any worsening symptoms while you wait. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. .
