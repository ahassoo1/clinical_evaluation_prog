DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Redfern, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s me. Chanz. Look, honestly, I barely remember filling out all those forms. It was… a while ago, wasn’t it? Something about sleep, right? And getting… less floppy? Is that what they said?
DOCTOR: “Less floppy?
PATIENT: That’s… how my wife put it. She had a way with words, God rest her soul. Said I was losing my… tone. Like an instrument needing a tune-up, only it was me. Honestly, I just feel tired all the time. And I suppose… not as strong as I used to be. Though, what's the point of getting stronger at my age? Not like I'm climbing mountains.
DOCTOR: Right. Tiredness and… a perceived loss of strength. And this has been going on for… how long exactly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Ages. Honestly, since… well, since she passed. It’s all a bit blurry. A good year, maybe? Longer? It’s hard to say. Everything just… blended together after that. Not that I expect you to understand. It’s not like losing a good violin is the same as losing… well, her. But it’s been a while, definitely. A while of feeling… off.
DOCTOR: A year. And has this tiredness been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, mostly. Though some days are… less awful than others. Like a bad note that occasionally rings true. But yeah, generally, I’m just… dragging. Even after a full night. Which, admittedly, isn't always a full night. I tend to… drift off in front of the telly. Old habits, you see. Bad ones. Though what's the point of not drifting when there's nothing good on?
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I'm tired and a bit… deflated, as I've said. Do you need me to list all the ways I’m failing to live up to my potential? Honestly, I'm a musical instrument repairer, not a medical textbook. What sort of symptoms are you expecting? And frankly, I don’t understand why you’re asking all these… basic questions.
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, I am attempting to gather a complete medical history. Perhaps you have noticed changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? It comes and goes. Sometimes I eat like a horse, other times… not so much. Depends on the mood, really. It's not like I'm a particularly fussy eater. I’ll eat just about anything if it doesn't move too much. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I came here because I was told someone could help me feel less like a… worn-out tuning fork, not to be quizzed like a child.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you noticed any difficulties with your breathing?
PATIENT: Breathing? No. I breathe. Perfectly fine, thank you. I mean, I don't go running marathons, if that’s what you’re implying. But I can manage a flight of stairs without collapsing, so I assume my lungs are functioning adequately. Honestly, this is all rather… pointless. Are you a doctor, or an interrogator? Because you seem to be focusing on things that aren’t actually bothering me. What about the tiredness? Are we going to address that, or are we just going to catalogue my declining bodily functions?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's move on. I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. Just some basic neurological checks and listen to your heart and lungs. It won't take long.
PATIENT: Neurological checks? Listen to my… heart? Look, I came here for advice on sleep, not to be prodded and poked like a… well, like a broken cello. I’m a craftsman, not a specimen. Honestly, this is ridiculous. I’m starting to regret even coming. Is there anyone else I can speak to? Perhaps someone who actually listens instead of… examining?
DOCTOR: Mr. Redfern, I assure you, this is standard procedure. However, if you are unwilling to cooperate, I cannot provide you with any assistance. I suggest you schedule an appointment with a sleep specialist, as you requested. They may be more suited to your… concerns.
PATIENT: .
