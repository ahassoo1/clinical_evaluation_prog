DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. I'm Dr. Cumper. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I… well, I’ve gained weight, and I haven't been doing anything differently, so I thought it best to get it checked. It’s rather unsettling, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Unexplained weight gain can be unsettling. Let's try to get to the bottom of this. First, how long have you been noticing this weight gain?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It began, I believe, sometime in late February. Perhaps early March. I recall because the snow was still quite thick then. I hadn’t weighed myself regularly before, but my clothes began feeling… snug. And then, when I did step on the scale… well, it was a rather unpleasant surprise.
DOCTOR: Alright, so roughly six months. And would you say it's been a gradual increase, or more sudden?
PATIENT: Gradual, definitely gradual. Not like I woke up one morning significantly heavier. It’s been… a steady climb, if that makes sense. A pound here, a pound there. Enough to be concerning, though. I haven’t changed my eating habits, and I’m still… reasonably active for my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, reasonably active… could you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as an orderly at the hospital, so I’m on my feet quite a bit – lifting patients, making beds, things like that. It’s not strenuous exercise, mind you, but it keeps me moving. And I try to walk my dog, a small terrier named Rudi, for about thirty minutes each day, weather permitting, of course. Although, with the humidity lately… it’s been difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright, that gives me a good starting point. Now, let’s talk about your eating habits. You mentioned you haven’t changed them. Could you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well, breakfast is usually a small bowl of oatmeal with some berries. I prefer not to have much sugar. Lunch is generally a sandwich - perhaps turkey and cheese on whole wheat bread - and a small piece of fruit. And dinner… it varies. My husband, he likes to cook, so sometimes it’s fish with vegetables, other times it's chicken, potatoes, something like that. We rarely eat processed foods or fast food, and I always try to have a sensible portion. I do enjoy a small piece of dark chocolate after dinner, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds like a pretty healthy diet overall. Now, let's move on to some other things. Do you have any trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. I sleep quite soundly, usually about seven or eight hours a night. I’m always tired after work, naturally, but I don’t have any difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. My husband snores a little, but I’ve become accustomed to it over the years. I do wake once or twice to use the restroom, but that’s just… age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your energy levels?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I suppose… I am a little more tired than I used to be. It could just be the heat, as I said. But yes, I do find myself needing a little more rest in the evenings. Not debilitating, mind you, but noticeable. And it takes me a bit longer to recover after physical activity. It's… subtle, but it’s there.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits, or any unexplained constipation or diarrhea?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no. Everything is… regular, if you’ll excuse the bluntness. I haven't noticed any changes in that regard. I pride myself on a healthy digestive system, if that's of any comfort. My grandmother always said a good diet is key, and I’ve tried to follow her advice. It’s one of the few things I truly inherited from her, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, have you noticed any changes in your skin or hair?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve observed. My hair is… thinning, perhaps, but that’s just aging. I’ve noticed it’s getting more grey, naturally. And my skin… a little drier, maybe, but that’s the winter taking its toll, even now in August. I moisturize regularly, though. Nothing alarming, Doctor. Really. I try to be attentive to such things.
DOCTOR: Okay. Let's talk about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – anything at all?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, a rather unpleasant experience, but I’ve had no other surgeries. And I’ve never been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – no diabetes, no high blood pressure, no heart problems. I do have occasional migraines, but they are infrequent and manageable with over-the-counter medication. And I've had the usual childhood illnesses, of course - measles, mumps, chickenpox, but that was many years ago. I’m generally a very healthy person, Doctor, which is why this weight gain is so puzzling.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Any family history of weight gain, thyroid problems, or diabetes?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My mother… she struggled with her weight later in life, but it was primarily after menopause. She didn't have a diagnosed thyroid problem, as far as I know, but she did have a rather sluggish metabolism. My father, he was always thin as a rail, so no help there. And, to my knowledge, no one on either side of the family has had diabetes. Though, my aunt on my husband's side, she was… a bit of a recluse, so I don’t have much information about her health. I hope that's helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not currently. As I mentioned, I take over-the-counter pain relievers for my migraines occasionally - ibuprofen, that sort of thing. But that’s it. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. I believe in natural remedies, within reason, of course. I take a multivitamin occasionally, during the winter months, but that’s more for preventative health. Nothing else, Doctor. I assure you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Ms. Selbitschka, based on what you’ve told me, it does sound puzzling. Given the gradual onset of weight gain and the lack of other obvious symptoms, we need to rule out some potential causes. I’d like to do a physical exam and then order some blood work to check your thyroid levels, blood sugar, and a basic metabolic panel. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. I appreciate you taking this seriously. Yes, a physical exam and blood work sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgement. Let us proceed, then. I just hope it’s nothing serious. I have a rather busy schedule, you see, and I would hate to be sidelined by a medical issue. But I understand these things must be investigated thoroughly.
DOCTOR: Okay. Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here, I’ll get started with the physical exam. We’ll start with your height and weight, just to get a baseline, and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your thyroid. It shouldn’t take too long.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I understand. Please proceed at your own pace. I will do my best to remain still. I confess, I do have a slight aversion to medical examinations, but I trust you will be thorough and efficient. And hopefully, we will arrive at a diagnosis soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Selbitschka. Your height is 155 centimeters, and your weight is 83 kilograms. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to palpate your thyroid gland. Thyroid feels normal, no nodules or enlargement. Blood pressure is 130 over 80. And pulse is 72 and regular. Everything seems within normal limits physically, which is good. Now, we'll need to draw some blood to get a better look at what might be going on.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring to hear, Doctor. Thank you. A blood test, then. I suppose it's inevitable. I do dislike needles, if you don't mind my confessing. But I understand it's a necessary evil. Do you have a comfortable chair for me to sit in while it’s being done? And perhaps a cool compress, if I feel faint? I appreciate your consideration. I always find medical procedures… a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Selbitschka. We'll make you as comfortable as possible. We have a very comfortable chair right over here, and I'll have the nurse bring you a cool compress just in case. The phlebotomist is very skilled; she’ll be as gentle as possible. It really doesn’t take long. And I’ll be right here if you need anything at all. We'll just need a small sample for the tests, and then we'll send it off to the lab. It should be back within a few days. Let's get the nurse in here to get that started, okay?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you for your patience and understanding. I do appreciate it. Please, let me know if there is anything I should do to prepare. And… if the results are concerning, could I perhaps schedule another appointment as soon as possible? I prefer not to linger in uncertainty, if you understand.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Selbitschka. The nurse will explain the procedure to you. And yes, if the results are concerning, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment immediately to discuss them and formulate a plan. We'll contact you as soon as they are available. I'll leave you with the nurse now. I'll be in the office if you need anything.
