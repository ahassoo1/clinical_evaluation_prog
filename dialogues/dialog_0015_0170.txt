DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just need to get this life insurance thing done. They sent me over here for a check-up first, I guess. Don't really know what all they need to check, though.
DOCTOR: Life insurance physical, alright. Well, that's fairly straightforward. It's essentially a general health assessment to determine your risk profile. We'll want to go through your medical history, do a physical exam, and likely some blood work. Let's start with your medical history, shall we?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Uh… where do I start? I mean, I've had the usual stuff, I guess. Nothing major. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid. And… a broken arm once. Fell out of a tree. A long time ago. Is there a form I should be filling out? I'm not so good at remembering everything.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is a form, Mr. Putney. It would have been helpful if you'd had a chance to review it beforehand. However, we can go through it together. It covers past illnesses, surgeries – you've already mentioned those, thankfully – family history, medications, allergies… things like that. Let’s start with current medications. Are you taking anything regularly, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees. They bother me when it's cold. That's about it. And… vitamins, sometimes. Not every day, though. Just when I remember. Nothing serious, Doctor. I try to stay healthy.
DOCTOR: Alright, ibuprofen as needed for knee pain, and occasional vitamins. Do you know the dosage of the ibuprofen you typically take?
PATIENT: Uh… 200 milligrams, I think? The regular kind you get at the store. It's… two pills usually, when I take it. I don't take it that often, honestly. Maybe once or twice a month, if that.
DOCTOR: Two 200mg ibuprofen tablets as needed, approximately once or twice a month. And no allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat everything, pretty much. My wife used to complain about that. We’re divorced now, though. Sorry, didn't mean to bring that up. It’s just… I don't really have anyone to tell me about allergies anymore.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’re focusing on your health history, Mr. Putney. Divorces aren't relevant here. Now, let's move on to past medical history, beyond the tonsillectomy and broken arm. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, asthma…?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. The doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high once, a few years back, but he said it was probably just because I was stressed. Didn't give me any pills or anything. Just told me to relax more. Easier said than done, I guess. I mostly just try to ignore it.
DOCTOR: Alright. No formal diagnosis of hypertension. Let's discuss your family history then. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: My mom passed away a few years ago. Cancer. Lung cancer, I think. And my dad… he’s still around, but he’s pretty old. He lives back on the islands. Doesn’t really talk much about his health. Never has. It's hard to get information from him, even when he is feeling okay.
DOCTOR: Mother deceased, lung cancer. Father alive, limited health information available. Now, do you have any significant health concerns at the moment?
PATIENT: Just my knees, like I said. They ache a lot, especially when it’s cold or damp. And… sometimes I get a little short of breath when I walk up the stairs. Nothing too bad, though. I've been meaning to get it checked out, but… I keep putting it off. Life gets in the way, you know?
DOCTOR: Aching knees and occasional shortness of breath. How long have you been experiencing the shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Uh… a few months, maybe? It comes and goes. Sometimes I don't notice it at all. But when I do, it's… like I just can’t get enough air. It doesn't last long, though. A minute or two, usually. I just slow down and it goes away. It's probably just my weight, honestly. I could stand to lose a few pounds.
DOCTOR: You are somewhat overweight, Mr. Putney. 97 kilograms and 174 centimeters... We should address that. Now, let's proceed with a brief physical examination. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Yeah, sure. There we go. It's a little stiff this morning. Old age, I guess. What are you looking for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I'm assessing your general appearance, looking for any signs of distress. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your abdomen. Please try to relax. Your heart rate is a little elevated… and slightly irregular. Blood pressure is 145/90. That is elevated. Breath sounds are somewhat diminished bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, but there's some tenderness in the upper quadrants. Do you experience any pain here frequently?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… sometimes after I eat a big meal. It's just indigestion, I think. Like heartburn. It goes away pretty quickly. That spot feels a little sensitive, though. Maybe I did eat something bad last night. I can't remember what it was. It's hard to keep track of things sometimes.
DOCTOR: Intermittent abdominal discomfort. Given your elevated blood pressure, irregular heart rate, diminished breath sounds and abdominal tenderness, I think we need to order some blood work and a chest X-ray. This will help us determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. It’s unlikely to be indigestion. Do you have any allergies to contrast dyes?
PATIENT: Contrast dyes? Uh… I don’t think so. I've never had an X-ray before, I don't think. Never needed one. I try to avoid doctors as much as possible. What are you looking for with the X-ray, Doctor? Is it something serious? I just need this life insurance thing done, you know? I don't want to get involved in a big medical thing.
DOCTOR: Mr. Putney, the X-ray is standard procedure to evaluate your lungs and heart. It is not inherently serious, but it will help us determine if there is anything concerning going on. Given your shortness of breath and diminished breath sounds, we need to rule out any underlying pulmonary issues. As for the life insurance, these tests are necessary for them to assess your risk accurately. We’ll get the blood work ordered and the X-ray scheduled. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I guess not. Just… how long will this all take? I don't want to be stuck here all day. I have things to do. And... will they call me with the results? I don't really have a regular doctor to follow up with.
DOCTOR: The blood work will take a few hours to process. The X-ray can be scheduled for later today or tomorrow. Once the results are available, the clinic will contact you to discuss them. Given that you do not have a regular physician, I recommend a follow-up appointment with me to review the results and discuss a treatment plan. This is important, Mr. Putney. Now, let's get the lab requisition and X-ray order completed.
