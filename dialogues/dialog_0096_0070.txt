DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Seat. Good. Well, it’s… the new place, you see? Just moved here. Doctor told me I need to… check in. Social thing, I think? For old people. Medicare, they call it. Not sick, not really. Just… new.
DOCTOR: Right. A “check-in.” And you're 58, is that correct?
PATIENT: Fifty-eight. Yes. Though I feel… older some days, you know? It’s the stress of moving, I think. Boxes. So many boxes. And… people asking questions. Like you. No offense. Just… a lot.
DOCTOR: No offense taken, Mr. Szmyd. It’s my job to ask questions. Helps me get a picture of your overall health, even if you feel perfectly fine. So, let's start with this “feeling older.” Can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm. Describe… It’s… aches. Little aches. Everywhere. Not bad enough for pills, you understand. Just… there. And tired. Always a little tired. Like I used to be able to work all night on a show, and now… two hours, maybe? And the memory… not so good. I forget names, mostly. Important names. The usual old person things, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Right. Aches, fatigue, some memory issues. And how long have you been experiencing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Oh, goodness. A while. Since the move, definitely. But… before that too, maybe? It’s… hard to say. Things were busy. Lots of shows. Not much time to think about aches and tiredness. Maybe six months? A year? Time… it goes fast. Not very precise, sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. And these “shows” you mentioned… what kind of work did those involve?
PATIENT: Ah, the shows! Makeup. I do makeup. For the theatre, mostly. And some… performance art. Fancy costumes, lots of glitter. I used to travel with a company, all over. Now… not so much. Too much trouble. But I still do some local things. Small shows. School plays. That sort of thing. It keeps the hands busy, you see.
DOCTOR: So, you're on your feet a lot, working with… chemicals, potentially?
PATIENT: Chemicals? Well, yes. Paint, mostly. And powders. Lots of powders. And… things to make it stay on. But it's not… dangerous chemicals. It's makeup! The ladies wear it! It's not like I'm mixing poisons, you know. Though some of those actresses look like they have been poisoned, if you ask me. But that’s another story. Bad actors.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Let's talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any conditions – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Medical history… Oh, goodness. That was my wife’s job. She kept all the papers. I went to the doctor when she told me to. I… I think I had my blood pressure checked once. It was… normal, I think? Or maybe a little high? She got upset about it. I can’t really recall. Nothing serious. Never been in the hospital, not for anything big. Just… little things. A cold, maybe. I really don't pay much attention to those things. It's all very confusing.
DOCTOR: And what about any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. Let me think. There was… something with my knee, a long time ago. When I was young. Playing football, I think. They… fixed it. I don't remember much about it. It hurt for a while. And… I think my wife had me get a mole checked. On my back. But it was fine. Nothing to worry about. Small thing. Really. Old injuries, mostly. Not important. I've had more cuts from glitter, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter drugs?
PATIENT: Medications… Well, sometimes I take something for my stomach. It gets… upset. But it’s just something I buy at the store. A little white pill. Can’t remember the name. And… sometimes, when my knee acts up, I take something for the pain. But not often. Usually just a hot bath. Not much, really. I don’t like taking pills. They make me feel… strange. And my wife always said I was bad about remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don’t think so. Never been allergic to anything. Maybe dust? I sneeze sometimes. But everyone sneezes, right? I used to work with a lot of different things, on the shows. Paints, powders, fabrics… never had a reaction. I suppose if I was allergic to something, I’d know about it. Wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just to get a baseline. Could you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Stand up? Oh, my… It’s a little… stiff today. Not my best day for standing, I’m afraid. But alright. What do you want me to do? Just… stand here? Careful, now. Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds… regular, but a little fast. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Reflexes are a bit diminished. And you have some mild swelling in your ankles. Your weight is also a bit higher than it should be. Now, can you walk a few steps for me?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… not so good. It’s a little… painful, you know? In the knee. And the ankles… they always bother me. Especially after standing. I told you, old bones. Not what they used to be. Don't push me too hard, doctor. I’m not a young man anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it sounds like you're experiencing some age-related wear and tear. The aches, fatigue, some memory issues… it’s not uncommon. The swelling in your ankles and your weight also suggest some possible early signs of… congestion. It's not a serious condition, yet, but it’s something we need to keep an eye on.
PATIENT: Congestion? Like… a stuffy nose? I don’t have a stuffy nose. I thought you said it was old bones? Now it’s congestion? It’s all very confusing, doctor. I just wanted a check-up, not a lecture. What does this mean, exactly? Do I need pills? I really don’t want pills.
DOCTOR: No, not a stuffy nose, Mr. Szmyd. Congestion refers to fluid buildup. And yes, age-related wear and tear contributes to it. We need to rule out any underlying issues. I’m going to order some blood work – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid test. We should also get an EKG to check your heart rhythm. And I want you to start a low-sodium diet and try to get some gentle exercise, like walking, when you can. No strenuous activity. As for pills, let's see what the tests show first. But frankly, Mr. Szmyd, you could benefit from losing some weight and being more active. That's the best medicine, if you ask me. I'll have the nurse schedule you for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Blood work… tests… diet… exercise… It’s a lot, doctor. So much. Low sodium… what does that mean? No salt? I like salt. I suppose… I understand. I’ll try. But I’m not very good at following instructions, if I’m honest. And I really don’t want to give up salt. Can the nurse… explain everything again? Maybe slower? And is there… a pamphlet? Something I can read? This is all very… stressful. Perhaps a nice cup of tea would help.
DOCTOR: The nurse will explain everything. And yes, there are pamphlets. I'll have her bring them to you. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients to see. Try to remember everything we discussed, Mr. Szmyd. It’s important.
