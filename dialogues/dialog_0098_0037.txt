DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Kilton. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is very nice to meet you too. Well, I have been… how you say… wheezing. It is not good. It makes it hard to breathe sometimes.
DOCTOR: Wheezing, alright. And you said it's making it hard to breathe?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Not all the time, but when I walk, or… if I try to do too much. I used to be very strong, you know. I was an athletic trainer for many years. But now… the wheezing comes. It is… worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's certainly concerning when a change like that happens, especially when it impacts your activity level. You mentioned it happens when you walk or exert yourself… Has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradually getting worse over time?
PATIENT: Hmm. That is a good question. I think… gradually. Maybe a few months now. At first, it was just when I climbed the stairs. Then walking to the store. Now… even just a little bit of garden work. I do not push myself too hard, but still.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few months of gradually worsening wheezing with exertion. And you said it started with stairs, then walking, now even gardening… Have you noticed anything else that seems to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Let me think… sometimes when the air is very warm and sticky. Like yesterday, it was bad. And… dust. If I am cleaning, and there is a lot of dust, it makes me cough and wheeze.
DOCTOR: Warm, sticky air and dust seem to be triggers. That's helpful to know. Have you had a fever, chills, or any chest pain along with the wheezing?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, no chills. And no pain in my chest. Just… the feeling like I cannot get enough air. It is… scary sometimes.
DOCTOR: I understand that must be frightening. Alright, so no fever, no chills, no chest pain, just shortness of breath and wheezing. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with asthma or COPD, or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I have not. I have always been very healthy. I have had… the usual colds, of course, but nothing serious. I never needed to see a specialist for my lungs before.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior diagnoses of lung conditions. Have you ever smoked, or been exposed to a lot of smoke growing up, or in your work?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I never smoke. And my parents did not smoke either. In my work, sometimes there was… spray from the field, but not much. I always tried to stay away from it.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking history or significant smoke exposure. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have, or any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Well, my knees are not what they used to be. Arthritis, the doctor says. And I take something for that… a little white pill. I think it is called… meloxicam? Yes, meloxicam. That is the name. Other than that, I am pretty healthy, for my age.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis in your knees treated with meloxicam. That’s good to know. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I have never had a reaction to anything. I can eat anything, take any medicine… well, except for that one time I had a bad stomach ache, but that was just a bad apple, I think. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies and only meloxicam for your arthritis. Now, I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen level, if that's alright with you. Then we can talk about what might be going on and what we can do about it. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Listening to my lungs… yes, please. I hope you can hear what is wrong!
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just sit up straight on the examination table, that would be perfect. I'm going to listen to your breathing with my stethoscope. It might be a little cool on your skin. Okay... I do hear some wheezing, as you described, mostly on both sides, but a little more prominent on the right. Your breathing rate is a bit elevated, but not dangerously so. Oxygen saturation is 93%, which is a little low, but not critically so. I'd also like to check your heart rate and blood pressure. Heart rate is normal, blood pressure is slightly elevated, but within an acceptable range. Overall, everything seems stable, but the wheezing is definitely something we need to investigate further.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That sounds… serious. What does it mean? Is it my lungs? What can we do? I get very worried when I cannot breathe.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Mrs. Kilton. The wheezing suggests there's some narrowing in your airways. It could be a number of things, and we need to figure out which one it is. Given your history, it's most likely either asthma – even though you haven't had it diagnosed before, it can develop at any age – or COPD, which is often linked to smoking, but can also occur in people who've had significant exposure to irritants. It could also be bronchitis, which is an inflammation of the airways. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to rule out any other causes, like pneumonia or fluid in your lungs. I also want to do a spirometry test, which measures how much air you can breathe in and out and how quickly you can do it. That will help us assess the function of your lungs. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: X-ray and a… what did you say? Spirometry? Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If it helps you find out what is wrong, then yes, please. I do not want to be short of breath all the time. But… will it hurt?
DOCTOR: No, neither of them will hurt at all. The chest X-ray is just a quick picture of your lungs, like a photograph. You'll just stand or sit in front of the machine, and it takes a few seconds. As for the spirometry test, you'll just breathe into a tube connected to a machine. The technician will give you instructions, and it’s just about taking deep breaths. It takes about 10-15 minutes, and it will tell us how well your lungs are working. I'll write the orders for those tests now, and the nurse will schedule them for you. While we wait for the results, I’m going to prescribe you a short course of a bronchodilator inhaler. It helps to open up your airways and make it easier to breathe. It’s a common medication, and it can provide some relief while we figure out the underlying cause. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A little tube to breathe into… and a spray? Yes, Doctor. That sounds… helpful. If it will make it easier to breathe, then yes, please. I trust you. What does the spray do, exactly? And… is it safe? I worry about side effects.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question, Mrs. Kilton. The inhaler contains a medication called albuterol, which is a bronchodilator. It works by relaxing the muscles around your airways, which opens them up and allows more air to flow in and out of your lungs. It’s very safe for most people. The most common side effects are a slightly faster heartbeat or some shaking, but those usually go away quickly. I’ll prescribe a low dose to start, and we can adjust it if needed. The nurse will show you how to use it correctly before you leave. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment in about a week to discuss the results of the X-ray and spirometry test and see how you’re responding to the inhaler. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or any other concerning symptoms, please go to the emergency room immediately. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Albuterol… and to go to the hospital if it gets worse. I understand. And the nurse will show me how to use the spray. Thank you. You have been very kind and… patient with me. I feel a little better knowing we are doing something to find out what is wrong.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mrs. Kilton. That’s my job, and I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. It’s always best to address these concerns proactively. I’ll have the nurse come in to review the instructions for the inhaler and schedule those tests for you. Do you have any other questions for me before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… that is all for now. Thank you again. You are a very good doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very kind to say so, Mrs. Kilton. Just remember to take it easy, and don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. I’ll see you in a week.
PATIENT: .
