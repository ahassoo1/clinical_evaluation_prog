DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away, and my heart… it hasn’t been feeling its best lately either. It's a bit of a worry, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough and some heart concerns. Let's start with the cough. How long have you had it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… it’s been… nearly three weeks now, I’d say. Maybe a little longer. It started as just a tickle, really. But now it’s… deeper. And I get winded easily with it, even just walking to the kitchen.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, and getting deeper with some shortness of breath. Okay. Is the cough producing any mucus?
PATIENT: Yes, it is. It’s… mostly clear, but sometimes it’s a little bit… frothy. White, mostly. And in the mornings, it’s a bit worse, you know? More of it. I have to clear my throat a lot. It’s quite bothersome, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, clear to white mucus, worse in the mornings. Do you have any other symptoms along with the cough?
PATIENT: Well, I've been feeling a bit tired, more tired than usual. And my ankles… they’ve been swelling up a bit. Not terribly, but enough that I noticed. I have to put my feet up in the evenings. Oh, and sometimes I feel a little… fluttery in my chest, like a little bird is trapped in there. It doesn’t last long, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, ankle swelling, and those flutters in your chest. Let's talk about those flutters for a moment. Do they happen with activity, or just at rest?
PATIENT: Mostly at rest, I think. Or when I’m just… sitting quietly. Not when I’m moving around too much. It's hard to say for sure, I don't go doing much running around these days! But I'd say more when I'm relaxing. They don't hurt, just… unsettling. Like a little skip in my heartbeat.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsettling skips when resting. Now, let's move onto your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My heart… the doctor, a long time ago, told me I have something called… congestive heart failure. It’s been years, though. And I take medicine for it, every day. And I used to have high blood pressure, but that’s been pretty well controlled with pills too. I also had a bit of trouble with my kidneys a while back, but that’s been stable for a long time, thankfully. I’m trying to remember if there was anything else…
DOCTOR: Okay, congestive heart failure, controlled high blood pressure, and a history of kidney trouble. That’s helpful. And you’re currently taking medication for your heart condition, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. I take… let me see if I can remember the name… it’s a white pill, small… it’s called… Digoxin, I think. And a water pill too, to get rid of the extra water. Furosemide, that’s it! I take both every morning. I haven't changed the dose of either one, not recently.
DOCTOR: Okay, Digoxin and Furosemide, same doses recently. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat just about everything, and I've taken all sorts of pills over the years, and never had a problem. My skin gets a little itchy sometimes, but that’s just from the dry air, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, let’s talk a bit about your family. Is there a history of heart disease, lung problems, or kidney problems in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother… she had a weak heart, near the end. She was always tired, and she ended up in the hospital a lot. And my brother, he had high blood pressure, like me. And my cousin, on my father's side, he had some trouble with his kidneys. So, yes, there’s a bit of heart trouble and kidney problems in the family, you see. Not much lung trouble though, thankfully. They all lived to a good old age, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, and kidney problems. And finally, let's briefly discuss your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Never touched a cigarette in my life! My husband, he used to smoke, but he quit years and years ago. I always told him it was bad for his health, and he finally listened. I do enjoy a little bit of wine with my dinner sometimes, but just a small glass. Nothing excessive, you understand. And I mostly stay at home these days, quiet and comfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional wine, and mostly at home. That’s very helpful, Nadene. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just be gentle, if you would, my bones aren't what they used to be!
DOCTOR: Of course, Nadene. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Okay. I hear a bit of crackling in your lungs, especially on the lower lobes, and your heart sounds a little bit… irregular. I also notice some swelling in your ankles, as you mentioned. It’s mild to moderate, but it’s there. Your blood pressure is 150/90 today, which is a bit elevated. And your pulse is irregular, around 88 beats per minute. I'm going to check your oxygen saturation with this clip on your finger... 92%. That’s a little low, but not critically so.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound very good, does it? The crackling… is that bad? I thought I was just a bit congested. And my blood pressure… it’s usually better than that, I think. 92%… that's lower than usual too. What does all this mean, Doctor? Is it my heart getting worse?
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried, Nadene. The crackling in your lungs suggests there’s some fluid buildup, which can be common with congestive heart failure. Your elevated blood pressure and irregular pulse also point in that direction. The lower oxygen saturation confirms that you’re not getting enough oxygen, likely due to the fluid in your lungs. It's possible your heart condition is worsening, and that’s what we need to investigate further. I’d like to order a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of your lungs and heart. I also want to order a blood test to check your kidney function and look for a marker called BNP, which is elevated in heart failure. An EKG will also be helpful to assess the irregularity of your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. Anything to find out what’s going on. X-ray, blood test, EKG… whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better, you know? I’m getting tired of feeling like I’m always out of breath. Will these tests tell me what’s causing all this? And will I have to stay in the hospital?
DOCTOR: Those tests will give us a much clearer picture of what’s causing your symptoms, Nadene. The X-ray will show us how much fluid is in your lungs and the size of your heart. The blood tests will assess your kidney function and confirm if your heart failure is worsening. The EKG will help us identify the type of irregular heartbeat you're experiencing. Whether or not you'll need to stay in the hospital depends on the results of these tests. If the fluid buildup is severe, or your kidney function is significantly impaired, you may need to be admitted for treatment and monitoring. However, it's also possible we can manage your condition with medication adjustments and close follow-up as an outpatient. I’ll order these tests right away. The nurse will come in shortly to draw your blood and then we'll get you scheduled for the chest X-ray and EKG. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results. I don't like being in the dark, you know? And thank you for listening to me. I appreciate your kindness.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Nadene. I understand your concern, and I assure you I’ll let you know the results as soon as they’re available. The nurse will be in shortly, and I’ll be reviewing your results personally as soon as they come back. For now, try to rest and take it easy. If you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. It was nice meeting you, Nadene.
