DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh, my… well, it's the pain, really. Down low. In my abdomen. It comes and goes, but when it does come… it's quite severe. I believe that’s what prompted the visit. It’s been… troubling me. Though, truthfully, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I hope that doesn't make things too difficult.
DOCTOR: Certainly not, Ms. Glymph. It’s quite common for memory to change as we get older. We’ll take things at your pace. Could you describe the pain a bit more?
PATIENT: Oh, well… it’s difficult to put into words, you know? It’s not… a constant ache. It feels like a cramping, a very tight squeezing. And sometimes… like a sharp stabbing, though not always. It seems to come in waves, really. And it’s… lower down, as I mentioned. Towards my… well, the front. I think it’s on the lower right side, but I’m not entirely certain. It all blurs together after a while, you see. Do you… need me to be more specific? I apologize if I’m rambling.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Glymph. You're describing it perfectly well. The cramping and sharp stabbing sensation, lower abdominal pain... that’s helpful. And it’s alright if you’re unsure of the exact location. When did this pain start?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that is a difficult question. Honestly, it feels like it’s been… a long time. Perhaps… a few months ago? It started gradually, just a little discomfort, easy to dismiss. But it’s become more frequent and more intense lately, which is why I decided to come in. I do recall a particularly bad episode just last week… it kept me up most of the night. Before that… it’s all rather fuzzy. I was hoping you might have some idea of when it began based on… well, anything I've told you?
DOCTOR: That’s understandable. A few months of gradual onset, worsening pain, and a particularly bad episode last week – that gives us something to work with. Now, have you noticed anything that makes the pain better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… I do find that lying down helps somewhat. A warm compress, too. Just a little bit, mind you, it doesn’t make it disappear entirely. As for what makes it worse… eating seems to aggravate it sometimes, especially… richer foods, perhaps? And… movement. Definitely movement. Walking, bending… anything strenuous. I try to avoid that when I can, but… well, one has to do things, doesn’t one? I haven't noticed anything specific that always triggers it, though. It seems rather… unpredictable, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable pain is certainly frustrating. Lying down and warm compresses providing some relief, and eating and movement making it worse… alright. Ms. Glymph, have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the pain?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… now that you mention it. There’s been… a bit of fatigue, I suppose. More so than usual, anyway. I do tire easily. And… well, I’ve noticed some changes in my… bowel habits. Nothing too alarming, but… not quite regular, if you understand what I mean. And, on occasion, I’ve felt a little… nauseous. Not vomiting, just… queasy. It comes and goes. I believe that's all, but honestly, I could be forgetting something. My doctor, before… he mentioned something about… my system being a bit… unstable. Does that sound familiar?
DOCTOR: Fatigue, changes in bowel habits, occasional nausea... that’s all important information. And yes, I do see a note in your chart about some previous discussion of gastrointestinal instability. Ms. Glymph, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me think… I don't believe so. I've never had a… reaction, shall we say, to any medication I've been given. Though I do try to avoid taking anything unless absolutely necessary. It all feels… harsh on my system. I do recall being a little… sensitive to a certain antibiotic as a child, but that was a very long time ago. I'm quite certain it wouldn't be relevant now. I haven’t taken anything new recently, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known medication allergies. That's helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, not currently. As I said, I avoid medication when possible. I take a multivitamin occasionally, just to be on the safe side, but that's it. Nothing for pain, nothing regular. I've been trying to manage things on my own with rest and… well, trying not to overdo it. I did use a heating pad for the pain, but that's not a medication, is it?
DOCTOR: No, a heating pad isn’t a medication. Ms. Glymph, I'd like to ask about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a bit of a daunting question. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. Let me think… I was diagnosed with… lupus, I believe. Some years ago now. Systemic lupus erythematosus, I think the doctor called it. And… arthritis, too. Rheumatoid arthritis, perhaps? It affects my joints, mostly. And… I believe there was something else. Something to do with my… kidneys, perhaps? It's all rather vague, I apologize. I do have a file somewhere, with all the details, but I haven’t looked at it in… a very long time.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Glymph. Lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and a possible kidney condition – that is very important information, and it explains quite a bit. Don’t worry about the details if you’re unsure. And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think… I had my appendix removed, many years ago, when I was quite young. A rather simple procedure, thankfully. And… I believe I had a… joint replacement, in my knee. Perhaps ten years ago? It helped for a while, but it’s started to bother me again recently. Other than that… I don’t recall any other surgeries. Nothing major, at least. It's all so long ago, you see. I'm afraid my medical history is a bit… fragmented.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. Appendectomy and a knee replacement – that’s good to know. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history, if that’s alright. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… yes. My mother had arthritis, quite severely. Rheumatoid arthritis, I believe, the same as me. And… my brother had heart problems, I recall. A rather sudden thing, unfortunately. And… my grandmother, on my mother's side, had diabetes. Type 2, I think. Other than that… I'm not really sure. My family wasn't very forthcoming with medical information, if you understand what I mean. It was… a sensitive subject, perhaps.
DOCTOR: Alright, arthritis, heart problems, and diabetes in your family. That’s helpful. Finally, before we move on to an exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, my lifestyle… well, it's rather… quiet these days, I'm afraid. I live alone, in a small apartment. I don’t have any… demanding hobbies, shall we say. I enjoy reading, mostly. And… watching documentaries. I try to eat a healthy diet, but it’s difficult sometimes, with the pain. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol. I used to walk more, but… with the arthritis and the lupus, it’s become rather difficult. I try to stay active, but it’s a challenge, you see. A very gentle pace is all I can manage these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Glymph. That gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Please, proceed. I understand you need to do what you need to do. Just… be gentle, if you would be so kind. My joints are rather sensitive, you see. And… I might flinch if you touch my abdomen. Not intentionally, of course. It’s just… a bit tender.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Glymph. I will be as gentle as possible. I will start by listening to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll feel your abdomen. Please let me know immediately if anything is too uncomfortable. Your heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear. I’m noticing some tenderness in your lower right abdomen. It's not a rigid abdomen, but there is discomfort upon palpation. I also note some mild swelling in your right ankle. Can you tell me if you’ve noticed that swelling before?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… the ankle. I have noticed that swelling, intermittently. It comes and goes. Sometimes it's hardly noticeable, other times… it’s quite prominent. I assumed it was just… the arthritis, flaring up. It often affects my joints, you see. I hadn’t thought to mention it, as it didn’t seem particularly… significant. It’s not painful, usually. Just… swollen. And warm, perhaps? I'm not entirely sure. I apologize for not mentioning it sooner. I sometimes forget what's important and what isn’t, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Glymph. Any change in swelling is good information. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, the tenderness in your lower right abdomen, the intermittent swelling in your ankle, and your history of lupus and arthritis, several possibilities come to mind. It could be a flare-up of your lupus affecting the gastrointestinal system, a musculoskeletal issue causing referred pain, or potentially something else. To help narrow things down, I'd like to order some blood work and a urine analysis. The blood work will check for inflammation, kidney function, and rule out any infections. The urine analysis will help assess kidney function and look for any signs of infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. Blood work and a urine analysis… I’m happy to have them done. I understand you need to investigate thoroughly. I trust your judgment. I do hope it’s nothing too serious. But… well, one must be prepared, mustn’t one? When would I be able to have these tests done? And… will they be painful? I apologize for asking so many questions. I just… worry, you see.
DOCTOR: You're not asking too many questions at all, Ms. Glymph. It’s perfectly normal to worry. The blood draw and urine analysis can be done right here in the clinic today. The blood draw will cause a brief pinch, but it's usually very quick. The urine sample is non-invasive, you’ll simply provide a sample. Once the results are back, which usually takes a few days, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a mild anti-inflammatory medication to help manage the abdominal pain. It's important to take it with food, as it can sometimes cause stomach upset. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… very acceptable, Doctor. An anti-inflammatory medication and a follow-up appointment once the results are back. Take it with food… I will certainly remember that. I do have a rather sensitive stomach, you see. And… thank you. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. It… eases my mind, knowing that you’re taking this seriously. Will I receive instructions on where to go for the tests? And… do I need to fast before the blood work?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. That’s my job. Yes, you do need to fast for eight hours before the blood work. That means no food or drinks, except water. The nurse will provide you with specific instructions, along with a lab requisition form. She’ll also show you where the lab is located. I'll also have her print out a list of potential symptoms to watch out for in the meantime, particularly any fever, severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or changes in bowel movements. If you experience any of those, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so, Doctor. You've been exceptionally thorough. The fasting instructions, and the list of symptoms… that’s very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to address all my concerns. I suppose… I’m just a bit anxious, waiting for the results. But knowing that you’re on the case… that’s reassuring. Thank you again, Doctor Rakosky. I shall see you at the follow-up appointment.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. Don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. We're here to help. Get some rest, and take care of yourself.
PATIENT: It was a pleasure meeting you as well, Doctor.
