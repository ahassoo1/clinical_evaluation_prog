DOCTOR: Right. Ms. Hughston, yes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that's me. Lytisha. It's… nice to meet you, Dr. Memmolo, I think that’s how you say it? I get names mixed up sometimes, you see.
DOCTOR: Memmolo, yes. And it’s fine, many people do. Let’s not dwell on introductions. So, Ms. Hughston, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, the nice lady on the phone said something about a… test? A drug test, I believe. Medicare wanted me to get it done, something about… keeping track of things. I don't really remember all the details, honestly. It's all a bit of a blur. Is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: A drug test… Medicare can be… insistent. It’s likely part of your wellness visit. Although, truthfully, I don’t have the full details myself. Are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Hughston?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I take something for my… knees, I think. A little white pill. And sometimes something for the pain, when it flares up. But I can’t recall the names, not at all. My daughter usually keeps track of those things for me. She’s good with that sort of detail.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s… less than ideal. Do you have a list anywhere?
PATIENT: Hmm… I used to, maybe? In the kitchen, perhaps? Or with my paperwork… Honestly, Doctor, I'm really not good with remembering things like that. It just slips my mind. Would it be alright if I called my daughter? She'd know right away. She's usually home around this time.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Hughston, with all due respect, we're trying to conduct a consultation here. Relying entirely on your daughter isn’t… efficient. Do you recall anything about these medications?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I’m sorry. It's not that I want to be difficult, it's just... they’re little pills, you know? One’s for the aching, and one's… to help me sleep sometimes. I think the sleep one is pink. I get them refilled at the pharmacy down the street. That's all I really know, I promise. It's a bit embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Right. A pink pill for sleep, and a white pill for… aches. Vague, but… acceptable, I suppose. Alright. Let’s move on. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Not that I know of, no. I haven’t had a bad reaction to anything in a long, long time. Maybe a little bit of a sniffle when the pollen is bad in the spring, but that’s just… seasonal, I think. Nothing serious. I don't think so, anyway. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Minimally. Very well. I’m going to conduct a brief physical exam. Just a quick check of your vitals and listen to your heart and lungs. Please sit back and relax.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Sounds good. I do get a little… nervous around doctors, if I'm being honest. My heart always races a bit. But I'll try to relax. Is it going to be… cold? I always feel the cold.
DOCTOR: It won't be cold, Ms. Hughston. Blood pressure is… elevated. 150 over 90. Heart rate is also elevated, 88 and a bit irregular. Lungs sound… clear, but you’re breathing rather shallowly. Do you experience any shortness of breath, Ms. Hughston?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. Is that bad? Elevated… I don’t know what that means. No, not usually… but I do get a bit winded when I'm working. You know, with the paving. It's heavy work. And sometimes when I climb the stairs, but that's just… getting old, I guess. I’ve always been a bit… breathless, if I’m being honest. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: Right. So, you perform heavy physical labor despite experiencing shortness of breath. That’s… less than ideal. Tell me about this “paving”. What exactly do you do?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I operate the equipment. You know, the big rollers and tampers? I smooth out the asphalt, make sure it's level. I’ve been doing it for… a long time now. Since my husband passed, actually. He taught me everything. It keeps me busy, keeps my mind off things. It's good work, physical, you know? But it is heavy. And dusty, sometimes. Does that make sense? I mostly just drive and make sure it’s all… flat.
DOCTOR: Asphalt work, shortness of breath, elevated blood pressure and heart rate… It’s becoming clear we have several concerns here. Ms. Hughston, have you ever been diagnosed with any heart conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not that I recall. The doctors always told me my heart was… strong, actually. But that was a long time ago. I did have a bit of… fluttering sometimes, when I was younger. They said it was just nerves. But never anything serious. I don’t think so. It's hard to remember, you know? Things get… muddled. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, a long time, actually.
DOCTOR: Right. It appears we need to establish a baseline for your cardiac health. I am ordering an EKG and a chest x-ray. And I would like you to schedule a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist as soon as possible.
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness. That sounds… serious. An EKG… and a chest x-ray? Is something wrong, Doctor? And a… a cardiologist? I just came in for a drug test, I thought. Is this because of the paving? I can retire, you know. I don't need to keep working. Just tell me straight, is everything alright? I get so anxious when I don’t know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hughston, your vital signs are elevated, and you've disclosed a physically demanding occupation despite experiencing symptoms that warrant further investigation. It's prudent to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. This is not an emergency, but it is something we need to address proactively. I’m going to order these tests as a precaution. Now, about this drug test… we’ll get to that as soon as we have a clearer picture of your overall health. Don’t worry unnecessarily. We’ll take things one step at a time.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. One step at a time. Yes, that sounds… good. It’s just… a lot to take in. And I really didn’t want to cause any trouble. I just needed a piece of paper for Medicare. Do I need to do anything special for the tests? And where do I go? I don’t drive much anymore, my daughter usually takes me. I’ll have to call her… This is all so… stressful.
DOCTOR: The order contains all the necessary information, including the location and any preparatory instructions. You will need to schedule the appointment yourself or have your daughter do so. The lab is located at St. Joseph's Hospital. Please follow up with the cardiologist as soon as possible. And please, Ms. Hughston, try not to worry unnecessarily. Now, if there is nothing else… I have other patients waiting.
