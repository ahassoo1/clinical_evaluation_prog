DOCTOR: Hello, Venna. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. My blood pressure's been a little high, that's what the nurse said when she took it. I don't really know much about it, to be honest. Just want to get it checked, I guess. Don't want any trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good you're getting it checked. High blood pressure is very common, and we can definitely take a look. It's good to be proactive. The nurse did mention it was a bit elevated. Do you know what your usual blood pressure readings are, if you’ve had it checked before?
PATIENT: No, not really. I don't go to the doctor much. My husband, bless his heart, he always took care of all that. Been a few years since I had it checked, I reckon. Everything was fine then, I suppose. I mostly just bake. Makes people happy, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s lovely, baking is wonderful. It does make people happy. And it's perfectly alright if it's been a while. We'll just get a good baseline reading now, and see what's going on. Now, when you say everything was fine before, do you remember when that was, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… maybe… five years ago? No, more than that. Before my Harold passed, I think. That was… seven years ago this fall. So, maybe eight years ago, give or take? I'm not good with dates anymore.
DOCTOR: Eight years ago is fine, that gives us a starting point. Now, have you been feeling any symptoms lately that might be related to your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm… not that I know of. I get a little tired sometimes, but I'm ninety years old! I figure that's just part of gettin' old. Maybe a little bit of a headache now and then, but nothing I haven't had before. I mostly just feel… normal, I guess. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Venna. It’s good you're not experiencing anything alarming. Feeling "normal" is good! A little fatigue at your age is very common. Okay. I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better overall picture. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your pulse. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Go right ahead. Don't mind me, I've had doctors pokein' and proddin' me my whole life. Just try to be gentle, okay? These old bones ain't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I’ll be as careful as possible. Okay, heart sounds are regular, but a little bit… strong. Lungs are clear, good and open. Your pulse is a bit fast, actually. Not alarmingly so, but faster than I’d like to see. I’m also going to check your ankles for any swelling. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Check away. Swellin', you say? No, I don't think so. I wear comfy shoes, always have. Don't like tight shoes. Harold always said I had a shoe problem. Too many pairs! But no, I haven't noticed any swellin'.
DOCTOR: No significant swelling, you're right. Ankles feel good and firm. Okay, that’s good. Now, have you had any changes in your vision lately?
PATIENT: Vision? Hmm… not really. It's not the best, never has been. I need my glasses to read, of course. And things get a little blurry when I'm lookin' at somethin' far away. But that's just age, I suppose. Haven't noticed anything different lately, no. I mostly just bake, remember? Don't need perfect vision to measure flour!
DOCTOR: That's right, you mostly bake! And you're right, baking doesn't require perfect vision. Okay, good. And how about your kidneys?
PATIENT: Kidneys? Oh, goodness. What do you want to know about my kidneys? I don't even know where they are! I haven't been havin' any trouble… goin' to the bathroom, if that's what you mean. Everything's pretty normal there, too. I'm sorry, Doctor, I'm not much help with this medical stuff. I just know I'm old and my blood pressure was a little high.
DOCTOR: You're doing perfectly fine, Venna, truly. You don’t need to know where your kidneys are! I just ask because sometimes high blood pressure can affect the kidneys. You said you’re not having any trouble with urination?
PATIENT: No trouble at all. Everything's regular. Go when I need to go, same as always. Not too much, not too little. Just… normal. I drink plenty of water, though. Always have. Harold always said I was part fish. Is that helpful? I'm tryin' to answer your questions, but I just don't understand all this medical talk.
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, thank you. Knowing you're drinking plenty of water is good. And "normal" is a very good answer. Okay. One last thing, Venna. Have you had any falls recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, not recently. I haven’t fallen in… well, it’s been a long time. A few stumbles here and there, when I get up too fast, but no full-on falls. I’m careful. Always holdin' onto somethin'. Harold used to worry about me, but I'm pretty steady on my feet, for an old lady. This helps, you know? Gives me a little extra support.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And it’s very smart to use your cane for support. Okay. Based on what you've told me, and the quick exam, your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your pulse is a bit fast. It doesn’t sound like anything immediately urgent, but we definitely need to investigate further. I want to order some blood work and a urine test. That will help us rule out any underlying causes and see how well your kidneys are functioning. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. If you think it’s best. Blood work and a urine test. Okay. I can do that. Just tell me where to go, and what I need to do. And how long it’ll take? I have a batch of peach cobbler I need to get in the oven this afternoon. Don't want to let my customers down, you know? They depend on me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We wouldn’t want to disappoint your customers! The lab is just down the hall, room 203. The nurse will give you the paperwork, and they’ll draw a small sample of blood, and you’ll give a urine sample. It shouldn’t take more than an hour or so. I’ll have the results sent to me, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them once they’re back. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: An hour? Yes, that should be alright. I can manage an hour. Follow-up appointment… yes, that sounds good. Just let me know when you're free. And thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with an old lady. I appreciate it. Now, if you'll excuse me, I best get back to my kitchen. That cobbler isn't going to bake itself.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Venna. It’s my pleasure. And you're right, that cobbler isn't going to bake itself! Let the nurse know you’re ready to go to the lab, and she’ll get you all set up. We’ll get this figured out. And enjoy your baking! Do you have a favorite recipe you'd like to share?
PATIENT: Oh, bless your heart. Thank you for the offer of help. I'm pretty steady, but I appreciate it. And favorite recipe? That's a hard one! I've been bakin' for so long, I've lost count. But my peach cobbler is pretty special, if I do say so myself. It's my grandmother's recipe, passed down through generations. I think the secret is a little bit of almond extract. Now, I really must be going. Don't want to keep you any longer. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been a lifesaver.
DOCTOR: It was lovely meeting you, Venna. Enjoy your baking, and we'll see you at your follow-up appointment. Take care!
