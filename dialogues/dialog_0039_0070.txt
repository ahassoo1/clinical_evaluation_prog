DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Szmyd. Welcome. I'm Dr. Kamahele. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, hello. Yes, nice to meet you too, Doctor… Kamahele, is it? Something about… new place. I moved here, you see. Just checking things… you know. Social thing. Medicare wants me to. Not sick, exactly. Just… new.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It's always good to establish a primary care physician when you move, and Medicare often encourages that. That’s perfectly alright. So, just to clarify, you’re mainly here for a general check-up, since you're new to the area?
PATIENT: Check-up… yes, that sounds right. I do a lot of… faces. Makeup, for the theatre. Lots of people need faces, you know? Not my face, mostly. Others. Is that… important? I don't get sick much.
DOCTOR: That's interesting work, Mr. Szmyd! So you do makeup for the theatre?
PATIENT: Yes, yes! Very important work. Making people… presentable. Beautiful, sometimes. Or scary! Depends on the play. Used to be a big theatre back home, you know. Much bigger. This town… smaller. Not so many faces to fix.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, it sounds like you're quite skilled. It’s good to hear you’re keeping busy. And it’s good you’re establishing care with us. Now, just to get a better picture of your overall health… have you been feeling well generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Hmm… I eat. I sleep. Sometimes my back… a little sore. From bending over faces, you know? All day. But I'm old. Old people get sore backs. It's normal. Nothing wrong with it.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Mr. Szmyd. Sore backs are very common, especially with work that involves a lot of bending. We should definitely take a look at that. And it’s good you're aware of your body. Just to be thorough, can you tell me a little more about the soreness?
PATIENT: More? It… aches. Mostly lower back. Like someone left a heavy thing there. Not always. When I’m working a lot, it’s worse. Sitting for long times, you know? Making faces. It’s… hard to explain. It’s just a back. Everybody has backs.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining perfectly well, Mr. Szmyd. It’s helpful to know it’s related to your work and sitting for long periods. Does the pain radiate down your legs at all?
PATIENT: Radiate? What does that… mean? Down my legs? They don’t… shine. They’re just legs. Old legs. They walk. Sometimes they ache a little too, but… not a lot. It's all connected, probably. Everything aches when you get old.
DOCTOR: You're right to ask – I apologize for using a word you might not be familiar with. “Radiate” just means does the pain travel down your legs, like shooting pain. Does it go into your legs from your back?
PATIENT: Ah. Sometimes… a little tingle. Not all the way down. Mostly in the… calves, I think. Not a bad tingle. Just… there. Like pins and needles, but not really. Like… when your foot falls asleep. But smaller.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tingling sensation in your calves… that’s helpful to know. And you said it's related to sitting and working. Do you notice anything else that makes the back pain or tingling worse, or better?
PATIENT: Worse… hm. Cold weather. Makes everything ache more. And when I have to lift heavy things. Not boxes, usually. Sometimes… the actors are… bigger. Need help getting into costume. But I try to avoid that. Makes the back angry. Better… hm. Lying down. And… hot bath. That helps. A lot.
DOCTOR: Alright, cold weather makes it worse, lifting makes it worse, and lying down and hot baths help. That gives me a good picture. Now, just to get a broader sense of your health, have you had any significant medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Significant? Back home… oh, there was a doctor. He gave me pills. For… something. My blood, maybe? I don't remember. It was a long time ago. Before… everything. Not important, probably. Old man problems. I felt a little tired sometimes, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. It's understandable that you don't remember specifics. We can look up your records if you'd like. Do you know what clinic you went to previously?
PATIENT: Clinic? No. Everything… blurry. Lots of white walls. And smells. Medicine smells. Big building. Not this small town building. No, I don't remember the name. Forgetful, you know? Gets worse with age.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Szmyd. It’s common to have trouble remembering details from the past. We can try to get records another way if it’s important. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or vitamins?
PATIENT: Medications… hm. I take something for… my stomach. Sometimes. When it… complains. Little blue pill. Can't remember the name. From the drugstore. Just… when it hurts. Not every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little blue pill for your stomach when it hurts. We can talk about that a little later. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don't think so. I eat everything. Mostly. Sometimes my stomach complains, but that's not an allergy. Just… old food. Or too much food. I like food.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Szmyd. Alright, one last quick question about your past… have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hm. There was… something. When I was young. A small thing. My… appendix, maybe? The doctor cut it out. I was in the hospital for a few days. But it was a long time ago. Before everything. Doesn’t matter now, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful, Mr. Szmyd. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. Now, I think it would be a good idea if I did a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what's going on with your back. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam? You're going to… poke me? Is it going to hurt? I’m an old man, you know. Bones are… delicate. But… alright. If you think it's necessary. Just be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. I'll be very gentle. I'll just be checking your range of motion, reflexes, and feeling your back to see where the soreness is. It shouldn’t hurt at all, but please let me know if anything does feel uncomfortable. If you'd like, we can start by having you lie down on your side.
PATIENT: Alright. On my side… which side? Doesn’t matter, I guess. Be careful with the back, Doctor. Very delicate. And old.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. I will be very careful. Now, I’m just going to gently feel along your spine to see if I can pinpoint the source of the soreness. Just relax as much as you can. Does this feel tender here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes! There! Right there! That’s where it hurts! Careful, Doctor! You’re poking the angry spot.
DOCTOR: Alright, I apologize for that, Mr. Szmyd. I see exactly where the tenderness is. It appears to be in the lower lumbar region. Are you feeling any pain radiating down your legs when I press there?
PATIENT: A little… tingle. Not bad, just… a buzz. Like pins and needles, but smaller. Mostly in the calf. The left calf, I think. It’s not a sharp pain, Doctor. Just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in the left calf. Now, could you please try to bend forward and touch your toes for me?
PATIENT: Oof! Can't… quite reach. It hurts too much. See? Old man problems. Everything’s stiff.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No need to force anything, Mr. Szmyd. That’s very helpful to know. Now, let's check your reflexes. Could you please extend your legs out straight?
PATIENT: Like this? Everything feels… creaky. Don’t hit my knees too hard, Doctor. Very old knees.
DOCTOR: I will be very gentle, Mr. Szmyd. Just relax. Both reflexes are present and equal, which is good. Now, I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Everything sounds clear there as well. Alright, Mr. Szmyd, that’s all for the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, it seems like you have some lower back muscle strain, possibly aggravated by your work. The tingling in your calf could be related to slight nerve irritation.
PATIENT: Muscle strain? That’s it? Just… old muscles? I knew it! Always the muscles. What do I do about it? More pills? Hot bath isn’t enough anymore.
DOCTOR: It does sound like a muscle strain, Mr. Szmyd. And no, pills aren't necessarily the answer. For now, I recommend a few things. First, continue with the hot baths – they are helpful. But also, try applying ice packs for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day, especially in the first few days. Gentle stretching exercises can also help, but avoid anything that causes pain. And it's important to maintain good posture when you're working. I'm going to write you a prescription for a mild muscle relaxant, just to help with the discomfort. But I also want you to try over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, as needed. Would you like me to explain those as well?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen? Naproxen? What are those? Pills, I guess. More pills. Explain, please. I don't understand all these… names. Just tell me what they do. And are they safe? Old man problems, you know. Everything reacts… differently.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. Ibuprofen and naproxen are both over-the-counter pain relievers, often sold under brand names like Advil or Aleve. They help reduce inflammation and pain. They’re generally safe for most people, but as you mentioned, it’s good to be cautious. They can sometimes cause stomach upset, so it’s best to take them with food. And if you have any underlying medical conditions or are taking other medications, it's important to check with your pharmacist before taking them. I'll write down the dosage instructions for you. And if the pain doesn't improve after a week, or if it gets worse, please let me know. We might consider physical therapy or further imaging. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Imaging? Like… pictures? Of my back? Is something seriously wrong? I told you, it’s just old muscles. I don't want any… poking and prodding. And pictures? What if they find something bad?
DOCTOR: No, no, don't worry, Mr. Szmyd. I don't think anything serious is wrong. Imaging, like an X-ray or MRI, would just give us a more detailed look at your back if the pain isn't improving. It's not something we need to do right away. We can start with the medication and see how you respond. I'm going to write you a prescription for the muscle relaxant and give you a handout with information about ibuprofen and naproxen. I also want you to focus on gentle stretching and maintaining good posture. Do you have any restrictions on your activities?
PATIENT: Restrictions? No, I have to work. I make faces. People need faces. Can’t exactly… lie in bed all day. But maybe… less heavy lifting. And I'll try to sit up straighter. It’s hard work, you know. All these young actors… they're not always light.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Szmyd. It's good you're still able to work, and you're right, less heavy lifting would be a good idea. We’ll take it one step at a time. I'm also going to give you a referral to a local physical therapist, just in case you decide you want to explore that option later. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… pills. And less lifting. And sitting up straight. It’s a lot to remember. Thank you, Doctor. For not finding anything too bad.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Szmyd. Don't worry too much about remembering everything at once. Just focus on taking things one step at a time. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We're here to help. It was nice meeting you, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: .
