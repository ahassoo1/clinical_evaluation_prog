DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. I am Dr. Bradlee Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s… the waterworks, you see. Been trouble with them again. Keeps coming back, this… discomfort. I don’t rightly remember all the details, to be honest. It just… hurts when I go. Is that enough to start? I'd like to get this over with quickly, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: “The waterworks,” alright. And it hurts when you urinate, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. When I… go to the bathroom. It’s not constant pain, you understand. It comes and goes. More comes than goes, lately. I… I don't recall exactly when it started this time, Doctor. It feels like it's been a little while, though. I just want it to stop, really. Is this something serious?
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Wease, any discomfort with urination warrants investigation. The fact that it’s recurrent is also of note. To help me understand the situation better, could you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Recurrent… that doesn’t sound good, does it? The pain… let me think. It’s… a burning, mostly. Like a stinging. And… a pressure, low down. It’s not a sharp pain, thankfully, but it’s… irritating. Very irritating. I don't like it one bit. Honestly, it feels like I can’t ever fully empty my bladder, either. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: A burning sensation and a pressure… and difficulty fully emptying your bladder. Those are pertinent details, Ms. Wease. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh… goodness. I… I don’t think so. I haven't checked, to be truthful. I don’t usually… look. I just know it hurts. I suppose I should have, but… no, I don’t recall seeing any blood. But I haven't been paying much attention, if you understand. I've been trying to ignore it. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not ideal, Ms. Wease, but not uncommon to not specifically check. We will need to investigate that possibility. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower back pain along with this discomfort?
PATIENT: Fever… chills… Oh, I might have felt a little warm last week, but I just thought it was the weather. It gets awfully hot here, you know. And my back… well, my back always aches a bit. I'm an old woman! I didn't think anything of it. It's just my usual aches and pains. I suppose I don't pay much attention to those either.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, kidney problems, or urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Oh dear, medical history… That's a long time ago. Let me see… I believe I had something with my… waterworks once, years and years ago. A doctor gave me some pills, and it went away. I don’t recall the name of the condition, or the pills. And… I might have had something with my sugar levels at one point, but they went back down. I think. I honestly can’t remember all the details. Everything’s a bit… foggy, you see. I’m divorced, if that matters. My husband… well, that’s a story for another day. Is this getting somewhere? I’d really like to know what’s going on.
DOCTOR: It is... helpful to have a general idea. A prior history of a waterworks infection is relevant, as is the possibility of prior sugar level issues. Now, Ms. Wease, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I've taken pills over the years, for various things, and nothing… dramatic happened. I might have gotten a little sleepy once, but that could have been the weather, too. Honestly, I'm not very good at remembering things like that. I don’t really pay attention to the details. Just want the pills to make me feel better, you see. Is this important? I truly don't recall any specific allergies.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… No, not really. I have some cream for my… achy joints, but I don't take it regularly. And sometimes a little something for sleep, but just when I really can't rest. Nothing else. I try to avoid pills whenever possible, you see. They never seem to do much good anyway, and I don’t want to get reliant on them. Is that all? I’m getting quite tired, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wease. Now, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical exam. This will involve listening to your abdomen, and a quick neurological check. Then, I would like to obtain a urine sample for analysis. It’s essential to rule out a urinary tract infection, and assess for any abnormalities. Do you have any objections to that?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical exam… and a sample? Well… I suppose not. As long as it doesn't take too long. I don't like being poked and prodded, if you understand. And the… sample. Is there a bathroom nearby? I need to be quick about this, you see. This whole process is rather… undignified, isn’t it? I just want to know what's wrong, and get this over with. Is it going to be painful?
DOCTOR: The exam is quite routine, Ms. Wease, and should not be painful. The urine sample will simply require you to provide a small amount of urine in a sterile cup. The bathroom is just down the hall, on your left. I'll give you a cup and instructions. Once you've collected the sample, please let me know, and we can proceed with the exam. I'll be right here.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A cup, you say? Just down the hall. Very well. I'll… be as quick as I can. Hopefully, this won’t take too long. Let me know if you need me. I'd like this all over with swiftly, if that's alright. .
DOCTOR: Hmm. Very well. I shall prepare for the examination. .
