DOCTOR: Alright, Jase, so tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's… well, it's my stomach. It's been, like, really upset. I keep getting diarrhea. It’s been going on for a bit now, and it's just… annoying, honestly. I don't really remember when it started, exactly. A few weeks, maybe? I feel okay otherwise, mostly. Just… a lot of trips to the bathroom.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, a few weeks. Or maybe longer? It's hard to say. Things have been… a bit blurry lately, memory-wise. Sorry. It just comes and goes, and it's not like anything major happened to make me notice when it started. Just… gradually got worse, I guess. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: "Gradually" isn't terribly precise, is it?
PATIENT: No, you're right. It isn't. I know, I'm sorry. It's just… hard to pinpoint. I feel like I've always had a sensitive stomach, a bit. Things bother me easily, you know? But this is… more frequent. And it's not just after eating something bad, if that makes sense. Sometimes it happens even if I've just had plain rice.
DOCTOR: "Sensitive stomach," right. And you're saying it's interfering with your daily activities?
PATIENT: Um, yeah, a little bit. I work, you know, sales… so being able to get to appointments is important. I’ve had to cancel a couple because of it, which isn’t great. And… honestly, it's just embarrassing. Having to constantly worry about where the bathroom is. My husband is understanding, but still… it’s not fun. I don’t want to make a big deal out of nothing, but it’s been going on long enough that I thought I should check it out.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your diet, generally?
PATIENT: Oh, um… pretty normal, I think? I like Pakistani food, obviously. Biryani, curry… all that. I try to eat healthy-ish, but I do have a sweet tooth. I also eat a lot of rice, just because it's easy on my stomach when it’s upset. I don't drink a lot of caffeine, and I don’t smoke. I don’t think I have any allergies, but… I haven’t really thought about it much, to be honest. Does that help? I can try to remember more specifics if you need me to.
DOCTOR: "Healthy-ish." Yes, well. Let's move on. Any fever, nausea, vomiting, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, no fever, no vomiting. Sometimes I feel a bit queasy, but I wouldn’t call it nausea, really. And… no, no blood. Definitely not. That would be… awful. I just feel really tired sometimes, but I thought that was from work. I’m married, you know, so things are busy. Does that make sense? I am just trying to think of everything. It all feels a bit jumbled in my head.
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Um… honestly, I don't really have much of one. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, chickenpox and stuff. Nothing major. I do have… well, I think I might have Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or something like that? A doctor mentioned it a long time ago, but I don't really remember the details. And I think I also get Celiac disease, but I don’t really know. It’s all a bit fuzzy. Is that helpful? I'm really sorry I can't be more specific. My husband usually handles all the medical stuff.
DOCTOR: "Fuzzy" is not a diagnosis, Jase. Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, no surgeries. Never had any. I… I haven't really been sick enough to need surgery, I guess. Just the usual things, colds and flu. Nothing serious. I did have my appendix removed when I was little, but that doesn’t really count, does it? I was really young. Honestly, I am starting to feel a bit stressed just trying to remember everything. It’s just a lot.
DOCTOR: Alright. Family history?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. My mom has… she has problems with her stomach sometimes, similar to me, I think. And my dad… he has high blood pressure, I think. And maybe something with his heart? I’m not really sure. My husband’s family is pretty healthy, as far as I know. He has a big family, so it’s hard to keep track. I’m sorry. It’s just… I don’t really pay that much attention to all that stuff. My husband handles all the details.
DOCTOR: Right. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, not really. I mean, I take a multivitamin sometimes, but that’s it. And occasionally, if I get a headache, I’ll take ibuprofen. But that’s it. No prescriptions, nothing regular. I don’t really like taking pills, if I can avoid it. I prefer to just… deal with things on my own, if possible. Though, clearly, that’s not working right now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, then. Lie down on the exam table, if you would. I need to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. That sounds… good. I hope it doesn't take too long. I have an appointment later this afternoon. Just letting you know. Is there anything specific I need to do?
DOCTOR: Just relax. I'll start by listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Take deep breaths. Okay. A little tenderness here and here. Nothing alarming, but noticeable. Your abdomen is…slightly distended. And I’m detecting some mild resistance. Do you feel any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: Um… yeah, a little. It’s not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. And I do feel a bit bloated, actually. I hadn’t really thought about it until you mentioned it. It's… kind of a normal feeling for me, honestly. I just assumed it was… my stomach being sensitive. Ooh, yeah, that one’s a bit more uncomfortable. But it's not terrible.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about bowel sounds?
PATIENT: Bowel sounds? Um… what does that mean? I am sorry, I don’t really understand all the medical terms. Does it mean… like, how often I go to the bathroom? I already told you about that, didn’t I? It's… frequent. I am not really sure what bowel sounds are.
DOCTOR: No, it’s what your intestines sound like when I listen with the stethoscope. It gives me an indication of how things are moving through your digestive system. It’s…normal to have them. Your bowel sounds are…hyperactive. Which isn’t unusual, given your symptoms. Alright, that’s enough for now. Let’s get some basic blood work done to rule out any infection or inflammation. I’m also going to order a stool sample to check for parasites and bacteria. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… alright, I guess. Blood work and a… stool sample. I hope it doesn’t involve too much… detail. And how long will it take to get the results? I have that appointment later this afternoon, and I don’t want to be late. I was hoping to get some answers today, but…
DOCTOR: The results usually take a few days. It’s standard procedure, Jase. The lab will explain how to collect the stool sample; it's a simple process. In the meantime, I recommend a bland diet – rice, toast, bananas – and stay hydrated. Avoid dairy, caffeine, and sugary drinks. And try to manage your stress. It can exacerbate gastrointestinal issues. Based on your history and the preliminary exam, it’s likely a case of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, possibly aggravated by some mild food sensitivities. But we need the lab results to confirm. We can discuss possible medications once we have those back. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Okay… bland diet, no dairy, manage stress. Rice, toast, bananas… I can do that. I think. And IBS… so it is my stomach, then? It's just… been going on for so long. I guess waiting for the results is the best thing to do. It sounds acceptable, yes. Thank you, doctor. Where do I go to get the blood work done?
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the street. You don’t need an appointment. They’ll take care of everything. Alright, well, if you don't hear back within a week, give the clinic a call. Anything else?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you for seeing me. I appreciate your help. Hopefully, the results will be back soon.
