DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’ve been feeling…off, lately. I’m excessively thirsty, no matter how much I drink, and I seem to be hungry all the time. It’s quite bothersome, and I’d like to get to the bottom of it, if you don’t mind. I haven’t much time today, so if we could be reasonably swift, that would be appreciated.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Erxleben. I understand you're busy, and we'll do our best to be efficient. Excessive thirst and hunger can be caused by a number of things, so let's gather some more information. I see here you are 32 years old. Could you tell me a little more about this “feeling off”?
PATIENT: Yes, 32, divorced, unfortunately. As for “feeling off”… it’s difficult to explain. It's not a pain, precisely. More like a constant…emptiness, I suppose. Even after eating a substantial meal, the hunger doesn’t quite go away. And the thirst... I find myself constantly reaching for water, or anything to drink, really. It's interfering with my work, to be honest. Shipping and receiving requires a clear head, and this is… distracting.
DOCTOR: I see. That does sound bothersome, especially with the demands of your job. Constant thirst and hunger, alongside this feeling of emptiness… alright. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently – either weight loss or weight gain?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Actually, now that you mention it… I believe I have lost a bit of weight. Not a significant amount, perhaps five or six pounds, over the last month or so. I hadn’t consciously registered it, to be frank. Work has been… consuming, and I haven't been as diligent with monitoring my weight as I ought to be. I'm around 93 kilograms, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful. Five to six pounds in a month is worth noting, especially alongside the other symptoms you’re describing. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urination – are you going to the bathroom more frequently than usual?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s… that is happening, actually. I’m going to the bathroom considerably more often, particularly at night. It's disruptive to my sleep, which isn’t helping with… well, everything. I assumed it was simply the amount of water I’m drinking, but perhaps it’s connected? I hadn't thought to mention it initially, as it seemed a logical consequence of the thirst.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re sharing all of this, Mr. Erxleben. Increased urination is significant, and in combination with the thirst, hunger, and weight loss, it does raise some concerns. To get a better understanding of what might be going on, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any past medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve always been quite healthy, to be honest. No major illnesses, no surgeries… the usual childhood ailments, of course, but nothing lasting. I have private insurance, so I've kept up with routine check-ups, but everything has always been… normal. I suppose that’s why this is so unsettling. I'm usually a rather robust individual.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And what about family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe, and my father… he had some trouble with his heart in his later years, but nothing particularly… hereditary, as far as I’m aware. Both passed away some time ago, so I don’t have a great deal of detail. They weren't particularly forthcoming about such things, if you understand. A stoic bunch, my family.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Stoicism can certainly make it difficult to gather a thorough history. Now, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I actively avoid medications whenever possible. I prefer to… manage things myself, if I can. A bit old-fashioned, perhaps, but I believe in a healthy diet and regular exercise. Though, admittedly, the exercise has suffered recently, due to… well, everything we’ve been discussing. The thirst and hunger make it difficult to focus on anything requiring physical exertion.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I’m aware of. I’ve never experienced an allergic reaction to anything. I occasionally indulge in shellfish, despite the warnings, and I’ve never had a problem. I’m usually quite careful about what I consume, though. I wouldn’t want to jeopardise my… robustness, as I called it earlier. This current situation is rather…unprecedented, in that regard.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be going on, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. The sooner we can determine the cause of this, the better. I have a meeting scheduled shortly, so if we could be reasonably expedient, that would be greatly appreciated. I'm not opposed to an examination, of course, but my time is… limited.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Erxleben. We’ll be as efficient as possible. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 88 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Heart sounds are normal, and lungs are clear to auscultation. Your abdomen is soft and non-tender. Your skin turgor appears slightly diminished. Your oral mucosa appears slightly dry. Based on this brief examination, your skin is a little dry and your mouth is a bit dry, which supports the symptoms you’ve been describing. However, these findings are not conclusive. To further investigate, I’d like to order some blood work. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, blood work sounds… sensible. As long as it doesn't involve an excessive amount of waiting. My schedule, as I mentioned, is rather demanding. What exactly will the blood work entail? And how long will the results take to come back? I need to know if I need to reschedule any commitments.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll order a comprehensive metabolic panel, which will check your blood sugar, electrolytes, kidney function, and liver function. We'll also check your hemoglobin A1c, which gives us an average of your blood sugar levels over the past three months. The lab technician will take a sample from your arm. It's a standard procedure, and shouldn't take long. The results typically come back within 24 to 48 hours. We can call you with the results as soon as they're available, or you can schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, it’s important to stay hydrated. Continue drinking plenty of water. Do you have any questions about the blood work or anything else we’ve discussed?
PATIENT: No, that sounds… thorough enough. Staying hydrated is hardly a hardship, given my current predicament. Twenty-four to forty-eight hours is… acceptable. I suppose I can reschedule a few minor commitments. No, I don’t believe I have any further questions at this time. I appreciate your efficiency, Doctor. Hopefully, the results will shed some light on this… discomfort. If you’ll excuse me, I believe I should make arrangements for my upcoming meetings. I trust the lab technician will be able to locate me easily?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Erxleben. The lab technician will be in shortly to draw your blood. They'll be able to find you easily. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as blurred vision, confusion, or severe fatigue – please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. We'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. Thank you for your patience and cooperation. Have a good day, and I hope we can get to the bottom of this quickly.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… diligence. I trust this won’t be a prolonged affair. Good day to you as well.
