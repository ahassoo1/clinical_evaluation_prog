DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, I’ve noticed a lump… a mass, I guess you’d call it, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I wanted to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. And how long has it been there, roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Probably about three months, maybe a little longer. It wasn’t very noticeable at first, just felt like… a fullness, really. But it’s grown a bit since then.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months, starting as a fullness and growing. Has it been painful at all?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. It doesn’t hurt to touch it, or move around, or anything like that. It’s just… concerning, you know? Because it is there, and it’s getting bigger.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Amy. It's always best to get these things checked out. Has there been any change in your bowel habits, like constipation or diarrhea, or any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: No, no changes there. Everything’s been pretty regular, thankfully. No blood or anything like that either. I haven't noticed anything different with that, at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And have you had any fever, weight loss, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, thankfully none of those either. My appetite is normal, and I haven’t been feeling sick. I've actually been feeling quite well, aside from the worry about this lump, of course.
DOCTOR: Alright. And just to get a complete picture, can you tell me about any past medical problems you've had, or any surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: Let's see… I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, that's about it, really. No other surgeries, and no major illnesses. Just the usual childhood things, like chickenpox, but nothing serious. My wife says I’m remarkably healthy, actually.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had high blood pressure, and my father had some heart trouble later in life. Nothing like… cancer or anything like that, as far as I know. Just the usual things that come with getting older, I suppose. No one in my immediate family has ever had anything like this that I'm aware of.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I can take most medications without any problems. No food allergies either. My wife always jokes that I'll eat anything!
DOCTOR: Alright, good. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones, or any supplements?
PATIENT: No, I’m not taking anything regularly. Occasionally I'll take something for a headache, like ibuprofen, but that's about it. No supplements or anything like that. I try to eat a healthy diet, so I don’t really feel the need for them.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let's take a look at this lump. If you don’t mind, could you lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. No problem at all. Just let me know if you need me to adjust anything.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm just going to feel around a bit. Let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. It appears to be about… 3 centimeters in diameter, located in the left lower quadrant. It's fairly firm, and doesn't seem to be particularly tender. It's also mobile, which is a good sign. I don't feel any enlarged lymph nodes in the area. Based on what you've told me and what I'm feeling, it’s difficult to say definitively what this is without further investigation. It could be a number of things, like a lipoma, a hernia, or even a muscle knot. However, to rule out anything more serious, I’d like to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A CT scan… yes, that sounds sensible. If that's what you recommend, then yes, absolutely. I’d rather be thorough, you know? Rule things out, just to be safe. What does that involve, exactly? And when would I be able to get it done?
DOCTOR: Good, I agree, it's best to be thorough. A CT scan uses X-rays to create detailed images of your abdomen and pelvis. You'll lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. It's painless, but you will need to drink a contrast solution beforehand to help highlight the organs. It usually takes about 30-45 minutes. I can get the order sent to the radiology department at Suburban Hospital. They usually have appointments available within the next 24-48 hours. They will call you to schedule a time. Once the results are in, we’ll review them together and discuss the next steps. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright. Within 24-48 hours is good. And I understand about the contrast solution. I'll drink whatever they tell me to. Thank you, Doctor. That makes me feel a lot better already, knowing we’re getting it checked out properly. Is there anything I should do before the scan? Like, anything I should avoid eating or drinking?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Amy. I’m glad I could reassure you. For the CT scan, the radiology department will give you specific instructions, but generally, they’ll ask you to fast for a few hours beforehand – usually four to six hours. They’ll also want to know if you have any allergies, especially to iodine or contrast dye. It's a good idea to drink plenty of water in the days leading up to the scan to help your kidneys process the contrast. And if you're taking any medications, let them know. I’ll also send a referral to Dr. Chen, a general surgeon, just in case the scan reveals anything that requires surgical consultation. It’s best to have all the options available. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable. Fasting for a few hours, drink plenty of water… I can manage that. And a referral to Dr. Chen, just in case… that’s sensible too. You're very thorough, Doctor, I appreciate it. I think that covers everything, doesn't it? Should I contact your office after the scan, or will someone contact me?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I always want to be sure we’re covering all bases. The radiology department will send the scan results directly to my office. My staff will then contact you within a couple of days to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings. If you have any urgent concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to call the office and speak with one of the nurses. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything very well, Doctor. I feel much better knowing we have a plan. Thank you again for your time and your thoroughness. I’ll be sure to call if anything changes before then. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if anything comes up. You have a good day as well.
