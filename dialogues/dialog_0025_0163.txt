DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. I’m Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. A rather… spirited endeavour, you might say, has prompted this visit. I’ve been attempting a new diet, and while I haven’t encountered any immediate catastrophes, I felt it prudent to have a professional opinion. It’s rather… restrictive, and I’m beginning to question its long-term viability, and frankly, its wisdom.
DOCTOR: A restrictive diet, you say?
PATIENT: Indeed. A friend – a rather excitable young man, always chasing the latest trends – suggested it. It involves… well, primarily consuming only foods that were available before the 18th century. Apparently, it’s a return to “natural” eating. No processed foods, naturally, but also no tomatoes, potatoes, or maize, as they arrived in Europe later. It’s… more challenging than one might initially assume.
DOCTOR: Before the 18th century?
PATIENT: Precisely! A rather… dedicated approach, wouldn’t you say? He calls it the “Paleo-Historical” diet. I confess, I initially dismissed it as youthful folly, but he was quite insistent on its benefits. Said it would “realign my gut biome.” I’ve always been reasonably healthy, you understand, so I approached it as a… temporary experiment. Though I’m rapidly discovering the sheer lack of variety.
DOCTOR: And how long have you been on this… “Paleo-Historical” diet, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… approximately six weeks, I believe. Commenced on the 20th of June. At first, it wasn’t terribly onerous – lots of roasted meats and root vegetables. But the limitations are beginning to feel… acute. And I find myself longing for a simple tomato, truthfully. Or a properly baked potato. It's quite absurd, when you consider it.
DOCTOR: And have you noticed any… specific changes in how you’re feeling since starting this diet?
PATIENT: Specific changes… hmm. Well, my energy levels are… somewhat variable. A bit lower, perhaps, than usual. I've also experienced a certain… sluggishness, if I’m being honest. And my digestion… let us say it is not as predictable as it once was. There’s a certain… gurgling, and occasional discomfort. Nothing debilitating, you understand. Merely… noticeable. And I’ve had a rather persistent craving for fruit, which, naturally, is… limited on this regime.
DOCTOR: "Sluggishness" and "unpredictable" digestion. Alright. And are you taking any other supplements or medications currently, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Not at all, Doctor. I pride myself on avoiding such things. A sensible diet and regular exercise have always been my principles. I do take a daily multivitamin, simply as a precaution, but that’s been my routine for years – long before this… historical experiment. I haven’t altered that. And I assure you, no exotic potions or miracle cures. Just a rather foolish attempt to impress a friend, it seems.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’d like to listen to your abdomen, check your reflexes, and take your blood pressure. Just to get a baseline, you understand. If you could just sit up there for me.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you deem necessary. I do hope I haven’t caused too much trouble with this… dietary folly. I always felt these extreme approaches were… unsustainable.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not alarming given your age. Reflexes are… a bit diminished, but within normal range for someone your age. And… yes, your abdomen is a little tender in the lower quadrants. Any pain when I press here?
PATIENT: A slight discomfort, yes. Not acute, but… noticeable. I hadn't attributed it directly to the diet, frankly. I simply assumed it was… age. A general creakiness, you might say. But if you find a correlation, I shall be most interested. And perhaps rather relieved, if it indicates a relatively simple correction.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, it sounds like this… “Paleo-Historical” diet is likely causing some digestive upset. It’s severely restricting important nutrients and fiber, which is leading to your sluggishness and abdominal discomfort. Your blood pressure being a little elevated could also be related to the overall stress on your system. It’s not a sustainable approach, and frankly, it’s a bit… foolish.
PATIENT: Foolish, you say? A rather polite assessment, Doctor. I concur entirely. I allowed myself to be swayed by youthful enthusiasm and a misguided sense of… experimentation. To be frank, I suspected as much. I simply needed a professional to confirm my suspicions. So, what do you recommend? A return to a more… sensible diet? And perhaps a stern lecture to my friend?
DOCTOR: A return to a balanced diet is absolutely essential. We're not looking for extreme restrictions, Mr. Vantine. Plenty of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. I'd also recommend a stool softener for a few days to alleviate the discomfort. As for your friend… well, I won’t dictate your social interactions. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a metabolic panel just to get a more detailed picture of your nutritional status. We want to rule out any deficiencies. And, if the discomfort persists, we may consider a referral to a gastroenterologist. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Quite agreeable, Doctor. A sensible approach indeed. And I shall, with immediate effect, cease this… historical endeavor. Perhaps I shall suggest my friend consult a nutritionist before embarking on further… experiments. A complete blood count and metabolic panel seem entirely prudent. And I appreciate your consideration regarding the gastroenterologist, should the need arise. Thank you, Doctor Fourney. You’ve restored my faith in common sense, and my appetite for a simple tomato.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab technician will draw the blood before you leave. I'll have the results sent to you within a week. And please, Mr. Vantine, avoid restrictive diets. Your body will thank you. Do you have any other concerns today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That covers everything admirably. I believe I’ve inflicted sufficient trouble for one day. I shall endeavor to adhere to a more… conventional dietary regime. And I thank you again for your… diplomatic assessment of my folly, and your sensible recommendations. I believe I shall leave the historical adventures to the historians, and focus on a more… palatable present.
DOCTOR: Good. The lab results will be sent to your primary care physician as well. Have a good day, Mr. Vantine. .
PATIENT: Indeed. A good day to you as well, Doctor. I shall take my leave, and seek out a suitable tomato.
