DOCTOR: Hi Nani, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… it’s difficult to say precisely. I suppose… a general feeling of being quite down. It’s been lingering for some time now, and I thought it best to have someone look at it. I haven't been sleeping well either, but honestly, who does these days?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. A general feeling of being down and some trouble sleeping. That's a good place to start. When you say “lingering for some time”, could you give me a sense of how long we're talking about?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me see… it must be… six months, perhaps? Maybe a little longer. It’s not that I haven’t had good days within that time, mind you. Just… a consistent lack of…spark, I suppose. It’s hard to explain. Everything feels… muted.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months of a generally down feeling with some good days mixed in, and that sense of things feeling “muted”. That gives me a better idea. Has anything specific happened around the time this started that might have triggered it?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my divorce was finalized around then, yes. It wasn't… acrimonious, exactly. More of a… drifting apart, you understand? We simply realized we wanted different things after a very long time. But even so, it's been… a change. A large one. I don’t know if that’s the reason, but it certainly coincided.
DOCTOR: That's significant, Nani. A divorce, even an amicable one, is a major life event. It’s completely understandable that you'd be feeling down afterward. Besides the divorce, have you noticed any other changes in your life around that time?
PATIENT: Let me think… oh! I retired from full-time lifeguarding then, too. Ski patrol was always more of a hobby, really. So, I wasn’t as busy, I suppose. Though I did try to keep active with volunteering… it just wasn't the same as having a proper job, with colleagues and… a routine. Does that make sense? It sounds silly now that I say it aloud.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound silly at all. Retirement and a divorce close together - that’s a lot of adjustment. Losing both a life partner and a career identity can definitely contribute to feeling down. Okay, let’s talk a bit more about how you've been feeling specifically. When you say "down," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: It’s not… sadness, precisely. Not all the time, anyway. More… a heaviness. A lack of motivation. Things that used to bring me joy… gardening, visiting with my grandchildren… they don’t feel as appealing. It’s like… the colour has faded from everything. And I find myself… quite tired, even when I've had enough sleep. Or, perhaps because I've had enough sleep. It’s all very confusing.
DOCTOR: That sounds like more than just a temporary low mood, Nani. The heaviness, loss of motivation, and things not being as enjoyable are all important things to mention. You also mentioned being tired even with enough sleep. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Well… my appetite hasn’t been very good, no. I don’t actively dislike food, but I simply don’t feel hungry as often. And yes, I have lost a little weight. Nothing drastic, perhaps five or six pounds. My daughter commented on it last time she visited. She worries, you see. A very good girl, my daughter.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased appetite and some weight loss. And your daughter’s noticed. That's good she's looking out for you. Have you been experiencing any difficulty concentrating, or trouble with your memory?
PATIENT: Oh dear… now that you mention it, yes. I have been rather… forgetful lately. Small things, mostly. Where I put my glasses, what I went to the kitchen for… But yesterday, I couldn't recall the name of a colleague I worked with for years. That frightened me, to be honest. It's not like me at all. Perhaps it's just old age catching up?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re noticing these changes, Nani. And it’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned. Memory lapses can happen for a lot of reasons, and it's important to explore them. Let’s move on to some other things, just to get a broader picture. Are you having any trouble sleeping, beyond just not feeling rested?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It’s not that I can’t fall asleep, but I wake up frequently during the night. Sometimes I’m just restless, other times I have… vivid dreams. And once I’m awake, it’s often difficult to get back to sleep. I spend hours just lying there, thinking. Or not thinking, really. Just… being awake. It’s quite frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, frequent awakenings during the night and difficulty getting back to sleep. And you said vivid dreams?
PATIENT: Yes. Not nightmares, precisely. Just… very real, very detailed dreams. Often about the past, about my childhood, or my late husband. They aren’t frightening, but they leave me feeling… unsettled. And quite tired, naturally. I wake up feeling as if I haven't slept at all. It's very peculiar. I haven't had dreams like this in decades.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s a lot of information, Nani, and I appreciate you sharing it with me. It sounds like you've been going through a difficult time, and these symptoms are definitely worth investigating further. Before we talk about next steps, let me quickly ask about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Let me see… nothing major, no. I had a bout of bronchitis a few years ago, but that cleared up quickly. My doctor always monitored my blood pressure, and it was usually a little on the high side, but never anything requiring medication. I've always been quite healthy, really. Or, I was quite healthy. Before all this, that is. I don't recall ever being diagnosed with anything serious. I've been lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And what about any surgeries you’ve had?
PATIENT: Just a hysterectomy, many years ago. Around the time I was forty, I believe. It was… routine, really. No complications. And that’s it. Nothing else. I’ve always avoided surgery if I could, preferring to let nature take its course. Perhaps I should have had more done, though. One never knows, does one? But no, just the hysterectomy. A long time ago now.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, none that I am aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My daughter always jokes that I could eat anything, which is probably why she worries so much! No allergies, no. Completely allergy-free, thankfully. I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin, Doctor. I’ve been taking one for years, just to keep my strength up. And occasionally, if I have a headache, I’ll take paracetamol. But that’s it. Nothing else. No prescription medications, no herbal remedies, nothing at all. Just a simple multivitamin, and the occasional paracetamol for a headache. I pride myself on not being one for taking pills, unless absolutely necessary.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's good to know. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. I used to enjoy a glass of sherry with dinner occasionally, but I haven’t touched a drop in years. My late husband wasn't fond of it, and I simply lost the habit. And smoking… never. My mother smoked, and I saw firsthand the damage it did. So, no, no alcohol, no smoking, and certainly no recreational drugs. I’ve always led a very clean life, Doctor. Very clean indeed.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Nani. Okay, one last quick question before we move to a physical exam. Can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Well… my mother lived to be eighty-five, but she had… dementia, in her later years. It was quite distressing for everyone. My father died relatively young, in his sixties, from a heart attack. And I had an older brother, but he passed away several years ago from a stroke. Other than that… not much. No history of mental illness, as far as I know. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I suppose. Nothing particularly alarming. But the dementia… that does worry me, naturally. It was very difficult to watch.
DOCTOR: Okay. Thank you for sharing that, Nani. That gives me a good overview. Given everything you’ve told me – the prolonged low mood, loss of motivation, sleep disturbances, weight loss, memory problems, and your family history – I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam and order some blood tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. If you think it’s necessary, then please do. I’d rather be safe than sorry, as they say. Though I must confess, I've never been one for tests and examinations. But if it will help, then yes, please proceed. Let’s get it over with, shall we? The sooner we know what’s going on, the better.
DOCTOR: Alright, Nani. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Okay, your heart rate and rhythm sound regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'll check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 145/90, but not dramatically so. Pulse is 78, also within normal range. Now, I’m going to quickly check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. And finally, I’d like to do a very quick cognitive assessment – just a few simple questions to check your memory and orientation. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Go ahead. I suppose I should be prepared for anything at this point. I must confess, I’m a little nervous about the memory questions, but I understand it's important. Let’s get it over with, shall we? The sooner we know, the better. Just be gentle with me, if you would. My mind isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Nani. I will be as gentle as possible. First, can you tell me what today’s date is?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… it's August… the second? Yes, the second of August. 2025, isn’t it? Though it's hard to keep track these days. Is that correct? I do hope I haven’t gotten it wrong. I used to be so good with dates.
DOCTOR: That is correct, Nani. August 2nd, 2025. Good. And can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Oh… well, we’re in… Doctor’s office, aren’t we? Your office, of course. At the… clinic? Yes. I believe it's in town, isn’t it? The urban clinic. Though I don't recall the name of the clinic itself. Is that sufficient? I know I’m not being very helpful.
DOCTOR: You are being very helpful, Nani. It’s alright. Now, can you repeat these three words for me, and I’ll ask you to recall them later?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Please do. Let me see… three words, you said? Go ahead. I'll try my best to remember them. I always had a good memory… I hope it hasn't completely deserted me.
DOCTOR: Okay. The words are: apple, table, penny. Please try to remember those. Now, I'm going to ask you a few more questions about your recent memory. Have you had any recent difficulties with remembering appointments or medications?
PATIENT: Yes… as I mentioned earlier, I've been forgetting things more easily. Appointments… sometimes I write them down, but then I forget where I put the paper! And medications… I only take a multivitamin, as I said, but I do worry about forgetting it. It's small things, mostly, but they are unsettling. It’s not like me at all. I used to be so organized, so meticulous. Now… I feel rather scattered. It’s quite distressing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, Nani. And finally, I’m going to ask you to draw a clock, including all the numbers, and set the hands to 10:10. It’s just a quick assessment of spatial awareness and executive function. Don't worry about it being perfect, just do your best.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I apologize for the mess. It's not my best work, I'm afraid. My hands aren't as steady as they used to be. I haven't drawn anything in years, and it shows. I feel rather foolish now.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Nani. Okay, that’s fine. It’s not about artistic skill, it’s just a quick assessment. Alright, Nani, that concludes the physical exam and quick assessments. Now, I’m going to order some blood tests. These will check your thyroid function, vitamin levels, kidney and liver function, and rule out any underlying infection. I’ll also order a Complete Blood Count, or CBC, to check for anemia. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… thorough. Please do whatever you think is necessary. The sooner we have some answers, the better. I must confess, I’m a little anxious about the blood tests, but I understand they are important. I always dislike needles, but I’ll try to be brave. Please let me know the results as soon as they are available. I’m eager to get to the bottom of all this.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nani. I’ll have the lab results back within a few days. In the meantime, I want to be upfront with you. Based on what you've told me, and the preliminary findings from the exam, I’m concerned about the possibility of early-stage dementia, or another cognitive impairment. The memory lapses, the drawing, and your family history are all red flags. However, it's too early to make any definitive diagnosis. The blood tests will help rule out other potential causes, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems, which can sometimes mimic dementia symptoms. While we wait for the results, I’d like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation. They can perform more specialized tests and provide a clearer picture of your cognitive function. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Dementia? Oh dear… my mother… You think… you think I might have… dementia? A neurologist… yes, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary, then yes, please. But… it’s frightening, Doctor. Very frightening. I… I don't know what to say. I just… I hope you're wrong. I've always prided myself on my mind… it’s… it’s all I have left, really. Please… please do everything you can to find out what’s going on. I… I need to know. And I need to know soon.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Nani. It’s perfectly natural to be frightened. It’s important to remember that a diagnosis of dementia is a process, and we don’t have enough information yet to make any conclusions. The neurologist will perform a more detailed evaluation to assess your cognitive function and determine the cause of your symptoms. It’s also important to remember that even if you do have some cognitive impairment, there are things we can do to manage the symptoms and maintain your quality of life. I’m going to order the blood tests right away, and I’ll have my nurse schedule an appointment with a neurologist for you. In the meantime, I want you to focus on taking care of yourself. Try to maintain a regular routine, stay socially active, and eat a healthy diet. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I'm here to support you every step of the way. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… not right now, Doctor. I… I think I need some time to process everything. Just… the neurologist, you said? And the blood tests… alright. Yes. I suppose that’s all I can do right now. Thank you, Doctor. For… for everything. Perhaps… perhaps you could just remind me what I should expect from the neurologist? What kind of tests will they perform? I… I'm rather anxious about the unknown.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Nani. The neurologist will likely perform a variety of cognitive tests – things like memory recall, problem-solving, language skills, and attention span. They may also assess your motor skills and reflexes. It’s a fairly comprehensive evaluation, but it’s not painful. They may also order brain imaging, like an MRI or CT scan, to get a better look at your brain structure. The entire evaluation will likely take a couple of hours. It's important to be honest and open with the neurologist about your symptoms and concerns. They will be able to provide a more accurate diagnosis and recommend the best course of treatment. I’ll have my nurse give you a handout with more information about the neurologist and what to expect during the evaluation. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. I think that’s all for today, Nani. I’ll have the nurse schedule your blood tests and neurologist appointment. Take care of yourself, and remember, I’m here to support you.
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Thank you. I… I think I’m ready to go now. I just… need to get home and… think. Thank you again, Doctor. For everything.
