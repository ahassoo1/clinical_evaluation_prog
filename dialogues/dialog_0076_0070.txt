DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Szmyd, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, Kile. Just Kile is good. Is… good enough. You are the doctor, yes? New doctor here, I think? Everything looks… small. This chair is small!
DOCTOR: Yes, well. I'm Dr. Ruocco. And yes, the furniture isn’t exactly… designed for larger gentlemen. Doesn't matter. So, Kile. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Brings me in? Hmm. I… don’t really bring myself anywhere. The lady at the front desk… she said I needed to come. Social thing, she said. Medicare, something like that. New in the area, you see. Everything is… confusing. I do makeup, mostly. For the theater. Not… sick or anything.
DOCTOR: Right. The “social thing.” A preventative visit, I presume. Medicare likes those. Look, I have several patients after you, so let’s just… try to be concise. You’re not sick, you say?
PATIENT: Concise? Is that… important? I don't get sick like other people, no. I work with sick people. Make them look… presentable. Old ladies with… things. Actors with… drama. Mostly, I just put on the colors. Is good colors, very important. But I feel… okay. A little tired, maybe. But everyone is tired.
DOCTOR: “Good colors.” Right. Tired, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. Like… a weight. Not a bad weight, just… there. Always there. I used to be able to work all night, no problem. Now… I need a nap after lunch. And the colors… sometimes they don’t look as bright. Maybe it’s the lights in the theater. They are very old. Everything is old, these days.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Age, likely. It happens. Let’s just take a few basic measurements, alright?
PATIENT: Measurements? Like… for clothes? I don’t understand. I am not buying new clothes. My clothes are… fine. Is this a doctor’s office or a tailor shop?
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Szmyd. Height, weight, blood pressure. Routine. It helps me get a baseline. Honestly, it's quicker if you just cooperate. Do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? To… what? Dust? Bad actors? I don't really pay attention to those things. I work with everything. Sometimes I get a rash from the cheap paint, but I just put some cream on it. Is that an allergy? I don’t know. I just… ignore it.
DOCTOR: Right. Ignore it. Very well. Any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I drink tea. Sometimes with honey. Is that a medication? My mother always said tea is good for everything. For the soul, she said. And for… the color of your face. Makes you look younger, she said.
DOCTOR: No medications. Alright. Let’s just do a quick listen to your heart and lungs, shall we?
PATIENT: Listen? Like… to my story? I don't have a very interesting story, doctor. Just colors and old ladies. And actors. Is… cold stethoscope, yes? I don’t like cold things on my chest. It feels… disrespectful.
DOCTOR: It’s necessary, Mr. Szmyd. Deep breath. And try not to talk.
PATIENT: Is… cold. Very cold. I told you. And my heart… is probably very tired. Like the rest of me. All this drama. Makes a man… weary.
DOCTOR: Lungs are clear. Heart rate is… regular, if a bit slow. Blood pressure is… elevated. Which isn't entirely surprising. Have you been feeling any chest pain?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No. Not really pain. Maybe… a squeezing. Like someone is holding a very small kitten on my chest. A very fluffy kitten. Is… annoying, but not painful. And only when I get very upset. When the actors… forget their lines. Or the old ladies… complain about the colors.
DOCTOR: A "fluffy kitten." Right. And you said you've been feeling tired?
PATIENT: Yes. Very tired. Like… all the colors have gone out of the world. Not just the paints, you see. Everything. The lights, the faces, the… kittens. Everything is just… gray. And I need a nap. A very long nap.
DOCTOR: Okay. We’ll do some bloodwork to rule out anything obvious. And I’m going to recommend you see a cardiologist. Elevated blood pressure, fatigue… it warrants further investigation. I'll have the nurse draw some blood and schedule you an appointment. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Cardio… what? Is that someone who paints hearts? I don’t need my heart painted. It's… fine. Gray, but fine. Bloodwork? Is that… a lot of blood? I don’t like needles. And… kittens don't like needles either.
DOCTOR: A cardiologist is a heart doctor, Mr. Szmyd. They specialize in the heart. And the bloodwork is routine. A small vial, that’s all. It's just to be sure. The nurse will explain everything. I'm going to write the orders now. Please wait here. This is going to be a long day.
PATIENT: Routine… Is like painting the same face, over and over? Very boring. I just want a nap. And maybe… some brighter colors. .
