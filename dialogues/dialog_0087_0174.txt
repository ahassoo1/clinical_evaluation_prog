DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Derasmo. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s… it’s a bit difficult to explain. I haven’t been myself lately. Honestly, I’d just like to get this over with as quickly as possible, if you don't mind. My time is rather valuable, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Derasmo. I will do my best to be efficient. Perhaps we can start with what "not yourself" means. Can you describe the symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Well, I just… don’t feel much of anything anymore, really. Not happy, not sad, just… empty. And I’ve been sleeping a great deal. More than usual, certainly. I used to be quite active, you know – lifeguarding, skiing… now I just want to stay in bed. It’s very unlike me. I also haven’t been eating properly. Though, truthfully, it's hard to tell if that's the reason or a result of the other things.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, a loss of interest or pleasure in activities, increased sleep, and changes in appetite. Have you noticed any difficulty concentrating, or feeling restless or slowed down?
PATIENT: Concentrating… yes, that’s a good question. It’s harder than it used to be, definitely. Things just… float away from me, you see? And sometimes I feel… agitated, like I need to do something, but I don't know what. Other times, I’m just… sluggish. It varies. Honestly, I haven’t paid close attention to the details. I’ve just been trying to get through each day. Is this going to take long, Doctor?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Ms. Derasmo. We’re getting there. Just a few more questions to get a clearer picture. Have you experienced any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I believe I have. A bit less, I think. It’s difficult to say exactly; I don’t weigh myself often anymore. It's just… clothes feel looser, that's all. Not a great amount, but noticeable. Is this about my weight? I assure you I’m perfectly healthy, despite everything. I’ve always been strong. Years of swimming, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. Now, have you noticed any feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness?
PATIENT: Hopelessness… yes. That’s… a difficult question. I suppose so. What’s the point, really? I’ve lived a good life, but… things aren’t the same anymore. My ex-husband… he's doing well. And I'm… not. It feels a bit unfair, if I'm being honest. Is this what you're asking about? It's not a comfortable topic, you know. I prefer to focus on practical matters.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Derasmo. It's perfectly alright to share only what you're comfortable with. Now, just to be thorough, have you been experiencing any physical symptoms—like headaches, stomach problems, or fatigue—in addition to how you're feeling emotionally?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The fatigue, certainly. It’s constant. And… I’ve had a bit of a stomach upset lately. Nothing severe, just… queasy. I thought it might be something I ate, but it’s been lingering. And a headache now and then. But, you know, at my age, one expects a few aches and pains. It’s probably just old age catching up with me. Really, I just want to feel… normal again. Is there a solution to this, Doctor? A quick one, preferably.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Derasmo. Thank you for sharing that with me. To get a better understanding, I’d like to ask about your medical history – any previous diagnoses, surgeries, or medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. I had my gallbladder removed, oh, must be thirty years ago now. And I was briefly treated for high blood pressure a few years back, but it resolved on its own with diet and exercise. I don't take any medications currently, no. Just a multivitamin. And… well, I had a rather nasty bout of the flu last winter, but that was all. Honestly, I'm usually quite robust. Do you need to know anything else? I have an appointment to keep this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. No current medications, just a multivitamin, gallbladder removed thirty years ago, and history of high blood pressure that resolved with lifestyle changes. That’s good information. Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… my mother had arthritis, quite badly. And my father… he had heart problems, I believe. He died young, unfortunately. And my sister… she's been struggling with diabetes for years. Other than that, not that I recall. It's a large family, you know, so it's difficult to keep track of everything. Is this necessary, Doctor? I'm not feeling particularly well, and this is… a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Derasmo. Just a few more questions to complete the picture, then we can discuss next steps. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle—do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Goodness, no! Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. I might have a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps once or twice a month. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no! I was a lifeguard, you know! A responsible citizen! I believe in a healthy lifestyle - swimming, good food, fresh air. Though, admittedly, I haven’t been doing much swimming lately. Still, I maintain my principles. Can we please get to the point, Doctor? I’m getting rather impatient.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Derasmo. Based on what you’ve told me – the loss of interest, increased sleep, changes in appetite, fatigue, and feelings of hopelessness—along with your family history, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. However, to rule out any other underlying medical conditions, I would like to order a complete blood count and a thyroid panel. And, if you don’t mind, a vitamin D level. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Depression? Hmm. Well, I suppose it’s possible. I hadn't really considered it. I’ve always been a strong woman, independent. It’s just… things aren’t the same. Blood tests… yes, alright. Whatever needs to be done. But please, no unnecessary procedures. I have a busy schedule, you see. And could we perhaps discuss a quick solution? Medication, perhaps? I really need to get my life back on track. This has been… rather unpleasant, Doctor. Let's just get it over with. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Derasmo. I will order the blood work right away. The lab is just down the hall. Once we have the results, we can discuss potential treatment options, including medication if appropriate. In the meantime, I would also like to schedule a follow-up appointment for us to review your results and discuss your options further. We can also talk about the possibility of a referral to a therapist, if you feel that would be helpful. Here is the requisition form for the lab tests. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
