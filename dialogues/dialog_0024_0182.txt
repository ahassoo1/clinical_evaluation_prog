DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. I am Dr. Mutnick. Please, have a seat. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's about this…procedure. My daughter insisted I get a check-up before I go through with it. Says I'm too old to just decide these things for myself. It's a face lift, if you must know. Perfectly sensible, really. Just want to look…presentable. Let's get this over with, shall we?
DOCTOR: A facelift. Yes. While I commend your…proactive approach to self-care, Mr. Orwin, a medical evaluation is prudent before any elective surgery, regardless of age. I’ll need a comprehensive history. Now, let’s start with your current medical conditions. Do you have any diagnosed illnesses – heart problems, diabetes, high blood pressure, anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, good heavens, no. Nothing diagnosed. I get a little…winded climbing the stairs, maybe. And my knees ache when it rains. But that’s just old age, Doctor. Perfectly normal. I used to be a strong man, you know. Terrazzo work is hard labor. Built this country, practically. Don't need a list of illnesses. Just want to know if I'm fit enough for a little nip and tuck. Honestly.
DOCTOR: “A little nip and tuck,” as you say, still requires anesthesia and carries inherent risks. We need to be thorough. So, let’s clarify. You experience shortness of breath with exertion – climbing stairs, you said?
PATIENT: Well, yes. Like I said. It’s not a problem. I just…pause a bit. Catch my breath. I’m not running marathons, Doctor. Look, are we going to do this or not? I have a luncheon scheduled. And frankly, I don’t appreciate being interrogated about my breathing. It's perfectly adequate for a normal life.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I assure you, I am not attempting to interrogate you. It’s standard procedure. The EHR indicates a visit two years ago for… “seasonal allergies.” Is that accurate?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, that. Yes, yes. A bit of a sniffle in the spring. Nothing serious. My daughter dragged me to that quack, Dr. Henderson. Gave me some pills that tasted like chalk. Didn’t do much good, frankly. Mostly just made me drowsy. I just deal with it. A little sneezing. Everyone gets allergies. Is this relevant to my face?
DOCTOR: While seasonal allergies themselves may not preclude you from surgery, the medication you were prescribed could have implications. Do you recall the name of the medication?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, do you expect me to remember the name of every pill a doctor foists upon me? It was…a little white one. Maybe pink? I don't keep track of these things. My daughter handles the medications. She's very organized. Ask her. This is ridiculous. I came here for a pre-op clearance, not a pharmaceutical quiz.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s move on then. Do you have any known allergies to any medications, foods, or environmental factors besides seasonal allergies?
PATIENT: No. Nothing I’m aware of. I eat everything. Used to enjoy lutefisk, even. A strong stomach, I have. And I’ve been around. Worked outdoors my whole life. I doubt there’s anything that bothers me. Honestly, Doctor, I’m a remarkably healthy eighty-one-year-old man. This whole process is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, with all due respect, "remarkably healthy" is a subjective assessment. Let’s discuss your surgical history. Have you ever had any operations or been hospitalized for anything other than a brief illness?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Good heavens, no. I broke my wrist once, when I was a boy, falling out of a tree. But that was…ages ago. Just a cast for a few weeks. Nothing serious. Other than that…no. I’ve always been a robust individual. Avoid doctors whenever possible. They just poke and prod and tell you things you don’t want to hear. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? My luncheon…
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, you know…the usual. People get sick. My mother lived to be ninety, but she wasn't exactly robust. My father…heart trouble, I think. But that was a long time ago, and he smoked like a chimney. Not my fault, is it? Frankly, Doctor, I don't keep a detailed genealogical record of ailments. It’s morbid. Are we almost finished? I really must be going. This is taking far too long.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your impatience, but a comprehensive medical history is crucial. Now, regarding your social history…do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Do I look like the type? I was a working man, Doctor, not a…a wastrel. I might have had a glass of sherry with dinner occasionally. Very occasionally. But smoking? Recreational drugs? Absolutely not. Disgraceful question, frankly. I expect a certain level of decorum from a physician. Now, can we please wrap this up? My luncheon…you've heard enough.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I'm documenting this all, as you can see. Now, let's move on to a brief physical exam. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and assess your overall condition. Please remove your jacket.
PATIENT: Now hold on just a minute! A physical exam? You haven’t even established whether I’m fit for this procedure based on my perfectly adequate answers! I came here for a clearance, not a full medical overhaul. I’m a private man, Doctor. I don’t appreciate being poked and prodded unnecessarily. And I certainly won’t be removing my jacket for you. I think I’ve had enough of this. I’m leaving. Find someone else to interrogate. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, with all due respect, I cannot in good conscience provide medical clearance without a basic assessment of your health. Your refusal to cooperate is…unwise. I strongly advise you to reconsider. However, if you insist on proceeding without a proper evaluation, I will document your refusal and recommend you seek a second opinion from a physician willing to accommodate your…preferences. I will also document your current complaints of shortness of breath and advise you to monitor them closely and seek immediate medical attention if they worsen. Have a good day, Mr. Orwin. .
