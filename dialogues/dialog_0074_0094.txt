DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Fontanazza. My name is Dr. Reisig, and I’m an internal medicine physician. It’s lovely to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you here?
PATIENT: Morning. Doctor… Reisig, right? Yes. My husband… he make appointment. Something about… learning. I forget. I just work with metal, you know? Very hard work. Sheets. Big sheets. Not easy.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Fontanazza, Reisig is correct. And it's perfectly alright if you're unsure of the specifics. Your husband likely scheduled this appointment for a general check-up, perhaps to establish care with a primary physician, or to discuss any concerns he might have about your health given the nature of your work. To start, could you tell me a bit more about this work with metal?
PATIENT: It's...loud. Very loud. And heavy. I cut it, bend it… sometimes it fly around, little pieces. We make… things for buildings? Or maybe… roofs. I don’t really pay attention. My hands always hurt. And dusty. Very dusty. I wear… a mask, I think. Sometimes. Husband buy it. Blue one. Not very good, maybe. Itches.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for explaining that. It sounds like physically demanding work in a potentially hazardous environment. The loud noise, heavy lifting, and metal dust are all things we'll want to address. You mentioned your hands hurt. Could you describe the pain?
PATIENT: It’s… ache. All the time, really. But worse after a long day. Like… when you squeeze something too hard, for too long. And my fingers… they get stiff. Hard to open jars sometimes. Husband help. He’s strong. It’s not… sharp pain. Just… tired. Bone tired, maybe. I don't know about bone. I just… work.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing chronic pain and stiffness in your hands, which is exacerbated by your work. "Bone tired" is a good way to describe it. We should take a closer look at your hands. Would you mind if I performed a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: Exam? Oh. Okay. If you must. But don’t take too long. I have things to do, you know? Metal doesn’t cut itself. I need to get back… soon. Husband need help with… something. Always something. Just… be quick, please.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Fontanazza. I'll be as efficient as possible. Okay, I'm just going to have you flex and extend your fingers and wrists for me, and I'll feel for any tenderness or limitations. Alright. I do notice some mild swelling in a few of your finger joints, and there’s a bit of decreased range of motion when you bend them. There is also some tenderness when I press here and here. Do you experience any pain in other joints, like your wrists, elbows, or knees?
PATIENT: Wrists…sometimes. A little. Not so bad. Like the hands. Just… ache. Elbows…no. Knees…maybe? I stand a lot. All day. But that’s just…standing. Old shoes, probably. I don’t think it’s…joints. Just tired legs. Like everything else. Husband say I need new shoes. He's always saying something.
DOCTOR: Okay, so mostly the discomfort is concentrated in your hands and wrists, with occasional aches in your knees likely related to prolonged standing. Now, let's talk about your overall health a little bit. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms—like fever, fatigue, weight loss, or any skin rashes?
PATIENT: Fever… no. Not that I remember. I get hot from the metal, you know? Very hot. And tired… always tired. But that’s…the work. Heavy sheets. Weight loss? I eat enough. Husband make sure of that. He cook good. Rashes… no. Skin is…skin. Sometimes itchy from the dust, but that's just the dust. It's always something. Always.
DOCTOR: Alright. That helps me to get a better understanding. You mentioned the dust—do you wear a mask consistently when you’re working with the metal?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Like I said, blue one. Husband buy. It’s not… tight. Air get in. And it itch. So I take it off sometimes. Hard to breathe with it on. And hot. Very hot. Metal is hot enough. I try to wave the dust away. Mostly it work. I think. Husband say I should wear it more. He’s always saying something. He worry too much.
DOCTOR: I understand. The mask doesn't seem to be providing adequate protection and it's causing discomfort, which makes consistent use difficult. It's good that your husband is concerned about your health and encouraging you to wear it, but it’s also important that it’s something you can comfortably use. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like arthritis, or any other health problems?
PATIENT: Arthritis? I don’t think so. Doctor never say anything. Just… aches. Like old lady. Husband mother have…something with her hands. Very bendy. But I’m not bendy. Just ache. I go to the… the bone doctor once. Long time ago. For my back. Lifting. Heavy sheets. He give me pills. Make me sleepy. I stop take them. Didn't help much. Just sleepy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no formal diagnosis of arthritis, but a history of back pain related to lifting, and you tried pain medication in the past which didn't provide much relief and caused drowsiness. It sounds like your husband's mother may have had a condition affecting her hands. One last question for now: are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Just...water. Lots of water. Very hot work. Need water. Husband give me…something sometimes. Orange juice. He say good for…something. I forget. No pills. No vitamins. Just water and…orange juice, I think. And sometimes, husband make tea. Very sweet. He worry too much. Always.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. Thank you for sharing all of this information with me. It sounds like you are experiencing chronic pain in your hands and wrists, possibly aggravated by your physically demanding work and inadequate protection from metal dust. Given your symptoms and work history, I suspect you may be experiencing early signs of osteoarthritis or another form of arthritis, potentially exacerbated by repetitive stress. However, to get a more definitive diagnosis, I would like to order some blood tests and X-rays of your hands and wrists. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh. More things. Husband will be happy. He always want more tests. Okay. If you think so. But…how long? I need to get back to work. Big sheets. They don't cut themselves, you know. And…how much will it cost? I don't have much money. Husband work hard. But…tests, okay. If you must. But quick, please. Quick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the time and cost, Ms. Fontanazza. We’ll try to make this as efficient as possible. The blood tests will help rule out other potential causes of your pain, and the X-rays will allow us to see the condition of the bones and joints in your hands. The cost will depend on the specific tests, but let's see if we can work with the clinic’s financial assistance program, or explore some lower-cost options. We can also discuss potential payment plans. I'll have the receptionist assist you with that after our consultation. To get the process started, I’m going to write an order for the blood work and X-rays. They can be done here at the clinic, or at a facility of your choosing. Would you prefer to do them here, or would you like a list of nearby options?
PATIENT: Here is fine, I guess. Easier. But…will it take all day? I really need to get back to the metal. And…can I still work? With the tests? Or do I have to just…sit? Husband will not be happy if I just sit. He need help. Always. Just…make it quick, please. And let me know about the cost. Before you…do anything. I don't want surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fontanazza. We will do the blood work here. It shouldn't take more than an hour or so. The X-rays will only take a few minutes. You can certainly still work after the tests, but depending on the results, I might recommend temporarily modifying your activities to avoid further strain on your hands. We can discuss that in more detail after we have the results. I’ll have the receptionist provide you with a detailed cost estimate before we proceed with anything. She will also explain the financial assistance options available. Let me just finish writing the orders, and then we can schedule the tests for you. Is there a particular day or time that works best?
PATIENT: Tomorrow is good. After lunch. Husband need help in the morning. But…after lunch, okay? And…promise me you won't make me sit all day waiting for results? Metal…it's important. Husband…he depend on me. Just…quick, okay? Quick tests, quick results. That’s all I ask. And…cheap. Please. Husband work very hard.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Fontanazza. I understand your concerns, and I'll do my best to accommodate your schedule and get the results back as quickly as possible. We’ll schedule the tests for tomorrow afternoon. I’ll also request that the lab prioritize the results so we can review them sooner rather than later. I've made a note of your financial concerns, and the receptionist will be able to provide you with all the relevant information regarding potential assistance programs. Here's what we'll do: tomorrow afternoon, you'll come in, we'll draw some blood and take the X-rays. We'll then send those off to the lab, and I’ll contact you as soon as the results are available to discuss them and formulate a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes. That sound… okay. Tomorrow. Afternoon. Quick. And…not too expensive. Please. Husband… he’ll be happy. He always worry. That's all. And thank you. For… not making me sit all day. I need to get back to the metal. It's important.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fontanazza. I understand how important your work is, and I’ll do everything I can to help you manage your pain and get back to it as quickly as possible. The receptionist is ready to assist you with scheduling the tests and discussing the financial options. She’s just outside the door. Thank you for coming in today, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment tomorrow.
