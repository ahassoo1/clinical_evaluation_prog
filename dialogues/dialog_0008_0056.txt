DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. I’m Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. What brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t the time for this. It’s… the students. They simply don’t appreciate knowledge anymore. It’s… demoralizing. I suppose that’s the word. And the paperwork… endless paperwork. I used to run a very efficient library. Very efficient. Now… it’s all quite dreadful.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be frustrating when things aren’t going as planned. Just to clarify, Mr. Schlatterer, are you experiencing any physical symptoms that are making it difficult to continue your work, or are we primarily discussing the stress related to these challenges?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms? Oh, goodness, no. Not exactly. A bit of… fatigue, perhaps. But that’s to be expected at my age, wouldn’t you agree? It’s more… a weariness of the soul, Doctor. A distinct lack of… respect. Honestly, these young people… they haven't the slightest clue. I don’t believe I’m explaining myself very well. This is rather… inefficient.
DOCTOR: No, you're explaining perfectly well. Fatigue can certainly be a symptom of many things, and stress can definitely contribute to that. Let's try to get a clearer picture of this fatigue. On a scale of one to ten, with one being barely noticeable and ten being completely debilitating, how would you rate your typical energy level these days?
PATIENT: A scale? Really, Doctor? Must we quantify everything? Well… if I must. I suppose… a four. Perhaps a five on a bad day. But that’s entirely due to… external factors. The lack of motivated students, the pointless meetings… it’s all very draining. Honestly, it feels like I’m educating… stones. A four, I maintain. A generous four.
DOCTOR: A four, alright. And has this level of fatigue been consistent, or has it been getting worse lately?
PATIENT: Worse? Of course it’s worse! Everything is worse! The world is… declining, Doctor. But to be specific… yes, it’s been a gradual… erosion. It wasn’t always this… draining. In the old days, students eagerly sought knowledge. Now… they stare at their… devices. It's a complete lack of discipline. It’s been getting worse for… oh, I don’t know, a few years, perhaps. It’s all rather… blurry, to be frank. I'm not one for remembering dates.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the fatigue and feeling drained, have you noticed any other changes lately?
PATIENT: Changes? Well, my digestion isn’t what it used to be. And I find myself… irritable. Easily irritated, you understand. By… incompetence. And… well, my sleep isn't restful. I wake up… thinking about the essays that need grading. Dreadful, simply dreadful. Honestly, I doubt it’s anything medical. It’s simply the… state of things. A very unsettling state, indeed.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some changes in digestion, increased irritability, and trouble sleeping. Are you experiencing any pain with your digestion – stomach pain, cramping, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not pain. Discomfort. A general… unsettled feeling. It's not like I'm doubled over, Doctor. It’s more… a lack of appetite, perhaps. Everything tastes… bland. And I find myself… skipping meals. It's hardly a medical crisis. Honestly, I suspect it’s just the… stress. It's a very stressful profession, you know. Surrounded by… apathy.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. We’ve covered a lot here. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, just to rule out any underlying medical issues that could be contributing to these symptoms. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An exam? Doctor, really? Must we? I assure you, I've been examined thoroughly in the past. However… if it will expedite this process… very well. But please, be quick about it. I have papers to grade, you see. And honestly, I doubt it will reveal anything of consequence. It's simply… the students. Always the students.
DOCTOR: Certainly, sir. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Let’s start with your blood pressure and pulse. Please extend your arm. Your blood pressure is 135/85 and your pulse is 78. A little elevated, but within a range we can monitor. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Breathing sounds are clear. Heart sounds… regular, but slightly faint. Now, I'll take a look at your throat and ears. Throat looks normal, ears are clear. And finally, I'm going to feel your abdomen. It's a little tender in the lower quadrants, but no masses or anything concerning.
PATIENT: Tender? Well, naturally. One doesn't spend a lifetime dealing with… intellectual mediocrity without some… internal distress. Honestly, Doctor, I fail to see what all this poking and prodding will achieve. It's simply… a symptom of the times. A very unsettling symptom, indeed. Can we please be finished now? I have a stack of essays awaiting my attention. And frankly, I’m beginning to lose patience.
DOCTOR: Alright, sir. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam, it seems like we’re dealing with a combination of stress, fatigue, and some digestive upset. The mild tenderness in your abdomen could be related to that, but it’s not significant enough to be overly concerning at this point. However, I’d like to order some routine blood work – a complete blood count and a metabolic panel – just to get a baseline and rule out anything else that might be going on. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Blood work? Really, Doctor? Must we subject me to more indignities? Very well. If it will finally allow me to return to my… duties, then yes, I suppose. But I trust it won’t be a lengthy process? I have a schedule to maintain, you see. And honestly, I suspect it will reveal nothing of consequence. It's simply… the state of education these days. A very… disheartening state, indeed. Just please, expedite the process. I have papers to grade.
DOCTOR: Certainly, sir. The blood work is fairly standard and shouldn’t take long. The lab is just down the hall. I'll have the results sent to me and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in about a week. In the meantime, I recommend trying to incorporate some stress-reducing activities into your routine – perhaps some light exercise, meditation, or simply spending time doing things you enjoy. And please, if your symptoms worsen, don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Here’s the requisition and a list of local labs. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: Questions? No, Doctor, I have no questions. Frankly, I find the entire process… unnecessary. However, I appreciate your… efforts, I suppose. I shall schedule a follow-up appointment. Although, I doubt it will reveal anything of consequence. Stress-reducing activities? Honestly, the only activity that reduces my stress is… grading papers. Thank you, Doctor. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have duties to attend to. .
