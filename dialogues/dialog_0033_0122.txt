DOCTOR: Right. Venus Alvara. 53. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor... Dechane, yes? It is… concerning. I find I am… forgetting things. Small things, mostly. But more often now. And my blood pressure… it has been quite high lately. My husband… he always watched it for me. Now, it is just… me. I want to understand what is happening, if you please.
DOCTOR: Yes, Dechane. And yes, I see that you've noted some memory issues and elevated blood pressure. “Small things, mostly” isn’t particularly helpful, I must say. Can you give me some specific examples of these “small things”?
PATIENT: Oh. Forgive me. Specific… yes, of course. Yesterday, I went to the market for milk and… I completely forgot why I was there when I arrived. I just stood there, looking at the produce. And… last week, I scheduled a meeting with the landscaping company, but I cannot recall the time. I had to check my calendar three times. It is… frustrating. And worrying. I do not like feeling… not myself.
DOCTOR: Right. So, some difficulty with recent memory. And the blood pressure… is there a record of recent readings you can provide?
PATIENT: Yes, I have them here. My husband… he kept very good records. Let me see… July 18th, 152 over 94. July 25th, 160 over 98. And this morning, before I came… 158 over 102. It is usually around 140, normally. But it has been creeping up, I think. He always said to come if it stayed above 150.
DOCTOR: Alright. Elevated, certainly. We’ll need to get a more accurate reading here, of course. Let's get you situated and I'll take a look. And then we can discuss some basic blood work. It’s likely just stress, honestly, but we need to rule things out. Sit here, please.
PATIENT: Very well. Stress… yes, it has been a difficult year. I understand. Ruling things out is… sensible. Please, proceed as you see fit, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Right. Just relax your arm… and breathe normally. 164 over 105. As expected. We'll need to repeat this reading a few times to confirm, but it's definitely elevated. Now, tell me, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Sometimes, a slight headache, at the back of my neck. Not severe, but… persistent. And lately, I have been feeling… a little dizzy when I stand up quickly. Also, I find my vision… blurs sometimes. Very briefly, but it is concerning. I thought it was just my eyes getting older, honestly.
DOCTOR: Headaches, dizziness, blurred vision… Right. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications, Doctor. Never have. And no allergies, to my knowledge. I have always been quite healthy, until… recently. My husband always said I was strong as a horse. He liked to say that. He made sure I ate well, exercised… everything. It is just… different now.
DOCTOR: Well, "strong as a horse" doesn't preclude developing medical issues, Mrs. Alvara. It's simply a… statement. Now, let's try a brief neurological exam, just to get a baseline. Can you follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Of course, Doctor. I understand. It is… sensible to check everything thoroughly. There. Is that alright? Do I need to look further to the side? Please, just tell me what to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Strength appears normal. Reflexes… slightly diminished, but not alarming. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… My mother… she had high blood pressure, yes. She was treated for it, for many years. She lived to be 82, but the last few years were… difficult. My father… he was quite healthy, actually. He had a strong heart. No history of… memory problems, as far as I know. My brother… he is healthy as well, living in Moscow. We do not speak often. He is a… scientist.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a family history of hypertension. That’s… relevant. Now, let’s discuss your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. My husband… he did not approve. And I have never had the inclination. I drink tea, sometimes. And I enjoy gardening. Very peaceful. I do not… socialize much, since he passed. Mostly just keep to myself, and tend to my roses.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, that’s… helpful. Look, Mrs. Alvara, while I appreciate you sharing this information, it's all rather… vague. Hypertension, likely exacerbated by stress and perhaps some mild cognitive impairment, is the most probable explanation for your symptoms. We’ll need to monitor your blood pressure closely, and I'm going to order some routine blood work to rule out any underlying causes. I’ll also give you a prescription for a low-dose antihypertensive. Start with that, and schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks. If your symptoms worsen significantly, come back immediately. Here's the lab requisition and the prescription. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: Routine blood work… yes, of course. And the medication… I understand. Two weeks… very well. Honestly, Doctor, it feels… rushed. And the memory problems… you say mild cognitive impairment, but… is that all it could be? I am a property manager. I need to be sharp. I worry about making mistakes. Are there… any other tests you would recommend? Something more thorough? It is just… important to be certain, if you understand. I simply want to know what is happening.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Alvara, I understand your concerns, but frankly, you are presenting with fairly typical symptoms of stress-related hypertension and mild age-related cognitive decline. Ordering a battery of unnecessary tests would be both costly and, in my professional opinion, unproductive. We’ll monitor your blood pressure and see how you respond to the medication. If your symptoms persist despite treatment, then we can consider further investigation. But for now, I recommend focusing on stress reduction techniques – perhaps some relaxation exercises or light gardening. Now, is there anything else, or shall we conclude this appointment?
PATIENT: Gardening… yes, I do that already. And stress reduction… it is not quite so simple, Doctor. Very well. If you believe that is the best course of action… then I will follow your instructions. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I suppose I will schedule a follow-up appointment. .
