DOCTOR: Good morning, Chanz. I'm Dr. Finco. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, to be honest, I don’t really remember making the appointment. My… wife did, before… well. Anyway, she wanted me to get checked out, something about not sleeping right and, uh, getting… fitter? That was her thing. I just fix pianos, you know? Don't really need much fitness for that. I suppose I've been a bit tired lately, but who isn't?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Chanz. It sounds like your wife was looking out for you, wanting to make sure you were feeling your best. It’s very common for people to schedule appointments with good intentions, and then things get a little…fuzzy. Don’t worry about the appointment itself. So, you mentioned being tired lately. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yeah, fuzzy is a good word for it. She always liked things organised. Right, tired… well, it’s not like falling-down exhausted, more… persistent. Like a low hum of it, all the time. I wake up feeling… not refreshed, let's say. And I get these little dips during the day. Just sort of… blah. It doesn’t stop me working, mind you. I just… push through it. Honestly, I've probably always been a bit like this. It's just… more noticeable now, I suppose. I don't know. Is there a question in there somewhere?
DOCTOR: There is, Chanz, thank you for explaining. It's helpful to know it's more of a persistent tiredness than something sudden. And you're right, it's good you can still work. When you say “dips during the day”, can you describe those a little more?
PATIENT: Hmm… dips. Right. Okay. It’s like… I'm concentrating on a piano – maybe a tricky bit of repair, tuning a specific string – and then my focus just… wanders. Like a radio losing signal. I have to really make myself concentrate to get it back. It doesn't happen every time, just… frequently enough to be annoying. And sometimes… sometimes I just feel a bit… off. Like something’s missing. I don't know how to explain it better than that. It's not painful or anything, just… not right. I haven't had any headaches or anything like that, if that’s what you were going to ask. I mostly just drink tea to get through it. Strong tea.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for clarifying. That’s helpful. “Radio losing signal” is a very good way to describe it. And no headaches, that's good to know. You mentioned strong tea – how much tea would you say you drink in a day?
PATIENT: Oh, um… a lot. Probably… six or seven mugs? Maybe more on a busy day. It’s builder’s tea, you know? Proper strong stuff. My wife… she used to tell me I was going to turn into a teapot. She had a good sense of humour. I don’t really drink coffee. Never got into it. Just tea. And maybe a biscuit or two with it. Don’t tell anyone, it’s probably terrible for me. I should probably drink more water, I suppose. Everyone says that.
DOCTOR: Six to seven mugs of strong tea… yes, that's quite a bit. And you’re right, staying hydrated is important. No judgement here, Chanz. We all have our habits. To get a better picture of what’s going on, could you tell me a little about your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… hmm. It’s… okay. I get to sleep alright, usually. It’s staying asleep that's the problem. I wake up… a lot. Probably three or four times a night. Sometimes I can get back to sleep straight away, sometimes I lie there for ages. And even when I do get back to sleep, it doesn't feel… restorative, you know? Like I haven’t really been asleep. I don't toss and turn or anything, just… wake up. And sometimes I have… strange dreams. Not nightmares, just… odd. Difficult to remember them, though. I don't really have a routine, either. I go to bed when I'm tired. It's not very scientific, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Chanz, many people don't have a strict routine. It sounds like you’re getting some sleep, but it’s not necessarily quality sleep. And those odd dreams are interesting to note. Now, to get a broader understanding, could you tell me a little bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history… oh, dear. That’s… vague, I'm afraid. I haven't really had much medical history. I've always been pretty healthy, you know? Knock on wood. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, chickenpox, that sort of thing. Nothing serious. I haven't been to a doctor in… well, years. Probably not since my wife… Look, I’m not very good with remembering dates or details. I had a bad knee once, playing football when I was younger, but that healed up fine. And I get hay fever in the summer, but that’s just annoying, not serious. I'm not on any medication. And I don't have any allergies, as far as I know. I really haven't had much to tell a doctor before. Is this… important?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Chanz. It’s very common to have a limited medical history, and that’s good to know. No, it’s not necessarily important, but it helps me get a full picture. Just to be thorough, could you tell me about any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… hmm. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. And he had a heart attack when he was quite young. My mother… she had arthritis, badly. She was in a wheelchair for the last few years of her life. And my sister… she’s fine, as far as I know. Lives in Syria, I don’t see her much. And my wife's family… I don’t really know them. We didn’t keep in touch much, to be honest. So, high blood pressure and arthritis, I suppose. That’s about all I can remember. It's not a very helpful answer, is it? I’m sorry. I really am terrible with details. Is there a test I can take? I'm better at doing things than remembering things.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Chanz. Knowing about the high blood pressure and arthritis is useful information. And please, don't apologise – you’re doing just fine. It’s perfectly alright to not remember details, and you're not being tested. Now, to wrap things up a bit, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… oh. Well, I fix pianos. All day. It's mostly sitting. I have to lift heavy bits sometimes, but it’s not regular exercise, you know? I eat… okay, I suppose. I like a good roast dinner on a Sunday, and I have biscuits with my tea. I don't really snack. And I don't really… socialize much. My wife… she used to organise things, but… Since then, I mostly just keep to myself. I don't smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with my dinner occasionally. I don't do any sports, and I don't really have any hobbies. I used to play chess, but I haven't played in ages. It’s not a very exciting lifestyle, is it? A bit… sad, probably. I should probably get out more. I just… don't really feel like it. Is this… what you were asking?
DOCTOR: That’s very honest, Chanz. And thank you for sharing. It sounds like you’ve been through a lot recently. It’s perfectly alright to not have a very exciting lifestyle at the moment. Alright, Chanz. I think I have a good enough understanding of things now. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a clearer picture. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's… fine. Whatever you think is best. A physical exam… I haven't had one of those in years, either. I suppose it’s a good idea. Just… don't expect too much. I'm not exactly in peak condition, you know? And please, go easy on me. I don’t like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: Of course, Chanz. I’ll be as gentle as possible. We'll just do some basic checks – blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and a quick look at your ears, nose, and throat. It shouldn’t take long, and I’ll explain everything as I go. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me… that’s good. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, let's listen to your heart… Your heart rate is a little fast, but regular. Nothing concerning at this point. Now, I'm just going to listen to your lungs… Sounds clear. No wheezing or crackling.
PATIENT: Right. Okay. Sounds… normal, I suppose. I haven’t really got anything to compare it to. My wife… she always told me I needed to see a doctor more often. She was always right about these things. Is 140 over 90 bad? I don’t want to end up like my father. And is my heart beating fast because I'm nervous, or is it… something else? Sorry, I’m probably being a nuisance. I just… don't like feeling out of control.
DOCTOR: You’re not a nuisance at all, Chanz. It’s good you’re asking questions. 140 over 90 is slightly elevated, but it’s not drastically high, and it can be caused by many things, including stress or anxiety – and being in a doctor's office can certainly do that! We'll want to monitor it over time. As for your heart rate, it is a little fast, but it could be due to the stress of the appointment, or even the caffeine from your tea. Now, I'm just going to take a quick look in your ears… Ears look clear. No sign of infection. And I’ll just take a quick look at your throat… Throat looks fine. No redness or swelling. Everything seems to be within normal limits physically, but your slightly elevated blood pressure and heart rate, combined with your fatigue and sleep issues, suggest we should investigate further.
PATIENT: Right. Okay. So… not too bad, but not good, either. Investigate further… what does that involve? Blood tests? I hate needles. And more poking and prodding? Honestly, I'd rather just go home and have a cup of tea. It's probably just… stress, like you said. I’ve had a lot on my mind lately. Maybe if I just… tried to relax a bit more. It’s easy to say, harder to do, though. My wife… she always knew what to do. She'd probably have me doing yoga or something. I'm not very good at yoga. Is there anything… anything I can do right now? Something simple? Besides drinking more water?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Chanz. It's perfectly alright to feel anxious about tests, and we can definitely discuss options. Blood tests would be helpful to rule out any underlying causes for your fatigue and sleep issues, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. I wouldn't suggest anything we don’t feel is necessary. And you’re right, stress could be a major factor. For something simple you can do right now, let's focus on some breathing exercises. It sounds silly, but deep, slow breathing can help lower your heart rate and blood pressure. We can practice one now, if you're comfortable. It's called diaphragmatic breathing. It involves breathing deeply into your abdomen, rather than your chest. Inhale slowly through your nose, feeling your stomach rise… and then exhale slowly through your mouth, letting your stomach fall. We can do a few repetitions together. Would you like to try?
PATIENT: Diaphragmatic breathing… sounds… complicated. I’ve never really thought about how I breathe before. I just… do it. But… alright. If it’ll help, I suppose it’s worth a try. My wife… she used to do mindfulness exercises. She said it helped her calm down. I never really understood it, to be honest. Inhale… stomach rising… exhale… falling… Is that right? It feels… strange. And I keep wanting to take another breath. It’s making me feel… more anxious, if I’m honest. I’m probably doing it wrong. Maybe I’m just not cut out for this sort of thing. Perhaps a cup of tea would be better. A very strong cup of tea.
DOCTOR: It is a bit awkward at first, Chanz. And it's perfectly alright if it doesn't feel comfortable. You’re not doing it wrong, it just takes practice. And if it’s making you feel more anxious, we’ll stop. There's absolutely no pressure. Perhaps breathing exercises aren't for you right now. That’s perfectly alright. Let’s talk about the next steps. I recommend a blood test to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and basic blood count. It will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. We can also monitor your blood pressure for a week, at home, to see how it fluctuates. Do you have a blood pressure monitor at home?
PATIENT: No, I don't have a blood pressure monitor. My wife… she had one, but I haven’t seen it since… well. Never mind. Blood tests… alright. I suppose I’ll have to do them. I hate needles, but… if it’ll help. Where do I go? And how long will it take? And will it hurt? I'm probably asking too many questions, aren’t I? I just… don’t like surprises. I’d rather know what’s coming. And is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood test? Fasting? Drinking more water? Less tea? Honestly, it’s all very confusing. Perhaps… perhaps I should just go home and have that cup of tea. It's probably just stress, like you said. A very strong cup of tea.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too many questions at all, Chanz. It’s perfectly alright to be concerned, and it's good you're asking. You’ll need to go to the lab downstairs. They're very efficient and the nurse is excellent. It will take about 15-20 minutes, including paperwork. It will sting briefly, but it’s a quick pinch and it will be over before you know it. For the blood test, you don't need to fast, but please avoid drinking caffeine for a few hours beforehand. And yes, perhaps cutting back on the tea for today might be a good idea. I'll write you a referral for the lab and a list of instructions. We can schedule a follow-up appointment next week to discuss the results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright. A referral… and instructions. And no tea. This is all very… disruptive. But… alright. Next week… yes, that sounds alright. I suppose. As long as it doesn’t involve too much poking and prodding. And… and what if the results are bad? What if it is something serious? I don’t think I could… I don’t know. My wife… she always knew what to do. Perhaps… perhaps I should just take it one step at a time. The referral… the instructions… and then… then we'll see. I'm probably worrying too much. It's probably just stress, like you said. A very strong cup of tea. But… thank you. For… for explaining everything. And for being patient. I’m not very good at this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chanz. And you’re absolutely not worrying too much. It's perfectly normal to feel anxious about these things. And you've handled everything very well. We’ll take it one step at a time, and we’ll face whatever comes together. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. And please, try not to stress too much. Here’s the number for the lab. And remember, I’m here to support you. And if you’re feeling overwhelmed, it’s okay to lean on others. Take care, Chanz. And please, try to get some rest.
