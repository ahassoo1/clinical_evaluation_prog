DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Theriot, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's me. Look, I don’t usually bother with doctors, honestly. But my aunt… she just got diagnosed with something pretty bad. Runs in the family, apparently. I just want to make sure I’m okay, you know? Preventative stuff.
DOCTOR: Preventative is… sensible, I suppose. Though, frankly, worrying about family history without symptoms is often… unnecessary. Still. Let’s get this over with. What exactly prompted you to come in today?
PATIENT: Unnecessary? Really? Look, it's easy for you to say. You don't have a family full of…well, let's just say things. My aunt has…stomach cancer, I think it was. And my grandfather, on my mother's side, had something with his lungs. It's not just worrying, it’s…being responsible. I want to know if I need to be doing anything. Tests, or…whatever. I don’t want to end up like them.
DOCTOR: Stomach cancer and lung issues…right. And you’re experiencing what symptoms that have led you to believe you’re at risk?
PATIENT: Symptoms? That's the thing! I don’t have any symptoms. That’s why I’m here! I don't want to wait for symptoms. Isn't that the point of a check-up? To find things before they become a problem? It feels like you're deliberately trying to dismiss me.
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Theriot, I'm not dismissing you. It’s simply… inefficient to run a battery of tests on someone without a clinical indication. It wastes resources. Still, if you insist. Let's start with a basic review of systems. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my weight? Not really. I mean, a pound or two, maybe. I try to eat reasonably well, but…work keeps me busy. It fluctuates a bit, but nothing drastic. Honestly, I'm pretty slim as it is. I don't exactly have a lot of weight to lose. Is that important? Is that what you’re getting at?
DOCTOR: It’s relevant. Any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Look, I'm telling you, I feel fine. Perfectly fine. I eat, I sleep, I work. I haven’t thrown up in…years. And my…bowel habits are regular, if you must know. This is getting ridiculous. I came here for peace of mind, not a twenty-question game about my…digestion. You’re making me feel like I’m wasting my time, and yours.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My mother would kill me. And frankly, it’s disgusting. Is everyone going to ask me about smoking? It feels like you’re assuming I’m some kind of…reckless person. I thought you were supposed to be a professional.
DOCTOR: And alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Socially. I mean, a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. A beer with friends on a Friday. Nothing excessive. I don't…drink to excess, if that's what you're implying. I have a job, a life. I'm not an alcoholic. Honestly, you're starting to irritate me. Is this standard procedure for everyone, or are you just…disapproving of my lifestyle?
DOCTOR: Do you have any shortness of breath, wheezing, or chest pain?
PATIENT: No! I just told you, I feel fine. Look, I’m an engineer. I spend most of my day at a desk, okay? Not running marathons. I don’t get breathless walking to the coffee machine. This is… patronizing. Are you always this… dismissive with your patients? I came here because I'm concerned about my family history, not because I think I'm dying. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Theriot. I’ve documented your concerns. Given your insistence despite a lack of symptoms, and your…anxiety, I will order a basic metabolic panel and a complete blood count. It’s unlikely to reveal anything, but it will hopefully…alleviate your concerns. I suggest you schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results. .
