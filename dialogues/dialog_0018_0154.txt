DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wease. My name is Dr. Stilaire. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Please, have a seat. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Yes, well… it’s my waterworks, really. Been botherin’ me again. It’s…difficult to explain properly, you see. It just…hurts when I go. It's happened a few times now, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand. It can be difficult to discuss these things, so please don’t feel embarrassed. “Hurts when you go” is a good start. Could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Oh, it's not…a sharp pain, exactly. More of a…burnin’ feeling. And a bit of a ache. Down low, you understand. It’s not constant, thankfully. Just when…well, when I need to use the ladies’ room. It goes away after, mostly. I just...don't like it. It’s uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Wease. A burning sensation and ache “down low” specifically when urinating. And it resolves after you finish urinating, is that correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Resolves…is that what you call it? Yes, after I’m finished. Though sometimes…sometimes it lingers a little. Not too bad, mind you. Just…noticeable. And I feel like I need to go often, even when I haven’t had much to drink. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It does make perfect sense, Ms. Wease. Both the lingering discomfort and the increased frequency are important details. Now, has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Oh dear…changed? Let me see… not that I recall. My routine is…well, it’s pretty much the same every day. I work on the campers, come home, have my tea… Honestly, Doctor, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I'm afraid I couldn’t tell you if something had changed. Perhaps my…soap? I got a new kind last month, I think. A lavender one.
DOCTOR: Thank you for thinking about that. We'll certainly keep that in mind. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical history… I had a touch of the flu a few years back, but that was all. And my arthritis, of course. It flares up in my hands sometimes, makes it hard to grip the tools. But other than that…not that I know of. My ex-husband, bless his soul, always handled the doctor’s visits. I didn't pay much attention to it all. And now…well, it's been a long time. I'm not insured, you see. So I don't go unless I really have to.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for things to be managed by a spouse, and it’s perfectly alright that you haven’t needed to be actively involved in your medical care until now. We’ll do our best to get a good picture of things. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… let me think. When I was a girl, I had my tonsils taken out. That was a long time ago, of course. And…oh! I broke my wrist once, falling off a bicycle. But that was it, I believe. No major surgeries, no. Just the tonsils and the wrist. I really don’t get sick much, thankfully. It's a nuisance when I do, though. Makes it hard to work.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Wease. Tonsillectomy as a child and a broken wrist, that’s helpful. Now, could you tell me about your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… Well, my ex-husband, Harold, passed away some years ago. We didn't have any children. My mother, she’s gone now too. I have a cousin, Maria, but we don’t see each other much. She lives in Florida. As for medical problems… I honestly don't know. I wasn't close enough to them to be aware of their health issues, I'm afraid. It’s been a long time, and I don’t really keep up with things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s alright if you don’t have that information. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol? Only a small glass of sherry with my tea on special occasions. And drugs? Heavens, no! I’m a respectable woman, Doctor. I work hard, I take care of my home… I don’t have time for such things. It’s a simple life, but it’s a good life.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Wease. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just the arthritis cream, Doctor. A little one for my hands. And sometimes, when my joints are really bothering me, I take an ibuprofen. Just the regular kind, you know, from the drugstore. Nothing else, I promise. No vitamins, no fancy supplements… I don’t believe in all that stuff, really. I try to eat healthy, but I'm not strict about it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Wease. Now, I would like to ask about any allergies you may have. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or environmental factors like pollen or animals?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… Not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I can remember. I used to help my mother in the garden, and I didn’t have any trouble with the pollen. And I love cats! Had a lovely tabby named Clementine when I was younger. Never sneezed, never got a rash… No, I don’t think I have any allergies, Doctor. I’m a pretty sturdy woman, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s very good to know, Ms. Wease. Now, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll also want to examine your abdomen and do a quick neurological assessment. We’ll also need to do a urine test. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well, I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. I haven’t had one in… well, a very long time. I’m not a fan of doctors poking and prodding, if you don’t mind me saying so. But if it will help, I’m willing. And the urine test…yes, I can do that. Just tell me where to go, and I’ll be as quick as I can.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. I understand your apprehension, and I will be as gentle and efficient as possible. First, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. If you could please sit up and lean back, that would be wonderful. Your heart sounds are regular, with no murmurs detected. Your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. I do not feel any masses. Now, I’ll just do a quick neurological assessment – checking your reflexes and balance. Your reflexes are normal, and your gait is steady. Now, let's get that urine sample. The restroom is just down the hall to your left. I’ll give you a cup, and I'll meet you back here when you're finished. Please try to collect a midstream sample, if you can.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. A midstream sample… I think I remember something about that. Just…start and then collect a little bit later? I hope I can manage it. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll be as quick as I can.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wease. Take your time. And please let me know if you have any trouble.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. I hope that’s alright. It was a bit awkward, if you don’t mind me saying so. Now, what happens next? Do you have to send it off to a lab?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Wease. Yes, this will need to go to the lab for analysis. It will help us determine if there is an infection or any other abnormalities present. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. While we are waiting for the lab results, based on your symptoms – the burning sensation, the frequent urination, and the lingering discomfort – and given the absence of fever or flank pain, I suspect you may have a urinary tract infection, or UTI. However, we need the lab results to confirm this. Until we get the results, I'm going to recommend you increase your fluid intake significantly – try to drink at least eight glasses of water a day – and avoid caffeine and alcohol, as these can irritate the bladder. We can also discuss a pain reliever to help manage your discomfort, if needed. Do you have any questions about that, Ms. Wease?
PATIENT: Oh, eight glasses of water… that’s a lot! I suppose I can try. And no caffeine… that will be difficult. I do enjoy my tea. But if it helps… I’ll do it. A UTI… is that serious, Doctor? And what if I do have it? Will I need…pills? I don’t like taking pills, you see. They always make me feel unwell.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be concerned, Ms. Wease. UTIs are very common, and thankfully, most are easily treated. If left untreated, they can become more serious and spread to the kidneys, so it’s important to address them promptly. In most cases, UTIs are treated with antibiotics, which are usually prescribed as pills for a week or so. I understand your reluctance to take pills, and we can discuss options to minimize any potential side effects. There are different types of antibiotics available, and we can choose one that is typically well-tolerated. In the meantime, if you experience any fever, chills, back pain, or blood in your urine, please contact me immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. These could be signs of a more serious infection. Now, do you have any allergies to antibiotics that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… allergies to pills… I don’t think so. Not that I remember. My ex-husband always handled the medication, you see. He would just give me what I needed, and I never asked questions. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can recall. But…if you need to know something specific, I might not be able to help. I really am sorry, Doctor. I wish I could be more helpful. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you see. It’s very frustrating. But I appreciate you trying to help me, nonetheless.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Wease. I understand. We’ll proceed with caution. Given your lack of known allergies, I’ll write a prescription for a standard antibiotic – nitrofurantoin – to start once we confirm the diagnosis with the lab results. It’s a relatively mild antibiotic and often well-tolerated. In the meantime, please continue to increase your fluid intake, avoid caffeine and alcohol, and monitor your symptoms. If you experience any worsening of your discomfort or develop any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to contact me. Here's the prescription and some helpful information about UTIs. Please read it carefully. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in a week to check on your progress and review the lab results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds very good, Doctor. A follow-up appointment… yes, that will be reassuring. Thank you so much for your help, Doctor. I really appreciate your patience with me. It’s not easy explaining things when I can’t quite remember everything. Is there anything else I need to do? Any special instructions? I want to make sure I do everything right.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wease. I'm happy to help. And please, don’t hesitate to ask questions if anything is unclear. The only other thing is to finish the entire course of antibiotics, even if you start feeling better before you’ve finished all the pills. Stopping early can lead to a recurrence of the infection. Also, if your symptoms don’t improve within a few days of starting the antibiotics, please contact me immediately. And lastly, I’ll send the lab results to this clinic, and the nurse will contact you when they are available. If you don’t hear anything within a week, please call the clinic to follow up. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Oh, finish the whole course… yes, I understand. Even if I feel better. And call if I don’t hear anything in a week. No, I think that’s everything. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. Thank you so much for your kindness and patience. I think I’ll be on my way now. I appreciate your help more than you know. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wease. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please, don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any concerns. Get well soon. .
