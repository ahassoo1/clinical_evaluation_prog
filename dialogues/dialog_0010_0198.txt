DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sugino. I'm Dr. Annesley. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, I've been thinking a lot lately about… how to be more present, you know? More calm. I’m interested in learning about mindfulness or meditation, if that’s something you can help with. I keep hearing good things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you’re interested in exploring techniques to manage stress and improve your overall well-being. That's excellent. While I'm a family medicine doctor and not a specialist in mindfulness specifically, we can certainly discuss it and I can offer some guidance and resources. Before we delve into that, could you tell me a little more about why you're feeling this need for more calm and presence now?
PATIENT: Well, my job… it's not bad, but it can be very… focused. Signal and track switch repair, you know? You really have to pay attention to every little detail. It’s important, of course, but sometimes I find my mind racing even when I’m not at work. I worry about missing something, or if I’ve done everything correctly. And that worry… it just sort of spills over into everything else. I guess I’m hoping mindfulness can help me quiet things down a bit. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A job requiring intense focus and responsibility can absolutely lead to that kind of mental fatigue and worry. It sounds like you’re experiencing some anticipatory anxiety, which is very common. To get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about how this anxiety manifests?
PATIENT: Well… it’s mostly just… thinking. Replaying things in my head. “Did I check the bolts on switch 4B correctly?” Or, “What if I missed a crack in the rail?” It doesn't usually stop me from doing my job, but it’s exhausting. And sometimes… it makes it hard to sleep. I'll be lying in bed, and just… go over everything again and again. It’s not panic, exactly. More like… a persistent hum of worry. I also find myself getting a little… short with people sometimes, which I don’t like.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful. So, repetitive thoughts, particularly related to your work, difficulty sleeping, and some increased irritability. Those are all consistent with what we often see with stress and anxiety. Have you experienced anything like this before, or is this a relatively new development?
PATIENT: It’s… newer. I’ve always been a bit of a worrier, to be honest. But it’s definitely gotten worse in the last year or so. There were some changes at work – a new supervisor, some new procedures. Nothing terrible, but it added a bit of… uncertainty. And my mother… she hasn’t been well, either. So, I think a lot of things have piled up. I used to be able to just… brush things off. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some life changes and a concern with your mother’s health on top of the work stress. That certainly explains a lot. Before we talk more about mindfulness techniques, I’d like to ask a few routine questions about your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, and I get the usual colds and flu, but nothing major. My blood pressure is a little high sometimes – the doctor told me to watch my salt intake – but it’s usually okay if I’m careful. I take a vitamin D supplement, because I don't get much sun. Other than that… pretty healthy, actually. I try to eat well and I walk whenever I can. Do you need a list of any medications I’ve taken? I can get that from my pharmacy, if you like.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. No, a list isn't necessary right now. Just the vitamin D is helpful to know. And good on you for taking preventative steps with your diet and exercise. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother, as I mentioned, hasn’t been well. She has some heart problems, and arthritis. My father… he passed away a few years ago, he had diabetes. And my brother… he's healthy enough, I think. Works in construction, always busy. No history of… mental illness, if that’s what you’re asking. Nothing like anxiety or depression. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, was a bit of a worrier, come to think of it. But that’s just… a personality trait, I always thought.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of heart disease and diabetes, and a grandmother with similar tendencies to you regarding worry. That’s helpful. Now, can you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone. I have a small apartment in town. I work shifts – sometimes days, sometimes nights. It changes every week. I don’t drink alcohol, and I don't smoke. I don't have any pets, unfortunately. I used to enjoy gardening, but I haven’t had much time for that lately. I like to read, mostly historical novels. And I keep in touch with my brother and a few friends. It’s… a quiet life, but it’s mine. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: No, that gives me a good sense of things. Just trying to get a full picture. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything. I’ve been stung by a bee once, but that was just a local reaction – a bit of swelling, but nothing serious. I used to worry about penicillin, because I heard some people were allergic, but I’ve never had to take it. So, no, I don't think I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s all very helpful. Thank you. Now, to get a better idea of how you’re functioning day to day, would you mind if I ask you a few questions about your sleep, energy levels, and appetite?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Ask away. As I said before, my sleep hasn’t been great lately. I have trouble falling asleep, and I wake up a lot during the night, replaying things in my head. My energy levels… they’re okay, but I’m often tired. And my appetite… it comes and goes. Sometimes I don’t feel like eating at all. It’s not a huge problem, but it’s noticeable. Does that make sense? I suppose I’m just… a bit out of sorts.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, and it sounds like these things are all connected. Trouble sleeping, fatigue, and fluctuations in appetite can all be symptoms of stress and anxiety. Before we discuss possible approaches, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to rule out any other underlying medical causes. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. I don’t mind. I haven’t had a proper check-up in a while, actually. So, that’s probably a good idea. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Great. If you could just change into one of these gowns, we'll start with your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'll take a look in your ears, nose, and throat, and quickly palpate your abdomen. It shouldn't take long. Oh, and for the record, your blood pressure is 138/82. A little elevated, but not alarming given your stress.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. I’ll just change here, then? Thank you for letting me know about my blood pressure. I guess that doesn't surprise me, to be honest. It's probably all the worry. Is it something I should be really concerned about?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re aware of it. It’s not immediately concerning, but it’s something we’ll keep an eye on. And as you said, stress can definitely play a role. While you’re changing, I’ll just make a quick note of that in your chart. Alright, if you could just sit up on the table, we’ll start with listening to your heart and lungs. Just try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: Okay, no problem. I’ll try to relax. It’s easier said than done sometimes.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles. Ears are clear. Throat is clear, no signs of infection. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpable. Everything seems normal from a physical perspective, which is good. It supports the idea that your symptoms are likely related to stress and anxiety, rather than a physical illness.
PATIENT: That’s… reassuring to hear, actually. I was worried it might be something else. So, what do you think I should do about it? You mentioned mindfulness earlier… is that something you recommend? I’ve seen some things online about meditation, but I don’t really know where to start.
DOCTOR: Yes, mindfulness and meditation are excellent starting points. They've been shown to be very effective in managing stress, anxiety, and improving sleep. They work by helping you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings without getting caught up in them. It’s like observing clouds passing by – you acknowledge them, but you don’t try to hold onto them. There are many different techniques, but a simple one to start with is focused breathing. Just finding a quiet place, closing your eyes, and focusing on your breath – the sensation of it entering and leaving your body. When your mind wanders – and it will – gently redirect your attention back to your breath. I can recommend a few apps, such as Headspace or Calm, that can guide you through some basic meditations. We also have some resources available here at the clinic, including a referral to a licensed therapist who specializes in mindfulness-based stress reduction. Would you be interested in learning more about that?
PATIENT: Those apps sound like a good place to start, actually. I’ve heard of Headspace, I think. And a therapist… well, I’ve never really considered that before, but it might be helpful to talk to someone. What does that involve? Is it… a lot of talking about my feelings?
DOCTOR: It can be, but it’s entirely up to you what you share. A therapist provides a safe, non-judgmental space to explore your thoughts and feelings at your own pace. They can help you identify the sources of your stress, develop coping mechanisms, and learn strategies for managing your anxiety. A typical session lasts about 50 minutes. They’ll likely ask you about your history, your current challenges, and your goals for therapy. There are different approaches to therapy, but a common one for anxiety is cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT, which focuses on changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. If you’re interested, I can give you a list of therapists in the area who accept your Medicare insurance. There’s no obligation, of course. You can also schedule a brief phone consultation with a few different therapists to see if they’re a good fit. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That would be very helpful. A list would be great. And a phone consultation… that sounds less intimidating than just booking a full session right away. I’m just… not used to talking about these things. But I suppose it’s worth a try.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. It takes courage to reach out for help, and it’s perfectly normal to feel nervous. I'm happy to provide you with the resources you need. Here's a list with their contact information and a brief description of their specialties. I’ve highlighted a few who specialize in CBT and accept Medicare. I also want to recommend some basic self-care strategies. Regular exercise, a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep are all essential for managing stress. And try to schedule some time for activities you enjoy, even if it's just for a few minutes each day. I'll also write a prescription for a low-dose sleep aid, just to help you get through the next few nights. It's not a long-term solution, but it can give you some relief while you're working on other strategies. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I feel… a little bit better already, just having talked about it. And I appreciate the list and the prescription. I’ll give some of these therapists a call. I think I'll start with Dr. Ramirez - the CBT specialization sounds good.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sugino. I’m glad I could help. Dr. Ramirez is an excellent choice. And remember, it takes time to find what works best for you. Be patient with yourself, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in about a month, just to check in and see how you’re doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. A month gives me time to try some things. Thank you again, Doctor Annesley. I really appreciate your time and advice.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sugino. It was my pleasure. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you again next month.
