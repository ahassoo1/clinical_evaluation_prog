DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Benites. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. I… how you say… telehealth visit, yes? My… friend, she make appointment for me. I not feel so good lately, but nothing… big. Just tired, maybe? Old bones, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see here that your friend assisted with the appointment. That's very kind of her. And you're right, feeling tired can be a symptom of many things. "Old bones," as you say, can certainly contribute, but we want to rule out anything else that might be going on. Just to clarify – when did you start feeling this tiredness, Ms. Benites?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is good question. Maybe… two, three months now? It come slowly. At first, I think just busy. Garden work, you know? But it not go away. Even when I rest, I feel… weak. Is hard to explain. And sometimes… my hands hurt. Not all the time, but when I do things… like, fix car, or cook.
DOCTOR: Okay, two to three months of progressive fatigue, even with rest. And pain in your hands with activity… that’s helpful. So, the hand pain – where exactly is it located?
PATIENT: Is in… all my fingers, mostly. And the base of my thumb. Sometimes, the wrist too. Is not… sharp pain. More like… ache. Dull ache. And it is worse in the morning. Very hard to open jars, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds like a dull ache in your fingers, thumbs, and wrists, worse in the mornings and making it difficult to grip. That gives us a bit more to work with. Ms. Benites, have you noticed any swelling in those joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… hmm. I not sure. Maybe a little? Sometimes they look… bigger, yes. But I think is just old age. My hands, they change. Is hard to say if is swelling, or just… how you say… puffiness?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. It can be difficult to tell. So, it sounds like some possible swelling, or at least a change in the appearance of your hands. Now, outside of the tiredness and hand pain, have you experienced any other symptoms – anything at all, even if it seems unrelated?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I have been… more cold than usual. Even in summer. My friend, she say I should wear sweater. And… oh! My skin is very dry. Like… paper. And sometimes… I feel little dizzy when I stand up fast. Is not so bad, but… I notice.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased sensitivity to cold, dry skin, and dizziness when standing up quickly. That's good information. Ms. Benites, have you had any fevers, weight loss, or any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I do not think so. No feeling hot. Weight loss… maybe a little? But I not… pay attention. I eat what I can. Bowel habits… is normal, yes? I go to bathroom every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, possible slight weight loss, and bowel habits are normal. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… doctor, long time ago, I have… what you call… high blood pressure. But is not so bad now. I take pills for it. And… I have arthritis, yes? In my knees. Is why I cannot walk so good sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, which you manage with medication, and arthritis in your knees. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I do not know the name. Is… white pill. Small white pill. I take it every morning. My husband, he always get it for me. Now… is my friend who get it. She knows everything. I just take pill.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Benites. We can certainly look that up in your records. And do you remember what you take for your arthritis?
PATIENT: Oh, just… something for the pain. Is… little pink pill. I take it when my knees hurt bad. Sometimes, I use cream too. The doctor give me the cream. Is… smelly cream.
DOCTOR: Okay, let me just pull up your records here to confirm these medications and get a better understanding of your medical history… Alright, it looks like you’ve been taking Lisinopril for your blood pressure for about five years, and Ibuprofen as needed for your arthritis. It also looks like you were prescribed a topical Diclofenac gel for your knees. Any of that sound familiar?
PATIENT: Yes! Lisinopril… that is the white pill. And Ibuprofen… is the one for pain. And… Diclofenac… is smelly cream! You are very good, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… long time ago, I have… appendix out. When I was young woman. And… I stay in hospital when I break my arm. Fall from tree, when I was little girl. But is very long time ago. Nothing recent.
DOCTOR: Okay, an appendectomy and a broken arm in the past. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? Oh… my husband, he… he is gone now. Long time ago. And I have one son. He live in Prague. I not see him very often. He is busy man.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Benites. And it sounds like your son is quite busy. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus?
PATIENT: Autoimmune…? Oh, goodness. I do not know. My mother, she have… something with her joints. Hurt bad when she old. But I do not know what is name. My father, he was healthy man. Never sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, some family history of joint problems, but no specific diagnoses. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I do not think so. Maybe… sometimes I get little itchy when I eat strawberries. But is not so bad. I can eat strawberries, just… little itchy.
DOCTOR: Okay, possible mild sensitivity to strawberries. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Never. I do not like smoke. My husband, he smoke, but I always make him go outside. And I do not drink. Is not good for health. And… no, no recreational drugs.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you, Ms. Benites. That gives me a very good overview of your medical history. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your joints for swelling and tenderness, and take your blood pressure. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is fine. Whatever you need.
DOCTOR: Okay, your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, let’s take a look at your joints… I’m noticing some mild tenderness in your knuckles and wrists on both hands. There’s no significant swelling, but your joints do feel a little warm to the touch. And your knees have a limited range of motion, as you mentioned. Your blood pressure is 135/80, which is slightly elevated but not critically high. Overall, the exam findings are consistent with some signs of joint inflammation. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests. These will help us rule out any underlying causes for your symptoms, such as rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Yes, if you think is good. Is not so bad, yes? I have had blood tests before. Is just… poke?
DOCTOR: Yes, just a little poke. It's a routine procedure, and we'll take all necessary precautions to make it as comfortable as possible. We'll check for things like inflammation markers, your complete blood count, and kidney function. I’m also going to order some X-rays of your hands and knees to assess for any structural changes. Would you be able to do that today?
PATIENT: X-rays…? Yes, I think so. Is close to here, yes? I can walk… slow. Maybe I need help?
DOCTOR: Yes, the X-ray facility is just down the hall. I can certainly assist you there. We’ll take it slow, and I’ll make sure you're comfortable. While we're waiting for the results, are there any medications you're currently taking over-the-counter for your pain?
PATIENT: Oh, sometimes I take… Ibuprofen. When my knees hurt very bad. And… sometimes I use the cream, the Diclofenac. Is the smelly cream. But I not take it every day. Just when is very bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. And just to clarify, how long have you been experiencing these symptoms overall?
PATIENT: Hmm… it start slowly, like I say. Maybe two, three months. But is worse now, in last few weeks. Is harder to do things, you know? Fix car, cook… even garden work. Is hard.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it's been a progressive process, and it's understandably impacting your daily life. Once we have the results of the blood tests and X-rays, we can get a clearer understanding of what’s going on and develop a plan to manage your symptoms. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think you explain everything very good. I just… hope is not so bad. I want to keep fixing cars. And garden.
DOCTOR: I understand. And that's what we're here for, Ms. Benites. We'll do everything we can to get you back to doing the things you enjoy. I'll go ahead and order those tests now. Once the results are available, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly – if you experience a sudden increase in pain, swelling, or fever – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic or go to the nearest emergency room.
PATIENT: Okay, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate everything.
