DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Mombrun. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. The pleasure is all mine. I requested a general wellness panel, if that’s what you mean. Just wanting to get a good look at how things are functioning, you understand. At my age, one likes to be… proactive. I believe the results are ready for review?
DOCTOR: A wellness panel, yes. Proactive is… sensible. Let me pull up those results here. Hmm. Yes, everything appears to be within normal limits at first glance. However, I do see a slightly elevated creatinine level. Now, that could be a number of things. Do you happen to know what your typical creatinine level has been in the past?
PATIENT: Creatinine, you say? To be honest, Doctor, I don’t make a habit of memorizing those numbers. I leave that to the professionals! This is my first time having this particular panel done, as such. I trust your judgement. Is it… something to be concerned about? Perhaps a consequence of the work I do? I'm a construction laborer, you see – quite physical.
DOCTOR: Well, it's not necessarily cause for immediate alarm, but it does warrant further investigation. Muscle breakdown, as you experience with construction work, can elevate creatinine. However, it's also an indicator of kidney function, and we wouldn’t want to overlook anything. I’d like to get a more complete picture. I’m going to order a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urinalysis to start. And, just to be thorough, I’ll also order a GFR – glomerular filtration rate – test. That gives us a better sense of how well your kidneys are filtering.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. A comprehensive look is always best. What does this entail, practically speaking? More blood work, I presume? And… will these tests require another appointment? I’m fairly busy with a project at the moment, though I can certainly make time for my health.
DOCTOR: Yes, further blood work is required, and a urine sample. It’s a standard procedure. The blood work will be similar to what you’ve already had, though we’ll be looking at a wider range of markers. The urine sample is… straightforward. I have a nurse who will provide you with a sterile container and instructions. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in approximately one week to discuss the results. Unless, of course, something comes back urgently, in which case my staff will contact you immediately. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we proceed?
PATIENT: No allergies to report, Doctor, thankfully. One less thing to worry about. A week sounds perfectly reasonable. And I appreciate the reassurance about urgent results. My wife would be quite concerned if I didn’t relay any news promptly. She’s a very… attentive woman. So, the nurse will provide the container and instructions? Is there anything I need to do to prepare for these tests? Diet restrictions, perhaps? Or should I adjust my medication in any way?
DOCTOR: No dietary restrictions are necessary at this time. And I wouldn’t advise altering your medication regimen without consulting with the prescribing physician. Do you currently take any medications, Mr. Mombrun?
PATIENT: Ah, yes, Doctor, apologies for not mentioning it sooner. I do take a low-dose blood pressure medication – Lisinopril, I believe it’s called. Prescribed by my primary care physician about five years ago. And occasionally, ibuprofen for aches and pains after a particularly strenuous day at work. Nothing else, I assure you. My memory isn't quite what it used to be, you understand.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Only when absolutely necessary. A few times a month, perhaps? It helps with the joint pain, you see. Construction is… hard on the body. I try to limit it, honestly. Is that… problematic? I hadn't realized it might interfere with these tests.
DOCTOR: It is problematic, Mr. Mombrun. Ibuprofen, and other NSAIDs, can negatively impact kidney function, especially in conjunction with Lisinopril. It's not ideal, and it complicates matters significantly. I strongly advise you to discontinue the ibuprofen immediately. And we will need to monitor your kidney function very closely. The nurse will give you instructions on how to properly collect a 24-hour urine sample. It’s important to be precise. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Discontinue the ibuprofen, you say? Very well, Doctor. I shall do so immediately. I hadn't realized it could be so detrimental. I trust your judgement implicitly. A 24-hour sample… That sounds… involved. I hope I can manage it. Could the nurse perhaps explain the procedure in detail? I confess, I'm not quite as nimble as I once was. These things become more challenging with age, you understand.
DOCTOR: The nurse is fully capable of providing detailed instructions. She’ll explain everything thoroughly. It requires diligence, yes, but it’s not an insurmountable task. I’ll also order a repeat Lisinopril level just to be certain. And I want to see you back here in one week, regardless of how the tests come back. This requires close monitoring. Now, do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No other conditions, Doctor. Aside from the usual aches and pains of an aging body, I’m quite healthy, all things considered. I had a bout of shingles a few years ago, but that cleared up completely. And I had my prostate checked annually for years, but the doctor said it was perfectly normal. Beyond that… nothing significant. Are you concerned, Doctor? You seem… rather serious. Is my creatinine level very elevated?
DOCTOR: It’s… elevated enough to warrant investigation, Mr. Mombrun. It’s not necessarily cause for panic, but complacency would be unwise. The Lisinopril and ibuprofen combination is… suboptimal, and the shingles could potentially have some bearing on kidney function. We need to rule out any underlying complications. I’m going to schedule a referral to a nephrologist, just to get a second opinion. It’s a precautionary measure, but it’s best to be thorough. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A nephrologist… A specialist? That does sound serious, Doctor. Is it possible… is it possible this is something more than just a reaction to the medication? My wife… she’s been worried about my energy levels lately. I haven’t been sleeping well, either. You're not… you're not suspecting something…serious, are you? Perhaps even…kidney failure? I apologize for being so direct, but I prefer honesty. It's better to know, you see.
DOCTOR: Mr. Mombrun, I understand your concern. It’s prudent to be forthright. While it's premature to discuss definitive diagnoses, it is essential to investigate the cause of the elevated creatinine. A referral to a nephrologist allows for a more specialized assessment. It is possible that there is an underlying issue, but it's equally possible that it’s simply a medication-related side effect. We need more information before drawing any conclusions. Here is a referral form for Dr. Anya Sharma, a highly respected nephrologist. Please schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And I will see you back here in one week to discuss the results of the initial tests. Do you have any questions regarding the referral?
PATIENT: Dr. Sharma, you say? Very well. I trust your judgement, Doctor. No, I don’t suppose I have any questions at the moment. Just… a great deal to process. I will schedule an appointment with Dr. Sharma immediately. Thank you, Doctor. For your honesty, and for your thoroughness. I appreciate it, truly. And I will discontinue the ibuprofen, as you advised. I suppose this is all part of getting older, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Mombrun. It is. The nurse will escort you out. Please, do not hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. And please, discontinue the ibuprofen immediately.
