DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Erxleben. I am Dr. GonzalezPerez. It says here you’re 32 years of age. Now, to what do we owe the pleasure of your visit today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, Christen Erxleben, 32. I’ve been… well, I’ve been awfully thirsty lately, and hungry too. More so than usual, I suppose. It’s been going on for a few weeks now.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say. And is this thirst…constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's… fairly constant, to be honest. I find myself reaching for water all the time. And then I'm hungry again soon after. It's a bit of a cycle, really. It's just… unusual for me.
DOCTOR: Unusual, yes. And has anything else changed?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I can readily think of. I've been… a bit more tired, perhaps? But work's been busy, so I just assumed it was that. I wouldn’t say it’s anything… drastic. I mean, I'm still getting by. It’s just… irritating, this thirst and hunger.
DOCTOR: Increased thirst and hunger for a few weeks, with some associated fatigue. Do you happen to know your approximate height and weight, Mr. Erxleben?
PATIENT: Right. Yes, well… I'm about five foot eight, I think. And… around 180 pounds. Give or take a few. It fluctuates, naturally. I haven't weighed myself properly in a bit, to be truthful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Changes in… urination? I… hadn't really paid much attention, to be honest. Now that you mention it… perhaps I'm going a bit more often? But again, with the amount of water I'm drinking, I figured that was to be expected. Is that… something I should be noting?
DOCTOR: Increased frequency of urination with increased fluid intake. Right. And do you have any family history of…diabetes, Mr. Erxleben?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Not that I’m aware of. My mother had high blood pressure, and my grandfather… well, he had a touch of everything, if I’m being honest. But no one specifically with diabetes, as far as I know. It’s not something we ever really discussed, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I see. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not currently. I haven't needed anything, thankfully. Just the usual over-the-counter things when I catch a cold, that sort of thing. No prescriptions or anything long-term.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: No allergies that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I’m fairly robust, I suppose. It’s just… this thirst is becoming a real bother. I’m hoping it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Erxleben, based on what you've told me—the increased thirst, hunger, frequency of urination—it could be indicative of a number of things. We'll need to do a few tests to rule things out. I’d like to perform a basic physical exam and order a blood glucose test. Is that agreeable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Anything to get to the bottom of it. A physical exam and a blood test… yes, that's perfectly agreeable. Let’s get it done. I have a meeting this afternoon, so the quicker we can manage it, the better.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you’ll just follow me. We’ll start with your vitals, and then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Afterwards, we’ll get the blood work ordered. Now, have you had a recent physical examination within the past year?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. It’s been… a few years, actually. Work gets in the way, you understand. I tend to put these things off until something’s actually wrong. Which, clearly, I’ve now done.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, preventative care is important. Alright, let’s begin. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure. …140 over 90. A little elevated, but not overly concerning at this stage. Now, let's listen to your heart. …Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs sound clear, good breath sounds bilaterally. Now, could you open your mouth for me, please?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There you go, Doctor. Feel free to take your time. I just... I'd rather get this sorted out quickly if possible. I have that meeting this afternoon, you see.
DOCTOR: Throat appears normal, no significant inflammation or lesions noted. Alright, Mr. Erxleben. Everything appears within normal limits during this initial examination, but the blood glucose test will be crucial. I'll get the order sent to the lab. It'll likely take an hour or two for the results to come back. Do you have any immediate concerns or questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not at the moment. Just… when will I know the results? And is there anything I should be doing in the meantime? Perhaps avoiding sugary drinks? I don’t really drink much soda anyway, but just in case. I’d rather not make things worse before we have an answer.
DOCTOR: The lab will contact you directly with the results, usually within two to three hours. To be safe, it’s prudent to avoid sugary beverages and excessive carbohydrates until we have the results. Stick to water, if possible. I'll also make a note of your meeting this afternoon, and we can discuss a follow-up plan once the results are available. Do you understand those instructions, Mr. Erxleben?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, perfectly. Water only, avoid carbs, and wait for the lab to call. And then we'll discuss a follow-up. Thank you. I appreciate your time, and hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. I really must get going soon.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse escort you to the waiting room. We’ll be in touch shortly. Should you experience any unusual symptoms—excessive thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision, unexplained fatigue—please seek immediate medical attention. That is all, Mr. Erxleben.
PATIENT: .
