DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Licano. I'm Dr. Fourney. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… chronic… fatigue, I think they said? It’s just… I’m always tired. Really tired. It's been going on for… a while now, honestly. I don't really keep track of dates so well anymore. It feels like forever.
DOCTOR: “Forever” isn’t terribly helpful, Ms. Licano. We need something to work with. But alright. Let’s try to narrow it down. When did you first start noticing this fatigue?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I know, I know. It’s just… things blur together, you see? Let me think… before my husband… passed. Yes, definitely before then. Maybe… six months before? It was getting harder to… do things. Even just getting out of bed was a struggle. It’s all a bit of a haze, if I'm honest.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll try to piece it together. Six months prior to your husband’s passing… that would put us around February, give or take. And you said it was making it harder to do things. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: February… yes, that sounds about right. Um… well, I used to love gardening. I had a beautiful rose garden, you see? But… I just stopped having the energy to keep it up. And then the housework… it piled up. Little things, really. But they added up. I just… couldn't. I’d start something, and then have to sit down. And then I’d just… stay sitting. It's very frustrating.
DOCTOR: So, difficulty with physical exertion. And just to clarify, Ms. Licano, this isn't just feeling a little tired after a long day?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no. It's not like that at all. This is… deeper. It’s like there's no energy to have a long day. Even if I slept all day, I’d still feel… drained. It's not just physical, either. Sometimes my brain feels foggy, like I'm trying to think through water. It's… hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Alright. Foggy thinking… fatigue that doesn’t improve with rest… We need to rule a few things out. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? Oh, dear. Let me think… I’ve been feeling… colder than usual, even in the summer. And… my appetite isn't what it used to be. I used to enjoy cooking, but now… food just doesn't seem appealing. And… sometimes my muscles ache, a little. Nothing terrible, just… a dull ache. I take Medicare, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Medicare is noted. Cold intolerance, decreased appetite, muscle aches… alright. Any recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, I think so. My clothes feel a little looser than they used to. I haven't weighed myself properly in ages, but… yes, I've lost some weight. I just haven’t been eating much. It's not deliberate, you understand. I just don’t feel hungry.
DOCTOR: And have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you're asking things… Um… yes. I suppose so. I… haven't been as regular, if you know what I mean. More… constipated, I think. It’s… unpleasant. I don't usually talk about these things.
DOCTOR: Right. Constipation… This is starting to paint a clearer picture, though we need to be thorough. Any headaches, dizziness, or changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Headaches… sometimes. Not terrible, just a dull ache, like… a pressure. And… yes, actually. I have been a little dizzy now and then. Nothing serious enough to fall, but… I feel a bit unsteady sometimes. My vision… I don't know. It seems… blurry sometimes, but I just assumed it was my age. I’ve always needed strong glasses.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s a difficult question. Let me see… my doctor… Dr. Schmidt, he passed away a few years back. He was a lovely man. He used to say I had… high blood pressure, I think? And… arthritis, in my hands. But that was a long time ago. It wasn't too bad.
DOCTOR: Hypertension and arthritis. Any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I had my gallbladder out, years ago. Maybe… twenty years? And… I was in the hospital once, when I broke my wrist. But that was just an overnight stay. Nothing serious. I’m trying to remember everything… it’s all a bit muddled.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. Let me see. I take something for my blood pressure… a little white pill. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my arthritis, when my hands are bothering me. That's it, I think. I don’t take many pills. I try not to.
DOCTOR: Do you know the names and dosages of those medications?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. No, I don't. I just… take what the doctor gives me. My husband used to manage all that. He… kept track of everything. I just hand him the bottles, and he makes sure I take the right ones. Now… I just try to remember to take something for my blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, this makes things… difficult. Let's move on to allergies. Any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies. No, I don't think so. I haven’t ever had a bad reaction to anything, that I know of. Maybe… a little itchy sometimes when I'm around cats, but that's just a mild irritation. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Never. My husband… he used to enjoy a little glass of wine with dinner, but I never cared for it. And I certainly don't do those things. I'm a good Romanian woman.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Licano. Given your symptoms and limited medical information, I’d like to do a physical exam and order some blood work. This will help us get a better understanding of what’s going on. Can we start with your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel… better. Please, let’s get this over with quickly if possible. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please sit comfortably with your back supported and your feet flat on the floor. 158 over 92. Elevated. Pulse is 78, regular. Temperature is 98.6. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, heart sounds are regular, but slightly rapid. Any chest pain or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. And no, I haven’t been short of breath. Just… tired. Always tired. This is taking a long time… Is everything alright? Are you finding anything?
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft, but I note some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, a little. It's not… sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Like a dull ache. Especially… over here, on the left side. Is that bad? I’m not usually bothered there.
DOCTOR: It’s something to investigate further. Now, let's check your reflexes and your neurological function. Reflexes are slightly diminished, but within normal limits. No significant neurological deficits noted. Now, I'm going to check your thyroid gland. Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, and there is some mild tenderness to palpation.
PATIENT: Enlarged…? Oh dear. What does that mean? Is it something serious? My husband… he always took me to the doctor. I never had to worry about these things… Is it the fatigue? Is that what’s causing all of this?
DOCTOR: It's too early to say definitively, Ms. Licano. The enlarged thyroid, combined with your fatigue, weight loss, constipation, and other symptoms, suggests a possible issue with your thyroid gland. We need to run some blood tests to confirm this and determine the underlying cause. It could be something relatively minor, or it could indicate a more significant condition like hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism. I'm ordering a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel, including TSH, T4, and T3. We will also check your vitamin D levels. It’s important to rule out other possibilities as well.
PATIENT: Oh. So… lots of tests. And then… what? Will they need to… operate? I don’t like hospitals. I just want to know what’s wrong with me, and what I can do to feel better. Is there anything I can do now? Before the tests?
DOCTOR: The tests will give us a clearer picture. As for operating, it's far too early to consider that. Most thyroid issues are managed with medication. We’ll cross that bridge when, and if, we need to. As for what you can do now… try to get as much rest as possible. Eat small, frequent meals, even if you don’t feel hungry. And stay hydrated. I’m also going to recommend a high-fiber diet to help with the constipation. But more than anything, try not to worry until we have the test results. Stress can worsen your symptoms. I'm also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Next week… that’s a long time to wait. Alright. High-fiber… I think I remember my mother making prune juice. Is that high-fiber? And prune juice… won't that make the constipation worse? Oh dear, this is all so confusing. Can I at least get something for the dizziness? Just until the tests come back? It makes me feel… unsteady when I walk. And thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you trying to help me.
DOCTOR: Prune juice can help with constipation, but it's not a long-term solution. It’s better to focus on increasing your fiber intake through foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. As for the dizziness, I can prescribe a low-dose anti-motion sickness medication, but it's a temporary fix. It won't address the underlying cause. This should help with the dizziness, but please be cautious and avoid activities that require a lot of balance until we have the test results. I'm also going to recommend you take it with food, as it can sometimes cause nausea. Here you go. And please, try to relax. I know it’s easier said than done, but stressing will only make things worse. We'll get to the bottom of this. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s all. Just… the dizziness, and the tests. And… trying to remember everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I really do appreciate your help. I’m just… tired. Always tired. I should probably go now. And I hope the dizziness doesn't get any worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get some rest, Ms. Licano. And please, if you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms – such as severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, or a rapid heartbeat – go to the emergency room immediately. Here is a list of local pharmacies. I'll see you next week.
