DOCTOR: Hi Sherion, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Chriselda. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, my chest… it’s been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me a little, you know? It feels like… a tight squeezing.
DOCTOR: Okay, a tight squeezing in your chest. I understand why that would be worrying. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… when does it happen? Let me think… It’s not when I’m doing big things, like cleaning the whole house. It’s more… when I walk up the hill to the store, maybe? Or if I get a little excited talking to my grandkids on the phone. It doesn’t last long, just a few minutes, then it goes away. But it makes me stop and catch my breath.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it seems to be brought on by exertion or strong emotions, and it resolves pretty quickly when you rest. How would you rate the pain on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being very mild and 10 being the worst pain you’ve ever felt?
PATIENT: Oh, a scale? Hmm… I don’t really know numbers so good. But it’s not the worst pain. Like, I broke my wrist once, and this isn't like that. Maybe… a 4? When it’s bad, it’s a 4. Most of the time, it’s more like a 2 or 3. Just enough to make me stop what I’m doing. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Sherion. A 4 at its worst, and usually around a 2 or 3. And it goes away with rest. Have you noticed if anything else happens when you have this chest pain?
PATIENT: Let me see… when it hurts, sometimes I feel a little short of breath, like I said. And… my arm, my left arm, feels a little… heavy. Not numb, exactly, just… tired. And sometimes, a little bit of sweat. But not always. It doesn't happen every time. It’s hard to explain. It’s just… not right. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Sherion. You're describing some concerning symptoms, and I appreciate you telling me everything, even the things that are "hard to explain." Shortness of breath, heaviness in your left arm, and sweating with the chest pain… Okay. Now, have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I’ve had aches and pains, you know, getting older. But this is different. This squeezing… and the arm… no. First time ever. It started maybe a week ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little uncomfortable. Then it got a bit stronger. That’s why I came in. I didn’t want to wait too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week ago, and gradually getting stronger. That’s good you came in. Now, let’s go over some other things. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my doctor back in the city, he said my blood pressure was a little high once, years ago. He put me on a little pill, but I stopped taking it after a while. It made me feel dizzy. And… I have arthritis in my hands, that’s why they’re always a little swollen. Other than that… no, not really. I try to stay healthy. I walk every day, like I said, and I eat my vegetables. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Sherion. High blood pressure in the past, and arthritis. And you stopped taking the blood pressure medication because of dizziness. Do you know the name of that medication, if you recall?
PATIENT: Oh, the name… let me think… it was a little white pill. I’m terrible with names! My husband, Ricardo, he always remembered everything. He used to fill my pills for me. I think it started with an “A”? Or maybe a “B”? I really don’t know. Sorry. It was a long time ago, and I didn’t pay much attention. I just knew it made me feel funny. Ricardo handled all that stuff.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Sherion. It’s perfectly okay that you don’t remember the name. We can look it up in your records if we have them. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones, like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Just the cream for my hands. For the arthritis. It’s called… uh… Voltaren? I think that's it. And sometimes, if my hands are really hurting, I take a little bit of ibuprofen. The orange kind. But not every day. Just when I need it. That's all. I don't like taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, Voltaren cream and occasional ibuprofen. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I eat everything! Ricardo always said I had a cast iron stomach. He could eat anything, too. We never had any trouble with allergies. My grandkids have some, but not me. I’m pretty lucky that way. Does that answer your question?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good to know, Sherion. No known allergies. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any heart problems, high blood pressure, or diabetes in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… my father, he had a bad heart. He died when I was young, from a heart attack, I think. And my mother, she had high blood pressure. She was on pills for it for many years. And my brother, he has diabetes. He has to watch his sugar very carefully. So, yes, there’s a little bit of everything in my family. That’s why I worry so much, you know? It runs in the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of heart problems, high blood pressure, and diabetes. That’s helpful to know. And finally, let’s talk a little bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, never. Ricardo didn’t like smoking, and I didn’t want to upset him. He always said it was bad for your health. And I don’t drink, either. It makes me feel dizzy. And… no, nothing like that. I’m a good girl. I just like my coffee in the morning and spending time with my grandkids. That’s all. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Yes, Sherion, that's perfectly okay. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll also check your blood pressure and pulse. Would you mind if I take a look at your hands as well?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. My heart feels a little funny sometimes, so listening is good. And my hands… they’re always swollen, you can see. Just be gentle, okay? They get sore easily.
DOCTOR: Okay, Sherion. Your blood pressure is a little elevated – 145/90. Your pulse is regular, but a bit fast at 92. I can hear some… subtle crackling sounds in your lungs, mostly on the lower right side. And your hands do show significant swelling and some tenderness at the joints. I'm going to order an EKG to get a better look at your heart rhythm, and a chest X-ray to see what's going on with your lungs. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that doesn’t sound so good. Crackling? And fast pulse? Is it serious? The X-ray… will it hurt? I don’t like the sound of all this, Chriselda. I just want to know what’s wrong, you know? Is it my heart? Like my father?
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Sherion, and I want to reassure you that we're just gathering information right now. The crackling in your lungs could be due to a number of things—sometimes it's just fluid buildup, sometimes it's related to a mild infection. The EKG and X-ray will help us figure out exactly what's going on. The EKG is completely painless—we just put some stickers on your chest. And the X-ray is also painless, it just takes a quick picture. It’s too early to say definitively whether it’s your heart, but given your family history and the symptoms you're describing, we need to rule out any serious problems. We'll get the results back quickly, and then we can discuss a plan. I’m going to have the nurse come in and get you set up for the EKG and X-ray now. Do you have any questions before she comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think I understand. Stickers, and a picture. Okay. Just… please tell me if it’s something bad, Chriselda. I don’t want any secrets. My husband… he always told me the truth, even when it was hard. I need to know what’s happening. And… thank you for listening. It’s nice to have someone who cares. I'm a little scared, you know. But I trust you.
DOCTOR: I promise you, Sherion, I will be honest with you every step of the way. I will explain everything in plain language, and we’ll make decisions together. I understand you’re scared, and that’s perfectly okay. We're going to take good care of you. Let’s get these tests done, and then we'll have a better understanding of what's going on. The nurse will be in shortly. Just take a few deep breaths, and we'll get through this together.
