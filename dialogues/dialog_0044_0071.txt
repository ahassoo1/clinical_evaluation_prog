DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Asami. It’s good to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s good to meet you too. Well, my niece… she’s wanting to come live here from over in Europe. And I believe she needs some shots, or somethin’, to get her papers right. I’m just tryin’ to get all the information I need to help her with that. I’m a little lost on what exactly is required, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very thoughtful of you to help her out. So, she’s immigrating from Europe and you’re trying to get her medical records sorted for the process?
PATIENT: Yes, sir. That’s right. Not immigratin’, exactly… more like a long-term visit, with the possibility of stayin’ longer if things go well. It’s a bit complicated, and the paperwork… well, it mentions vaccinations. I just want to be sure we’re coverin’ everything. She’s a good girl, and I wouldn't want her to be turned away for somethin’ simple like that. Do you need her birthdate or somethin’ like that?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, we can get this sorted. It’s smart to be proactive. Yes, if you could give me her date of birth, that would be helpful. And do you happen to know if she has any existing medical records from Europe with her?
PATIENT: Her birthdate… let me see. It’s November 14th, 1998. As for records… she mentioned havin’ somethin’ from the doctor over there, but I don’t know if she brought ‘em with her. She just arrived a couple weeks ago, and we’ve been gettin’ her settled. I’m not sure where she keeps those things. Would it be alright if we just started from scratch, then? If she does have records, we can always add to them later, right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly fine. We can absolutely start fresh and add any records she finds later. It’s actually quite common. Knowing her birthdate helps us determine what vaccinations she should have had, and we can go from there. Just to be thorough, has she had any vaccinations in the US since arriving?
PATIENT: No, sir, I don’t believe so. We went to the health department to get her a basic check-up, but they didn’t offer any shots. They just said she seemed healthy enough. We were mostly worried about any travel sickness, but she didn’t have any problems on the plane. She's a strong girl, generally. I just want to make sure she has everything the government needs, you know? I don't want any trouble with the paperwork.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No vaccinations here in the US yet. That simplifies things a bit. So, to get a better understanding of what she may need, could you tell me a little bit about where in Europe she was living?
PATIENT: She was livin’ in… let me see… Poland. Near a city called Kraków. It’s a pretty big place, I think. She was goin’ to school there, studyin’ somethin’ with computers, I believe. She didn’t say much about the healthcare there, but I figured it was probably decent. It’s a good country, as far as I know. I haven’t been myself, but she always spoke well of it. Does where she lived matter for the shots?
DOCTOR: Yes, it does matter. Different countries have different standard vaccination schedules, so knowing where she lived helps us determine what she likely received already and what she might need to catch up on. Okay, so generally, individuals from Poland should have received vaccinations for things like measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis… We'll also want to make sure she's up-to-date on her polio and varicella vaccinations. Has she had chickenpox before, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Chickenpox… Hmm. She might have had it when she was little, but I’m not entirely sure. She was pretty young then, and her mother… well, her mother wasn’t around much. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t involved in her life then. So, I honestly couldn’t say for certain. I suppose we should assume she didn’t, just to be safe? It's better to be cautious, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Yes, assuming she hasn't had it is the safest approach. We can do a quick blood test to check for varicella immunity if you’d like. It’s a simple procedure. Now, besides vaccinations, are you aware of any other medical conditions she has, or any medications she currently takes?
PATIENT: No, sir. She doesn't take any regular medications that I know of. She’s a healthy girl, as I said. Never had any serious illnesses, not that I’m aware of. She might take somethin’ for a headache now and then, but nothin’ routine. She told me she didn’t have any allergies either. Just a good, strong girl, generally. I really appreciate you takin’ the time to go through all this with me, Doctor. It’s a relief to know someone’s lookin’ after her health.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Skarbek. It's my pleasure. It sounds like she's generally quite healthy, which is wonderful. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline and confirm everything looks good. We’ll check her vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and listen to her heart and lungs. Then we can discuss which vaccinations she might need and schedule them accordingly. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that sounds perfectly alright. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. A physical exam sounds like a good idea. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I’m here to help in any way I can. I just want to make sure she’s taken care of, and that this paperwork gets sorted out smoothly. .
DOCTOR: Great. If you'll just have a seat up here, we'll get started. First, I'll check her blood pressure. Okay, that's 128 over 76, good. Now let's listen to her heart and lungs. Can you tell me if she's ever had any shortness of breath, or chest pain?
