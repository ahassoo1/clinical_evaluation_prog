DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I'm Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s this…fogginess. Like my head isn’t quite clear. My wife, she’s been after me to come in for a while now. Says I ask the same questions twice, sometimes. It’s… unsettling, you know? Not like me at all.
DOCTOR: Unsettling, yes, I understand. “Fogginess,” you say… and repeating questions. How long has this been going on, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It’s…sneaky, see? It doesn’t happen every day. Maybe… three, four months now? Started small, I figured it was just getting old. But it's happening more often, and frankly, it’s worrying my wife more than it worries me. She’s a worrier, that one. Always has been.
DOCTOR: Three or four months… alright. And is this “fogginess” constant throughout the day, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, definitely. It usually hits in the afternoon, I think. After I’ve been working, setting tile. That sun… maybe it’s the heat? I don’t know. It's not like I'm doing anything different, you know? Same routine for twenty years. Same tiles, same sun. It just… happens. And then it lifts, usually before dinner. Though sometimes… sometimes it lingers.
DOCTOR: Setting tile… a physical job. Any other symptoms alongside this fogginess?
PATIENT: Well… I get a bit tired, now that you mention it. More tired than usual, after a day's work. But that's to be expected, isn't it? Sixty-six years old isn't getting any younger. I also stumble a little more. Not falling, mind you, just… off balance sometimes. My wife says it's noticeable. She notices everything, that woman. And… oh, there was that one time I couldn't quite remember the name of the fellow who supplies the marble. Old friend, been dealing with him for years. It just… slipped my mind. Embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, some balance issues, and a recent difficulty with recall… slipping names. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Vision? Hmm. Not that I’ve noticed, no. I wear glasses, always have. Get them checked every year. They feel fine. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but that’s just old age again, isn’t it? I get a little glare in the sun, of course. Makes it harder to see the grout lines. But nothing different than usual. I can still see well enough to set a perfect tile, don’t you worry. I take pride in my work, you know. Still the best tile setter in the county, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any headaches, dizziness, or any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: No headaches, no. And no dizziness. Though… sometimes I feel a little… unsteady. Like I’m walking on soft ground, even when I’m not. Not enough to fall, just… not as solid as usual. And no weakness in my arms or legs. Still strong as an ox, I’d say. I lift heavy tiles all day, you know. It’s good exercise. My wife keeps telling me I work too hard, but what else am I going to do? Sit around and watch television? No thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright. No headaches, no dizziness, no weakness. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment, Mr. Lason. Do you have any significant medical conditions that you’re aware of – high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, yes. Doctor’s been on me about that for years. Take a pill for it, every morning. Keeps it under control, mostly. Other than that… nothing much. Had my appendix out when I was a boy, but that was a long time ago. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothing like that. Pretty healthy for my age, if you ask me. My wife says I’m stubborn, but that’s probably why I’m still going strong. She also says I don’t listen to doctors, but… well, she’s probably right about that too.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Let me think… just the blood pressure one, usually. But… sometimes I take something for my knees. They bother me, especially after a long day on the concrete. It’s an over-the-counter thing, ibuprofen, I think. My wife gets it for me. And… oh, sometimes a little something for sleep. Just when I can't get to sleep, you understand. Nothing regular, just when I need it. I don't like taking pills if I don't have to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ibuprofen and something for sleep occasionally. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else, that we should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. My wife’s the one with the allergies, always sneezing and itching. But me? I can eat anything, take anything. Pretty lucky that way, I guess. Though she worries, of course. Always worried. Says I should be more careful, but what's the point? I’ve lived this long without problems, why change now?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Lason. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Get it over with, I say. I've got tiles to set tomorrow, you know. Can't be sitting around all day. Just don't poke me too much. I’m a practical man, Doctor. Don't need fancy tests or anything. Just tell me what’s wrong and I’ll get back to work. Though, truthfully, if you do find something, I suppose I'd rather know. My wife would be even more insistent then.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you'll just have a seat here. We'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 88. Pulse is regular at 72. Not alarming, but something we’ll keep an eye on. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but not significantly. Balance is a little unsteady, as you mentioned. Coordination is slightly impaired. Alright. Everything seems relatively normal, but the slight unsteadiness and diminished reflexes are concerning, given your symptoms. I'm going to order some blood work and a CT scan of your head, just to rule out anything serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan? Now hold on. A scan… that sounds… serious. What are you looking for, Doctor? Is it something bad? I don't like scans. And blood work… I’m not fond of needles either, you know. I can’t say I like any of this, frankly. Is there… is there anything else we can do? Perhaps just… monitor things a little longer? I’ve been setting tiles for forty years, Doctor. I think I know my own body. A scan seems… excessive.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Lason. It is a bit unsettling to hear about needing scans. However, given your symptoms – the fogginess, the memory issues, the unsteadiness – we need to rule out anything serious. The scan isn’t to say there is something bad, it’s to ensure there isn’t. The blood work will give us a baseline, check for any vitamin deficiencies or other imbalances that could be contributing. The CT scan will look at the structure of your brain, to rule out stroke, tumors, or other causes of cognitive decline. It's a precautionary measure, really. We need to be thorough. I wouldn’t order these tests if I didn’t think they were necessary. Given your age and your symptoms, it's better to be safe than sorry. I can explain the procedure in detail, and we can discuss any concerns you have. Would you like to do that?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. You’re right, I suppose. My wife… she’d never let me live it down if I refused. She's already telling everyone about the fogginess, you know. Exaggerating it, probably. Fine. Blood work and… the scan. But explain it to me. Everything. What does it involve? Will it hurt? How long will it take? And what… what are we looking for, exactly? Don't sugarcoat it, Doctor. I’m a practical man. I want to know the worst possible thing, so I can prepare myself. And… is there any chance this is just… old age? That's all I want, really. Just a little bit of slowing down. Not… not something serious.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Lason. Let’s start with the blood work. It’s a simple procedure. A phlebotomist – a lab technician – will draw a small amount of blood from a vein in your arm. There will be a brief pinch, and you might feel a slight discomfort. It takes only a few minutes, and we'll send the sample to the lab for analysis. The results usually come back within a few days. Now, the CT scan. It’s a non-invasive imaging test. You’ll lie on a table that slides into a donut-shaped machine. The machine uses X-rays to create detailed images of your brain. It doesn’t hurt, but you’ll need to lie very still for a few minutes while the images are being taken. As for what we’re looking for… we want to rule out several possibilities. Stroke, which can cause sudden cognitive decline and neurological symptoms. A tumor, which could be pressing on the brain and causing similar issues. And other structural abnormalities that could be contributing to your symptoms. It’s also important to rule out more subtle causes, like vitamin deficiencies or small areas of bleeding in the brain. The scan will help us get a clear picture of what’s going on. It's important to remember that the vast majority of these tests come back normal. We're simply being thorough to ensure we have an accurate diagnosis and can provide you with the best possible care. And yes, there is a chance this could be related to age-related cognitive changes. But we need to rule out other possibilities first. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: X-rays… I’ve had enough of those fixing broken bones over the years. Not fond of radiation, you know. And lying still… that's difficult. I'm a restless man, always moving, always working. What if you do find something? A tumor, you said? What then? Surgery? Chemotherapy? I’ve seen what that does to people. It’s… not a pleasant sight. Be honest with me, Doctor. What are the realistic possibilities here? Don’t sugarcoat it. I need to know what I’m facing, even if it’s not good. My wife… she'll want to know eventually. And I’d rather hear it from you than from some… some internet doctor.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your concerns. It's natural to be anxious about these possibilities. You’re right to ask tough questions, and I won’t sugarcoat anything. If we do find a tumor, the next steps would depend on its size, location, and type. Small, benign tumors may simply require monitoring with regular scans. Larger or more aggressive tumors may require further intervention, such as surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. But it’s important to remember that not all brain tumors are cancerous. And even if a tumor is cancerous, there are many effective treatment options available. The prognosis, or expected outcome, would depend on several factors, including your overall health and the specific type of tumor. However, let me emphasize that we haven’t found anything yet. And it’s equally possible that the scan will be normal, and we’ll be able to attribute your symptoms to age-related cognitive changes or other, less serious causes. As for the radiation exposure from the CT scan, it’s minimal. The benefits of obtaining a clear diagnosis far outweigh the risks. And we use the lowest possible dose of radiation to obtain the necessary images. I understand this is a lot to process. I want you to know that I’m here to support you every step of the way. We’ll discuss all of your options in detail if we find anything concerning. And we’ll work together to develop a treatment plan that’s right for you. For now, let’s focus on getting the scan done. If you’re willing, I can schedule it for tomorrow morning. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning… alright. Get it over with. But… … promise me you'll explain everything, every step of the way. No medical jargon. No… vague answers. I want to understand what’s happening, even if it’s not good. And… if it is serious… I want to know my options. All of them. And… tell my wife. She'll find out eventually. She always does. She's… she's a strong woman. She can handle it. But… I want to be the one to tell her. Not some… some doctor she's never met. Promise me that, Doctor. Promise me you'll explain everything, and let me tell my wife. That's all I ask.
DOCTOR: I promise you, Mr. Lason. I will explain everything, every step of the way. No medical jargon, no vague answers. I will make sure you understand exactly what’s happening, and what your options are. And I promise you that I will respect your wishes regarding your wife. I will not discuss the results of the scan with her without your explicit permission. You are the one who will tell her, and I will support you in any way I can. I understand this is a difficult time, and I want you to know that you’re not alone. I am here to support you and your wife every step of the way. Alright. Let’s get the scan scheduled for tomorrow morning. I’ll also have my nurse prepare some information about the procedure, and some resources about brain health. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all. Just… get it over with. And… thank you, Doctor. For being honest. And for listening. And… if it is bad… don't give up on me. I’m a stubborn man, you know? I’ve survived a lot in my life. I’m not going down without a fight. Alright. Tomorrow morning, then. I'll see you then. And… Doctor? Thank you. For everything.
DOCTOR: Stubborn man… a good quality. .
