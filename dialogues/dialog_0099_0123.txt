DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's my skin. It's been so itchy lately. It’s driving me crazy, honestly. Not all over, but mostly on my arms and back.
DOCTOR: Hmm, itchy skin, alright. And you said mostly on your arms and back… how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It started… maybe a month ago? It wasn’t bad at first, just a little annoying. But it's gotten worse over the last week or so. I keep scratching, and it just seems to make it angrier.
DOCTOR: A month, gradually worsening… Okay. And has anything changed recently, Ms. Cassimatis?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me see… not really. I haven’t started using any new soaps or lotions, and I haven't been anywhere different. I did start a new gardening project, a little vegetable patch out back. Could that be it? I've been getting my hands pretty dirty.
DOCTOR: Gardening… potentially. We’ll get to that. Now, is the itch constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, I think. It's worse at night, definitely. Keeps me up sometimes. During the day, it’s not constant, but it flares up if I get warm, or if I’m stressed. Like if I’m trying to remember something… or dealing with paperwork!
DOCTOR: Worse at night, triggered by warmth or stress… Alright. Are you noticing any rash, bumps, blisters, or anything visible on your skin along with the itch?
PATIENT: Well, it's not like a full-blown rash, no. It’s more… little red patches, sometimes. And if I scratch – which I know I shouldn’t! – it gets a little bumpy. But it doesn't blister or anything like that. It's mostly just red and… irritated looking, I guess. Hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Irritated looking, red patches, worse with scratching… Okay. Have you tried anything to relieve the itching yourself?
PATIENT: Oh, plenty! I’ve tried lotion, that’s the usual. And I put some calamine lotion on it a couple of times. It helps a little, for a bit, but it doesn’t really last. And I've been trying not to scratch, but it's so hard when it itches like that!
DOCTOR: Lotion, calamine lotion, minimal relief… Right. Now, Ms. Cassimatis, let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions – like diabetes, kidney problems, thyroid issues, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've been pretty healthy, all things considered. My blood pressure runs a little high sometimes, but nothing a little walking and watching my salt intake doesn't fix. And I had a hysterectomy years ago, but that was… well, a long time ago now.
DOCTOR: No major medical conditions, managed hypertension, hysterectomy… Alright. Any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don't think so. I mean, I'm not a fan of shellfish, but that’s a preference, not an allergy. Oh! I had a reaction to some kind of bug bite when I was a kid, but I don't even remember what it was. No known allergies that I'm aware of, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No known allergies… Okay. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – vitamins, supplements, anything at all?
PATIENT: Just a daily multivitamin, and sometimes I take something for my joints when they're acting up. It’s called glucosamine, I think? That’s it, really. I try to stay away from too many pills if I can.
DOCTOR: Multivitamin, glucosamine… Alright. Now, let's take a look at your skin. Could you please turn around and lift your shirt a bit so I can examine your back?
PATIENT: Okay, certainly. Here you go, Doctor. Be careful, it might make me shiver! It's a little cold in here.
DOCTOR: Alright. I see some redness and a little bit of… scratching, as you mentioned. It doesn’t appear to be anything dramatically alarming at this point, but there is some inflammation. And your arms, similar findings – some redness, areas where it looks like you've been scratching. No hives, no significant blistering, no open sores. Skin feels relatively normal texture otherwise. Okay. I'm going to go ahead and document these findings.
PATIENT: That’s good to hear it’s not anything serious. I was starting to worry, honestly. Is it something the gardening could be causing, you think? I’ve been using gloves, but maybe not good enough ones?
DOCTOR: It’s possible the gardening is contributing. It could be contact dermatitis—an irritation from something in the soil or on the plants. Even with gloves, some irritants can still get through. Before we jump to that conclusion though, we should rule out other possibilities. Have you been using any new laundry detergents, fabric softeners, or cleaning products recently?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at all. Same old everything. I’ve been using the same laundry detergent for years, and my daughter does the cleaning, so I don’t even know what she’s using! She likes to try new things, that girl. But I haven’t changed anything on my end.
DOCTOR: No changes in laundry products… Alright. Given your history, and the examination findings, my initial suspicion is contact dermatitis, likely related to something in your garden. However, to be certain, I’d like to order a simple patch test. It will help us identify if you have a specific allergy to something common in the environment, or in plants. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A patch test? Sounds sensible, Doctor. If it helps figure out what’s causing this itch, then yes, that's fine with me. Is it… uncomfortable? I don't like needles, you know.
DOCTOR: No, it doesn't involve a needle. It’s just a series of small stickers—patches—that we apply to your back for a couple of days. They contain common allergens. We then check to see if you have any reaction to them. It's a fairly straightforward process. In the meantime, I'm going to recommend a topical corticosteroid cream—a mild one—to help reduce the inflammation and itching. Apply it twice daily to the affected areas. And try to avoid scratching as much as possible, even though I know that’s easier said than done. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: That sounds alright, Doctor. Stickers are much better than needles! And I’ll try my best with the scratching, honestly. I’ll put the cream on right away when I get home. What about the gardening? Should I stop altogether for a bit? I really enjoy it, you know.
DOCTOR: You don’t need to stop entirely, but I would advise wearing thicker gloves—perhaps even two pairs—when you’re working in the garden. And after you’re finished, be sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. We'll get the results of the patch test back in about a week or so, and that will give us a better idea of what you might be reacting to. I'm going to write up a prescription for the cream, and a referral for the patch testing. And I'll give you a handout with instructions for applying the cream and avoiding irritants. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen and not making me feel like I'm crazy for itching! I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome. Follow the instructions on the handout, and schedule the patch testing as soon as possible. If the itching gets significantly worse, or you develop any signs of infection—like fever, pus, or increased pain—contact the office immediately. Alright, have a good day.
