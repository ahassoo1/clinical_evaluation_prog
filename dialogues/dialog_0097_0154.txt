DOCTOR: Good morning, Claudene! It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about my waterworks, if you don't mind my saying. Been a bother, it has. A real bother. I don’t… I don’t rightly remember when it started, but it keeps coming back. I just want it fixed, if that's possible. Quickly, if we could.
DOCTOR: Okay, “a bother with your waterworks.” That's a perfectly good way to put it! It sounds frustrating. And I understand wanting to get it sorted out quickly. Let’s try to figure out what's going on. When you say it “keeps coming back,” could you tell me a little more specifically what’s happening?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well… it’s a burning feeling, mostly. When I… when I go to the bathroom. And sometimes, even when I don't. It’s uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable. And I have to go so often. It’s… it’s been happening on and off for… a while now. I really can’t say how long. Months, I suppose? Maybe longer. It’s hard to recall. I just want to feel normal again, you see?
DOCTOR: I understand. A burning sensation, even when you’re not urinating, and frequent trips to the bathroom… that certainly doesn’t sound comfortable, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. When you say frequent, about how often are you going to the bathroom during the day, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. More than usual, certainly. I used to be able to… well, it was hours between, you know. Now? It feels like every couple of hours. Sometimes even less! It’s… distracting, to say the least. I don’t know exactly, Doctor. I don’t keep track of such things. Is that alright? I’m not very good with numbers, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Claudene. I appreciate you trying your best to explain it. “More than usual” is helpful enough. Now, have you noticed any blood in your urine, or any changes in the color or smell of it?
PATIENT: Blood? Oh dear. I… I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. It looks… normal, I believe. Maybe a little darker sometimes, but I just thought that was from… drinking water. I drink a lot of water, you see. As for the smell… I haven’t really paid attention, to be honest. I don't have the best sense of smell these days. Is that bad? Should I be looking for something specific? I get so confused with these things.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not bad at all that you haven’t noticed anything specific. It’s good you’re telling me what you have noticed. A darker color from drinking water is understandable. Okay, let’s talk about other symptoms. Have you had any pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: Oh… well, sometimes. A dull ache, mostly. In my lower… down there. And yes, sometimes in my back too. But I thought that was just my age, you see. Old bones. I get aches and pains all over. It’s hard to tell what’s what these days. It’s not a sharp pain, not usually. Just… uncomfortable. Like a weight, pressing down. Is that… concerning? I really just want to know if it's serious.
DOCTOR: That's a fair question, Claudene. A dull ache in your lower abdomen and back can be concerning, but it's also common with age, so we need to investigate a bit further. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting along with these symptoms?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. Definitely no vomiting. Nausea… sometimes, perhaps. A little queasy, but I get that from… from travelling in the car. I don’t travel much anymore, thankfully. No, it’s not like that. It’s just… the waterworks, mostly. And the ache. I just want it to stop, Doctor. I'm not getting any younger, you see. Is it something serious? Please tell me it’s not something dreadful.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or vomiting. Just the urinary symptoms and the dull ache. I understand your worry, and we'll work to figure out what's going on. Let me ask a few questions about your past medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever had any kidney problems, bladder infections, or sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a bit personal, isn’t it? Well… I had a bladder infection years ago. A very long time ago. I don’t remember much about it, just that it was… uncomfortable. And I had a… a difficult childbirth, with my son. That was a long time ago, too. As for other things… no, not that I recall. I haven’t been… active in that department for a very long time. My husband… well, that’s a story for another day. Is that enough information? I don't like dwelling on the past, if you don't mind. It’s all rather… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Claudene. You share as much or as little as you're comfortable with. A history of a bladder infection and a difficult childbirth are good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medications… let me think. No, not really. Just a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. It's… a small white pill. I get it from the chemist. As for allergies… I don’t think so. I used to be allergic to… something, when I was a child. But I’ve forgotten what it was. It was a long time ago. No, I don’t think I have any serious allergies. I try to avoid taking pills as much as possible, you see. They make me feel… unwell.
DOCTOR: Alright, a small white pill for arthritis, and no known allergies. That’s good to know. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay. It will just involve listening to your abdomen, and a quick check of your lower back. I’ll also need a urine sample to check for infection. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? And a… a sample? Well… I suppose so. If you think it’s necessary. It’s just… a little embarrassing, you see. But if it will help… yes, alright. Do what you have to do. Quickly, if you could. I’m not very comfortable with all this poking and prodding. And where would I… provide the sample? I haven’t been anywhere private yet.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Claudene. I understand your discomfort, and I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. We'll make sure you have privacy for the urine sample. There’s a bathroom just down the hallway there. I’ll give you a sterile cup, and I’ll explain exactly how to collect the sample. There's a lid on the cup, so you won't have to worry about spills. Take your time, and just let me know when you’re ready. I'll be right here. After that, we’ll just listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope and check your back. It shouldn’t take long at all.
PATIENT: Oh, good. A private room. That’s… much better. Yes, alright. I’ll go and… attempt this now. Just… let me know if you need anything. I’m not very good at this sort of thing, you see. And please, be quick. I’d like to get this over with as soon as possible. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Claudene. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to call out if you need anything at all. I’ll be right here when you’re finished.
