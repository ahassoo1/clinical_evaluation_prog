DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verrall, have a seat. Look, I'm Audel Pehrson. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hello. Yes, hello Doctor Pehrson. It’s…Smith Verrall. I think… I think my daughter, she wants… well, she wants a baby. And I… I think she said I should come talk to you? Before… before it happens. Something about making sure everything is okay? I’m not very good with this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Right, right. Preconception counseling. Honestly, people come up with the strangest reasons to be in here. Your daughter wants to get pregnant and you're here?
PATIENT: Yes, that's… that's it. She’s very thoughtful. She said it was important, for… for the baby. And me. I… I just want to be sure I'm… healthy enough, I suppose. I don’t want to cause any trouble. It’s been a long time since I worried about… things like that. Is that… okay? Should she be here instead?
DOCTOR: Look, it's not wrong she wants you involved. It's just... unusual. Okay, fine. We'll do a quick run-through. I need to know your medical history. Have you been seeing any doctors regularly?
PATIENT: No, not really. Not for… a very long time. I used to go, when I was younger. But… things happened. I mostly just… try to stay busy. Sales work, you know? Lots of driving. I haven’t been to a doctor in… oh dear. I couldn’t say. Maybe ten years? More? I don't really keep track. Is that a problem?
DOCTOR: A problem?
PATIENT: Well… I just mean, is it bad that I haven’t? I usually just… take some pills when I feel bad. For my back, mostly. And… sometimes my stomach. Nothing serious, I don’t think. My daughter, she worries a lot. She’s the one who made me come here. She said… she said it was about… things I might pass on? To the baby? I’m not very good at remembering.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. So, no regular doctor visits. Self-treating with… what pills exactly?
PATIENT: Uh… let me think. For my back… I think they’re… Ibuprofen, mostly. The kind you get at the shop. And for my stomach… something for heartburn. I can’t remember the name. A little blue one, maybe? I buy them when I need them. I don’t keep a list, sorry. It’s not… a very organized system. My daughter always says so.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ibuprofen. And an unknown heartburn medication. Wonderful. Any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat all sorts of things. My daughter makes me try new foods all the time. She’s a very good cook. I haven't had a bad reaction to anything… recently. When I was a boy, I think I was allergic to… bees? But I haven’t been stung in… a very long time. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Fine. Any major illnesses?
PATIENT: Major illnesses… that’s… a difficult question. I had the flu a couple of times, I think. And… when I was younger, I broke my arm. Does that count? Nothing… serious. I’ve always been pretty lucky, I suppose. I’ve never been in the hospital for anything… long-term. Or anything… important. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Okay, no major illnesses reported. Let's talk about your family. Any history of… genetic conditions?
PATIENT: Genetic conditions… oh dear. That’s a… a very complicated question. My family… we come from a small village, a long way away. We didn’t have… doctors much. People got sick, people… didn’t. I don’t know… I don’t think so. My mother… she was a strong woman. And my father… he worked very hard. I don't remember anyone being… sick for a very long time. Is that… helpful? I wish my daughter was here, she would know all this.
DOCTOR: Right. So, basically, no known family history of anything. Look, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just basic stuff. Blood pressure, listen to your heart, that sort of thing. Can’t tell much without some information, and this is… less than ideal.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you need. I… I understand. I’m not very good at this, but I’ll try to help. Just… tell me what to do. A physical exam is… fine. I haven’t had one in… a very long time. Hopefully, I won’t be too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, have a seat. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath… and out. Hmm. Sounds… okay. Blood pressure next. 140 over 90. A little elevated, but not alarming. Now, let me just check your reflexes… And… yeah. Everything seems… basic. I'm going to order some bloodwork. Just a standard panel. Cholesterol, blood sugar, basic metabolic panel. We need a baseline. We'll also do a CBC. Just to be safe.
PATIENT: Okay. Bloodwork… yes. That sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I… I trust your judgment. Is 140 over 90… bad? My daughter will probably worry if I tell her. She’s very… thorough. And a CBC? What’s that?
DOCTOR: 140 over 90 is… elevated. We'll see what the bloodwork says. A CBC is a complete blood count. It checks your red and white blood cells. It's routine. Look, I'm going to write you a referral for a cholesterol check and get the lab order printed. I’m not a magician, Mr. Verrall. We’ll get some results, then we'll talk. Go to the lab, get this done, and come back in a week. I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Okay. A week… yes. I can do that. Cholesterol check… and a CBC. Thank you, Doctor. Is there… anything I need to do before the bloodwork? Should I… eat something? Or not eat? I don’t want to mess it up. My daughter will be very… disappointed if I do something wrong.
DOCTOR: Fasting for 12 hours. No food after midnight. Got it?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Fasting for 12 hours. No food after midnight. I… I think I understand. Thank you, Doctor. I will… I will make sure to do that. Thank you again. Have a good day. .
