DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, it’s… down there. Something’s… leaking. Not good. It’s been happening for a few days now. Makes a mess, you know? Not like it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Down there” – you mean vaginal leaking?
PATIENT: Vaginal? No, no. Not my vaginal. Down there. You know... a man thing. My friend’s son, he had this happen. It’s… it’s like a drip. A bad drip.
DOCTOR: Ah, I see. You’re experiencing leakage from your penis. And you said this started a few days ago?
PATIENT: My... penis? Oh. Right. Yes. That’s what I mean. It’s just… embarrassing to talk about. And yes, a few days. Maybe three? I don't really keep track of that stuff anymore. It’s not like it’s a big problem, but it's… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, unsettling is a good way to put it. And it’s perfectly alright to be embarrassed – we deal with these things all the time. Three days is helpful. Is it constant dripping, or does it happen at specific times?
PATIENT: Specific times? Land sakes, doctor, I don’t sit around watching it drip! It just… happens. Sometimes when I move around too much, maybe? Or after I… you know. It’s just there. It’s not a lot, but it’s definitely something.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. So it seems to be more noticeable with activity or after urination. Has there been any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. A little… stingy sometimes. Like when you gotta go really bad and you hold it too long, you know? It's not sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Honestly, everything's uncomfortable these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, a stinging sensation with urination. And you mentioned everything feels uncomfortable generally. Any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No. I felt a little warm yesterday, but that's just the weather. This heat is terrible. And my belly... well, it hurts sometimes, but that's my old age catching up with me. Everything aches. I don't think that's got anything to do with the… dripping.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever, and you don't think the abdominal pain is related. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, smell, anything unusual like that?
PATIENT: Urine? Oh, goodness. I don't really look at it, doctor. Just goes in, goes out. Maybe a little darker than usual? Everything's a little off these days, I tell you. It’s hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. Let’s do a quick exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me get a better idea of what might be going on. I'll need to take a look at your penis and check your abdomen. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Hmph. An exam? You gotta look at it? Well… I suppose. But be quick about it, alright? And try not to stare. It's not a pretty sight, I’m sure. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Genard. I’ll be as quick and professional as possible. Just lie down on the exam table, and we’ll take a look. Okay, I’m just going to gently feel your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oof! There. That spot. A little tender. Not awful, but… yeah. Right about there. And… be careful! That’s sensitive! Honestly, everything’s sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the lower abdomen. And examining the penis now... I see some mild redness around the opening and a small amount of clear discharge. No obvious signs of injury. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you might have urethritis – inflammation of the urethra. It could be caused by a number of things, including an infection. Now, to confirm that, we’ll need to do a urine test.
PATIENT: Urine test? More poking and prodding? Honestly, doctor, I just want this to be over with. Is it gonna hurt? And what kinda infection? Is it… bad? You're scaring an old woman now.
DOCTOR: No, the urine test doesn’t involve any poking or prodding, Ms. Genard. It’s just a simple sample you’ll provide in a cup. It won’t hurt at all. As for the infection, it’s usually not serious, but it needs to be treated. It could be caused by bacteria, and we'll need to identify which one to give you the correct medication. We'll send the sample to the lab and get the results back quickly. It's best to address it to avoid complications, like a more serious infection. Would you be able to provide a sample now?
PATIENT: A cup? Oh, goodness. Well, alright. I suppose I can manage a cup. But this is ridiculous, you know. All this fuss over a little drip. Just tell me where to go and I'll... I'll try not to make a mess.
DOCTOR: Right this way. The restroom is just down the hall. There’s a sterile cup on the counter. Please try to collect a midstream sample – start urinating, and then collect about two ounces in the cup. Once you're finished, bring it back to me, and I'll send it to the lab. I'll be right here. Let me know if you have any trouble.
PATIENT: A midstream… Honestly. Alright, alright. Don’t rush an old woman, doctor. I’m going. Just… don’t expect miracles.
