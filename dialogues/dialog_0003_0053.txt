DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let's try to be concise, shall we?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, concise is good. I don’t like wasting time, and honestly, it’s a bit embarrassing to talk about this. But here I am. It’s just…going to the bathroom is hard now.
DOCTOR: Hard…in what manner, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: Well, it takes me a long time to start, you know? I have to…push, really push. And then it’s not a strong stream, just…dribbles. It feels like I never fully empty my bladder either. It’s been going on for maybe a month or so, but it’s getting worse. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is…vague, but I gather you’re experiencing difficulty with urination. A month, you say?
PATIENT: Exactly. A month, maybe a little longer. It started gradually, I thought it was just getting old, honestly. But now it’s…frustrating. And I worry about it when I’m out shopping, or visiting my sister. You know, having to go right now and not being able to. It’s not a good feeling.
DOCTOR: Right. And do you experience any pain or burning during urination, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Not when I’m actually going. It’s just…the effort, the pushing. And the feeling like there’s still something left in there afterwards. Sometimes I have to go back in five minutes, just to get the rest out. It’s not comfortable, but not painful, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: No burning, no pain. Just…incomplete emptying and effort. Do you have any trouble starting the stream, or is it more a weakness while you’re going?
PATIENT: It’s definitely starting. Like I said, it takes me a good while to begin. I have to concentrate on it, really focus. Once it gets going, it’s…weak, like you said. Not a strong stream at all. It's both, I guess. Hard to start, and weak when it does. And then stopping is…difficult sometimes, too. Little dribbles afterwards, even.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. It looks normal, smells normal…as normal as urine smells, anyway. I haven’t noticed anything different about it, just the amount and how hard it is to get going. I drink plenty of water, too, so it’s usually pretty clear.
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any history of urinary tract infections, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve had my share of colds and flu, of course, but never anything specifically with my bladder or anything like that. My sister had one, years ago, but I didn’t. I’ve always been pretty healthy, all things considered. I try to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to need to do a quick physical examination, Ms. Yadao. We'll check your abdomen and a brief neurological exam. And I'll need a urine sample, of course. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, a physical exam? Okay, that’s fine. And a urine sample, yes, I figured as much. No allergies, no. I can take most anything. I used to be a gardener, you know, lots of pollen and things, but I never had a reaction. I’m good with medications. So, where do we start?
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just lie down on the table, we’ll begin with your abdomen. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort.
PATIENT: Alright. Here we go. Just tell me if anything hurts, you said? It’s a little cold, this table…but I’ll manage. I've survived colder winters in Lithuania.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Yadao. I’m just checking for any tenderness or masses. Breathe normally, please. Abdomen is soft, no palpable masses. Mild discomfort in the lower suprapubic region upon deep palpation. Bladder is…full. Now, I’m going to listen to your back. Please let me know if anything feels unusual.
PATIENT: Okay, that’s…fine. A little cold on the skin, but not painful. And you felt…discomfort? That’s right, that’s where it feels…tight. And listening to my back…what are you listening for? Is something wrong? I get nervous easily, you know. It’s just…this whole thing is unsettling.
DOCTOR: Your lungs are clear, Ms. Yadao. Now, just a quick neurological assessment. I’m going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Sensory intact. Now, if you could just bear down as if you’re trying to urinate. There’s a slight descent of the bladder…but not significant. Alright. I’ll need a urine sample now, if you could please provide one. The restroom is just down the hall.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. So, not too bad, you said? That’s good. My sister always worries when I go to the doctor. She thinks the worst. A urine sample…yes, of course. Down the hall, you said? Alright. I’ll be right back. Let me know if you need me to call for help getting there, just in case.
DOCTOR: Bilateral 2+ reflexes, sensory intact. Slight bladder descent. Mild suprapubic tenderness. …Still just vague. Will review the urine sample when she returns. Possibly rule out infection, assess for hematuria. Might need referral to urology…if things don't improve.
PATIENT: .
