DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um… well, things is… my mother, she had… problems with her heart. And my brother, he had… cancer. Not good. I just… want to make sure I am okay. You know? I don't feel bad now, but… it’s in the family. I want peace of mind, I think.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Schwer. It’s very wise to be proactive about your health, especially with a family history of heart problems and cancer. It sounds like you're interested in a check-up to assess your overall health and potentially screen for any concerns. To get a better understanding of your situation, could you tell me a little more about your mother’s and brother’s conditions?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. A check-up sounds good. My mother… she got real tired, very fast. And her legs… they puffed up. The doctor said it was her heart. She… she didn’t live long after that. Maybe ten years ago? I don’t remember exactly. My brother… he smoked. A lot. He got… a lump. In his chest. They did… things. But it spread. He… he’s gone now, three years ago, maybe? It was fast. Real fast. I don’t smoke, never have. But… still. It’s scary.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Schwer. It sounds like those were very difficult experiences for you. It’s understandable that you’re feeling anxious and wanting to be thorough with your own health. To get a more complete picture, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Have you seen a doctor regularly in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. When I was young… yes, for check-ups. But after… after my wife and I… divorced… things got busy. Work. Trying to make a living. I went if I needed to. But not just to… check things. I haven’t seen one in… oh, maybe five years? Six? I don't really keep track, to be honest. Just went when something hurt. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Mr. Schwer. Life certainly gets in the way sometimes. It's good you're prioritizing your health now. Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. Let me think… No, I don't think so. I eat pretty much everything. Never had a bad reaction to anything. Not that I remember, anyway. Maybe a little itchy sometimes when I’m outside, but I think that’s just bugs. I don't take any pills, either. Nothing regular. Just… when I have a headache. And that’s not often.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And are you currently taking any over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Like I said, just the headache pills sometimes. Aspirin. Regular stuff you get at the store. I don't really believe in all those… vitamins and things. Seems like a waste of money, if you ask me. I try to eat okay. Not fancy, but… enough. I like noodles. And fish. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Schwer. Noodles and fish are perfectly fine! It’s great you have a diet you enjoy. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you drink alcohol, and if so, how much?
PATIENT: Um… I used to drink more. When I was married. But not so much now. Maybe… one or two beers a week? Sometimes none. It’s just… easier without. Helps me sleep. I don’t need it, though. I just… sometimes like a beer with dinner. That’s all. Not a big drinker. Never have been, really. My wife… she liked wine. That was different.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. And do you currently smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. Like I said before, my brother smoked. I saw what it did to him. No thank you. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Makes me cough just thinking about it. I try to stay away from people who smoke, if I can. It’s bad for you. Real bad.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Schwer. Avoiding tobacco is one of the best things you can do for your health. Now, could you tell me a little about your work?
PATIENT: I’m a salesman. Wholesale… things. Mostly to stores. You know, I go around and show them stuff and try to get them to buy it. It’s… a lot of driving. And talking. I've been doing it for a long time. It keeps me busy, that’s for sure. Sometimes stressful, though. Always gotta meet quotas. And some customers… not so nice. But it pays the bills.
DOCTOR: Okay. And on a typical day, how many hours would you say you're working, and would you describe your job as physically demanding?
PATIENT: Hmm… usually about eight hours. Sometimes more, if I have a big meeting. Not real physical, no. Mostly sitting in the car or standing around talking. I walk some, when I’m in stores, but nothing like… construction work or something. But it’s… tiring. Mentally, you know? Always gotta be “on”. And dealing with people. That takes a lot out of you. Sometimes I come home and just… fall asleep.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds like a demanding job, even if it’s not physically strenuous. Alright, let’s move on to a quick review of your body systems. Have you experienced any recent changes in your weight, appetite, or energy levels?
PATIENT: No, not really. My weight stays pretty much the same. I maybe put on a little around the middle, but that's just getting older, I guess. My appetite is okay. Sometimes I don't feel like eating much, but that happens. And my energy… well, I get tired at the end of the day, like I said. But nothing worse than usual. I'm not a young man anymore, you know? I don't have the energy I used to. But nothing new. Just… old age. I think.
DOCTOR: That's fair. And have you noticed any fevers, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No. None of that. I haven't been sick in… oh, a long time. Just little colds sometimes, like everyone gets. But nothing serious. No fevers, no chills, definitely no weight loss. I’m a pretty steady weight, like I said. Maybe a pound here or there, but nothing to worry about. I sleep okay, too. Not perfect, but… okay.
DOCTOR: Good. And have you had any problems with your breathing, coughing, or chest pain?
PATIENT: No. I get a little winded sometimes when I climb stairs, but that’s just getting older. And I might cough a little in the morning, just to clear my throat. But nothing serious. No chest pain. No shortness of breath. Just… normal old man stuff, I think. I used to walk a lot more, but I don’t anymore. Maybe that's why I get winded easier. I don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you experienced any recent changes in your bowel habits or bladder control?
PATIENT: No. Everything is… regular. If you know what I mean. Like I said, pretty steady. I don't have any problems going to the bathroom, or anything like that. Nothing has changed. I eat my vegetables. Maybe that helps. It's not a topic I like to talk about, if you don't mind. But no, everything is… normal. If you need to know anything more specific, I don't know if I can help. It's a little… personal.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schwer. I appreciate you being open with me, and I respect your privacy. We don’t need to go into details if you’re not comfortable. Now, have you noticed any changes in your skin, such as new moles, sores, or rashes?
PATIENT: No, not really. I get a little dry skin in the winter, but that’s all. And I have a few age spots, but I’ve had those for years. Nothing new. I try to stay out of the sun when I can, but sometimes I forget. I don't wear a hat or anything. Nothing worrying. Just old man skin. I don’t really pay much attention to it, to be honest. I just wash it and hope for the best.
DOCTOR: Okay. And finally, have you been experiencing any recent headaches, dizziness, vision changes, or memory problems?
PATIENT: Hmm... sometimes I get a little headache, like everyone does. But it goes away pretty quick. I don't get dizzy, no. My vision is… okay, I guess. Maybe not as good as it used to be, but I can still see well enough to drive. And my memory… well, I forget things sometimes. But who doesn’t? It comes with age, I think. I don't think it's anything serious. Just… old age. Like everything else. It's getting harder to remember names, but I can still remember how to do my job. That's what matters, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schwer. That's very helpful. Now, to get a better sense of your overall health, I would like to perform a physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. It will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a basic neurological assessment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just want to make sure everything is okay. I haven't had a proper check-up in so long, I guess I’m not sure what to expect. But… go ahead. I'm ready. Just… don't poke too hard. My skin is a little thin, you know? Old age. Again.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schwer. I'll be as gentle as possible. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit back and relax?
PATIENT: Okay. Relax… I’ll try. It's just… doctor visits always make me a little nervous. I don’t like being poked and prodded. But… I’ll try to relax. What do I do with my hands? Should I put them in my lap? Is there anything I should be thinking about? I always forget what I'm supposed to do at these things.
DOCTOR: Just relax your arms at your sides, palms facing up. Don't worry about thinking about anything specific. Just breathe normally. And don't worry about being nervous, it's perfectly normal. I'll do my best to make this as comfortable as possible. Your blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not drastically so. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with my stethoscope. Please take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Your heart sounds regular, with no murmurs that I detect at this time. Your lungs are clear, with good airflow bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your pulse in your wrists and ankles.
PATIENT: Okay, that doesn’t feel so bad. Good airflow… what does that mean? Is that good or bad? And murmurs… that sounds scary. Everything sounds… complicated. I just want to know if I'm okay. Is that too much to ask? I used to have a strong pulse, when I was younger. I worked with my hands, you know? Construction. But that was a long time ago. Now… I just sell things. Not much exercise involved. Go on, please. I’m trying to stay calm. Just tell me what you find. And don’t use too many big words, if you don’t mind. I’m an old man, remember?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask, Mr. Schwer. And you're right, it's important I explain everything clearly. "Good airflow" simply means there's no wheezing or crackling in your lungs, which could indicate a problem. And detecting no murmurs means your heart valves are functioning properly. Everything sounds good so far. Your pulse is a little weak, but that's not necessarily a cause for concern given your level of activity. It just means we should focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Now, I'm going to quickly check your reflexes and your neurological function. This just involves tapping a few points on your knees and checking your balance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… reflexes. That sounds… ominous. I used to be quick on my feet. But not anymore. Everything is slower these days. Knees… I had a bad knee once, playing football. But that was a long time ago. Balance… I’m a little unsteady sometimes, if I stand up too fast. But I haven’t fallen yet, thankfully. Go ahead, Doctor. Just be careful. I don’t want to end up on the floor. And… please explain what you're doing, as you go. It makes me nervous when you just… poke and prod without telling me. Old man nerves, I guess.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schwer. I’ll explain everything as I go. This reflex test simply checks the nerve pathways in your legs. I'm going to gently tap below your kneecap with this little hammer, and I’m looking for your leg to kick out slightly. It’s a normal response, and it doesn't hurt. Good! That’s a normal reflex response. Now, I’m going to check your balance. Could you please stand up slowly and try to stand on one foot for a few seconds?
PATIENT: Okay, tapping… that didn’t hurt. Felt a little strange, though. It’s good you said it was normal. I worry too much, my daughter says. Standing on one foot… oh dear. I haven’t done that in years. This is going to be… difficult. I’m a little unsteady already. Just don’t let me fall, please. Whoa! Easy… easy… I think I need to hold onto something. This is… not good. I’m getting old, Doctor. Really old. I feel like I’m going to fall over. Can I sit down now? Please?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schwer. Please, sit down. That's perfectly alright. It's not a problem at all. Balance does tend to decline with age, and it’s good we checked it. It simply indicates we should focus on exercises to improve your strength and stability. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen and feel for any tenderness. Just relax your stomach muscles, and let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Okay… sitting down is good. Balance… I need to be more careful. My daughter always tells me that. I need to be more careful. Abdomen… that sounds… personal. Is that going to be uncomfortable? I haven’t had any stomach problems, not really. Just… indigestion sometimes. But nothing serious. Just… old age. Again. Go ahead, Doctor. But be gentle, please. This is… sensitive territory. I’m a little nervous. Old man nerves, I guess. Everything is sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schwer. I'll be very gentle. I'm simply listening for any unusual sounds and feeling for any tenderness. Just breathe normally. I'm starting on your upper abdomen… Everything feels normal so far. No tenderness or unusual sounds. Now, I'm going to check your lower abdomen… Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Okay, everything feels normal here as well. No tenderness or masses. Your abdomen is soft and relaxed. Alright, Mr. Schwer. That concludes the physical exam. Everything I found was within normal limits for someone your age. Your heart and lungs sound good, your abdomen is normal, and your reflexes are present. The balance test indicates we should focus on exercises to improve your strength and stability. Now, let's discuss your medical history in more detail and order some basic blood work to get a better understanding of your overall health. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… good. Everything normal… that’s good to hear. Relief washes over me. Exercises… that sounds like a lot of work. But I guess it’s better than falling over. Blood work… I haven't had blood work in years. Is it going to hurt? Will it take a lot of blood? I don’t like needles. It makes me faint, sometimes. Yes, let’s talk about my medical history. It’s not very exciting, but… go ahead. Ask me anything. I just want to know if I’m okay. That’s all. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Schwer. It’s perfectly reasonable to want reassurance. And the blood work is relatively quick and painless. They’ll only take a small amount of blood, and a nurse will be with you to ensure you’re comfortable. If you’re prone to fainting, we can have you lie down during the procedure. Okay, it looks like you haven't seen a doctor regularly in about five to six years. Do you have any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
PATIENT: No… no chronic conditions. Like I said, I haven't really been to the doctor much. I try to stay healthy. I eat okay, I don't smoke, and I try to avoid stress. That’s my secret, I think. Just… avoiding stress. Easier said than done, though. My wife… she had high blood pressure. But that was her. I didn’t have any problems like that. Just… normal old man stuff. Headaches, indigestion… nothing serious. I think that's it. I don't have any allergies, I don't take any pills, and I haven't had any surgeries. Just… a normal life, I guess. Not very exciting, if you ask me. But it's been a good life. Mostly.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Mr. Schwer. It sounds like you’ve done a good job taking care of yourself. And it’s good that you haven’t had any serious medical issues in the past. Now, let’s talk about your family history. You mentioned your mother had heart problems and your brother had cancer. Do you know what type of cancer your brother had?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It was… lung cancer, I think. He smoked, like a chimney. The doctor said it was from the smoking. He had to have… things done. And then it spread. Real fast. It was… not good. My mother… she just got tired. And her legs puffed up. The doctor said it was her heart. She didn't live long after that. Maybe ten years ago? I don't remember exactly. It's hard to think about. My father… he lived to be a very old man. He didn't have any problems, as far as I know. Just… old age. That’s what got him in the end. A good, long life. Lucky man. I hope I get as lucky as he did.
DOCTOR: It sounds like a difficult experience, Mr. Schwer, losing both your mother and brother. Knowing your family history of heart problems and lung cancer is very helpful. It's important we monitor your health closely. Given your family history, I recommend we order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel to check your cholesterol levels, and an EKG to assess your heart function. We should also discuss a low-dose chest CT scan to screen for any early signs of lung cancer. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A… CT scan? That sounds serious. Is that going to hurt? And… radiation? I’ve heard bad things about radiation. I don’t want to get sick from the test itself. I’m a little nervous, Doctor. This is all… a lot. I just came in for peace of mind, you know? I didn’t expect so many tests. I just wanted to make sure I was okay. Is all this really necessary? Can’t we just… do a regular check-up? I don’t want to get poked and prodded and scanned and… everything. I just want to know if I’m okay. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Schwer. It’s perfectly reasonable to feel nervous, and you’re right, it’s a lot. And you’re right to ask if all of this is necessary. Let me explain why I’m recommending these tests. Given your family history of heart problems and lung cancer, we want to be proactive and screen for any early signs of these conditions. The blood tests will give us a baseline assessment of your overall health, including your cholesterol levels and kidney function. The EKG will assess your heart rhythm and detect any abnormalities. And the low-dose chest CT scan is a very sensitive imaging test that can detect small nodules in your lungs before they become cancerous. The radiation exposure from a low-dose CT scan is very minimal – about the same amount of radiation you receive from a few days of natural background exposure. The benefits of early detection far outweigh the risks. However, I completely respect your concerns. We can start with the basic blood work and EKG, and then discuss the CT scan at a later date. We can also refer you to a pulmonologist for a consultation to discuss your risk factors and whether a CT scan is appropriate for you. What do you think would make you feel more comfortable?
PATIENT: That sounds… better. Just the blood work and EKG for now. Let’s see what those show. I don't want to rush into anything. And… maybe a consultation with the doctor about the lungs later. After I think about it. I just… I don’t like being poked and prodded and scanned. It makes me nervous. I just want to know if I’m okay. Is that too much to ask? And… can you explain what the results will mean? I don’t understand all the medical terms. I just want to know if there’s something wrong. If there’s something wrong, I want to know. But I don’t want to be bombarded with complicated terms. Can you explain it in plain English? Please?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Schwer. That sounds perfectly reasonable. We'll start with the blood work and EKG. And I promise, I will explain the results in plain English. I won't bombard you with complicated medical terms. The blood tests will give us a good overview of your overall health, including your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and blood sugar levels. If anything is outside the normal range, we'll discuss what that means and what steps we can take to address it. The EKG will assess your heart rhythm and detect any abnormalities. If anything is abnormal, we'll refer you to a cardiologist for further evaluation. And if you decide you want to discuss the chest CT scan later, we can schedule a consultation with a pulmonologist who can explain your risk factors and the benefits and risks of the test. Here are the orders for the blood work and EKG. You can take these to the lab downstairs, and they'll schedule an appointment for you. Once the results are back, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes. That sounds… good. Less overwhelming. And… thank you. For explaining everything. And for being patient. I just… I get nervous easily. I’ll take these downstairs now. And… I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment when I get a chance. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate it. I think that’s all for now. Just… the blood work and EKG. And… maybe the lung doctor later.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Schwer. Take your time, and don’t hesitate to ask the lab technicians if you have any questions. And remember, I’m here if you need anything. Have a good day, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment. .
