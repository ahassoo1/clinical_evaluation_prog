DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. I see here you are 89 years young. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hmph. Young? I feel every one of my eighty-nine years, thank you very much. And don't bother with the pleasantries, Doctor. I'm here because of this foot. It's just…awful. Been bothering me for weeks now, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better, no matter what I do. It's a sore, Doctor, a very sore sore.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Cannington. And please accept my apologies; I meant no disrespect. Eighty-nine years is a remarkable milestone! We'll certainly take a good look at that foot and try to figure out what's causing the soreness. Now, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it started small, a little cut, I suppose. Didn’t think much of it at first. I've always had good circulation, or used to, anyway. But it just…didn't heal. Then it got red, and puffy, and started…weeping. It's on the bottom of my left foot, near my heel. And it hurts when I put any weight on it. Honestly, it’s just a nuisance. I can’t get around like I used to. And you know, at my age, keeping mobile is important. I don't want to end up stuck in that chair all day.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Cannington. Maintaining mobility is incredibly important at any age, but especially as we get older. It sounds like this has been quite disruptive. You mentioned it started as a small cut. Do you recall how you might have gotten the cut?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, do you expect me to remember everything that happened months ago? I've lived a long life. Probably just a scrape, something in the house. I wear slippers, mostly. It wasn’t anything dramatic. I didn’t go hiking in the jungle or anything. It just… appeared. I suppose I wasn’t paying attention. Old age, you know. Things slip your mind. But I assure you, I’m usually very careful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Cannington. You're absolutely right, it’s perfectly normal for details to become less clear over time. I didn't mean to imply anything at all. We'll focus on what's happening now. You said it started as a small cut and then became red and puffy. Has there been any drainage or pus coming from it?
PATIENT: Drainage? Pus? Honestly, Doctor, I'm not a medical professional! I know it's…wet. And sometimes there's a bit of…discoloration on the bandage. A yellowish tinge, I suppose. It's not pleasant to look at, let me tell you. I change the bandage every day, or as often as I need to, to keep it clean. I use those antiseptic wipes my daughter sends me. But it doesn’t seem to be helping much. Honestly, I’m starting to think it’s just one of those things that will never go away.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Cannington. And you're doing exactly the right thing by keeping it clean and changing the bandage regularly. The yellowish tinge you describe sounds like it could be pus, which often indicates an infection, but we'll need to take a closer look to be certain. Now, I'd like to perform a quick physical examination of your foot. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An examination? Well, I suppose so. But don't go poking and prodding too much, Doctor. I have sensitive skin, you know. And I don’t want you to make it any worse. Just…be gentle. And explain what you’re doing as you go along. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Cannington. I will be very gentle, I promise. I'll explain everything as I go along, and I'll stop immediately if anything feels uncomfortable. First, I'm just going to visually inspect the foot, looking at the size and color of the sore, and checking for any signs of swelling or redness beyond what you've already described. I’m noting some redness and swelling around the sore, as you mentioned. I also see a small amount of drainage. It does feel a bit warm to the touch. Now, I’m going to gently palpate around the area – that just means I’m going to feel around the sore to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Does that cause you any pain, Ms. Cannington?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, Doctor, that does cause pain! Don’t poke so hard! It’s sensitive, I told you. Honestly, I don't know why you need to do all this poking and prodding. It just makes it worse. I can tell you it hurts, I don't need you to examine it to find that out. Honestly, it feels like it’s getting deeper. Is that possible? I don’t want it to get any worse than it already is. I’ve heard stories about people losing toes… or worse. Don't tell me that’s going to happen to me!
DOCTOR: I apologize, Ms. Cannington. I didn't mean to cause you any pain. I was being too aggressive in my examination, and I should have been more gentle. You are absolutely right, I shouldn't have proceeded without being more mindful of your discomfort. Regarding your concern about it getting deeper, that is a valid worry. It’s possible for sores like this to extend deeper into the tissue, especially if there's an underlying infection. That’s why it’s important to determine the extent of the problem. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order a simple test – a wound culture. This involves taking a small sample of the drainage from the sore to identify any bacteria that may be causing an infection. It won't take long, and it shouldn’t cause you any significant pain. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A culture? More poking and prodding? Honestly, Doctor, you're starting to sound like my daughter when she insists I get a flu shot every year. Always something! I suppose it can't hurt to check, but promise me it won't be too painful. And explain exactly what you're doing before you do it. I don’t like surprises, remember? And how long will it take? I have a bridge game this afternoon, and I don't want to be late. Old ladies are very particular about their bridge games, you know.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Cannington, and I promise to be very careful. I will explain every step before I do it, and I will stop immediately if you feel any discomfort. The wound culture involves gently cleaning the area with an antiseptic wipe – similar to what your daughter uses, but we’ll be even more gentle – and then using a small sterile swab to collect a tiny sample of the drainage. It should only take a few minutes, and the discomfort should be minimal – a quick pinch, at most. The sample will then be sent to a lab, and the results usually come back within a few days. It will help us determine if there’s an infection and, if so, what type of bacteria is causing it. This information will allow us to prescribe the appropriate treatment – typically an antibiotic ointment or, in some cases, an oral antibiotic. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Just get it over with quickly, then. But be very gentle, Doctor. And don’t keep me from my bridge game! My partner, Beatrice, will be furious if I’m late. She takes bridge very seriously. Honestly, you wouldn't believe the things she says when someone makes a bad play... Just…do it. But warn me before you poke. And don't expect me to be pleasant about it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington. I’m now putting on gloves to maintain a sterile environment. I'm going to gently clean the area around the sore with this antiseptic wipe. This may feel a little cool. Now, I’m going to use this sterile swab to collect a very small sample of the drainage. This will only take a moment, and it may feel like a quick pinch. I’ll warn you right before I do it. There we go. That’s it. All done. I’ll now apply a clean bandage to protect the area. It shouldn't take long for the lab results to come back, and we'll contact you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, I recommend keeping the area clean and dry, and changing the bandage daily. Do you have any questions for me at this point, Ms. Cannington?
PATIENT: No, I don’t suppose so. Just…get those results quickly. And tell Beatrice I apologize in advance for being late. She’s a formidable woman, that Beatrice. Honestly, you wouldn't want to be on the receiving end of her glare. And one more thing, Doctor. Do you think I should wear a stocking to bridge? I don’t want to shock the other ladies with my…condition.
DOCTOR: That’s a perfectly reasonable concern, Ms. Cannington. And yes, a stocking would be a very sensible precaution. It will keep the area protected and allow you to attend your bridge game with confidence. I understand your concerns about Beatrice as well. It's always best to be prepared! We'll contact you as soon as the lab results are available, likely within 2-3 business days. In the meantime, if you notice any worsening redness, swelling, pain, or drainage, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all. Just…get those results quickly. And remind Beatrice I said hello. She'll appreciate that. Honestly, she’s a very particular woman. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. But don’t expect me to be singing your praises if Beatrice loses the game because I was late.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cannington. I will certainly pass along your hello to Beatrice. And I will do my best to get those results back to you as quickly as possible. Please take your time, and let me know if you need any assistance getting to your car. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a wonderful day, and good luck at your bridge game!
