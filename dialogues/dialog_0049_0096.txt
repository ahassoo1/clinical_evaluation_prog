DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Komarov. I'm Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Arbin. Well, it’s…it’s a bit hard to explain. My eyes, they’ve been really bothering me with the sun. Like, really bothering me. It started a few months ago, I think around April? Everything just feels too bright, and it hurts to be outside for very long.
DOCTOR: April, you said?
PATIENT: Yeah, around then. Maybe a little before, honestly. It wasn’t sudden, just…gradual. Started noticing it more and more with each sunny day. It’s gotten worse lately, now even being in the house with the sun shining through the window is uncomfortable. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Uncomfortable, yes. Can you describe the discomfort, Mr. Komarov?
PATIENT: Arbin, please. And, um…it’s like a stinging, really. And everything seems washed out, almost. Like the colors aren’t as bright as they should be. And it makes my eyes feel…tired, even when I’ve had a good night’s sleep. It’s not blurry, just…sensitive. Really, really sensitive. It feels like someone left the lights on full blast right in front of my face.
DOCTOR: Sensitive to light…photophobia, we call it. And you say the colors seem washed out?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's it, photophobia. Sounds about right. And yes, the colors…it’s like looking at a faded photograph, almost. Not all the time, but especially when it’s sunny. Everything just doesn’t pop like it used to. It's hard to explain, I guess. Is that…is that normal? I just wanted to make sure I'm explaining it right.
DOCTOR: “Normal” is a relative term, Mr. Komarov. It's helpful you're describing it so specifically. Have you noticed any other changes in your vision – any blurry vision, spots, floaters, or difficulty seeing at night?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. No blurry vision, no spots…floater? What does that mean, exactly? Just to be sure. And night vision is fine, I think. I haven't really noticed any difference there. It's mostly just the brightness, the sensitivity to the light and the colors seeming…less vibrant. Oh! And sometimes my eyes feel a bit gritty, like there’s something in them, but I usually blink it away.
DOCTOR: Gritty sensation… alright. And this “gritty” feeling, does it happen with or without the sunlight?
PATIENT: It happens more when I'm outside, definitely. But sometimes, even indoors, when I've been reading for a while, I'll get that feeling. Not as bad, though. It's like my eyes are just…dry, even though I blink. And I do try to use eye drops, but they don’t seem to help much, to be honest. Just for a few minutes, then it's back to feeling scratchy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when was the last time you had a comprehensive eye exam, Mr. Komarov?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness…let me think. It was…before my wife passed, I believe. So, it’s been a while. Probably…five or six years ago? Maybe longer. It’s hard to keep track, honestly. It was with a different doctor, back in the city. I moved out here to the country shortly after… everything. Sorry, I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Komarov. Five or six years…that does mean it's time for an update. We'll need to do a full examination. I'm going to check your visual acuity, assess your peripheral vision, and examine the health of your eyes. Do you have any known allergies to eye drops or any other medications?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to anything before. I take a bit of medication for my blood pressure, but that’s it. Just a small dose, every morning. Nothing else. And…I'm ready whenever you are. I’m just hoping we can figure out what’s going on with my eyes. It's starting to make everything…difficult.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please, have a seat. We'll start with your visual acuity. I'm going to ask you to read some letters on a chart. Just take your time, and read the smallest letters you can comfortably see.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Lead the way, Doctor. I hope I remember the letters, it's been a while since I had to do this! I'm a little nervous, but I'll do my best.
DOCTOR: Just relax, Mr. Komarov. It’s a simple test. Now, cover your left eye with this patch, please. Good. Now, can you read me the first line of this chart?
PATIENT: Alright, let's see… um… is that an “E”? Yes, definitely an “E”. And then… an “F”? Yes, an “F”. And then… “P”? Yes. "P". Everything looks a little…fuzzy, to be honest. But I can still make them out, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s try the right eye. Cover your right eye this time.
PATIENT: Okay… um. This side seems…worse. Is that an “F”? No… it looks like a “P”. Maybe? It's really hard to make out. Everything is so blurry. Oh dear. I think…I think my eyesight has gotten worse. I can barely see anything on that chart now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Komarov. Don't worry, we'll figure this out. It appears your vision is significantly reduced in both eyes. Now, I’m going to use a small instrument to examine your pupils and the front of your eyes. It won’t hurt, but it may be a little uncomfortable. I'll need you to look straight ahead.
PATIENT: Okay, that's alright. I trust you, Doctor. Just let me know what you're doing, so I'm not surprised. Look straight ahead… right? Just tell me if it's uncomfortable, okay? I'm a bit worried now, but I'm hoping you can tell me what's going on. Go ahead, when you're ready.
DOCTOR: Alright. Looking straight ahead…excellent. Now, just follow my light. Hmm…I’m noting some mild pallor of the optic discs. And there appears to be a slight narrowing of the retinal vessels. Now, this is interesting. Do you have any history of high blood pressure or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I do have high blood pressure, like I mentioned earlier. I’ve been taking medication for it for about five years now. My doctor keeps a close eye on it. Diabetes… no, not that I know of. I’ve never been diagnosed with it. My wife… she had it, but I haven't. We always got our check-ups, so I would have known, right? It's been a while, but I'm pretty sure. This narrowing of the vessels… is that bad? Is that why my vision is so poor?
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure, managed with medication. That’s important information. The narrowing of the retinal vessels, along with the pallor of the optic discs, is suggestive of hypertensive retinopathy. It means the high blood pressure is affecting the blood vessels in your eyes. That's why we need to get your blood pressure under better control, and we’ll need some further testing to rule out any other potential causes. I'm also going to check your peripheral vision.
PATIENT: Oh…hypertensive retinopathy. Is that…serious? I try to take my medication like I’m supposed to. I don't want to lose my sight. Peripheral vision… okay. What does that involve? Is it like looking at lights in a dark room? Sorry for all the questions, Doctor. I'm just a bit… overwhelmed, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It can be serious, Mr. Komarov, but it’s also manageable with proper treatment. The key is to control your blood pressure and prevent further damage to the vessels. As for the peripheral vision test, yes, it involves looking at lights in a dark room. We’ll measure your ability to see lights in different areas of your vision. It helps us detect any blind spots. Let’s go over to the visual field testing room. It's just down the hall. It will take about 20 minutes or so. Afterwards, we’ll discuss the results and create a plan. We'll also need to order some blood work and a comprehensive metabolic panel. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s alright, Doctor. Twenty minutes is fine. Blood work… that's understandable. Whatever needs to be done, I'm ready. I just want to be able to see again. Lead the way, please. I hope this doesn't mean I'm going blind. I've been through so much already...
DOCTOR: We'll know more once we have the results of the tests, Mr. Komarov. It's too early to say anything definitive. We are just gathering information right now. A technician will explain the procedure. She will explain everything, and it is a very simple test. I’ll be right outside if you need me.
