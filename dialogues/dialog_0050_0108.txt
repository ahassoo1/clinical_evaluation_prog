DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gentz. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you’re 51 years of age. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don't usually bother with doctors, honestly. But this… this ain’t going away. Been spitting up blood for a few days now. Not a ton, but enough to worry a man. It started, I guess, after a really bad bout of heartburn. Worst I've ever had. Thought it was just that, but… well, here I am.
DOCTOR: Heartburn, you say. And this blood... is it bright red, or darker, perhaps mixed with other material?
PATIENT: Bright red, mostly. Not chunks or anything, thank goodness. More like…streaks. And it’s not every time, you know? Sometimes it’s just…there. Like after I cough real hard. Makes a fella kinda queasy, if you wanna know. I eat pretty simple, so it's not like I'm downing a bunch of beets or anything causing that color.
DOCTOR: I understand. Streaks of bright red blood after coughing… that is certainly concerning. And you've had this for several days now?
PATIENT: Yeah, four days now. Started on, let me think… July 30th, I think it was. I tried some of those over-the-counter antacids, the pink ones, but they didn’t do a whole lot. Honestly, I figured it'd clear up on its own. I’m a pretty tough guy, you know? Don't usually complain. But it just kept happening.
DOCTOR: “Tough” is admirable, Mr. Gentz, but ignoring a symptom like this is rarely the best course of action. Let's get a bit more detail. Besides the heartburn and blood, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. I've been feeling a little tired, I guess. More tired than usual, anyway. And kinda… weak. Not like I can’t get around, but just… sluggish. Oh, and my stomach’s been a little upset. Not full-blown diarrhea or anything, but just… not right. Like a dull ache. It’s hard to explain. And everything tastes kinda bland now, even my coffee.
DOCTOR: A change in taste, fatigue, weakness, abdominal discomfort along with the blood… these are all things we need to investigate thoroughly. Do you smoke, Mr. Gentz?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My wife… she couldn't stand 'em. No, sir. I drink a little coffee, maybe two cups a day. And sometimes a beer with dinner. Nothing crazy. I'm a pretty healthy fella, all things considered. Or was, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to need to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Significant medical conditions… not really. Had the flu a couple times, like everyone does. And broke my arm when I was a kid, climbing a tree. But nothing… serious. Oh, wait. A few years back, I had some… trouble with my stomach. Doctor said it was an ulcer. Took some pills for a while, and it cleared up. That was… maybe eight years ago? Honestly, I don't remember the name of the doctor or the pills. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: An ulcer is important information. Do you recall if you had any procedures related to that ulcer?
PATIENT: Procedures… hmm. No, I don’t think so. I just took some pills, like I said. He didn’t send me anywhere or anything. Just… pills. I went back for a check-up after a few months, and he said it was all clear. I remember him saying something about the lining of my stomach, but that’s about it. Honestly, doctors never explain things properly, do they? They just tell you what to do and expect you to understand.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, regarding your family history – are there any instances of stomach cancer, esophageal cancer, or any other serious digestive issues in your family?
PATIENT: Digestive issues… Hmm. My mother had… something. Real bad stomach pain. They took her to the hospital a lot when I was a kid. I think it was… colitis? Or something like that. She died when I was young, though. Real young. Never really knew what was wrong with her, to be honest. My father… he was pretty healthy. Lived a long life. No cancer that I know of. It was a long time ago, though. Hard to remember all that.
DOCTOR: I understand. That information is helpful. Now, before we proceed to a physical examination, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the coffee, like I said. And sometimes I take an aspirin if I've got a bad headache. That's about it. Nothing regular. I don't believe in filling my body up with a bunch of chemicals if I don't need 'em. I used to take something for my knees, a few years back, but I stopped when it didn't seem to be doing anything. Don’t even remember the name of that one either. Things just… fade, you know?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. I’m going to need to perform a physical examination. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen, and I’d like to examine your throat as well. Please lie back on the examination table. We’ll start with your abdomen.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Let’s get this over with. Table's kinda cold, isn't it? Go ahead. Just try not to poke too hard, alright? I bruise easy.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as gentle as possible. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Nope. Feels… fine. Just a little pressure, that's all. Like you said. You’re being gentle, though. A little bit there… maybe. But nothing awful. Just… a dull ache. Like I been saying. It’s not sharp or anything. More like… a heaviness. Honestly, I can barely feel a thing. I’m a pretty numb fella these days.
DOCTOR: And here?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's a little more sensitive. Yeah, that's where it mostly hurts. Right… there. Like a burning sensation, almost. Not constant, though. Comes and goes. Been worse after I eat, usually. Anything greasy, especially. You pressing kinda hard, Doc. Maybe ease up a little? I’m not made of iron, you know.
DOCTOR: Apologies. Any pain with this?
PATIENT: Nope. Doesn't bother me none. Just feels like… tapping. Like knocking on a door, almost. You finding anything? You gotta tell me what's going on. I don’t like being poked and prodded without knowing what you're looking for. It’s unnerving, you know? Makes a fella feel like a… a science experiment.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Gentz. Based on the palpation, there is some tenderness in the epigastric region, consistent with your description. There is no palpable rebound tenderness or guarding, which is reassuring. I would like to examine your throat now. Please open your mouth wide and say "ah".
PATIENT: There. You happy? Everything feels kinda sore, though. Probably from all the coughing. Don’t see nothin’ wrong with my throat. Just a little red, maybe. But I told you, I been coughin' a lot. It's dry as a bone in here.
DOCTOR: Yes, there is some mild erythema of the pharynx, consistent with irritation. No obvious lesions or exudates. Now, given your history of heartburn, ulcer, and the current symptoms of abdominal pain, fatigue, and streaks of bright red blood after coughing, I would like to order a few tests to determine the cause. We'll need a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool occult blood test. I also recommend an upper endoscopy to visualize the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. The endoscopy will allow us to directly assess any potential sources of bleeding and obtain biopsies if necessary.
PATIENT: Tests? Endoscopy? What does that mean? You’re gonna poke around inside me? That sounds… awful. And biopsies? Are you talkin’ about cuttin’ pieces outta my stomach? Look, I don’t like any of this. Can't you just give me some pills? Like the doctor did before? That seemed to work fine. I don’t need fancy tests and… and procedures. It sounds expensive, too. I ain’t got insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, I understand your apprehension, and I assure you, we will discuss all options thoroughly. However, given your symptoms and history, simply prescribing pills without a proper diagnosis would be irresponsible. The endoscopy is the most effective way to determine the cause of your bleeding and rule out more serious conditions, such as cancer. It is a relatively safe procedure, performed under sedation, and we will take every precaution to ensure your comfort. Regarding the cost, I understand your concerns. We have financial assistance programs available, and we can explore options to minimize your out-of-pocket expenses. We also have a dedicated financial counselor who can assist you with navigating these options. I strongly recommend proceeding with these tests. They are essential for determining the appropriate course of treatment and ensuring your long-term health. I will be happy to answer any further questions you may have. Would you like me to explain the endoscopy procedure in more detail?
PATIENT: Cancer? You're talkin’ about cancer now? I just got a little heartburn and some blood… and now you’re talkin’ about cancer? That’s ridiculous. I don’t want any procedures. I don’t want to be cut up. I’ll just take some antacids, and if it doesn’t get better, I’ll… I’ll deal with it myself. I don’t trust hospitals, and I certainly don’t trust doctors who talk about cancer after a little bit of coughing. You can forget about the tests. I’m leaving.
DOCTOR: Mr. Gentz, please. I understand your fear and frustration. I did not intend to alarm you, but it is my ethical obligation to inform you of all possible diagnoses, even if they are unlikely. We are not talking about an immediate cancer diagnosis. The endoscopy is a diagnostic tool, to rule out more serious conditions. However, I respect your decision. I will document your refusal of further testing. I strongly advise you to reconsider, but ultimately, the choice is yours. Before you leave, I would like to provide you with a prescription for a proton pump inhibitor to help reduce your stomach acid. If your symptoms worsen or persist, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Proton pump… whatever. Just give me the pills, and let me go. I don’t want to talk about it anymore. I've wasted enough time here already. And don't call me about it, either. I’m not changing my mind. Let's just get this over with. Doctors… always makin' a big deal outta nothin'.
DOCTOR: .
