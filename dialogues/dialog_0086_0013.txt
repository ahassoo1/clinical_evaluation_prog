DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hilber. I’m Dr. Murtic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my water. I have trouble… getting it all out, you see. Like it just… stays in there. It’s been happening for a little while now. Not all the time, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Trouble completely emptying your bladder, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. That’s right. Completely. I feel like I try and try, but… not everything comes out. It’s uncomfortable, and… a little scary, to be honest. I don’t want anything to… get bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. And how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a good question. Maybe… three, four months now? It started slow, just a little bit left after, you know. Now it’s… more noticeable. Harder to ignore. I didn’t think much of it at first, thought it was just… old age, maybe.
DOCTOR: “Old age”?
PATIENT: Well, I am 53, Doctor. And my wife… she passed a few years back. Things just… change, you know? I didn't want to bother you with something silly. But it’s been getting worse, and I thought… best to check.
DOCTOR: It’s never silly to address a health concern, Mr. Hilber. Dismissing symptoms is how things become… serious. Alright. So, besides the incomplete emptying, are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. No pain, and no burning. It doesn’t hurt to go, just… doesn’t finish. It’s just… a weak stream, sometimes. And like I said, feeling like there’s still some left in there even after I’m done.
DOCTOR: A weak stream… alright. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: No, not really. It looks… normal, I guess. Same as always. I haven’t been drinking any more or less water than usual, either. Just… the same. It’s mostly just the… not getting it all out.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No fever, no chills, and my belly doesn’t hurt. Everything else feels… normal. I’ve been a little tired lately, but that’s probably just… being old, again.
DOCTOR: We are not attributing this to “being old”, Mr. Hilber. Let’s try to be precise. Now, do you have any difficulty starting your stream of urine, or is it a steady flow once you begin?
PATIENT: Oh. No, I don't have trouble starting, no. It comes right away. It’s just… doesn’t stop when I think it should. And like I said, doesn’t feel like it’s all gone. It’s hard to explain, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to need to perform a quick physical exam, Mr. Hilber. I'll need to check your abdomen and, yes, I will need to do a digital rectal exam. It’s important to assess the prostate and rule out any obvious issues. Do you have any objections?
PATIENT: Oh. A… a rectal exam? Well, that doesn’t sound very pleasant. But… if you think it’s important, Doctor, I guess I can do it. I don’t like it, but… I want to know what’s wrong.
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Hilber. And it will be as quick and discreet as possible. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll need you to bend your knees and relax. I'll be right back with some lubricant and gloves.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I’ll… I’ll just lie down then. I hope it doesn’t take long.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hilber. Just relax. I’m going to apply a little lubricant here. This might feel a little cool. Take a few deep breaths… Hmm. Prostate feels… slightly enlarged, but not dramatically so. No obvious nodules. Alright. That’s done. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels tender.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That wasn't… comfortable. But I'm glad it's over. And… yes, please listen to my belly. Tell me if you find anything wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright. Abdomen is soft, no masses. Bladder is… slightly distended, which is consistent with incomplete emptying. Alright, Mr. Hilber. Based on your symptoms and the exam, it’s likely you have benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. That’s an enlargement of the prostate gland, which is common as men age. It can cause difficulty urinating. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a urinalysis to check for infection and a prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, blood test to help assess your prostate health. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh. BPH… that sounds… serious. But you said it’s common? And a test… alright. No, ma’am. No allergies to medicine that I know of. Never had any trouble with them before.
DOCTOR: Common does not mean insignificant, Mr. Hilber. It simply means we have established protocols for managing it. The PSA test will help us determine if further investigation, such as a referral to a urologist, is necessary. I’m going to write you a prescription for tamsulosin. It’s an alpha-blocker that can help relax the muscles in your prostate and bladder, making it easier to urinate. It’s important to take it as directed. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review the lab results and see how you’re responding to the medication. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. A prescription… and a follow-up. That sounds… good. I guess. I just want to feel normal again. So, yes. That sounds acceptable. How often do I take this medicine? And are there any side effects I should be aware of?
DOCTOR: You’ll take one 0.4mg capsule of tamsulosin daily, preferably at the same time each day. It’s best to take it with food. As for side effects, the most common one is dizziness, especially when standing up quickly. You may also experience a stuffy nose or retrograde ejaculation, which means semen goes into the bladder instead of out of the penis. It’s not harmful, but it can be… unpleasant. If you experience any severe side effects, such as fainting or a rash, stop taking the medication and contact my office immediately. I’ve given you a handout with more detailed information. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Dizziness… and… retrograde ejaculation? Oh. That doesn’t sound very good. But I guess… if it helps, I’ll try it. No, I don't think so. I think I understand. Just take it with food and watch out for the dizziness. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. The lab order and prescription have been sent to the pharmacy. Remember to schedule your follow-up appointment in two weeks. And Mr. Hilber, if your symptoms worsen before then, please don’t hesitate to contact us. We’re dismissing you now. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I will. I will schedule that appointment.
