DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rowbottom. Welcome to the clinic. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. VODZAK. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Well, it’s about time someone asked. It's… it's my stool. There was blood in it. Not a lot, mind you, but enough to be concerning. And frankly, at my age, concerning is usually right. Don't you think?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to be concerned, Mr. Rowbottom, and I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. It's always best to investigate changes like that, especially at any age, but particularly as we get older. Could you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: More about it? What do you mean, more about it? It was red! Blood-streaked, I told you. Like… like someone mixed a little cherry juice in there. Though I haven't had cherry juice in years. Probably for the best, all that sugar. And it wasn’t just once, you know. It's happened a couple of times now. Honestly, it’s quite bothersome. And undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. Thank you for clarifying. "Blood-streaked" a couple of times. That's helpful. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the color of the blood?
PATIENT: Color? Honestly, Doctor, are you trying to quiz me? It was… red. A normal red, I suppose. Not bright red, not dark red… just red. Like I said, cherry juice-ish. Though I wouldn't know a proper cherry juice red anymore. Used to drink a lot of it as a boy, down on the reservation. Everything was better then. Are you a doctor or some kind of color analyst? This is wasting my time.
DOCTOR: I apologize, Mr. Rowbottom. I didn't mean to be difficult. The color can give us clues as to where the bleeding might be coming from. Bright red blood usually indicates lower in the digestive tract, closer to the rectum, while darker blood suggests a source higher up. Since you describe it as a “normal” red, that's good information. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits alongside this – anything different with the consistency, frequency, or difficulty passing stool?
PATIENT: Consistency? Frequency? Doctor, I’m eighty-eight years old! My consistency and frequency are… what you’d expect at eighty-eight years old! It comes and goes, alright? Sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's… less easy. And sometimes I go more, sometimes I go less. What kind of question is that? Honestly, you young doctors ask the most peculiar things. It hasn't been painful, if that's what you're getting at. Just… disconcerting. And messy.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. It sounds like your bowel habits have been relatively consistent for you, despite some normal variations. No pain, which is good to hear. Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Now there's a question. I suppose I haven’t been eating as much lately. Not much of an appetite, you see. Everything tastes… bland. And what's the point, really? I'm not getting any younger, am I? But it hasn’t been intentional. I haven’t been trying to lose weight. Though a few pounds wouldn’t hurt, I suppose. But no, I wouldn’t say I’ve lost a significant amount of weight. Just… not as robust as I used to be. Back in my flying days… now that was an appetite.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Rowbottom. It sounds like a decreased appetite is a relatively recent change. Now, have you noticed any fatigue or weakness lately?
PATIENT: Fatigue? Weakness? Well, I am eighty-eight, Doctor. What do you expect? I tire easily, yes. I don't have the energy I used to. Used to be able to fly all day and still go out dancing in the evening. These days… a little walk leaves me winded. Is that what you're asking? It's just… old age, I reckon. I'm not made of steel, you know. Though some of those old planes were. Now they were built to last. Unlike… well, never mind. Just tired, mostly. And a bit achy.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. It's helpful to get a complete picture of how you’re feeling. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and we’ll do a quick rectal exam, which is important given your concerns about the blood in your stool. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A rectal exam?! Now hold on just a minute! You want to… examine me there? At my age? That’s… that’s a bit much, isn't it? I’ve never had one of those before. And frankly, I don’t see what good it will do. I told you, it’s blood-streaked stool! What more do you need to know? Young doctors and their poking and prodding… it’s unnecessary! Absolutely unnecessary. I’m not sure I’m comfortable with that, Doctor. Not at all.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Rowbottom, and I apologize if I’ve made you uncomfortable. It’s a sensitive exam, I know. However, a digital rectal exam is often the best way to identify the source of bleeding in the lower digestive tract and rule out any concerning growths or abnormalities. It’s a standard part of evaluating this type of symptom, and it can provide valuable information. We can discuss alternatives, but I want to assure you it's a quick exam, and I will be as gentle and respectful as possible. It’s very important for your health, Mr. Rowbottom. Perhaps I can explain the process in more detail so you feel more comfortable?
PATIENT: Explain it? Oh, I understand perfectly well what it involves, thank you very much. It’s just… undignified. And frankly, I don’t trust these things. Always poking and prodding, finding something where there isn't anything. You’ll probably tell me I need surgery, and at my age… well, that’s just not an option. No, I’m not having any of it. I’ve lived a long life, Doctor. Eighty-eight years! I think I’ve earned the right to refuse a… a probe. I'll just… I’ll just keep an eye on it, alright? And if it gets worse, then… then I’ll think about it. But not today. Absolutely not today. You can listen to my heart and lungs, if you must, but that’s it.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Rowbottom. Your comfort and wishes are my priority. I respect your decision. We can certainly listen to your heart and lungs, and I can document your concerns and your refusal of the rectal exam. However, I do want to strongly advise that you consider this again, especially if the bleeding worsens or you experience any other symptoms like dizziness, weakness, or significant abdominal pain. Let's proceed with listening to your heart and lungs for now. Then, we can discuss some general advice for managing your overall health and what symptoms to watch out for, and I'll provide you with information on when to seek immediate medical attention. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That… that sounds reasonable. Listening to my heart and lungs is fine. I suppose that can’t hurt. And I’ll listen to what you have to say about watching out for things. Though I’ve lived eighty-eight years, Doctor, and I think I’ve got a pretty good handle on what’s normal for me. But alright. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, alright? With the… listening. And don't expect me to come back for a… a probe. Not ever.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rowbottom. I will be very gentle. And I respect your wishes completely. No pressure whatsoever. Alright, Mr. Rowbottom. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Good. Another one… and exhale. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear, although a bit diminished, which is not uncommon at your age. No wheezing or crackling that I can detect. Now, let's talk a little bit about what to watch out for…
