DOCTOR: Bula! Hello, Janie. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kimm. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Um… well, it’s this tiredness. Just… always tired. I don’t really… remember when it started, exactly. A while ago, I think. It’s just… draining.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling constantly tired can be really frustrating. Let’s try to get a better idea of what’s going on. When you say “draining”, can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not like I can’t do things. I still work at the pharmacy, you know? But afterwards… I just… collapse. Like there's nothing left. And it takes a long time to… recharge, I guess. Even just walking to the mailbox feels like too much sometimes. I don't know. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. So you're able to get through your day, but it feels like it takes a lot out of you, and you don’t bounce back quickly. And even small things can feel exhausting. Is this tiredness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s pretty constant, I think. Some days are worse than others, sure. But it’s… always there, lurking. It’s just… a background feeling, always weighing me down. I don’t really have days where I feel full of energy anymore. Not like I used to.
DOCTOR: Okay, a constant background feeling. That gives me a better picture. Have you noticed anything else that seems to make it worse, or maybe even a little better?
PATIENT: Umm… honestly? Not really. I mean, sleeping doesn’t seem to help much, even if I get a full eight hours. And… I don't know. Stress? Probably. But who doesn't have stress? I lost my husband a few years back, so… that’s always there too. But I don’t know if it makes the tiredness worse, or if the tiredness just makes everything harder.
DOCTOR: I'm so sorry to hear about your husband. That's a huge loss, and it makes perfect sense that you're still feeling the effects of that. Grief can definitely impact your energy levels. Okay, so we've got constant tiredness, not much improvement with sleep, and a history of significant loss. Let's do a quick review of your overall health to see if we can find any other clues. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh… um… let me think. I have… high blood pressure, I think? And my knees are bad, arthritis, the doctor told me. But… I take pills for those, so I thought that was taken care of. Honestly, I can’t remember everything. It’s been a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and arthritis, both managed with medication. That’s good. Do you remember what medications you’re taking for each of those?
PATIENT: Umm… for the blood pressure… I think it’s a little white pill? I take one every morning. And for my knees… something with a “vastatin” in the name, maybe? I really don’t pay attention to the names. My daughter usually refills them for me. I just take what she gives me. Sorry, I’m not much help with this part.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Janie. It’s common to not remember medication names. We can look it up in your records. Okay, I see here you’re taking Lisinopril 20mg daily for your blood pressure, and Simvastatin 40mg daily for your cholesterol and arthritis. Are you taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good. Yes, that sounds right. Um… let me think. Sometimes I take a Vitamin D pill, my daughter gives it to me in the winter. She says I don’t get enough sun. And… occasionally, a pain reliever for my knees, if they’re really bothering me. Just ibuprofen, the regular kind.
DOCTOR: Okay, so Lisinopril, Simvastatin, occasional Vitamin D in the winter, and ibuprofen as needed. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Well… except maybe shellfish once, a long time ago. But that was when I was a little girl, I think. Nothing recent.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known recent allergies. And just to be thorough, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Not any of those. I don’t like the smell of smoke. And my husband… he didn’t like drinking, so I never got into it. Just… never been interested.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your diet and exercise. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Umm… well, I try to eat healthy. I have oatmeal for breakfast, usually. And for lunch… sometimes a sandwich, sometimes soup. And dinner… usually something simple. Chicken, fish, vegetables. I don’t really eat a lot of red meat. I try to avoid sweets, but I have a little chocolate sometimes, if my daughter brings it over.
DOCTOR: Okay, sounds like a pretty balanced diet overall. And what about exercise?
PATIENT: Oh… not much. I used to walk more, but my knees… they bother me, you know? So, I mostly just… sit. I do some little exercises the physical therapist showed me, but not very often. Honestly, I mostly just try to take it easy. I don’t want to overdo it.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited exercise due to knee pain. Alright, Janie, thank you for sharing all of this with me. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. I guess. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I have an appointment later this afternoon…
DOCTOR: Okay, great. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to take your blood pressure and pulse. Your blood pressure is 140/90, and your pulse is 72. A little elevated, but not dramatically so. Now, I’m going to check your thyroid. Your thyroid feels normal. I'm also going to take a look at your knees. There's some swelling and tenderness in both knees, and a limited range of motion. Do you experience pain with these movements?
PATIENT: Yes, definitely. It’s a sharp pain, right in the joint. Especially when I try to bend them too far. It’s why I don’t walk much anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, sharp pain with bending, consistent with arthritis. Alright, Janie. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, there are a few things that could be contributing to your tiredness. Your high blood pressure, while managed, could still be playing a role. Your arthritis is certainly causing pain and limiting your activity, which can contribute to fatigue. And it's important to rule out other potential causes. I’d like to order some blood tests, just to get a more complete picture. These tests will check your complete blood count, thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and some other markers that can help us identify any underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. As long as it doesn't take too long to get the results. I really need to get this figured out.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We'll get these tests ordered right away, and the results usually take about a week to come back. In the meantime, I want you to try to focus on getting as much rest as possible, and continue taking your medications as prescribed. If your pain is particularly bad, you can continue taking ibuprofen as needed. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a plan to address your tiredness. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. A week… alright. I guess. Thank you, Doctor. Is there anything else I need to do now?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Janie. The lab technician will give you instructions on how to prepare for the blood draw, but generally, it’s best to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. Just water is okay. And try not to do any strenuous activity before the draw. I’m also going to give you a handout with some general tips for managing fatigue. I’ll have my nurse schedule your follow-up appointment before you leave. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… I hope we figure this out. It’s just… so tiring. Thank you, Doctor Kimm. I appreciate your help. I really should get going now.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Janie. I understand how frustrating it can be, and we'll do our best to find the cause of your tiredness and get you feeling better. We will talk soon. Have a good day, and please, take care of yourself. The nurse will be with you shortly to schedule your follow-up appointment. .
