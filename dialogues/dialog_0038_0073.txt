DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I already told the nurse. It's my stomach. Been going on for… too long. And nothing seems to help. Honestly, I don't have a lot of time for this.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Stomach issues for too long, nothing helping.” We'll try to get to the bottom of this as quickly as we can. When you say “too long”, roughly how long have you been experiencing these problems?
PATIENT: Oh, I don’t know… weeks? Maybe a month? It all kinda blends together when you're running to the bathroom every hour. I just want it fixed. I have things to do, you know? This is… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, so roughly a month of symptoms. And you mentioned frequent trips to the bathroom. Can you tell me a little more about what you're experiencing?
PATIENT: What do you mean? It's… diarrhea. A lot of it. That’s why I’m here, isn’t it? I don’t need to get into graphic details with a stranger. Honestly, I've tried everything the drugstore sells. And it doesn’t stop.
DOCTOR: I understand you'd rather not go into a lot of detail, and that's perfectly alright. Frequent diarrhea for about a month, and over-the-counter remedies haven't been effective. Has there been any blood in your stool, or any fever or chills accompanying this?
PATIENT: Blood? No. If there was blood, do you think I’d be sitting here? I’d be at the emergency room. And no fever, no chills. Just… this. And it’s exhausting. I’m losing weight. It’s just… awful. Honestly, I don’t know what you need to know to figure this out.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood in the stool, no fever or chills, and you've noticed some weight loss. That's helpful to know. Let's try to get a better picture of what might be going on. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? What appetite? I can barely keep anything down, let alone want to eat. Everything tastes like… nothing. And then I have to rush to the bathroom anyway. It’s a whole thing. I just want a normal day, is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that's not too much to ask at all. It sounds incredibly frustrating. Okay, so decreased appetite and everything tastes bland. Have you experienced any nausea or vomiting along with the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Sometimes. Not constantly, but… yeah, a few times I’ve thrown up. Mostly just… whatever I tried to eat. It doesn’t really matter what it is, it just comes right back up. Look, I’m not a doctor, okay? I just know I feel terrible. Can we just skip the twenty questions and figure out what’s wrong with me?
DOCTOR: You're right to ask me to get to the point. I apologize if I'm taking too long with the questions. I'm just trying to rule things out and get a clear picture. Now, have you had any recent travel, or been exposed to anyone who has been sick recently?
PATIENT: Travel? No. And sick people are everywhere. I live in a city. What kind of question is that? Honestly, this is a waste of my time. I need something to stop this. Now.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you've been dealing with this for a while now, and it's significantly impacting your life. Before we discuss potential causes and treatments, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just listening to your abdomen and checking for tenderness. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… get it over with. I don’t have all day. And don’t expect me to be happy about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could lie back on the exam table, that would be great. I'm just going to listen to your abdomen with this. It might be a little cool. Okay. I’m listening to your abdomen now. Your bowel sounds are present, which is good. I noticed a little tenderness when I pressed here, on your lower left side. Does that pain radiate anywhere?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. Down my leg, sometimes. Not all the time, but… yeah, it goes down my leg. It’s… annoying. Look, is that all you’re going to do? Because I still feel terrible, and I don’t feel any closer to getting an answer. Honestly, I'm starting to think I wasted my time coming here.
DOCTOR: Okay, pain radiating down your leg. That's helpful to know. And I understand your frustration. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be a viral or bacterial gastroenteritis – a stomach bug – but the length of your symptoms and the referred pain makes me think we should investigate a bit further. Do you have any history of Irritable Bowel Syndrome , or any other digestive issues?
PATIENT: IBS? No. I’m not one of those people. I just… have a stomach problem. Look, I don't need a fancy name for it. I just want it fixed. Can we just get some tests done, or what? I’m not interested in talking about my… history. I just want to feel better. Are you going to help me, or not? Honestly, I’m losing patience.
DOCTOR: I understand. You’re right, we need to move forward with some testing. Given your symptoms and the exam findings, I'd like to order a stool sample to check for infection, and a blood test to rule out any inflammation or other underlying issues. We can also do a basic metabolic panel to check your electrolyte levels, given the diarrhea. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever tests you need. Just… get it over with. And can you please hurry? I have things to do. Honestly, this is taking way too long. I just want to be able to eat something without running to the bathroom every five minutes. Can we at least talk about what I can eat in the meantime? Is there anything I shouldn't be touching?
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve ordered the stool sample and blood tests. They’ll send you to the lab right away. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, I recommend sticking to a bland diet. Things like toast, rice, bananas, and applesauce – the BRAT diet. Avoid dairy, fatty foods, and anything with a lot of sugar. And it’s a good idea to stay well-hydrated, even if you’re only taking small sips. I know it’s frustrating to wait, but these tests will help us figure out what’s going on and get you on the right track. I also want to emphasize that if you experience a high fever, severe abdominal pain, or blood in your stool, you need to go to the emergency room immediately. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Toast, rice, bananas… fine. I’ve heard it all before. And yes, I understand the emergency room part. Honestly, I’m not stupid. Just… get me the results as quickly as possible. And please, don’t call me with a lot of questions. Just tell me what’s wrong and how to fix it. I have things to do, remember? .
