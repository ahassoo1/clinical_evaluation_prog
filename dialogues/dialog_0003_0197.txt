DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sciarotta. I’m Dr. Yackey. Now, let's get straight to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. I need to get a card so I can drive for a ride-share company. Something about a commercial driver’s medical card, I believe. I want to get this done quickly if possible, if that’s alright.
DOCTOR: A commercial driver's license medical evaluation. Yes, of course. We do those. Though I must say, at your age… well, it requires a more thorough examination. Time is always a factor, naturally, but patient safety is paramount. Let’s not waste any more of it. Do you have any existing medical conditions I should be aware of before we begin?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let me think… I had my gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. And my knees aren’t what they used to be, but who’s knees are at my age? Nothing the doctors ever said was serious, mind you. I take a little medicine for my blood pressure, but it’s been stable for years. Is that enough information? I can try to remember more if you need me to.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal twenty years ago… knees, and stable blood pressure medication. Adequate, for now. What medication specifically are you taking for your blood pressure, and what is the dosage?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s Lisinopril. Twenty milligrams, once a day. I’ve been on it for… oh, I'd say about eight years now. My previous doctor prescribed it, and it’s been working just fine. I get it refilled at the pharmacy every month.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 20mg daily… Alright. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way, thankfully. I eat just about anything. No reactions to any medicine I’ve ever taken, and I've had my fair share over the years! Though I don't care for oysters, but that's a taste thing, not an allergy.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Sciarotta, to properly assess your fitness for a commercial driver's license, I’ll need to conduct a basic physical exam. It’s rather standard, involving blood pressure and pulse checks, a visual acuity test, and an assessment of your neurological function. Are you prepared to proceed?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Let’s just get it done, please. The sooner I finish, the better. I’m not keen on spending all day here. I hope it won't be too uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just have a seat here. We'll start with your blood pressure and pulse. Please remain still and try to relax. Blood pressure is… 148 over 82. Pulse is 78 and regular. A little elevated, but not entirely unexpected. Now, let’s check your vision. Can you read the bottom line on this chart, please?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That chart… it’s a bit blurry. I need my glasses to read that properly. I didn’t even think to bring them. I can barely make out the big letters at the top, let alone the small ones. I’m terribly sorry. Is there one closer?
DOCTOR: As I suspected. Without corrective lenses, you fail the visual requirements for a commercial driver’s license. We’ll need documentation of your corrected vision from an optometrist or ophthalmologist. Unfortunately, without that, I cannot complete this evaluation. Do you have a current prescription for glasses?
PATIENT: Oh, bother. Yes, I do. It’s… let me think… it's at home. I got it updated about six months ago. I just assumed I could read the chart. Is a recent prescription good enough? I can get someone to bring it tomorrow if that's what you need. I really don’t want to have to make another trip out here.
DOCTOR: A recent prescription is acceptable, Ms. Sciarotta. However, it needs to be verifiable. A phone call to your prescribing doctor will suffice. Do you recall the name and number of the practice that provided it?
PATIENT: Yes, it’s Dr. Tanaka’s office. It’s… let me see… the number is 555-1212. That's the main number. They're located over on Maple Street, near the bakery. I've been going to Dr. Tanaka for years. She's a very good doctor. I hope that works. I really appreciate you trying to make this easier.
DOCTOR: Yes, hello?
PATIENT: 
DOCTOR: Yes, I’m Dr. Yackey calling regarding Ms. San Sciarotta. She’s here for a commercial driver’s license evaluation and requires verification of her vision prescription… Yes, from six months ago… Thank you. That's all I require. Very well. They confirmed a valid prescription for corrective lenses, dated approximately six months ago. Now, let’s proceed with the remainder of the examination. I need to assess your neurological function. Can you please follow my finger with your eyes, without moving your head?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Alright, I can do that. Is that alright? Am I doing it properly? I sometimes get a little dizzy if I concentrate too hard.
DOCTOR: Your eye movements appear normal. No nystagmus detected. No obvious deficits. Now, I need to check your reflexes. Please relax your arms. Two plus. Normal. And the other side… Two plus. Also normal. Do you have any history of numbness or tingling in your extremities?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none at all. My hands and feet are perfectly fine. I do a lot of gardening, so I'd notice if something wasn't working right. Digging and weeding keeps you aware of things! I’ve never had any problems with numbness or tingling.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, finally, a brief hearing assessment. I'm going to say a series of numbers, and you simply repeat them back to me. Can you understand me clearly?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can hear you perfectly well. My hearing isn't what it used to be, but I can understand everything you're saying. Let's get this over with, shall we? I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay. Seven… two… nine… Please repeat those numbers.
PATIENT: Seven, two, nine. Did I get them right? I hope my ears aren't playing tricks on me.
DOCTOR: Correct. Repeat after me: Four… one… eight.
PATIENT: Four, one, eight. Is that alright? It's a little difficult with the traffic noise outside.
DOCTOR: Adequate. Now, Ms. Sciarotta, based on this limited physical examination, and pending review of your medical history provided, I tentatively deem you medically fit for a commercial driver’s license. However, I strongly recommend regular check-ups with your primary care physician to monitor your blood pressure and overall health. I will complete the necessary paperwork for you. Do you have any questions for me before I finalize this evaluation?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s wonderful! Thank you, Doctor. That’s a relief. No, I don’t think so. Just… how long will it take for the paperwork to be ready? I need to get this done so I can start driving as soon as possible. I really appreciate you getting me through this quickly. I hope I didn’t take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: The paperwork should be ready within fifteen minutes. I will call you when it is complete. It is imperative that you adhere to the recommended follow-up schedule with your physician. And, Ms. Sciarotta, please drive safely. That will be all. .
PATIENT: .
