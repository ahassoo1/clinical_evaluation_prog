DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. MayHugh. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Reisig. It's nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. And my daughter, Lani, she insisted I come. She worries something fierce. I… I keep having these spells where everything spins, and I can't hear properly. It comes and goes, you see? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds quite distressing when your hearing and balance are affected like that. It’s good of Lani to encourage you to seek medical attention. “Spells where everything spins” – that’s very helpful. Could you tell me a bit more about these spells?
PATIENT: Oh, it is, dear. It's… unsettling. Well, it feels like the room is tilting, or I'm tilting. And everything goes blurry for a bit. Sometimes it's just a mild dizziness, like I've stood up too fast. But other times… other times I can’t even stand. I have to lie down. And the hearing… it goes muffled, or just gone completely, in one ear usually. It doesn’t last long, maybe a few minutes, maybe an hour. It’s hard to remember the specifics, honestly. They all sort of… blend together.
DOCTOR: I see. So, the dizziness varies in intensity, from a mild feeling of unsteadiness to being unable to stand, and it's often accompanied by hearing changes, primarily in one ear. And you mentioned these episodes can last anywhere from a few minutes to an hour. Do you notice anything before these spells start?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Before… let me think. Not usually, no. Sometimes, I feel a bit… pressured, like something’s building up inside my ear. But not always. Sometimes it just happens, out of nowhere. I might be walking, or cooking, or even just sitting and reading. It’s… random, I suppose. Oh! Now that I think about it, sometimes if I turn my head too quickly, that seems to trigger it. But not every time. It’s very… unpredictable.
DOCTOR: Unpredictable is a good way to put it. The pressure you feel in your ear is important information, and the fact that quick head movements can sometimes trigger it is also quite helpful. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with these spells – things like nausea, vomiting, or any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, sometimes I get a bit sick to my stomach when it happens. Not full-blown vomiting, thankfully. Just… queasy. And a little bit sweaty, you know? Like a cold sweat. My vision… I don’t think so. Everything gets blurry during the spin, of course, but I haven't noticed anything different after it passes. I just feel… drained. Really tired. And a bit confused, if I've been really dizzy for a while. It's hard to think straight.
DOCTOR: Okay, so nausea, sweating, and a feeling of being drained and confused after the spells. That gives me a clearer picture. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or anything related to your ears or balance?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that's a tricky one. I’ve been to doctors over the years, of course, but… I don't really remember any specific diagnoses. I had a bad bout of the flu a few years back, and my blood pressure was a little high then, but I think it went down after a while. And I had some trouble with ear infections as a child, but that was a long time ago. Honestly, I don't have a very good memory for these things. My daughter, Lani, she probably knows more than I do. She’s very good with paperwork.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. MayHugh. It’s common to not remember every detail. We can always check your records for more information. Lani's assistance would be wonderful. Before we look at your records, let’s just cover a few more basics. Have you ever had any surgery or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgery… let me see… Oh! Yes, I had my gallbladder out, years ago. Must have been… twenty years or more now. And I was in the hospital when I broke my wrist, falling in the garden. But that was just for a couple of days, to get it set and in a cast. Nothing major, really. Apart from that… I don't think so. Nothing that I recall, anyway. I mostly try to avoid doctors if I can, you see? It's not my favorite thing.
DOCTOR: I understand. Avoiding medical care when possible is not uncommon. Okay, gallbladder removal and a wrist fracture. That's helpful to know. Now, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including over-the-counter medications and any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, sometimes. But not every day, only when it feels high. My daughter reminds me. And… I take a multivitamin, just to keep healthy. Oh, and sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when my joints are bothering me. It’s… ibuprofen, I think? The white ones. I get them at the pharmacy. Honestly, I have so many little bottles, it's hard to keep track.
DOCTOR: Okay, a blood pressure medication as needed, a multivitamin, and ibuprofen for arthritis. We'll try to get a complete list from the pharmacy records as well. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. No, I don't think so. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat anything, as far as I know. And I haven't had any trouble with any medications. I’ve been lucky, I suppose. Though I get a little bit itchy sometimes, but that's probably just the mosquito bites, living here in the islands.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Ms. MayHugh. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of what might be going on. I'll check your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs, and I'll also take a look in your ears and do a few simple balance tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That sounds… sensible. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have a few things I need to get done this afternoon. Just… please be gentle. My old bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. MayHugh. I will be as gentle as possible. Your blood pressure is a bit elevated today, which could be contributing to your symptoms. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs now. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, let's take a look in your ears. I see a bit of earwax in both ears, which could potentially be contributing to your hearing difficulties. We can address that later if needed. Finally, I'd like to do a few simple balance tests. Could you stand with your feet together and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Oh dear… I don't like this. I feel like I'm going to fall. I can't do it, Doctor. It's too… unsteady.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. MayHugh. It's important to prioritize your safety. It's not uncommon to feel unsteady with your eyes closed, especially if there's an underlying balance issue. Based on your history and the brief examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing something called Vestibular Neuritis, which is inflammation of the inner ear nerve. It can cause sudden onset of dizziness, hearing loss, and nausea. However, other conditions can cause similar symptoms, so we need to do some further testing to confirm the diagnosis. I'd like to order an audiogram – a hearing test – and an MRI of your brain to rule out other possible causes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh dear… an MRI? Is that… safe? I've heard things about those machines. And a hearing test… I already know my hearing isn’t very good, what good will another test do? But… if you think it's necessary, Doctor, I suppose so. I trust your judgment. Just… please explain everything carefully. I don't want any surprises. And how long will all this take?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Ms. MayHugh. It’s important to feel comfortable and informed. An MRI is generally very safe. It uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. We will ask you about any metal implants you may have before the scan, as those can be a contraindication. The machine is quite large and can feel a bit claustrophobic, but we can offer you medication to help you relax if you’re feeling anxious. The scan itself usually takes about 30-45 minutes. As for the audiogram, it’s important to get a baseline measurement of your hearing loss, and to determine which ear is affected and to what extent. It will help us monitor your condition and track your progress. It's a painless test that takes about 30 minutes. I will write you a referral for both tests. The audiogram can be done at the clinic next week, and I will coordinate the MRI at the hospital for you. It may take a few days to get an appointment. In the meantime, I can prescribe you some medication to help manage your nausea and dizziness. And I’ll also give you some exercises you can do at home to help improve your balance. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… well, it sounds like a lot. But I suppose it's better to know, isn't it? Yes, the medication would be good. And the exercises… I'll try my best, but my joints aren't what they used to be. I worry about falling. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience. I'm getting a bit tired now, though. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. MayHugh. It is a lot, and it’s perfectly alright to feel overwhelmed. We'll take it one step at a time. Here is the prescription for the meclizine. Take one tablet every 8 hours as needed for nausea and dizziness. And this handout contains the vestibular rehabilitation exercises. Start slowly and gradually increase the repetitions as you feel comfortable. If you experience any pain or worsening symptoms, stop the exercises and contact the clinic. I will also have the receptionist schedule your audiogram for next week. And I'll arrange the MRI appointment for you as soon as possible. Before you leave, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. And I hope these exercises don't make me fall. Thank you again, Doctor Reisig. You've been very kind. I think that’s all for now. I should probably get going before I forget where I parked the car. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. MayHugh. I understand your concerns, and we’ll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or if your symptoms worsen. And don't worry about forgetting where you parked, we'll help you if you need it. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you next week. .
