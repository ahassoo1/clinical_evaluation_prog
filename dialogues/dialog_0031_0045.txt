DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Withycombe. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Uh, well, I been getting…flushed. Real red face, mostly. It just happens. Not always, you know? Sometimes I eat, sometimes not. It’s been a few weeks now, I think. Maybe longer. Hard to say, exactly.
DOCTOR: I see. Flushing, you say. And it’s been occurring for a few weeks, perhaps longer, and doesn’t seem consistently related to eating?
PATIENT: That’s right. Not always after food. Sometimes it’s just…there. And it’s not like a fever flush, you know? Not hot. Just…red. My face gets very red. My wife…she used to say it looked like a tomato. But she’s…gone now. So. Just the red face.
DOCTOR: I understand. And I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Withycombe. That must be difficult. Let’s focus on the flushing for now. When this happens, does it involve any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think. Sometimes my heart feels a little…fast. Not racing, just…aware of it, you know? And maybe a little warm in my chest. But not always. And it doesn’t last long. The flushing goes away pretty quick, and then the heart feeling…normal. I don’t get dizzy or anything. Just red face and maybe a quick heart beat. It’s hard to explain. It just is.
DOCTOR: Okay, so flushing with possible palpitations – a feeling of a quick heartbeat – and no dizziness. And these symptoms are relatively short-lived. Now, to get a better understanding, could you describe what you were doing immediately before one of these episodes occurred?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s…tricky. It doesn’t seem to have a pattern. Sometimes I'm just sitting, watching the TV. Sometimes I’m walking in the garden. Yesterday, it happened when I was talking to Mrs. Peterson about her prize-winning roses. She was telling me all about fertilizer… …and then, boom. Red face. I didn’t eat anything special before any of them, that I remember. It’s really random. That's what's worrying me.
DOCTOR: I understand. Random occurrences can be concerning. Let’s go through some general health questions. Do you have any known medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Doctor said I was…healthy as a horse, he used to say. Back when my wife was still here. Checked me every year. Blood pressure was always good. No sugar problems. Nothing. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, that's all. And sometimes I take something for my knees, but that’s just when they bother me. Really, I've never been a sick man. That’s why this is so strange.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And what about any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries. Never had one. And I haven't been in the hospital since…well, since my son was born, a long time ago. Just the usual check-ups. Nothing serious. I broke my arm when I was a boy, climbed a tree… …but that was ages and ages ago. They put a cast on it, that was all. Nothing major, Doctor. Really.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And regarding your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, high blood pressure, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My father…he had some problems with his heart, later in life. But he smoked a lot. And he didn’t take care of himself. My mother…she was pretty healthy, actually. Lived to be 85. No, I don’t think so. Nothing much that runs in the family, that I know of. My brother, he has high cholesterol, but he eats a lot of fried food. I try to eat healthy, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about medications you currently take, even over-the-counter ones, and any allergies you have?
PATIENT: Like I said, just a little vitamin D in the winter. And sometimes ibuprofen for my knees, when they act up. Nothing regular. As for allergies…I think I’m allergic to dust, maybe? I sneeze sometimes when I’m cleaning. But it’s not a bad allergy. Nothing serious. No, no bad allergies. No, Doctor. I don't take much medicine. I really don't.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you for that information, Mr. Withycombe. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don’t mind. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your skin. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Blood pressure is fine. I had it checked at the pharmacy last month when I got my flu shot. It was…normal, the lady said. Go ahead, Doctor. I'm ready.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is 138/82. That's slightly elevated, but not critically high. Your heart rate is 78 and regular. I do hear a slight murmur, which we'll need to investigate further. Your lungs are clear. I see some mild redness on your face, but no rash or other concerning lesions. Now, to get a better understanding of what might be causing your symptoms, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will help us check your thyroid function, electrolyte levels, and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Yes, that’s…fine. If it helps. I don’t mind. As long as it finds out what’s going on. Thyroid…what did you say? I don't really know much about those things, Doctor. But yes, blood tests are okay. Whatever you think is best. Just want to know why my face keeps turning red.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. The thyroid is a gland in your neck that produces hormones that regulate many of your body’s functions. Sometimes, thyroid problems can cause flushing and palpitations. The blood tests will help us determine if this is a possibility. I will also order an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart's electrical activity. This will help us further investigate the palpitations you’ve been experiencing. The lab is just down the hall. They will draw a small sample of blood. The EKG technician will attach some electrodes to your chest to record your heart’s activity. It’s a painless procedure. Do you have any questions about the tests?
PATIENT: Electro…something? It sounds…complicated. Will it hurt? You said it was painless, but…I don't like needles. And these things…hormones, electricity… What if it's something bad? Just tell me straight, Doctor. Is it likely to be something serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Withycombe. It's natural to feel anxious when facing uncertainty. The EKG is a very common and completely painless procedure. Small stickers are placed on your chest, and they record the electrical signals of your heart. It doesn’t involve any needles. As for the possibility of something serious, it's too early to say. These tests will help us gather information and rule out potential causes. While your symptoms could be indicative of a more significant issue, they could also be caused by something relatively benign. The most likely possibilities at this stage include thyroid issues, a reaction to something you're eating or drinking, or a benign heart murmur. We need the test results to have a clearer picture. I want to assure you that we will take all necessary steps to determine the cause of your symptoms and develop an appropriate treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any known triggers for flushing, such as alcohol or spicy foods. Do you have any other questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No triggers…I don't really drink, and I like mild food. So, blood tests and the…sticker thing. And then we see? How long will it take to get the results? I've got my garden to look after, you know. And Mrs. Peterson's roses need pruning. I just want to get back to normal. It's just... unsettling, having my face turn red for no reason.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s completely reasonable to want to get back to your routine. The lab results usually take about 2-3 business days to come back. The EKG results are typically available much faster, within a few hours. Once we have those results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and determine the next steps. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or severe headache – please seek immediate medical attention. I’ll have the lab technician send over the order for the blood tests and the EKG. They’ll guide you through the process. Do you have any questions about where to go for the tests or how they’ll be performed?
PATIENT: No, I think I'm okay. Down the hall, you said? They'll tell me what to do. Alright. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you explaining everything. It…calms me down a little. I’ll go get those tests done, and then we'll see what happens. I suppose there's nothing else for it.
DOCTOR: That’s right, Mr. Withycombe. We'll take it one step at a time. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
