DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Reisig. It’s lovely to meet you. To start, could you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about this foot. It’s been a bother, a real bother. Seems like everything just goes wrong when you get old, doesn't it? It's a sore, and it won't heal. I’ve had… problems with the sugar, you see. Diabetes, they call it. Not that I do anything to cause it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s certainly frustrating when things aren’t working as they should, and diabetes can certainly contribute to foot problems. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Ms. Cannington. So, this soreness… could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it’s on my right foot, the top of it, near my toes. It started as just a little… scratch, I suppose. I don't even remember how it started. Probably bumped it on something. But it just… didn’t get better. Now it’s red and… well, it’s deep. And it aches. Not all the time, but when I walk, definitely. And it’s… unpleasant to look at, I assure you. I try to keep it covered, but even then… the smell. It's not good.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it started as a small scratch on the top of your right foot near your toes, and it’s become red, deep, painful with walking, and has a noticeable odor. You mentioned you have diabetes. Do you know when you were diagnosed with diabetes, and how it is currently managed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. It was… a long time ago. Probably twenty years, give or take. Dr. Hemmings was my doctor then. He put me on pills. Little white pills. I take them every day. Two in the morning, one at night, I think. Sometimes I forget, to be honest. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Though I remember perfectly well when young Timothy broke Mrs. Gable’s window with a baseball. That I remember. But the pills... sometimes they slip my mind. I try to eat right, but everything tastes so much better when it’s… sweeter, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It’s common for memory to fluctuate, and managing medications can be challenging. And it's understandable to enjoy sweeter foods. So, you take two pills in the morning and one at night, but sometimes you miss doses. Do you know the name of the medication, or what it’s for specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. The name of the pill? No, I don't think so. It's a little white one. That's about all I can tell you. Dr. Hemmings just told me it was for the sugar. “Keeps the sugar down,” he said. I don’t bother with names, honestly. Too much to remember. And it all sounds the same anyway. I just know I have to take something or things get… wobbly. And I don’t like feeling wobbly.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Cannington. We can look up your medication history in your records. I’m just trying to get a complete picture. Now, besides the medication, have you noticed any other symptoms related to your diabetes?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Well, I get awfully thirsty sometimes. And I go to the bathroom… a lot. More than I used to, certainly. And my vision… it gets blurry on occasion. Not all the time, but enough to make driving… uncomfortable. I mostly stay home now, to be honest. It's safer that way. And my feet… they tingle sometimes. Not just the sore one, but both of them. It’s a strange feeling. Like little needles. Does that count as a symptom?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Cannington, that absolutely counts as a symptom. Increased thirst, frequent urination, blurry vision, and tingling in your feet are all common signs of diabetes. It sounds like your diabetes may not be as well controlled as it could be, which can contribute to the foot problem. Now, I'd like to take a look at your foot. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Examine away. It's not a pretty sight, I warn you. I’ve been trying to keep it clean, but… well, it’s not easy when you can’t bend over so well anymore. And honestly, I don’t have the eyesight to see everything properly. Just be gentle, alright? It’s quite sensitive. I do try to wear proper shoes, you know. Not those flimsy sandals. Sensible shoes. But it doesn’t seem to make much difference these days.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cannington. I will be as gentle as possible. Okay, I see some redness and swelling around the area, and there is a small amount of discharge. It is quite tender to the touch, as you mentioned. The area is also warm. I don't see any signs of infection spreading into deeper tissues at this moment, but it is concerning. There is also decreased sensation in the area around the sore. Do you feel any pain right now?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I feel it, alright. A dull ache, mostly. And a bit of a throbbing. It’s worse when you press on it, of course. Like a… a bruise, but deeper. And it tingles, like little fire ants marching around. Not constantly, but off and on. It’s… unpleasant. Honestly, Doctor, I’ve had better days. Is it serious? You’re making it sound rather serious. I hope it doesn’t mean I’ll have to… you know… lose my foot. My sister lost a toe once, and it was dreadful. I don’t want that.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Cannington. It's good that you're aware of the potential risks. Based on my examination, it does appear you have an ulcer on your foot, likely related to your diabetes and decreased circulation. The decreased sensation is also a concern, as it means you may not notice small injuries that could worsen the problem. We need to take this seriously, but I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to avoid a more serious outcome. We’re not at the point of considering amputation, and I do not believe we are there yet. However, this requires prompt treatment. I’d like to order some lab work to check your blood sugar levels and look for signs of infection. I also think we need to get an X-ray of your foot to see if there's any bone involvement. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, lab work and an X-ray… goodness. Well, if you think it’s necessary. I suppose it’s better to know, isn’t it? Though I don’t like the thought of all those… rays. Are they dangerous? My cousin Agnes always said X-rays are terrible for you. But if it will help… alright. Do I have to do anything special? Fasting, or something? I can’t remember what Dr. Hemmings used to say. My mind is just… blank sometimes. And how long will it take? I have my bingo game this afternoon. It's the big one, you know. The prize is a lovely fruit basket.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Cannington. We’ll take things one step at a time. For the blood work, you will need to fast for eight hours beforehand, so you would need to avoid eating or drinking anything except water. We can schedule that for tomorrow morning, so you can still make your bingo game this afternoon. As for the X-ray, it's a very quick procedure and the amount of radiation is minimal. It's safe, and the benefits of getting a clear picture of your foot far outweigh the risks. We’ll get those tests ordered now. In the meantime, it’s very important to keep pressure off your foot as much as possible. Do you have a comfortable chair you can sit in to rest?
PATIENT: Oh, eight hours… that will mean no breakfast. That’s alright, I suppose. I don’t eat much breakfast anyway. Just a little toast and tea. And yes, I have a lovely chair. A big, comfy armchair in the living room. It’s where I do my knitting. Though I haven’t been knitting much lately. My hands aren’t as steady as they used to be. And I suppose I should stay off my foot. Easier said than done, you know. I have to get to the kitchen, and the bathroom, and… well, everywhere! Do you think I should get one of those… those walking sticks? My neighbor, Mrs. Gable, has one. She seems to manage alright with it. But I feel so… old when I think about using a walking stick.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Cannington. It’s perfectly natural to feel that way. A walking stick could be very helpful in taking some pressure off your foot, and it’s a good idea to consider it. We can discuss that further after we get the results of your tests. For now, try to elevate your foot as much as possible and avoid putting weight on it. I’m going to write out an order for the lab work and the X-ray, and I’ll have the nurses schedule those for you. We'll also discuss a wound care plan, since it is important to keep the ulcer clean and protected. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A wound care plan… goodness. All this sounds rather complicated. I suppose I’ll need help. My son, Timothy, lives nearby, but he’s always so busy with work. He barely has time to visit, let alone help me with… wound care. Though I suppose he could. He should help. He’s a good boy, really. Just… distracted. As for questions… well, will this be expensive? I’m on a fixed income, you know. Medicare covers most things, I suppose, but… well, things can add up. And will I have to come back often for appointments? I do like my bingo. I don’t want to miss too many games. Is it contagious? I don’t want to give it to anyone. That would be dreadful. Oh, and… is it my fault? Did I do something wrong to cause this? I always try to take care of myself.
DOCTOR: Those are all very valid concerns, Ms. Cannington. Let’s address them one by one. First, regarding cost, Medicare should cover the majority of the tests and treatment. Our billing department can help you navigate any potential costs and explain your coverage. We will make sure you are aware of any out-of-pocket expenses before proceeding. As for appointments, we will need to monitor your progress closely, so there will be follow-up visits. We will try to schedule them at a convenient time to minimize disruption to your activities, including your bingo game. Regarding contagiousness, no, this is not contagious. It's related to your diabetes and circulation, not an infection you can spread to others. And lastly, no, this is not your fault. Diabetes can cause a variety of complications, and sometimes they happen despite your best efforts. It’s not a sign of anything you did wrong. We’re here to help you manage the condition and treat the ulcer. I’m going to have the nurse come in to review the wound care instructions with you in detail. She can also answer any other questions you may have. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds lovely. A nurse… yes, a nurse would be good. They always seem to know everything. And wound care instructions… well, I suppose I’ll need all the help I can get. I’m not very good at… medical things. I was always better at baking. Chocolate chip cookies, mostly. Everyone loves my chocolate chip cookies. And if Timothy comes over, I’ll have him read the instructions too. He’s good with details. Though he doesn’t always listen. But I’ll make sure he listens this time. He needs to understand the importance of this. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. And reassuring. It’s nice to know someone is taking care of me. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll sit here for a bit and try to remember where I put my glasses. I had them just a moment ago…
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cannington. That’s what I’m here for. And don’t worry about your glasses; they often turn up in unexpected places. I'll let the nurse know you're ready for the wound care instructions. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
