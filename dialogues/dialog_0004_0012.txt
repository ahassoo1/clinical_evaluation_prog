DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I’m Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m here because I’m planning a cruise – a bit of a belated holiday, you see – and the cruise line requires a form filled out by a doctor, just to confirm I’m fit enough to travel. Nothing serious, thankfully. It’s just a standard thing, I believe.
DOCTOR: A cruise, you say. Very well. While it is good you’re being proactive, even a ‘standard thing’ requires a proper assessment. It wouldn’t do to have someone fall ill mid-voyage. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, asthma?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, quite right. One mustn’t be too careful, especially at sea. Let me see… chronic conditions. No, not as such. I had a bit of trouble with my ankles years ago, playing netball, but that’s long healed. My husband… well, my late husband had high blood pressure, but I don’t. I’ve always been quite healthy, touch wood. I do get a wee bit of… stiffness sometimes, in my back, but it’s just age, I think. Nothing a warm bath doesn’t fix.
DOCTOR: “A wee bit of stiffness,” right. And how long has this “stiffness” been present?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, a good while now. On and off for… ten years, maybe? It comes and goes, really. Worse in the cold weather, of course. I wouldn't say it stops me doing anything, not at all. I still manage the garden, and I walk the dog every day. It's just… there. A reminder I'm not twenty anymore, you see. Is that… is that important, Doctor? I mean, it’s hardly a debilitating condition.
DOCTOR: Everything is important, Ms. Squiers. We are attempting to ascertain your fitness for travel. Ten years, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, ten years or so. And it hasn’t been getting noticeably worse, thankfully. It’s… consistent, if that makes sense. A dull ache, mostly in my lower back. It’s usually better after I’ve been moving about, actually. Sitting for too long is what sets it off, I think. I do a lot of standing at work, arranging displays, and that seems to help keep it at bay. Would you like me to tell you about the work in more detail? Perhaps that will give you a better idea.
DOCTOR: No, not at this moment. Let's stick to the medical aspects. Do you experience any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Perfectly good feeling in my legs and feet. I can feel the carpet quite clearly under my shoes, thank you. Though, now that you mention it… sometimes, if I’ve been lifting something heavy at work, I get a bit of a… ache in my arms. But it passes quickly. Really, I’m quite robust for my age, I assure you. It’s just… I don't want to be a bother if it’s something minor.
DOCTOR: "Robust" is not a medical term, Ms. Squiers. You mentioned aches in your arms… when lifting?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, sorry. Bad phrasing, I suppose. It's just… I don't like to make a fuss. The aches in my arms, yes. Mostly when I’m moving heavier items at work – mannequins, larger displays, things like that. It's not a sharp pain, more of a muscle fatigue, really. It usually goes away after a good night's sleep. I haven't had any trouble lifting things recently, though, so it’s not been a problem. Is this… concerning, Doctor? I really am sorry if I'm rambling.
DOCTOR: Rambling is not helpful, Ms. Squiers. We are trying to establish if you are capable of handling potential emergencies on a cruise, which, let me assure you, can occur. You state “no trouble lifting recently.” Have you noticed any weakness in your arms or legs at all?
PATIENT: No, no weakness whatsoever. Perfectly capable, thank you. I can still carry the groceries, open jars, and wrestle with the dog if need be. Honestly, Doctor, I feel perfectly fine. But… if you're concerned, perhaps you should ask me about medications? I take a small dose of something for my… well, it’s just a little something to help me sleep at night. That’s all. It’s not anything serious, I promise you. A very small dose, prescribed by my previous doctor, Dr. MacIntyre, years ago. Would you like the name of it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Squiers, I would like the name of it. And the dosage. Dr. MacIntyre is no longer listed as your primary care physician. It’s important to know everything you are taking, even if you deem it “not serious.” Please, do not omit details.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, it's called… Zopiclone. 3.75 milligrams. Just one tablet before bed, when needed. I haven't taken it every night for… goodness, years now. Only when I’ve had a particularly stressful day, or if I’m feeling anxious about something. I was prescribed it after my husband passed away, you see. It helps me… settle. But, like I said, I rarely take it now. Perhaps once or twice a month, if that. I can show you the bottle if you'd like? It's in my handbag. I keep it just in case, you understand.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s move on to allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or environmental factors?
PATIENT: No, none that I'm aware of. I eat most things without a problem. I've never had a reaction to any medication, to my knowledge. I've got a bit of hay fever in the summer, but that's hardly an allergy, is it? Just a bit of a sniffle and a watery eye. Nothing a tissue and a bit of fresh air can’t fix. I haven’t been stung by a bee in years, and I’ve never had any trouble with shellfish or nuts. Honestly, Doctor, I’m remarkably un-allergic, if that’s even a word. Is that… satisfactory?
DOCTOR: Satisfactory is not the relevant term, Ms. Squiers. Now, are you currently experiencing any pain anywhere in your body?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not at this moment. As I said, the wee bit of stiffness in my back comes and goes, but it's nothing debilitating. Perhaps a slight ache in my shoulders after a long day at work, but that’s just from arranging the displays, you see. I don't have any sharp pains or anything like that. I'm not in any acute discomfort, if that's what you're asking. I can stand, walk, and bend without any trouble. Honestly, Doctor, I feel quite well for my age. Is there something specific you're looking for? Perhaps I'm not explaining things properly.
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, I’m going to need to conduct a brief physical exam. Please, if you would, step up on the table. We’ll start with your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oh, right. A physical exam, of course. Yes, perfectly fine. I do hope I’m not too much trouble, Doctor. It’s been a while since I had one of these. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I’m a bit unsteady on my feet sometimes, you see.
DOCTOR: Please, lie back. 142/88. A little elevated, but not excessively concerning given your report of stress. Heart sounds are regular, though slightly rapid. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. Deep breath… like that? I always feel a bit silly doing this, Doctor. It reminds me of when I was a child. Is that… normal? My husband always used to say I breathed rather loudly. Is that relevant? I do hope I’m not being a bother.
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, please focus on the examination. Now, can you sit up and slowly touch your toes for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, certainly. Oh, dear. That’s… not as easy as it used to be. My back is protesting a bit, you see. Perhaps I shouldn’t push it too hard. I do get a bit of stiffness… There. Is that alright? I do hope I’m not causing you any concern, Doctor.
DOCTOR: There is some tenderness to palpation in the lower lumbar region, consistent with your report of stiffness. Now, stand up slowly. Observe your gait. Do you experience any pain or difficulty walking?
PATIENT: No, not at the moment, Doctor. Just a bit of a stiffness, you see. I walk perfectly normally, mostly. Sometimes, if I’ve been on my feet all day, I feel a bit of an ache in my hips, but it passes quickly. I do try to keep active, you understand. Walking the dog is very good for me. Perhaps I'm not explaining things properly. Is there something specific you’re looking for? I do hope I'm not wasting your time.
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, I’m attempting to ascertain if you are physically capable of handling unforeseen circumstances on a cruise. We’ll need to review your medical history again. You mentioned Zopiclone. Have you ever been diagnosed with any sleep disorders?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no sleep disorders as such. Dr. MacIntyre just prescribed the Zopiclone after my husband passed away. I was… terribly upset, you see. Couldn't sleep at all. He said it was just a temporary measure, to help me get through the initial… grief. I haven’t been formally diagnosed with anything. Just a bit of trouble sleeping occasionally. Honestly, Doctor, I’m quite robust, despite everything. I do hope this is all alright. I really don't want to cause any trouble.
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, while I appreciate your attempts to reassure me, your reports are… fragmented. And frankly, rather vague. Given your age, reported aches, limited range of motion, and use of a sedative, I recommend a full cardiac workup before you embark on this cruise. It would be irresponsible of me to clear you for travel without further investigation. I will order an EKG and blood tests, including a complete metabolic panel and thyroid function tests. We will also need a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. That… sounds rather serious, doesn’t it? A full cardiac workup… and a chest X-ray? I was just hoping for a simple form signed, you see. Is it really necessary? I feel perfectly well, mostly. Perhaps… perhaps I could just take a bit of extra care on the cruise? Avoid strenuous activities, you understand. I really don't want to go to all that trouble. What if… what if something shows up? I do try to stay positive, you see.
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, your health is my priority. A "simple form signed" is not an adequate substitute for proper medical assessment. A cardiac workup will help rule out any underlying heart conditions that could be exacerbated by travel. The chest X-ray will assess your lung health. It’s standard procedure, and frankly, it’s for your own safety. I understand you’re anxious, but delaying investigation could have serious consequences. I will have my nurse schedule these tests for you immediately. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh… very well. If you think it’s necessary, Doctor. Contrast dye… let me think. I don’t believe so, no. I’ve had injections before, without any trouble. Though… I can’t be absolutely certain. It was years ago, you see. My husband used to handle all the medical arrangements. Perhaps… perhaps I should just cancel the cruise? It’s not worth risking my health, is it? I was just looking forward to a bit of sunshine, you understand.
DOCTOR: Ms. Squiers, cancelling the cruise is a decision you need to make. However, I strongly recommend proceeding with the cardiac workup before making that decision. We need to have a clear understanding of your health status. I will write the orders for the EKG, blood tests, and chest X-ray. My nurse will explain the procedure and schedule the appointments for you. Please, try to remain calm. We are doing this to ensure you have a safe and enjoyable trip, if you choose to proceed. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… very well, Doctor. No, I don’t think so. Just… please try to be quick, if possible? And… perhaps you could explain the results to me in simple terms? I don’t understand all the medical jargon, you see. My husband… he always used to explain everything. I suppose I’ll just have to trust your judgement. Thank you, Doctor. I'll wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will be with you shortly.
