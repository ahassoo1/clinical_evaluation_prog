DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It's nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor... Soodeen, right? Yes. Well, it’s... something about a check-up? For... work. I think it has to do with a performance. Honestly, it’s all a bit fuzzy. They just said I needed to get cleared by a doctor. Is that right? A physical? I apologize, my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krahn, that’s perfectly alright. Many patients come in for work clearances, and a physical is often part of that process. We'll do a thorough exam, and I’ll document everything for your employer. It sounds like a general work physical is what you need. To start, can you tell me a little about the type of work you do?
PATIENT: Work… right. Well, I mostly… help people at theaters. Ushers, you know? And sometimes the ticket booth. Lobby stuff. It's… not very strenuous. Mostly standing and walking, pointing people to their seats. I’ve been doing it for a long time. A very long time. I don't remember exactly how long, sadly. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Standing and walking for extended periods… alright. And generally, how do you feel while you're doing that?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, my feet get tired, of course. Very tired. And my back sometimes aches a little. Old age, I suppose. Nothing terrible, usually. I just… sit down when I can. I try to take little breaks. I wouldn’t say it stops me from doing anything, but… it’s there. And sometimes I feel a bit… lightheaded, if I stand for too long without a rest. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s important. Fatigue, back pain, and lightheadedness are all things we need to discuss. To get a better picture, can you describe the back pain a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, it’s… not a sharp pain, you understand? More of a dull ache, mostly in my lower back. It comes and goes. It's worse at the end of the day, naturally, after being on my feet for hours. Sometimes it radiates down my legs a little, but it’s not… debilitating. It just makes it uncomfortable to bend over. I mostly try to avoid bending over, if I can be honest. I don't remember if I’ve ever seen a doctor specifically for my back, though. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Dull ache, radiating to the legs, worse at the end of the day... alright. Now, regarding the lightheadedness, can you tell me more about that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s… not constant, thankfully. It usually happens if I stand for a very long time without moving. Or, sometimes if I get up too quickly. It’s just… a woozy feeling. Like everything’s spinning for a moment. It doesn't last long, usually. A few seconds, maybe. And I just… hold onto something. A wall, a chair, you know? I haven’t… I don’t think I’ve ever actually fainted. It’s just… unsettling. It’s probably just old age, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s good that you haven't fainted, Mr. Krahn. Lightheadedness can have several causes, and it’s important we investigate. Before we move on to a physical exam, let me ask a few questions about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think… I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. I haven’t had any reactions to anything recently. I used to have a bit of a sensitivity to… certain pollens, maybe? As a child? But it wasn’t anything serious. I haven't really thought about it in years. I apologize, my mind is a bit of a blank sometimes. Is there a specific medication I should be thinking about?
DOCTOR: No need to apologize, Mr. Krahn. It's helpful to know you don’t recall any significant allergies. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Well, I take a little something for my… joints. Something to help with the aches and pains. It's an over-the-counter thing, I think. I get it at the drugstore. A small white pill. I can't recall the name, I'm so sorry. And… occasionally, I take a little something for my… indigestion. Again, over-the-counter. A pink one. Other than that… no, I don't think so. My memory is truly failing me today. It’s embarrassing.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Krahn, don’t worry about it. Many people have trouble remembering medication names. We can try to figure it out later if needed. Now, have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think. When I was a child, I had… the measles, I think. I was quite sick, but I don't remember much about it. A long, long time ago. Other than that… no, I don't believe so. I've been fortunate, thankfully. I've always tried to take care of myself. I don't recall any… serious illnesses, thankfully. Is that helpful? Perhaps not. My apologies.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. No significant hospitalizations as an adult. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh dear. Let me think carefully. When I was younger… I had my tonsils taken out, I believe. A very long time ago, when I was a boy. Other than that… no, I don't recall any surgeries. I’m quite sure of that. I would remember something like that, wouldn’t I? But… truthfully, my memory is so unreliable these days. It’s frightening, sometimes. I apologize for my rambling. It’s probably not helpful at all.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Krahn. Many patients find it difficult to recall past medical history, and it’s perfectly normal. Now, I’d like to ask about your family medical history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No, I’m afraid not. My parents passed away a long time ago. Both of them. My mother… she passed away when I was quite young, actually. I don't remember much about her, sadly. And my father… he lived a long life, but he passed away many years ago as well. I'm the last of my family, I believe. I don’t recall… specific illnesses they had. I’m so sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. I really do. It’s just… my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krahn. It’s perfectly alright. We can proceed without detailed family history for now. Finally, before we move on to the physical exam, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My lifestyle… Well, it’s… quiet. I live alone. I mostly stay at home, read books, watch television. I walk to work, of course. That’s my exercise, I suppose. I don’t… socialize much. I used to, years ago, but… not anymore. I don’t smoke. I don’t drink alcohol. I try to eat healthy, mostly. I like to cook for myself. It’s… a simple life. A very simple life. Is that helpful? It’s probably not very exciting, I apologize.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Mr. Krahn. Quiet lifestyle, no smoking or alcohol, walking to work... Alright. Now, let's proceed with a brief physical exam. Could you please stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. There we go. Be careful, I’m a bit… wobbly sometimes. This floor is rather slippery, you know. Just let me know if you need me to hold onto something. Please be gentle, Doctor. My joints aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krahn. I will be very gentle. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, 88 beats per minute. Lungs sound clear, but I do notice a slightly diminished breath sounds at the bases. Is there any history of asthma or COPD?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Elevated heart rate? Diminished breath sounds? Oh dear. Asthma or… COPD? No, not that I recall. Never been diagnosed with either, no. I used to get… a little bit of a cough in the winter, but nothing serious. Just a cold, I suppose. But I've never had any trouble breathing, not really. That doesn't sound good, does it?
DOCTOR: It doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious, Mr. Krahn. Diminished breath sounds can have several causes. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is slightly elevated at 140/90. Again, we'll need to monitor this. Now, let me check your reflexes. Reflexes are slightly diminished but within normal limits. Now, I’d like to check your range of motion. Can you bend forward and touch your toes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Elevated blood pressure too? Oh dear, this isn't good, is it? Range of motion… bending forward? Oh… oh dear. That… that’s a bit difficult, Doctor. I can’t… I can’t touch my toes anymore, I’m afraid. It’s quite painful. My back… it’s aching quite a bit now. I apologize. I really shouldn't have tried that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn, that’s enough for now. Please, sit down. We don’t want to cause any further discomfort. Your limited range of motion and lower back pain are significant findings. Now, I’m going to check your feet and ankles for swelling. I do notice some mild edema in your ankles and feet. Overall, your exam reveals slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure, diminished breath sounds, mild edema in your ankles, and limited range of motion in your lower back, with associated pain. I think it's best to order some blood work and an EKG to get a better understanding of what's going on.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Blood work? An EKG? Oh dear, that sounds… serious. Diminished breath sounds, edema, limited range of motion… Is it… is it my heart? Is something seriously wrong, Doctor? I apologize for being so anxious. It’s just… all this sounds quite frightening. I haven’t felt this unwell in a very long time. And I don't want to put my employer in a position where I can’t do my job. Perhaps I should retire. I'm probably too old for this anyway.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, please try to remain calm. We’re going to take things one step at a time. The tests are simply to help us gather more information and determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. It doesn’t necessarily indicate anything serious. It's good to check all possibilities. It could be a number of things, not just heart related. We’ll order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and an EKG. We’ll also check your oxygen saturation level. Now, regarding your work, let’s focus on getting a diagnosis first. We can address that afterwards. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye, if we were to need any imaging in the future?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Contrast dye… I… I don't recall. I’ve never had any imaging done before, I don’t think. No, I don’t believe I have any allergies, but honestly, my memory… it’s so unreliable these days. I truly can’t be sure. I apologize. Complete blood count, metabolic panel… so many tests! It all sounds very daunting, Doctor. What exactly will these tests tell you? And… how long will it take to get the results? I really don’t want to worry my employer unnecessarily. I'm worried I won’t be able to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krahn. The complete blood count will help us evaluate your overall health and look for any signs of infection or anemia. The metabolic panel will assess your kidney and liver function, electrolyte balance, and blood sugar levels. These tests will help us to get a better understanding of what's going on, and rule out other potential causes of your symptoms. We can get those results back within 24 to 48 hours. I will have the lab technician draw your blood right away. We will review the results together, and I’ll explain everything in detail. I’ll also contact your employer if it's necessary, and only with your consent, of course. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. 24 to 48 hours… that feels like a very long time. But I understand. And yes, please contact my employer only with my consent. I don’t want to alarm them unnecessarily. And… thank you, Doctor. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate it. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results. I'm really quite anxious about all this. I'm worried it's something serious. I just want to be able to continue working, and to live a normal life. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s not too much to ask at all, Mr. Krahn. I understand your concerns, and I will do everything I can to get you answers as quickly as possible. I’ll personally review the results with you as soon as they become available. I will contact you by phone immediately. In the meantime, I recommend you get some rest and drink plenty of fluids. I will now have the lab technician come in to draw your blood. We'll also check your oxygen saturation level while you’re here. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. No, I don't think so. I'm just… very worried. I really hope it's nothing serious. Thank you again, Doctor. Please, just do what you need to do. And let me know as soon as you have the results, okay? That’s all I ask. I appreciate your help, Doctor. I really do. .
