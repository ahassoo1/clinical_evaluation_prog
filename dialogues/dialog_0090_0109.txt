DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Brum. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s… my head. Back of my head hurts. Been hurting for… oh, maybe three days now? Not all the time, but it comes and goes. Feels like… a weight, you know? Not a bad pain, just… there.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A weight, you say. Okay. And is anything making it better or worse?
PATIENT: Not much, really. Laying down helps a little. But not much else. I try to drink water, like my wife always said. Didn’t really help this time though. Working… well, working makes it a little worse, I think. All the shaking and bumping.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what kind of work do you do, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: I work with the trains. Used to be a lot more… now I mostly move them around the yard, you know? Dinkey operator. Hostler too. Moving cars, fixing little things. Been doing it… a long, long time. Almost my whole life.
DOCTOR: I see. And has anything like this ever happened before, this headache?
PATIENT: Not like this, no. I get little headaches sometimes, everyone does. But this… this is different. It’s in the back of my head, like I said. And it doesn't go away so easy. Not like a regular headache. It feels… deeper. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does, actually. Deeper is a good way to describe it. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: No, not really. I… I feel a little tired, maybe? But I'm ninety years old, Doctor! I’m supposed to be tired. Nothing else. No blurry vision, no dizziness, no… what do you call them… the funny little spots in front of your eyes? I don’t have any of that. Just the head. And the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Not much, Doctor. Old age, mostly! I had a bad flu when I was young, but that’s about it. My wife, she took care of everything. Doctors, pills… she knew it all. I just… did what she said. I don’t remember any big illnesses, no. And I don’t take any pills now. Haven't for a long time.
DOCTOR: And any surgeries, Mr. Brum?
PATIENT: No surgeries, no. Never needed any. My wife… she always said I was too stubborn to let anyone cut me open. A little stubborn, yes. That's true. I’ve broken a bone or two working with the trains, but they healed up alright. No cutting.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My family… well, my wife is gone now. Passed a few years back. She had a good, long life. We had three children, all grown up now. They all live far away. California, Texas… they visit when they can. They're good kids. They ask about the headache, of course. They worry. They said I should come see a doctor. And… well, here I am. No one else… not really. Just my children. And they’re all healthy, as far as I know.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I’m going to do a quick exam, if that's alright. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam. Just to get a better idea of what's going on. Can you sit up for me?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Sit up? Of course. Just take your time. Old bones don’t move so fast. And… don’t worry if I groan a little. It’s just… getting old.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. Blood pressure is a little elevated – 150 over 90. Not terribly high, but something we should keep an eye on. Now, let me listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, a bit of crackling in the lungs, could be age-related, or a little congestion. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and balance. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I can follow your finger. This is alright, isn't it? I… I hope it’s not bad. I feel a little… nervous now. It’s been a long time since anyone looked at me like this. Just tell me if it's something bad, please. My wife… she always knew what was wrong.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum, try to touch your nose with your finger. Now, close your eyes… good. And now, push against my hand. Strength seems a little diminished, but that's not unexpected at your age. Balance is slightly unsteady, but you are able to stand. Alright. Now, let's talk. It doesn't sound like anything immediately life-threatening, but we need to investigate this headache further. We’re going to get some blood work to rule out any underlying infection or inflammation, and I'd like to get a CT scan of your head, just to be safe. It'll give us a better look at what's going on in there. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A CT scan? What’s that? Does it hurt? I don’t like… being poked and prodded. And blood work… I hate needles. My wife… she always did the needles. I just… told her what was wrong. Is it expensive? I don’t have much money, Doctor. Just… my social security. It sounds… complicated. And scary.
DOCTOR: The CT scan is a quick imaging test, Mr. Brum. It doesn’t hurt. You’ll lie on a table and a machine takes pictures of your brain. It's painless, though you have to lie very still. As for the blood work, yes, there's a needle, but it's a small one, and it’s over quickly. We’ll see what your insurance – or lack thereof – covers. The hospital has financial assistance programs, and we can explore those options. We need to rule out anything serious, Mr. Brum, and this is the best way to do it. Now, do you understand that?
PATIENT: Insurance? I… I don’t have any. Not anymore. My wife… she had the insurance. After she passed… it was gone. And financial assistance…? I don’t know anything about that. I just… worked. Always worked. And my wife took care of everything. I don't understand… anything about this. It’s too much. Maybe… maybe it’s just an old man’s headache. Maybe it’ll go away on its own. I don't want to be poked and prodded… and I don’t have any money. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Brum. Look, I understand you’re concerned. But ignoring this could be a mistake. We’re going to order the blood work regardless. We can discuss payment options later. And the CT scan… we’ll see. If the blood work comes back normal, we might be able to manage this with pain medication. But I need to rule out other possibilities first. I'm going to write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever, and I’ll have the nurse schedule you for the blood work. We’ll go from there. Do you understand that, Mr. Brum?
