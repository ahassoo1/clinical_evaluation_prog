DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Steines. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just Venna is fine. Well, the blood pressure's been acting up again. My regular doctor back home… he’s retired now, and I’m visiting my daughter for the summer. She said I should get it checked out while I’m here. It just feels… tight, sometimes. Like a band around my head.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venna. It’s good of you to come in, and I’m happy your daughter encouraged you to seek care while visiting. “Tightness,” as you describe it, is a useful way to put it. Can you tell me a bit more about when this “tightness” occurs?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not always when I’m doing somethin’. Sometimes it's just… there. But I reckon it gets worse when I’m fussin’ around in the kitchen, bakin’. Or if I get to talkin’ real fast, get excited, you know? It don’t last long, usually. Just a few minutes, then it goes away. But it's been happenin' more lately.
DOCTOR: I understand. So it seems to be somewhat sporadic, but perhaps exacerbated by activity or excitement. And you’ve noticed it occurring with greater frequency recently. Do you happen to know what your blood pressure readings were with your previous doctor?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers… I never was good with numbers. He… he always wrote 'em down on a paper, and my daughter usually kept track of things. I think it was usually around… good gracious, I really don’t know. Not too high, he always said. That's why I was surprised when it started botherin’ me more. I apologize, Doctor. I wish I could be more help.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Venna. It’s common not to remember specific numbers, and it’s more important that you're describing how you feel. We can certainly get a reading here today. Before we do that, let’s just do a quick run-through of your overall health. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, such as diabetes or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, nothin’ like that. Just… old age, I reckon! I’ve always been pretty healthy, all my life. I used to walk everywhere, you know? Before my knees started complainin’. My daughter worries, of course. She's a nurse, so she always thinks somethin’s wrong. But I feel okay, mostly. Just this pressure thing lately.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Venna, and staying active for as long as you could is wonderful. It sounds like you’ve generally been in good health. And it’s very reassuring to have a daughter who cares so much. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! When I was a little girl, I fell out of a tree and broke my arm. Had to have a cast, but that was… oh, goodness, almost eighty years ago! Other than that… no, nothin’. Never been one for hospitals, if I could avoid it. And I've been lucky enough to avoid anything serious, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Venna. A childhood injury is quite a while ago! Now, are there any medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, stroke, diabetes, perhaps?
PATIENT: Well, my mama… she had a weak heart, I think. Didn’t take care of herself, always worryin’ about everybody else. She passed when she was pretty young, still in her sixties. My daddy… he lived a long life, but he had trouble with his sugar, towards the end. Maybe diabetes, I don’t rightly recall. It was a long time ago. And most of ‘em smoked, which I always thought was foolish.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venna. That gives me a good sense of your family history. Now, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little somethin’ for my arthritis, in my hands. Makes ‘em ache somethin’ fierce sometimes. It's… let me see… Naproxen, I think it’s called. I take one a day, when they’re botherin’ me real bad. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take a little chamomile tea. That's about it. Nothin’ fancy.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Venna. Naproxen and chamomile tea – good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anythin’. I eat just about anythin’ put in front of me, truth be told. I do get a little itchy sometimes when I’m around cats, but that's just a mild allergy. Nothin’ serious.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Venna. That’s very helpful. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Go right ahead, Doctor. I don’t mind at all. I reckon it's time to see what's goin' on with this pressure thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Venna. Your blood pressure is currently 162/94, your pulse is 78 and regular, and your breathing sounds clear. I’m hearing a slight murmur, which is not uncommon in individuals your age, but we will keep an eye on it. Your heart rate is within normal limits. It appears your blood pressure is elevated at this time. We should investigate this further.
PATIENT: Elevated, huh? I figured somethin’ was up. What does that mean, Doctor? Is it somethin’ serious? I just want to get back to bakin’, you know? My daughter's been wantin' a pecan pie…
DOCTOR: It’s understandable you’re concerned, Venna, and wanting to get back to baking is a perfectly reasonable goal! Elevated blood pressure, also known as hypertension, means your heart is working harder than it should to pump blood through your arteries. It’s not an immediate emergency, but consistently high blood pressure can, over time, increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems. We'll need to do some further evaluation to determine the cause and best course of action. I'd like to order some blood tests to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and cholesterol levels. We can also perform an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Tests… I don’t mind the tests, I suppose. If it'll help me get back to bakin’, then I’ll do ‘em. But… will they hurt? And how long will it take? I’m only here for the summer, you know. My daughter’s got plans for us.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Venna. The blood tests are very straightforward; a small sample of blood will be drawn from your arm. It will only take a few minutes, and there might be a slight pinch. As for the EKG, small stickers will be placed on your chest, arms, and legs to measure your heart’s electrical activity. It’s completely painless and takes just a few minutes as well. The results usually come back within a few days. We can discuss them then and create a plan that fits your summer schedule. We might need to consider lifestyle modifications, such as dietary changes or exercise, or perhaps medication if necessary. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. If it won't take too long, I suppose I can manage a few tests. I'm not keen on changin' my diet too much, though. I've been bakin' for ninety years, you know? It's kinda hard to stop now. And exercise… well, my knees aren’t what they used to be. But I’ll do what I have to, if it means I can keep bakin' those pecan pies.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Venna. We’ll certainly take your lifestyle and preferences into consideration. It’s not about drastic changes, but rather finding small, manageable steps that can improve your health. We can discuss dietary options that still allow you to enjoy your baking, and explore gentle exercises that are kind to your knees. Alright, let’s get those tests ordered. I'll have the nurse come in and draw the blood, and then we can schedule the EKG for later today or tomorrow, depending on your availability. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. The sooner we get this done, the better. I appreciate you bein' patient with an old woman like me. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I reckon I’ll just sit here and wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Venna. It’s my pleasure. I’ll just finish up my notes and then the nurse will be with you shortly. Please don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns while you wait.
