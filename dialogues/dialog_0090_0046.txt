DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. I'm Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Kur. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’ve been experiencing some… pressure in my bladder, and it’s become quite bothersome lately. It’s been happening for a few weeks now, I believe.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Pressure,” you say. Can you describe that pressure a little more specifically?
PATIENT: Certainly. It feels… full, even shortly after I’ve just been to the restroom. And it’s not painful, exactly, but… uncomfortable. Like I need to go, even when I don’t, if that makes sense? It’s just… persistently there, especially when I'm sitting for long periods.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a sense of fullness and urgency even after voiding. And it’s more noticeable when you're sitting. Have you noticed any changes in your urine – color, odor, or any difficulty starting or stopping the flow?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s a good way to put it – a sense of urgency. As for changes… I haven’t noticed anything different about the color or odor, thankfully. I have noticed it takes me a moment to actually start going sometimes, like it takes a little bit of… effort, I suppose. And sometimes it feels like it doesn’t completely empty, though I can’t be certain about that.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, some hesitancy starting, and a feeling of incomplete emptying… Have you had any fever, chills, or pain in your back or sides?
PATIENT: No, Dr. Kur, no fever, chills, or pain in my back or sides. I feel perfectly normal otherwise. It’s just this bladder issue that’s troubling me. I haven't felt unwell in any other way.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not. No pain or burning at all when I go to the restroom. It’s just… the pressure, and the slight difficulty starting sometimes. It’s not a sharp pain, just… noticeable discomfort.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you had any urinary tract infections in the past, to your knowledge?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. I believe I had one when I was quite young, perhaps in elementary school, but it’s been a very long time. I don’t recall having any since then, no. It was just a standard infection, easily treated with medication, as I remember it. I was very young, so my memory is a little hazy on the details.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Yes, I am, Dr. Kur. I’ve been married for eight years now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or anything else that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any chronic conditions. My health is generally very good. I do have Medicare, of course, and I see my primary care physician for regular check-ups, but she hasn't identified any significant health concerns. I don't take any medications on a regular basis, either.
DOCTOR: Good. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had some issues with his kidneys when he was older, but beyond that, I don’t believe there’s any significant family history of urinary problems or anything related. It’s mostly just the typical – some heart issues here and there, nothing specific to this kind of thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Dr. Kur. I don’t smoke. I occasionally enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a week, but I don’t drink regularly, and I certainly don’t drink to excess. And I do not use any recreational drugs whatsoever.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to rule out anything obvious. I’ll listen to your abdomen, and I’d like to do a quick neurological exam to check your reflexes, and then a pelvic exam. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that is perfectly acceptable, Dr. Kur. Please, proceed whenever you’re ready. I trust your professional judgement. I understand the necessity of a thorough examination. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do to prepare.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please lie down on the table with your knees bent. I’ll start by listening to your abdomen. Alright, everything sounds normal there. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Please keep your legs relaxed. Reflexes are normal as well. Now, I'm going to need you to change into a gown and we’ll proceed with the pelvic exam. I'll leave you to do so, and I'll be back in a few minutes. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Dr. Kur. I’ll change into the gown now. Please just let me know when you’re ready. I appreciate you explaining each step.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Creagh. Okay. The exam reveals some tenderness in the pelvic region, but no obvious masses or abnormalities. Your bladder feels slightly full even after voiding, as you described. I’m going to order a urine analysis and a urine culture to rule out any infection, and I'd like to check your post-void residual volume to see how much urine remains in your bladder after you urinate. We should get the results back in a few days.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Dr. Kur. I appreciate you being so thorough. A post-void residual volume check – that makes perfect sense. Will you be calling me with the results, or should I schedule a follow-up appointment? I’m happy to do either.
DOCTOR: I'll have the nurse call you with the results. If anything significant is found, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss it in more detail. If the results are normal, we can simply discuss them over the phone. For now, I suggest you increase your fluid intake and try to avoid bladder irritants like caffeine and alcohol. We'll take it from there. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: That sounds very reasonable, Dr. Kur. Increasing my fluid intake and avoiding irritants – I can certainly do that. And I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. No, I don’t believe I have any further questions at the moment. Thank you very much for your time and expertise. I feel much more at ease knowing we’re taking these steps.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, you're welcome, Ms. Creagh. The nurse will be in shortly to give you some discharge instructions and schedule a time to call you with the results. If anything changes before then – you develop a fever, severe pain, or notice blood in your urine – please contact the office immediately. Otherwise, we’ll talk soon. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. Kur. You as well. I will be sure to contact the office if anything changes, and I appreciate your care. Goodbye.
