DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re with us today for a consultation. Could you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’ve noticed a change in my body odor, and it’s… different. Not worse, exactly, just different. It started a few weeks ago, I think. I wanted to get it checked out, just in case.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s certainly wise to address any changes in your body, and there’s no need to feel embarrassed. We investigate these things routinely. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the change in odor a bit more specifically?
PATIENT: Hmm, that's a good question. It's hard to explain. It's not like the usual sweat smell, you know? It’s… almost a little bit sweet, maybe? And a little bit… musty? It’s not super strong, but I notice it, and that’s new. I always used to smell… just like regular sweat, if that makes sense. I've been using the same deodorant for years, too, so that hasn't changed.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful. A change in the character of the odor is important information. And the fact that your deodorant hasn’t changed is also noted. Now, has this change been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It's been pretty constant, actually. I haven't had a day where I didn't notice it. It doesn't get worse with activity, which is weird. Usually, if I'm working, I'll definitely smell more sweaty, but this is... always there, just a faint background smell. Even when I'm resting.
DOCTOR: I see. Constant, even at rest… that is somewhat unusual. Now, Ms. Purtee, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. This will help me get a broader picture. Have you noticed any other changes in your body recently?
PATIENT: Not really. Well… maybe I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but I figured that’s just from the work. Floor laying is hard on the body, you know? No rashes, no new moles, no weight loss or gain… just the tiredness and this smell. Oh, and maybe a little bit of night sweats, but not every night. It's been hot lately, so I just thought it was the weather.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information. The tiredness and occasional night sweats are worth noting. Now, let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that you are aware of, such as diabetes, kidney problems, or thyroid issues?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for years now. Other than that, just the usual aches and pains from work. I’m on Medicare, so they keep a pretty good track of everything, if you need to check. I've had the usual check-ups, nothing major ever flagged.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. And yes, I can certainly access your records through Medicare. Let me just pull up your history… Okay, I see your hypertension is well-controlled with lisinopril, as you mentioned. No other significant medical conditions listed. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Let's see… I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago. And I was in the hospital for a few days when I broke my wrist a few years back, but that was just for the break itself. Nothing major, really. No other surgeries or long hospital stays. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright. Gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, wrist fracture a few years back. Now, regarding your family history, are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as diabetes, cancer, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother had diabetes, type 2, and she had heart problems later in life. My father was healthy as a horse until he passed away in a car accident. And my brother has high cholesterol, but that's about it, really. No major cancers that I know of on either side of the family. Everyone else lived to a pretty good age, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Purtee. Now, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Sure. Well, I'm divorced, been on my own for about ten years now. I live in a small apartment in the city. I work pretty much full-time, laying floors. It keeps me busy. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink – maybe a glass of wine with dinner once or twice a month. I try to eat healthy, but it’s hard when you’re working a physical job and always on the go. No pets, no kids. Pretty simple life, really.
DOCTOR: Okay. No smoking, minimal alcohol, active job. And finally, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I can take most medications without any problems. I've had a few stitches over the years from work injuries, but no allergic reactions to any of the antibiotics or pain relievers. I've always been pretty lucky that way, too.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Purtee. Thank you for providing me with such a thorough history. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and temperature, and then I’ll want to take a closer look at your skin and perform a neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Sounds good, Doctor. I’m ready whenever you are. I hope you find something out. It’s just… unsettling, you know? To smell different after all these years.
DOCTOR: I understand. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this. Let's start with your vital signs. Could you please sit back and relax. Okay, your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. All within normal limits. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a few deep breaths for me… Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, let's take a look at your skin. Skin appears normal, no rashes or lesions noted. I don’t see anything outwardly concerning. Finally, I’m going to perform a brief neurological assessment. This will involve checking your reflexes and testing your sensation. It’s a routine part of the exam. Reflexes are normal and symmetrical. Sensation is intact. No neurological deficits detected. Everything appears normal on the physical exam so far.
PATIENT: That's good to hear, I guess. But if everything is normal, what is causing the smell? It's still there, you know. It hasn’t gone away just because you checked me over. I'm starting to worry it's something… weird.
DOCTOR: You are right to point that out, Ms. Purtee. A normal physical exam doesn’t necessarily rule everything out. It’s important to investigate further, especially since this is a new and concerning symptom for you. Given your history and the physical exam findings, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. One possibility, though less common, is trimethylaminuria, also known as "fish odor syndrome." This is a metabolic disorder where the body can’t properly break down certain compounds, leading to a distinctive odor. Another possibility is bromhidrosis, an excessive or abnormal body odor, which can sometimes be caused by underlying medical conditions or changes in diet. To investigate further, I'd like to order some blood tests. These tests will help us assess your kidney function, liver function, and glucose levels, as well as rule out any underlying metabolic disorders. I'll also order a urine analysis to check for any infections or abnormalities. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. Blood tests and a urine analysis… that seems reasonable. I’m a little worried about what they might find, but I guess it’s better to know, right? Can you explain how those tests will be done? And how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right - it's always better to know. The blood tests will be a standard venipuncture – a phlebotomist will draw a small sample of blood from a vein in your arm. It’s a relatively quick and painless procedure, though you might feel a slight pinch. The urine analysis will require you to provide a urine sample, which we can collect here in the clinic. We'll give you a sterile cup and instructions on how to collect a midstream sample. As for the results, it typically takes 24-48 hours for the lab to process the tests and send them back to us. Once I have the results, I’ll review them thoroughly and contact you to discuss them and formulate a plan. In the meantime, if you notice any other symptoms or if the odor becomes significantly worse, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds perfectly alright. Blood test and urine sample, I can do that. And I'll definitely let you know if anything changes. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking this seriously. It's just… it's a strange thing to have to deal with.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Purtee. I understand it's a strange and concerning symptom, and I assure you we'll do our best to get to the bottom of it. Let me have the nurse draw your blood and collect a urine sample. She'll provide you with detailed instructions.
