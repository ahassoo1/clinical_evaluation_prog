DOCTOR: Good morning, Emileigh. I’m Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi! It’s nice to meet you too, Dr. Annesley. Um… well, I just moved here, and I think I need to, like, get set up with a doctor? It's kinda what my husband told me to do. I have Medicare, I think… does that make sense? I don’t really remember everything.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Emileigh. Getting established with a primary care physician when you move is a very smart idea. And yes, Medicare is excellent. We take it here. So, even though you don’t have a specific ailment today, we can do a general check-up, review your medical history, and make sure everything is in order. Before we dive into that, can you tell me a little bit about why you decided to move here?
PATIENT: Um… my husband, Robert, got a job here. He’s… he works with computers, I think? Something like that. I just kinda followed him. It’s a bigger city than where we were, that’s for sure. I used to… well, I work with machines, fixing stuff. But I haven't started anything here yet. It’s all kinda new. Does that… answer your question? I'm not very good at explaining things.
DOCTOR: That answers it perfectly, Emileigh. No need to apologize, you’re doing great. It sounds like a big change, and it’s perfectly normal to feel a little unsettled. We’ll take things at your pace. Okay, let's start with a bit of your medical background. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you’re aware of – anything at all, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so? I mean, I get headaches sometimes, but everyone does, right? And… I think I had the flu once, a long time ago. Honestly, I don't really remember going to the doctor much before. I… I think my husband knows more about that stuff. He always handles the paperwork. Is there a list somewhere? Maybe I had a list… I’m really bad with remembering things.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Emileigh. It’s very common to not have everything memorized. We can definitely look through your records if you’d like. We have access to a lot of information electronically. Before we do that, let's just quickly cover some basics. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Not right now. I used to take something for… for my head, maybe? But I stopped a long time ago. It didn’t really do much anyway. I mostly just drink water. And… sometimes tea? I'm not sure if that counts. Robert gets me different kinds. I really don’t know much about pills and stuff. He takes a lot, though, for his… his back, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications. That’s good to know. And tea doesn’t count! Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else like pollen or animals?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I don’t think so? I mean, I get itchy sometimes when I’m outside, but I just figured that was bugs. Or the sun. Robert says I get a little red sometimes, but he doesn’t really say much more than that. I haven’t ever had a really bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. Does a little bit of sneezing count? I get that a lot in the spring.
DOCTOR: A little bit of sneezing doesn’t count as an allergy, Emileigh. That sounds like seasonal allergies, which are very common. So, no known severe allergies. That’s helpful. Now, to get a more complete picture, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if any of your close family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any significant medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or anything else?
PATIENT: Um… that’s… that’s hard. I didn’t really… I didn’t grow up with my family. Robert knows more about that stuff too, I think. My mom… I think she had something with her heart? But I don't remember. And my dad… I don't really know. He wasn’t around much. I'm sorry, I’m not very helpful, am I? I wish I could remember more. It's like… everything's a little fuzzy.
DOCTOR: You are doing just fine, Emileigh. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t remember everything. It's a lot to keep track of, and it's common for family medical history to be unclear. Don’t apologize. We can always try to obtain records if you’re comfortable with that later on. For now, let’s move on to something else. Do you have any past surgical history?
PATIENT: Past surgery… hmm. I don’t think so? I mean, I had my tonsils out when I was little, I think. But that was a long time ago. And… maybe my appendix? Robert said something about that once, but I’m not sure. It was a long time ago, and I was really young. I don't really remember being sick or anything, other than the tonsils. It's all very… vague. I feel bad making you ask so many questions.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. Tonsils and possibly appendix – we’ll note that down. It's good you mentioned those. Now, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! No, none of that. I don’t like any of that stuff. Robert… he drinks sometimes, but not a lot. Mostly just beer when he’s watching sports. I don't smoke, and I definitely don't do any of those other things. I try to eat healthy, mostly. I like vegetables. And… I walk sometimes, when the weather’s nice. I’m not very good at exercising, though. I get tired easily.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful, Emileigh. That’s great that you maintain a healthy lifestyle. Now, before we move on to a brief physical exam, I’d like to ask about your current weight. Do you happen to know approximately how much you weigh?
PATIENT: Oh… um. That’s… a little embarrassing. I haven’t weighed myself in a while. I think… I think around 180 pounds? Maybe a little more? It fluctuates. Robert has a scale, but I don’t really like looking at it. I’m… I'm a little bigger than I used to be. It's okay if you don't want to know.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Emileigh. There’s no judgment here at all. Knowing a general range is helpful for me, and 180 pounds is perfectly fine. We’ll get an accurate measurement in a moment during the exam. Now, to get a better overall picture, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. We'll just check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and take a quick look at your ears, nose, and throat. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay, yeah, that sounds… okay. As long as it’s quick. I don’t like being poked and prodded too much. And… I get a little nervous around doctors, I guess. Is it going to hurt? I’m… I'm a little scared.
DOCTOR: It will be very quick, Emileigh, and I’ll explain everything as I go. It won’t hurt. It’s just a routine check to get a baseline understanding of your health. We’ll start with your blood pressure. Just relax your arm for me, please. Okay, your blood pressure is 130 over 80. That’s slightly elevated, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Your heart rate is 72 and regular. Lungs are clear. Now, let me just take a quick look in your ears……Ears look clear. And finally, let’s take a look at your throat……Throat looks clear as well. No redness or swelling. Okay, that's all done. Quick and easy! Everything looks good so far.
PATIENT: Okay, good. That wasn’t as bad as I thought. So… is something wrong? My blood pressure being high, you said? Is it something serious? I get kinda worried easily. Robert always says I do.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to be concerned when you hear something like that, Emileigh. 130 over 80 is slightly elevated, but it's not necessarily cause for alarm right now. It could be due to a number of factors – stress, caffeine intake, even just the fact that you're at the doctor’s office! We’ll want to monitor it over time, and I'll recommend some lifestyle changes that can help bring it down naturally – things like regular exercise, a healthy diet, and stress reduction techniques. We can also recheck it in a few months to see if it’s improved. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Exercise and healthy diet… yeah, I can try that. Stress reduction… That’s harder. I worry a lot. But okay. So… no medicine right now? Just… try to be healthier? And come back in a few months? Is that it? What if it doesn’t get better? I don’t want to have to take pills. Robert hates taking pills.
DOCTOR: That’s right, Emileigh. For now, we’ll focus on lifestyle modifications. That’s often the most effective first step, and it’s a great way to improve your overall health. We’ll recheck your blood pressure in three months. If it doesn’t improve with lifestyle changes, then we can discuss other options, including medication. But let’s not worry about that right now. We’ll take things one step at a time. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s… everything. You were really nice, Dr. Annesley. It wasn’t as scary as I thought it would be. Thank you. Robert will be glad to hear everything went okay. He always worries about me too. Should I schedule the appointment for three months now?
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Emileigh. I’m glad I could put your mind at ease. It’s perfectly normal to be anxious about these things. Yes, let's go ahead and schedule that follow-up appointment for three months from today. That would be November 2nd. Does that work for you?
PATIENT: November 2nd sounds good. Okay, perfect. Thank you again, Dr. Annesley. I think… I think I’m all set. Should I fill out any more paperwork? Or just… wait until November?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Emileigh. No need to fill out any more paperwork at this time. Just remember the appointment date. And if anything changes or you have any concerns before then, please don’t hesitate to give us a call. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a wonderful day, Emileigh, and please take care. .
