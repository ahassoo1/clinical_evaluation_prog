DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Belan. I’m Dr. Alzoubi. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, nice to meet you too. Look, to be frank, my wife thought it was a good idea I get checked for… you know… the HIV thing. She worries too much, honestly. But here I am.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you're here, and it's smart of your wife to encourage you to get checked. Even if you feel perfectly healthy, routine screening is important. It sounds like you're concerned about HIV. To help me understand your situation better, can you tell me a little bit about why you and your wife are concerned?
PATIENT: Concerned is… a strong word. She just reads a lot of things online. About… everything. And she gets nervous easily. I haven't done anything, if that's what you're getting at. I've been married for ten years, Doctor. Ten years! She just saw some article, I bet, and now I'm here wasting my time. Honestly, it's a bit insulting she doesn't trust me.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Belan. It sounds like this is more about reassurance than a specific concern. It's completely reasonable to want to address your wife's anxieties, and getting tested can certainly provide peace of mind. To be thorough, even though you haven't engaged in risky behaviors, we still need to go through a few questions. It's standard procedure. Have you ever had a blood transfusion?
PATIENT: A blood transfusion? No, never. Not even as a kid. I mean, I cut myself a few times, playing football when I was younger, but nothing serious enough for a… transfusion. Are you suggesting I look like the type of person who needs blood transfusions? That's a bit rude, don’t you think? I eat well, I exercise. I’m perfectly healthy.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question came across that way, Mr. Belan. That wasn’t my intention at all. It’s a routine question to rule out any potential exposures, even those that happened long ago. It's just part of a comprehensive assessment. Okay. Have you ever shared needles with anyone, for any reason?
PATIENT: Needles? Doctor, really? What do you think I am? A… a drug user? I work in compliance. I make sure people follow the rules, not break them! This is getting ridiculous. I'm starting to feel like you're accusing me of something. My wife and I live a very… clean life. This is a waste of my time. Honestly.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Belan. I apologize again if my questions are upsetting you. It’s important to ask these questions to get a complete picture, and I’m not making any accusations. We need to rule out all possibilities, however unlikely they may seem. Let’s try a different approach. Have you ever had any sexually transmitted infections, or been tested for them before?
PATIENT: Look, I told you. Ten years of marriage. With the same person. Do I look like I’ve been running around? This is just… insulting. I came here to appease my wife, not to be interrogated like a criminal. I’ve never had anything, never been tested for anything. Happy now? Can we just get this over with? I have work to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Belan, I understand. It sounds like you're very confident in your health and your relationship, and that's good. I’m simply following protocol to ensure we cover all bases. To proceed, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Then we can order the HIV test. It’s a simple blood draw. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Get it over with. Just… please don't touch me unnecessarily. And don't make small talk. I really don't have the patience for it. Just tell me when it's done.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. We'll keep it brief and focused. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Blood pressure is 128 over 76. Normal. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Ears appear normal, throat is clear. No signs of infection. Overall, your physical exam is unremarkable. Now, we'll just need to draw some blood for the HIV test. It will be sent to the lab, and the results should be available in a few days.
PATIENT: Finally. Just get the blood draw over with. I don't like needles, you know. And make sure it doesn't leave a big bruise. My wife will have a field day if I show up with a mark on my arm. Honestly, the stress of this whole thing is probably worse than actually having something.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. I understand your anxiety about needles. I'll be as gentle as possible. This will just be a quick pinch. Try to relax your arm. Okay, all done. Just a little pressure here with this gauze pad. Keep this bandage on for about fifteen minutes. And if you notice any excessive bleeding or bruising, let us know. The lab will contact you directly with the results in 3-5 business days. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… get me out of here. I need to go home and de-stress. Honestly. This whole experience has been… thoroughly unpleasant. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Belan. You have my card if you need anything. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. Have a good day. .
