DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Schlatterer is the name, yes. Honestly? I haven’t the faintest idea why I’m here. My…secretary, I believe, scheduled this appointment. Something about…being overwhelmed? Honestly, these young people and their…buzzwords. I taught Library Science for forty years, forty years! And I know how a library works, not…this. Just get on with it, if you would. I have a perfectly good afternoon planned.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like this appointment may have been scheduled proactively. That’s alright; we can certainly do a general check-up to see how things are going. Sometimes it’s good to just make sure everything is functioning as it should, even without a specific complaint. To start, do you have any current symptoms you've been experiencing – anything at all that’s been bothering you, even if it seems minor?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Good heavens. I’m eighty-seven years old, Doctor. What isn't bothering me? My knees ache, my back creaks… it’s called age, young lady. I suspect I’m perfectly healthy for my age. Though I suppose my digestion isn't what it used to be. But that's hardly a matter for a doctor, is it? It's probably just the…modern food. Everything's so processed these days. Are we getting anywhere with this, or are we just going to list my ailments? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: You're right to point that out, Mr. Schlatterer. Listing ailments isn’t productive. And you are very articulate for your age—that’s wonderful! Let's focus. You mentioned your knees and back, and some digestive issues. Are your knees and back painful constantly, or is it more when you’re active?
PATIENT: Active? Doctor, I haven’t been “active” since…well, a very long time ago. It's more when I try to be. Trying to get out of a chair, for instance. Or gardening, though I barely do any of that anymore. The young man next door, he takes care of the yard. A very thoughtful boy. But yes, any movement really. A dull ache, mostly. Nothing…crippling. Just… inconvenient. And it's always there, simmering in the background, you understand? A constant reminder of… decline. Now, are we finished? Perhaps a referral to a…physical therapist? Though I highly doubt they can do much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a better picture. Constant with activity – that's helpful. And a physical therapist could be an option; we’ll consider that. Let's just quickly go through a few other areas. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently, either gain or loss?
PATIENT: Changes in weight? Honestly, Doctor, I stopped paying attention to such trivialities decades ago. I eat when I'm hungry, and not much more. I suspect I've lost some weight, naturally. The older one gets, everything… shrinks, you understand? One loses one's appetite, one loses muscle mass… it's a natural process. And frankly, it’s rather impolite to ask a gentleman his weight! Is this standard practice? I expect more from a… medical professional.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to call me out on that, Mr. Schlatterer. That was impolite of me, and I apologize. It’s not standard practice, and I got off track with the general check-up questions. Let’s shift gears. Do you have any problems with your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep? No, I sleep plenty. Too much, perhaps. One has little else to do, you understand. Though it's not the restful sleep of my youth. I wake frequently, needing to…adjust things. And I’m an early riser. Always have been. A habit ingrained over decades of…responsibility. I suspect it's a blessing, truthfully. One gets more done when one starts early. Are we nearing the end of this…interrogation?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a bit fragmented sleep, waking frequently. That’s not uncommon. Let's talk about your diet. You mentioned eating when hungry – do you have any particular dietary restrictions or things you avoid?
PATIENT: Restrictions? Good heavens, no. I eat what I like. Though, as I said, everything tastes…blander these days. It's the modern food, Doctor. They remove all the flavor! And the texture...it's all soft and…yielding. I used to enjoy a good pickled herring, or a hearty sausage. But those are hardly available anymore. It's all…lean meats and…vegetables. And everything's so processed! I suppose I avoid things that…disagree with me. But that's hardly a restriction. It's just…common sense. Really, Doctor, I suspect I’m perfectly healthy. This whole exercise seems rather…pointless. Are we quite finished now?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Primarily, you’re experiencing some aches and pains with movement, disrupted sleep, and some dissatisfaction with the taste of food. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline, and then we can discuss some potential next steps. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A physical exam? At my age? Honestly. Very well. But make it quick, if you please. I have a book waiting for me. A first edition, you understand. One can’t simply leave such treasures unattended. Though, I assure you, you won’t find anything. Perfectly healthy for my age, as I said. Let’s get this over with. And please, try not to poke too much. My skin is rather…delicate.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. I will be as gentle as possible. Take a deep breath in…and out. Another deep breath…good. Your heart rate is a little slow, but regular. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Pulse is a bit weak, but present. Blood pressure is 130/80. A little elevated, but not concerning for your age. Some slight swelling in the ankles. And your reflexes are a little diminished, which is also common with age. Finally, some mild stiffness and limited range of motion in the knees. And that confirms what you mentioned about the aches and pains.
PATIENT: Well, there you have it. Precisely as I suspected. A bit of stiffness, a bit of swelling… the inevitable decline. Really, Doctor, this whole exercise has been a confirmation of what I already knew. I assure you, I am perfectly aware of my physical state. A waste of a perfectly good afternoon, if I may be frank. Now, may I inquire as to what your…recommendations are? Though I highly doubt they will be of any consequence. Perhaps a warm bath and a good book? That’s usually the best medicine, you know. .
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer. And you are very insightful about your own health. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, there isn’t anything acutely concerning. We’ve identified some mild joint stiffness, a bit of swelling, some disrupted sleep, and slightly elevated blood pressure. My recommendations are, first, to focus on gentle, low-impact exercise, if you’re able. Walking is excellent. And to continue to eat a balanced diet, even if the flavors aren’t quite what they used to be. For the sleep, establishing a regular bedtime routine may help. And regarding the blood pressure, we can monitor it at home. I can provide you with a blood pressure cuff and a log to keep track of your readings. I also want to order some basic blood work to rule out any underlying causes for the stiffness and to assess your overall health. Finally, you mentioned that you dislike a warm bath; would you be open to physical therapy, to manage some of the stiffness and pain?
