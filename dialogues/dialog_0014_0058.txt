DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Osumi, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Osterholm. Well, to be frank, it’s my weight. I've been…carrying a bit extra these last few years. My wife, bless her soul, always kept me on track, but since she passed…it’s been harder. I was hoping you might have something to help me get it under control. Something…a medication, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Hmm. Weight gain…after a loss, it’s…common. Honestly, most people don’t realize how much emotional eating contributes. But, yes, we can explore medication. Before we jump to that, though, I need to get a better understanding of how much weight we’re talking about, and for how long. Do you have any idea how much weight you’ve gained since your wife passed?
PATIENT: That’s a good question…a very good question. I haven’t really…weighed myself regularly, if I’m being honest. It's…difficult to think about, you know? But I’d say…oh, maybe 20, 25 pounds? Perhaps more. It's been about three years now since she passed, and it's steadily increased. I just…I used to be quite active, and now…not so much.
DOCTOR: Right. Twenty-five pounds over three years…okay. And besides the weight gain, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm…not really symptoms, no. Just…tired, I suppose. More tired than usual. And my knees bother me a bit, especially when I try to walk any distance. But I chalked that up to just…getting older, you know? I used to enjoy gardening, but it's becoming more difficult. I don't sleep as well either, but that could be anything, really.
DOCTOR: Tiredness, knee pain, trouble sleeping…all very common at your age, Mr. Osumi. Let's not jump to conclusions. Before we even consider medication, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs…the usual. And we’ll weigh you, of course. Just routine. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Routine is good. No allergies that I know of, Doctor. I haven’t taken much in the way of medication in years, truthfully. Just…a bit of something for the occasional cold, that's all. Let’s get this done, shall we? I have some wood waiting to be carved, you see. I like to keep busy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with your blood pressure. Roll up your sleeve, please. …140 over 88. Not ideal, but not terrible. …Heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear. Now, let's check your knees…any pain with this?
PATIENT: A little…yes, a little pain when you bend it like that. It’s more of an ache, really. Not sharp. It's been…gradual, as I said. It doesn't bother me too much unless I’m on my feet for a long time, or trying to get up from a chair. Is that…bad, Doctor? I just want to be able to get back to my carving. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Some crepitus and mild tenderness to palpation. Not a significant finding, frankly. Probably just age-related wear and tear. So, weight gain, tiredness, knee pain…Honestly, Mr. Osumi, it sounds like you're experiencing a lot of normal changes associated with getting older. We can discuss diet and exercise, of course. Have you considered increasing your activity level?
PATIENT: I have considered it, Doctor. Believe me, I have. But it’s hard. My wife and I used to walk every morning, rain or shine. But…without her, it’s just…not the same. It feels…pointless, somehow. I understand the value of diet and exercise, of course, but I was hoping for something…more. Something to give me a little boost, you know? Something to make it a little easier. That’s why I asked about medication. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: Look, Mr. Osumi, I understand you’re grieving. But relying on a pill to fix emotional issues…it’s not a healthy approach. Honestly, I think you'd benefit from talking to someone. A therapist, perhaps?
PATIENT: A therapist? With all due respect, Doctor, I’m not sure that’s what I need. I’m not…unstable, if that's what you’re implying. I just…want to lose a little weight, so I can feel better about myself and get back to my hobbies. I’ve lived a good life, and I’m not about to start analyzing my feelings now. Is there anything you can prescribe to help me with the weight, or is that simply not possible? I just want to make things a little easier for myself. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Fine. We can discuss medication, but I want to be clear: I don’t believe it’s the solution, and I strongly recommend considering other options. Let’s start with some bloodwork, just to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the weight gain, like thyroid issues. And we'll check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels while we're at it. I’ll write you a requisition form. I'll also need a urine sample. And I want you to schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds…acceptable, Doctor. Bloodwork, urine sample, follow-up appointment. I can do all of that. Thank you. Perhaps…perhaps with a little help, I can get back to my carving sooner. Just…thank you.
