DOCTOR: Good morning, Chanz. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It’s good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. Look, to be honest, I barely remember what I told the receptionist. Something about not sleeping well and… feeling a bit rubbish? It's all a bit foggy, to be frank. I mostly just want to feel… less tired, I suppose. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Chanz. It’s common to feel a bit overwhelmed when you're not feeling your best. “Feeling rubbish” and trouble sleeping are good places to start. Let’s try to clarify things a bit. When did you first start noticing the trouble sleeping?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? Ages ago. Months, definitely. Maybe even longer. It comes and goes, you know? Some weeks I’m fine, others I’m staring at the ceiling till all hours. It's… inconvenient, mostly. I used to be able to just drop when I needed to. Now it’s a whole thing. It's not like I'm tossing and turning all night, just… not proper, solid sleep. Does that make sense? I don’t really keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Intermittent sleep disturbance can be really frustrating. It sounds like it's been going on for quite some time. And when you are sleeping, would you say you wake up feeling rested?
PATIENT: Rested? Ha! No. Absolutely not. I wake up… aware. Like I've just… existed for eight hours, not recharged. It’s a subtle difference, maybe, but it’s exhausting. I feel… drained. Like an old battery. And then I need coffee. Lots of coffee. Which probably doesn’t help, now I think about it. Honestly, I don’t know what helps anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, so not feeling rested even after a full night’s sleep, and relying on a lot of coffee to get through the day. That gives us a clearer picture. Aside from the sleep issues and fatigue, have you noticed any other changes recently?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm. Let me think… I’ve been a bit… short-tempered, maybe? My wife… well, was very patient. She used to deal with my moods. Now… it’s just me. So, yeah, I suppose I’m a bit grumpier than usual. And I haven’t had the energy to really… do much. Not that there’s much to do, really. Just fixing instruments all day. It's not exactly a high-energy job. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I mean – any changes in your mood or energy levels are important. It sounds like you've noticed some increased irritability and a general lack of motivation. Now, let’s go over some other things to get a broader understanding. Have you experienced any weight changes recently, either weight loss or gain?
PATIENT: Weight? Ugh, don’t even ask. I’ve lost a bit, I think. The clothes feel looser. Not like I’m trying to, just… less appetite, maybe? Everything feels like a chore, even eating. I haven’t actually weighed myself in ages, to be honest. Numbers aren’t really my thing. My wife used to keep track of all that, but… well. It's probably not much, just noticed things don't fit as well.
DOCTOR: Okay, some unintentional weight loss, along with a decreased appetite. That's helpful to know. Now, have you been experiencing any physical symptoms like headaches, muscle aches, or changes in your digestion?
PATIENT: Headaches… sometimes. Dull ones, mostly. Not debilitating, just… annoying. And my back’s been a bit stiff lately, but that’s probably from bending over instruments all day. Digestion… no, nothing much different there. Everything's… regular, if you want to know. Sorry, a bit too much information, probably. I just… don't really pay attention to these things. My wife used to… you get the picture.
DOCTOR: No, it’s alright, Chanz. It’s important for me to get a complete picture of what’s going on. It sounds like you're experiencing some mild headaches and back stiffness, but nothing major in terms of digestion. Let’s shift gears a bit. Have you noticed any changes in your mood beyond irritability?
PATIENT: Changes… Hmm. I suppose I'm not… enjoying things as much. Used to get a lot of satisfaction from restoring an old violin, you know? Now it just feels… like work. A tedious task. I don't really feel much, to be honest. Not happy, not sad, just… empty. It's a bit depressing, when I think about it. Which I try not to do. Honestly, it’s easier to just focus on the instruments.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a loss of interest or pleasure in activities you used to enjoy, and a feeling of emptiness. That's important information. Now, I'm going to ask a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or depression?
PATIENT: Depression… Well, my wife always said I was a bit gloomy, but never anything official. No, nothing diagnosed. High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor mentioned something a while back, but I wasn’t really listening. I take a couple of pills… small white ones. Honestly, I can’t remember what they're for. My wife handled all the medications. She was very organized. I just… took what she gave me. I haven't changed anything since… well, you know. I don't even know what they are for. It's all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a possible history of high blood pressure, and you're currently taking some unidentified pills. We'll need to figure out what those pills are. Now, let's talk about your allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My wife was the fussy eater, always checking labels and avoiding certain ingredients. Honestly, I just ate whatever she put in front of me. I didn’t bother with all that… reading and checking. I'm a simple man, really. No allergies, no sensitivities… just… nothing. I don't really pay attention to that sort of thing. Is that good enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s good to know. No known allergies. Now, let's move onto your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? Good heavens, no. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Alcohol… I used to enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. But not much since… well, since my wife passed. It just doesn’t seem… right. And no, definitely no drugs. I'm a musician, not a… a… I don't really get involved in all that. Just quiet evenings and… fixing instruments. That’s about it. Simple, as always.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you previously drank alcohol occasionally, but have stopped since your wife passed, and don't use any recreational drugs. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, is there anything else you think might be relevant, anything at all, that you haven't mentioned yet?
PATIENT: Well… I haven’t been sleeping properly since… since she died, really. It's not just the last few months. It's been over a year now. It comes and goes, like waves. Some nights I’m okay, others… others I just lie there, staring at the ceiling. And the tiredness… it's not just physical. It’s… everything. It’s like… a weight. A constant weight. I just thought it would get better, you know? But it hasn't. I just… miss her. Maybe it's just grief. Is that it? Maybe I just need to… get over it. But I don't know how. I really don't.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Chanz. That's very important information, and it helps me understand what you're going through. It's completely understandable that you’re still struggling with grief after a year. It’s not something you simply "get over," and it can absolutely manifest in physical symptoms like fatigue and sleep disturbance. It sounds like there's a lot going on, and it's good you came in to talk about it. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline and rule out any other potential causes for your symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… get it over with, I suppose. I just want to feel… normal again. If that's even possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 135/85, pulse is 78 and regular, respiration is 16 and unlabored, and your temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation, no wheezes or crackles. Now, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ and equal bilaterally. Finally, I’m going to briefly examine your throat and ears. Throat is clear, ears are normal. Okay, physical exam is complete. Overall, your physical findings are relatively normal, but we'll need some bloodwork to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Bloodwork? What are you looking for, exactly? And what does all that… “normal” mean? Is it just… in my head, then? All this tiredness and stuff? I just… don’t want to be poked and prodded for no reason. I'm already tired enough. What will the bloodwork tell you that you don't already know?
DOCTOR: That’s a very fair question, Chanz. The bloodwork is to rule out a few things. We want to check your thyroid function – an underactive thyroid can cause fatigue and weight gain. We'll also check your vitamin D levels – a deficiency can also cause tiredness. And we’ll do a complete blood count to make sure there’s nothing else going on, like anemia. It's not about assuming it’s "just in your head." It's about being thorough and ruling out any underlying medical causes for your symptoms. And even if the bloodwork comes back normal, that doesn’t invalidate how you’re feeling. It just means we need to look at other possibilities, like grief, as you mentioned, and potentially explore other treatments. Do you have any allergies to blood draws?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had a problem with needles. My wife used to get regular blood tests… I just tagged along. I don’t mind the poke, really. It's just… the waiting. Waiting for the results, waiting to feel better… that’s the hard part. Fine. Do it, then. Get it over with. But please, don’t take too much. I'm feeling faint enough as it is.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll make sure the phlebotomist takes only the necessary amount. We’ll get the results back within a few business days, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, I’m going to give you a referral to a therapist who specializes in grief counseling. It’s okay to ask for help, and talking to a professional can be incredibly beneficial. Would you like me to provide you with their contact information?
PATIENT: Therapist? Look, I appreciate the thought, but… I'm not really a “talking” person, you know? Always kept things bottled up. My wife… she was the one who did all the talking. I just… fix things. Instruments, mostly. Talking about feelings… it doesn't come naturally. I’d rather just… wait for the blood results, see what they say. Maybe it's just a simple fix. Maybe I just need some vitamins or something. I don’t want to… dwell on things. Is that okay? I'll pass on the therapist, thank you.
DOCTOR: Of course. That’s perfectly alright. You don't have to do anything you're not comfortable with. We can definitely start with the bloodwork and see what those results tell us. Now, I’m going to write you a prescription for a multivitamin with Vitamin D. It won’t necessarily fix everything, but it’s a good starting point to address any potential deficiencies. I also recommend focusing on getting regular sleep – even if it’s just getting into a consistent bedtime routine. And try to eat regular meals, even if you don’t feel hungry. Do you have any questions about the prescription or any of the recommendations I’ve made?
PATIENT: Consistent bedtime… Easier said than done. I've barely been sleeping properly for over a year. But… fine. I'll try. What kind of vitamins are they? I don’t want anything… fancy. Just the basic stuff, I suppose. And where do I pick up the prescription? Is it far? Honestly, just getting out of the house feels like a chore these days.
DOCTOR: They’re just a standard multivitamin with added Vitamin D – nothing fancy at all. They’re available at most pharmacies – [Pharmacy Name] is just down the road on Main Street, about a five-minute drive. I can also send the prescription electronically to your preferred pharmacy if you’d like. Now, I’m going to give you a summary sheet with all of our discussion points, the vitamin prescription details, and the phlebotomy information. It also has some resources for grief support, should you change your mind about the therapist. Do you have any other questions for me today, Chanz?
PATIENT: No. I think… I think that’s everything. Just… thank you. For listening, at least. I'll see what the blood results say. And… I’ll try to get some sleep. If I can.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Chanz. I’m glad I could help, and I’m here for you if you need anything else. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Take care of yourself, and I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, Chanz.
