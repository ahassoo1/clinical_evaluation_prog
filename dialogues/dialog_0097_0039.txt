DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bohnett. Welcome. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Georgiou. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good mornin’ to you too, Doctor Georgiou. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, I got a letter... a notice, really. Said my cholesterol was a bit high. Thought I ought to get it checked out proper. Don’t much bother doctors usually, but figured better safe than sorry, you know?
DOCTOR: That's very sensible of you, Mr. Bohnett. It’s always good to be proactive about your health, and you’re right, better safe than sorry. A letter from whom, if you recall?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think a moment. It was… the lab down at the hospital, I believe. They did some blood work a few weeks back, routine stuff with the yearly check-up. The doctor I usually see just sent me the results with a note sayin' to follow up. Didn't say much beyond that, just "high cholesterol." Never had that before, so a bit worried, to be honest. I'm usually a pretty healthy fella, always been.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. So, the routine blood work flagged the cholesterol, and your regular doctor recommended a follow-up. That's a good starting point. Do you happen to know which type of cholesterol was high, or what the numbers were?
PATIENT: Numbers… no, not a bit. I just skimmed the letter, to be truthful. All those numbers just blur together after a while. Something about LDL being too high, I think? And HDL being… not high enough? Honestly, Doctor, I don't rightly recall. I’m more of a “does it feel bad?” kinda man, and it doesn’t! But my daughter, bless her heart, she was the one who told me I needed to see someone. She gets worried easily.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Bohnett. Don't worry about the numbers – we can certainly look those up in your records from the lab. It’s good you have a daughter looking out for you. So, you're feeling well overall, no chest pain, shortness of breath, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No, not a thing. Feel as spry as a young lad, most days! I still do a bit of gardenin’, keep myself busy. No pain at all, and I can walk a good mile without gettin' winded. I eat… well, I eat pretty much whatever I want, I suppose. Always have. My wife, God rest her soul, she always said I had a cast iron stomach. Mostly Swedish food, you know. Lots of potatoes, some fish, not too much red meat these days. And a little sweet treat after dinner now and then. Don't smoke, never have. Drink a beer with supper sometimes, but nothin' excessive.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Bohnett. A healthy lifestyle overall sounds like you've been doing things right. Let's take a look at those lab results then, and we can get a better idea of what's going on. Alright, it looks like your LDL cholesterol is a bit elevated, at 165. Ideally, we want that below 100. Your HDL is 42, and we’d like to see that above 60 if possible. Your total cholesterol is 240. Do these numbers mean anything to you, or should I explain them a bit more?
PATIENT: Well, those numbers… no, they don't mean a darn thing to me. You can explain 'em, please. I always get lost in all that medical jargon. What does "elevated" even mean? Is it bad? Should I be scared? My daughter's gonna want to know all this, you see. She's a worrier, like I said. And I don't want to upset her unnecessarily if it's not somethin' too serious.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Bohnett. No need to be scared, and I'll explain everything in plain English. Think of cholesterol like wax in your blood. There are different kinds. LDL is often called “bad” cholesterol because it can build up in your arteries and make them narrow – like a clog in a pipe. That can lead to heart problems down the road. HDL is “good” cholesterol because it helps remove the LDL from your arteries. Your LDL is a little higher than we’d like, which means there’s a bit more wax building up than ideal. Your HDL is a little on the low side, so it’s not removing enough of the wax. Your total cholesterol is a combination of both, and that's a bit elevated as well. It's not an emergency, but it is something we need to address to help prevent problems in the future. Does that make sense so far?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes a good deal of sense, actually. Like a clog in a pipe… I can picture that. So, too much "bad" wax, and not enough "good" wax. And that's why my daughter was worried, I suppose. What do we do about it? Do I need to take pills? I don't much care for takin' pills if I can avoid it. Are there things I can eat, or… somethin' else I can do? I'm not afraid of a little effort, if it helps. Just don’t want to change my whole life, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Bohnett. It's good you're willing to make some effort, and often we can make a lot of progress without immediately jumping to medication. The first line of defense is usually lifestyle changes. That means diet and exercise. We’d want to focus on reducing saturated and trans fats in your diet – those are found in things like fatty meats, fried foods, and some processed snacks. Increasing fiber intake can help too – things like oatmeal, fruits, and vegetables. And regular exercise is fantastic – even a brisk walk for 30 minutes most days of the week can make a big difference. Before we talk about medication, let’s see how you do with these changes. I’d like to get a more detailed picture of your typical diet. Could you tell me what a typical day of eating looks like for you?
PATIENT: Well… let me think. Breakfast is usually just coffee, and maybe a piece of toast with a little butter and jam. Nothing fancy. Lunch is often a sandwich - ham and cheese, usually. Sometimes I'll have a pickle with it. Supper… that depends. If I'm feeling energetic, I'll make some fish - cod, maybe, with potatoes and a vegetable. Sometimes it's just leftovers from the night before. And after supper… well, my daughter brings me a little somethin' sweet. A cookie, or a piece of pie, now and then. She worries about me gettin' too thin, you see. I do enjoy a beer with supper, most nights. It helps me relax. And I do love my coffee! I drink a good pot of it throughout the day. I’m not much of a snacker, to be honest. I eat when I’m hungry, and not much in between. Is that helpful? I’m tryin’ to remember everything…
DOCTOR: That is very helpful, Mr. Bohnett. Thank you. Okay, so some areas we could focus on are reducing the ham and cheese sandwich – those can be high in saturated fat and sodium. We can explore some healthier sandwich options, like turkey or lean roast beef on whole-wheat bread. Also, cutting back on the sweets a little bit would be beneficial. The coffee is fine in moderation. And the beer… we can discuss that in a bit more detail – a single beer isn’t necessarily a problem, but we want to be mindful of overall calorie intake. Before we dive deeper into diet, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just to check your heart and lungs, and get a general sense of your health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine with me. I don't mind a bit of checkin' up. My heart feels strong enough, always has. But I don’t argue with a good doctor. Do what you need to do, Doctor. I’ll just sit here and try to relax. It’s a bit warm in here, isn’t it? But that's alright. I'm used to the heat. Used to work outdoors for years, you see. Building houses, mostly. Good honest work. But my bones aren’t what they used to be, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear you've been active, Mr. Bohnett. It sounds like you’ve led a full life. And yes, it is a bit warm in here, I'll make a note to adjust the thermostat. Alright, let's start with your blood pressure. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 140/90. We'll keep an eye on that. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Pulses are good in all extremities. No swelling in your feet. Overall, everything sounds good. Just a little elevated blood pressure, which is common with age and can often be managed with lifestyle changes. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Everything sounds alright, then. Just a bit high blood pressure. I’ve always been a bit nervous at the doctor, maybe that's why it's high. And like you said, I'm gettin' on in years, so I suppose somethin's gotta give, eventually. So, what’s the plan? Do I need to start eatin' rabbit food and runnin' marathons? I'm hopin' for somethin' a little less drastic. And do I need to worry about pills, or can we try fixin' things with just a bit of effort? I’m tryin’ to be optimistic, Doctor. And I want to make my daughter happy, you see. She worries so much.
DOCTOR: Absolutely no rabbit food or marathons, Mr. Bohnett! We’ll start with small, manageable changes. Let’s focus on three things to begin with: 1. Diet: Try to swap the ham and cheese sandwich for turkey or lean roast beef on whole-wheat bread a few times a week. Also, let's try to reduce the sweets – maybe have one small treat every other day instead of every day. 2. Exercise: Aim for a 30-minute walk most days of the week. You don’t have to run, just a brisk walk will do. 3. Hydration: Drink plenty of water throughout the day. Let’s try that for a month and then recheck your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. If those numbers improve, great! If not, then we can discuss medication options. But let’s see if we can make progress with lifestyle changes first. Does that sound like a plan you can live with?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. I can manage that, I think. Turkey sandwiches and walkin’… I can definitely do that. And I’ll try to drink more water. I always forget to do that. And no sweets every day… that might be the hardest part, but I’ll give it a go. For my daughter, you see. She'd be pleased. So, no pills for now? Just try these changes and come back in a month? That sounds good. And you'll check my blood pressure then? Is there anything else I need to know? Or anything I need to be lookin' out for? I don't want to worry my daughter unnecessarily, you see. She's a bit of a hypochondriac, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Bohnett. That’s exactly the attitude we want. No pills for now – just focus on these lifestyle changes. And yes, we’ll recheck your blood pressure and cholesterol levels in one month. As for anything to look out for, the most important thing is to pay attention to your body. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or severe headaches, please call 911 immediately. Those are signs that something could be seriously wrong. Otherwise, just focus on making these small changes and enjoy your life. I’ll give you a handout with some tips on healthy eating and exercise. And I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for one month from today. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. A handout would be good, I tend to forget things, you see. And an appointment is good, keeps me on track. And I appreciate you not pushin' pills right away. I’m always a bit wary of them. Just tryin’ to live a good life, Doctor. And keep my daughter happy. Thank you for your time, and for explainin’ everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease, a good deal, actually. I’ll get started on those changes right away. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Bohnett. It was a pleasure meeting you. Remember, small changes can make a big difference. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and have a good day!
