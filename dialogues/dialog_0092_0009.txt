DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Alcorta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Giganti. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to meet you as well. Though, I must say, this suburban location is…rather underwhelming. But never mind that. I’m here because, quite frankly, my vision isn’t what it used to be. It’s becoming…difficult to see things clearly. It’s a nuisance, really. A man in my position expects certain standards, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand, Mr. Alcorta. It’s certainly frustrating when your vision starts to change. We’ll do our best to figure out what’s going on. To get a better understanding, could you describe how your vision is changing?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not as though there’s a dramatic shift, Doctor. It’s…subtle. Things aren’t blurry, precisely. It’s more like…a dimming, perhaps? And sometimes, when I’m reading – important documents, naturally – the letters seem to…waver. It’s quite distracting. I find myself having to hold the paper closer, and even then…it's not ideal. I assure you, I’ve always had excellent eyesight. My grandfather, a full-blooded Cherokee, had the keenest eyes you’ve ever seen. It’s likely just a temporary…lapses.
DOCTOR: I see. A gradual dimming and some wavering with reading, and it's more noticeable when focusing on close-up tasks. And you've noticed it’s impacting your ability to read comfortably. Do you experience this difficulty with distance vision as well, or is it primarily when you’re reading or doing close work?
PATIENT: Mostly close work, Doctor. Distances seem…adequate. Though, I haven't been doing much outdoor work lately, if you catch my drift. A gentleman of my standing doesn’t spend his days traipsing through fields. But driving, for instance, hasn't been an issue. I wouldn't be caught dead relying on spectacles, you understand. It's simply…unbecoming. I suppose that answers your question. Is this going to take long? I have a rather important call this afternoon.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about spectacles, Mr. Alcorta. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me if this change in vision has been sudden, or has it been developing gradually over a period of time?
PATIENT: Gradually, Doctor. Very gradually. It wasn’t as though I woke up one morning and couldn't see. It’s been…a slow decline, really. Over the past…oh, I’d say six months, perhaps? It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly. I don't typically concern myself with such… minutiae. I simply noticed it becoming more troublesome recently. It's interfering with my work, naturally. And a man must be able to rely on his senses, wouldn't you agree?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Alcorta. Reliable senses are crucial. Six months of gradual change… that’s helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this vision change?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me consider. No…not really. No flashes of light, no floaters, no pain. I haven’t experienced any…discomfort, per se. Though, I have been feeling rather fatigued lately. But that’s likely due to the…stresses of my position. A lot of responsibility, you understand. It’s not something easily borne. And truthfully, my sleep hasn’t been the best. But I wouldn't attribute that to my vision. It’s simply…life.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and some difficulty with sleep, alright. We'll keep those in mind. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Diabetes? Good heavens, no. A man of my constitution? Preposterous. High blood pressure… I’ve had a slight elevation from time to time, but nothing requiring medication. I prefer natural remedies, you see. And heart disease? Absolutely not. I maintain a…reasonable lifestyle. Though, the aforementioned stresses do take their toll, naturally. I’ve seen a physician, occasionally, for routine checkups. But nothing…serious. I suppose I'm generally a very healthy individual. A bit run down lately, perhaps, but certainly not ailing. My ex-wife, however, always insisted I was one step away from a collapse. A rather dramatic woman.
DOCTOR: I understand. No major medical conditions reported. And you've had occasional check-ups with no significant findings. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Absolutely not. And hospitalization? Only for a minor…incident involving a rather unfortunate slip on some ice a few years back. Nothing serious. A fractured wrist, if I recall correctly. But it healed perfectly. I assure you, I’m not prone to…illness or injury. I maintain a certain…dignity, you see. A gentleman doesn't find himself in hospitals. It's simply not done. And frankly, the thought of germs… it's rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries or hospitalizations other than the wrist fracture. Now, thinking about your family history, are there any eye conditions that run in your family, like glaucoma, macular degeneration, or cataracts?
PATIENT: That’s…a difficult question, Doctor. My family…isn’t exactly forthcoming with such details. My mother was rather…private. And my father…well, he wasn't around much. I know my grandmother, on my mother’s side, wore spectacles towards the end of her life, but that was…quite some time ago. And frankly, I never paid much attention to such things. My Cherokee ancestors, however, were known for their excellent vision. Hunters, trackers… they relied on their eyesight above all else. I suspect my…genes are rather strong in that regard. It’s likely just a temporary…lapses, as I said before. This is all rather tedious, isn't it? Are we getting anywhere?
DOCTOR: I understand your family history is a bit unclear, Mr. Alcorta. It’s helpful to know what you do recall, though. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? Very few, Doctor. I prefer to avoid them whenever possible. I take a multivitamin, naturally. And occasionally, an aspirin for a…headache. But that’s about it. I tried a sleep aid a few months back, but it left me feeling…foggy. Utterly dreadful. I find a glass of warm milk before bed is much more effective. And I take a…tonic, recommended by a friend, for overall vitality. It's herbal, naturally. I wouldn't dream of ingesting anything…artificial. Honestly, Doctor, I maintain a very healthy lifestyle. It’s likely just stress, as I’ve repeatedly said. Are we nearly finished? I really must get back to work.
DOCTOR: Alright, a multivitamin, occasional aspirin, a sleep aid you discontinued, and an herbal tonic. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, Doctor. None whatsoever. I've always prided myself on my robust constitution. I can eat anything, drink anything, tolerate anything. Allergies are for…the weak. Honestly, I’ve never even had a sniffle. I suppose I'm rather fortunate. A gentleman of my standing simply doesn't succumb to such…infirmities. This is all rather unnecessary, isn't it? Are we getting anywhere? I have a very important call in less than an hour, and I need to prepare.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay, Mr. Alcorta, I’ve asked a lot of questions, and I appreciate your patience. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical examination, if you don’t mind. I’ll check your vision, look at your eyes, and do a general neurological assessment. It shouldn’t take long. First, let’s start with your vision. Could you please read the letters on this eye chart for me?
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. But please be quick about it. I haven't got all day. And do try not to shine that light directly into my eyes. It's rather…discomforting. Let's get this over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Please cover your left eye with your hand. Now, starting with the top row, can you read me the letters?
PATIENT: Very well. Let’s see… E… H… F… P… T… …I believe that’s it. Though, I must say, those letters are rather small. And the lighting is…suboptimal. Are you certain this chart is calibrated correctly? It seems…dim. This is quite frustrating. I have important things to attend to, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's try the second row. Cover your left eye, please. And tell me what letters you see.
PATIENT: Good heavens. This is…worse. …U…V…W… I… I think that’s it. It's all rather blurred. Honestly, Doctor, I suspect my eyesight is perfectly fine. Perhaps you should check the chart again. And the lighting! It's simply atrocious. Are you certain you're a qualified optometrist?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Alcorta. Thank you. Now, let’s switch eyes. Cover your right eye with your hand, and we’ll see how your left eye is doing.
PATIENT: This is… exceedingly tedious. Very well. Let’s get this over with. …E… H… F… P… T… … It appears to be the same as the other eye. Though, I suspect there’s a slight difference. It’s difficult to pinpoint. Honestly, Doctor, I’m beginning to question the validity of this entire exercise. Are you certain your equipment is functioning correctly? This is a waste of my valuable time.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Alcorta. Alright. Now, I’m going to check your pupils and do a quick assessment of your eye movements. This won’t take long. Please look straight ahead. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. No noticeable nystagmus. Now, I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Please keep your head still. Eye movements are full and smooth in all directions. No signs of diplopia reported. Now, I will quickly test your peripheral vision. Peripheral vision appears intact, though a more formal perimetry test would be needed for a definitive assessment. Okay, Mr. Alcorta. That completes the basic eye examination. Based on what I’ve observed—and I understand you have a busy schedule—your vision is slightly diminished in both eyes, and you're having some difficulty with close-up tasks. The pupil and movement tests were normal, and peripheral vision appears intact, but further testing would be ideal. The most likely scenario is presbyopia, age-related decline in near vision. This is very common, especially as we get older. However, given your fatigue and occasional headaches, and the fact that you've noticed gradual change, I recommend a comprehensive dilated eye exam with an ophthalmologist. They can rule out other potential causes and provide a more definitive diagnosis. Additionally, it might be prudent to discuss your fatigue and headaches with your primary care physician to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would you like me to provide a referral to a specialist?
PATIENT: Presbyopia? Is that what you’re calling it? A perfectly respectable gentleman simply doesn’t have presbyopia. It sounds…undignified. And referring me to a specialist? Utterly unnecessary. I assure you, my vision is perfectly adequate for my needs. It’s merely…a temporary lapse. Due to stress, naturally. However… …very well. A referral wouldn’t hurt, I suppose. Just to appease you. But I expect a prompt appointment, and a thorough explanation of any…findings. And I trust you’ll keep my schedule in mind. I haven’t got all day, you know. And please, no more talk of presbyopia. It's simply…unacceptable. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a very important call to attend to. Could you please provide me with the referral information? And a written summary of our…discussion? Just to have on file.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Alcorta. I understand your concerns, and I will ensure a prompt referral to a highly-rated ophthalmologist in the area. I'll also include a summary of our discussion in your file, and provide you with a copy before you leave. Here is the referral information for Dr. Eleanor Vance, a specialist in comprehensive ophthalmology. Her office is located at 123 Oak Street, and her phone number is 555-1212. I’ve also noted your busy schedule in the referral request. And here is a copy of our discussion, including the findings from the eye examination and my recommendations. It indicates the slightly diminished vision in both eyes, the normal pupil and movement tests, and my recommendation for a comprehensive dilated eye exam. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I believe that covers everything. Though, I must say, I’m rather disappointed with the lack of a definitive diagnosis. It’s all rather…vague. But thank you for your time. And please, ensure Dr. Vance is fully aware of my…expectations. A prompt appointment is paramount, and a thorough examination is non-negotiable. Good day, Doctor. And please, try not to mention presbyopia again. .
DOCTOR: You have a good day as well, Mr. Alcorta.
