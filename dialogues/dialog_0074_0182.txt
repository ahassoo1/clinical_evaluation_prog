DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Orwin. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Reisig. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Yes, well, don’t waste my time, Doctor. I’m here for a clearance. Cosmetic surgery. The man wants a full check-up before he… well, before he starts poking around. It’s a simple enough thing, I should think. Just tell me what forms I need to sign.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Orwin. A pre-operative evaluation is a very sensible precaution. It is important to ensure you are in good health before proceeding with any elective surgery. It's not simply about signing forms, though. A thorough assessment helps us identify and mitigate any potential risks. To start, could you tell me a little more about the surgery you are planning?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, it’s really none of your business what surgery I’m having. It’s… a bit of a touch-up. A little smoothing here, a little lift there. You know. Age happens. But I assure you, I'm as healthy as a horse for a man my age. I still do a bit of work, you know. Terrazzo. It keeps you moving. I don't need a lecture on risks; I just need a signature so I can get on with it.
DOCTOR: I understand your desire to keep the details private, Mr. Orwin, and I respect that. However, even with a seemingly minor procedure, it’s my professional responsibility to gather sufficient information to ensure your safety. Knowing the type of surgery, even generally, helps me focus my examination and identify potential complications. For example, are you planning a surgery on your face, neck, or somewhere else?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. It’s on my face. A little… tightening. That’s all. Don’t need to know more than that. It's not like I’m getting a hip replacement, Doctor. It’s a little nip and tuck. And really, I thought doctors asked questions, not told people what they needed. Are you going to ask me about my medical history or just grill me about a perfectly harmless procedure?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to call me out on that, Mr. Orwin. I apologize – I should have started with a more comprehensive look at your overall health. My apologies. Asking about your medical history is essential, and you’re right, that’s where we should begin. Let’s start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, or lung problems?
PATIENT: Hmmph. Well, I had a touch of the flu a few years back. Nothing serious. And my knees bother me sometimes, but that’s just age, I told you. I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. Worked hard my whole life. Didn't have time to get sick. Never smoked, barely drink. And I had that little… incident with the scaffolding, but that was decades ago. A broken wrist. Healed up fine. Don't go looking for trouble in that direction, either. It’s all old news. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Orwin. That's helpful. So, no chronic conditions like heart disease, diabetes, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Look, I’m a practical man, Doctor. I don’t sit around worrying about every little ache and pain. I just get on with it. Terrazzo work, you know. It's demanding. And if I had some serious health problem, wouldn't I know? And wouldn't I have seen a doctor about it already? This is ridiculous. Are we getting anywhere, or am I wasting my valuable time? I have a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Orwin, and I assure you I’m trying to get to the necessary information as efficiently as possible. Given your active lifestyle with terrazzo work, are you currently taking any medications – even over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen?
PATIENT: No. Never take anything. Waste of money, usually. Maybe an aspirin now and then for a headache, but that's it. I prefer to just tough it out. And listen, if you keep pressing me on every little detail, I might just leave. I didn’t come here for a life story evaluation. Just tell me what forms I need to sign. I have things to do. This is becoming quite the ordeal.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your impatience and your desire to get back to work. I assure you I am not trying to pry unnecessarily. However, even a seemingly simple procedure carries risks, and it's my duty to assess your overall health to minimize those risks. To be absolutely clear, I need to rule out any potential complications related to bleeding, infection, or anesthesia. To do that, I need a basic understanding of your medical history and current health status. Would you be willing to let me quickly review your medical records from any previous doctors you’ve seen?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. I am not giving you access to my private medical records. That’s a ridiculous request, and frankly, a little insulting. I've told you I’m healthy. Terrazzo work is demanding. I'd know if something was wrong. I'm not some frail old man, Doctor. This is becoming preposterous. Just… forget it. I'm leaving. I'll find another doctor who respects my time and doesn't treat me like an idiot.
DOCTOR: Mr. Orwin, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if my questions felt intrusive. However, I am unable to provide medical clearance for surgery without a basic assessment of your health. Given your reluctance to provide any information, I cannot, in good conscience, proceed. I strongly recommend you reconsider and allow me to review your records or at least allow me to perform a brief physical examination. If not, I would advise you to seek clearance from another physician. I wish you all the best. .
