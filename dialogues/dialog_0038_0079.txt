DOCTOR: Alright, good morning, Courtnye. I'm Dr. Neeraj Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… bruising. I’ve been getting bruises really easily lately. It’s kinda weird, ‘cause I’m on blood thinners already, so it shouldn’t be happening more, right? I just want to figure out what’s going on, if that makes sense. I don't wanna mess around with this.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense to want to get to the bottom of it, especially given you’re already on blood thinners. That is a bit concerning, and we definitely need to investigate. Okay, let's start with a bit more detail about these bruises. When did you first start noticing they were easier to get?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… probably around late June, maybe early July? It was just little things at first, bumping into furniture. But then they started showing up even when I didn’t even feel like I bumped into anything. Like, I woke up with one on my arm a couple of weeks ago. No idea where that came from. And they seem… bigger now, too. It’s just… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Okay, so around late June, early July, and they've been gradually increasing in frequency and size, even without a clear injury. That is a change we need to explore. And you said you're already on blood thinners… which one are you taking, and what's the dosage?
PATIENT: It’s… Warfarin. Five milligrams, once a day, every evening. I’ve been on it for… oh, gosh, about three years now, since my… well, since I had a blood clot in my leg. I usually get my levels checked monthly, and they've been stable. Last check-up was… July 18th, and everything was in the right range. So that’s what’s so confusing!
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin 5mg daily, three years post-leg clot, and your levels were stable as of July 18th. That does make this more puzzling, and good on you for keeping up with those regular checks. Alright. Let’s do a quick review of other things that might be playing a role. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No… not really. No dizziness, no headaches, no… bleeding gums or anything like that. Just the bruising. I feel… tired sometimes, but I always figured that was just from working. I’m an Information Security Analyst, so lots of screen time, you know? Honestly, that’s all I can think of. No other symptoms. I haven't fallen or hit myself hard recently, either. It's just…appearing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other bleeding symptoms, no dizziness or headaches, fatigue likely related to work. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk about your medical history a little more broadly. Do you have any other medical conditions besides the blood clot?
PATIENT: Just… high blood pressure. I’ve been on medication for that for about five years now. And… I had my gallbladder removed about ten years ago, but that was a one-time thing. Other than that, I’m pretty healthy, as far as I know. I try to eat well, though sometimes it’s hard with my job. Long hours, you know? I don't drink a lot, maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. And I don’t smoke.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication, gallbladder removal ten years ago, otherwise relatively healthy. You don’t smoke, and you drink alcohol in moderation. Good to know. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mom had high blood pressure too, and my grandma… she had something with her blood, I think. Like, it didn't clot right? But I don't really know the details. She passed away a long time ago. No one else that I know of had any major issues with bleeding or bruising. Just the usual stuff, you know? Heart problems, diabetes… nothing like this. Does that make sense? I'm not really good at remembering medical details about my family.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, you’ve given me a good starting point. Your mom had high blood pressure, and your grandmother had a clotting issue – details are understandably vague. Let’s talk about your current medications. Besides the Warfarin and the medication for your blood pressure, are you taking anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… Oh! I take a multivitamin every morning. And sometimes, when my back flares up, I’ll take ibuprofen. Just over-the-counter stuff. And… that’s it, I think. No herbal supplements, no creams or anything like that. I try to stay away from taking too much medication if I can. I'm careful about mixing things, you know? With the blood thinner and all.
DOCTOR: Okay, multivitamin daily, ibuprofen occasionally for back pain. And you're good about being cautious with mixing medications, which is excellent. Alright. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of things. I’ll need to look at the bruising and feel around a little. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Go ahead. I just wanna figure out what's going on. I'm starting to get a little worried, honestly. It's just...not normal, is it? Getting bruises like this when I'm already on blood thinners.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not normal to develop new bruising while on Warfarin, especially if your levels are stable. That’s why we're investigating, and it’s good that you’re bringing this to my attention. Okay. I see several bruises here, varying in size. Some appear relatively recent, others a little older. They don't seem particularly painful to the touch, which is good. I don’t feel any swelling or lumps. Your skin feels normal otherwise. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, we need to run some tests to try to figure out what’s going on. I want to check a complete blood count – that will tell us if there are any problems with your red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. And I also want to repeat your INR – just to confirm your Warfarin level is still stable. Do you have any known allergies that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Just… the usual, like, maybe a little itchy from bee stings when I was a kid, but nothing serious. So a blood test and check my level again? That sounds good. Anything else? I'm just hoping it's nothing too bad. I have a lot of work right now and can’t really afford to be sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Just the bee stings as a child. We’ll do a complete blood count and repeat your INR. No, let’s start with those tests. While we wait for the results, I want you to avoid taking any ibuprofen or other NSAIDs – those can interfere with your blood clotting and worsen the bruising. And if you notice any new bleeding – like nosebleeds, bleeding gums, or blood in your stool – please come back immediately or go to the emergency room. It's better to be safe than sorry. I'm going to have the nurse draw your blood now. The results should be back within a few hours. We'll call you as soon as we have them, and we can discuss the next steps at that time. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay, no ibuprofen, and watch for any new bleeding. I can do that. No, I don’t think so. Just… try not to panic, right? It's probably nothing too serious. Thanks, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look at this. It's just… unsettling, you know? Getting bruises when you’re supposed to be protected. I'll wait for the call.
