DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Ambris. I am Dr. Blim. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally. Look, it’s my breath. It smells. Bad. People have…commented. It's embarrassing, okay? I don't need a whole life story asked of me, just…fix it.
DOCTOR: "Fix it," you say. Well, Ms. Ambris, even seemingly simple problems require a systematic approach. While I appreciate your…directness, I do need some information to determine the cause of this unpleasantness before I can offer a solution. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t know. A while. Maybe a few months? It comes and goes, I guess. Look, I work outside, all day, in the sun. Fixing potholes, trimming bushes…it’s not exactly glamorous. Maybe it’s the dust? I don’t really pay attention to that kind of thing. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Dust is…a possibility. Though, I suspect there's more to it. Do you notice it consistently, or only at certain times?
PATIENT: Like I said, it comes and goes. Usually worse after…well, after a long day at work. And if I don't get a chance to… brush my teeth properly. It's not like I have time for fancy dental routines when I'm directing traffic around a construction zone, okay? I just want a quick fix. A mouthwash, or something.
DOCTOR: A “quick fix” is rarely sufficient, Ms. Ambris. We need to rule out underlying causes. Do you experience any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What do you mean? Like…am I sick? No, I feel fine. Tired, obviously, from the job. But no fever, no cough, no…anything. Just bad breath. Honestly, this is a waste of my time. Is it something I need a prescription for? Because I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Are you experiencing any pain in your mouth?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not really. Sometimes my gums are a little…tender after I eat, maybe? But that's it. Look, I eat what I can, when I can. It's not like I'm sitting down to a gourmet meal every night. Mostly sandwiches and coffee. It's a demanding job. Are we getting anywhere with this or what?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed with a brief examination. Please open your mouth for me. I need to assess your oral health directly.
PATIENT: Just…get it over with. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Gums are slightly inflamed, some minor redness. No obvious cavities, but there is a buildup of plaque. Tongue appears coated. Do you floss regularly, Ms. Ambris?
PATIENT: Floss? Look, I brush when I can, alright? I'm not exactly sitting around with dental picks after a 12-hour shift. It’s…not a priority. Is this going to cost me a fortune? Because I really don't have the money for expensive dental work. I just need something to mask the smell.
DOCTOR: It's not a matter of masking the smell, Ms. Ambris. It's about addressing the source of the problem. The inflammation and plaque buildup are indicative of poor oral hygiene. While I understand your financial constraints, neglecting this will only lead to more serious – and costly – issues down the line. Have you ever had a dental cleaning?
PATIENT: No. Look, I was divorced last year, okay? Things were…tight. I had other priorities. And frankly, I didn't see the point. It's just teeth. I don't need a lecture about proper oral hygiene from someone who sits in an air-conditioned office all day. Just tell me what I need to buy to make this stop. Mouthwash, gum, I don’t care. Anything.
DOCTOR: Very well. I can recommend a therapeutic mouthwash containing chlorhexidine gluconate. It will help reduce the bacteria causing the odor. However, this is a temporary solution. I also strongly advise that you schedule an appointment with a dentist as soon as possible for a professional cleaning and evaluation. Here is a prescription for the mouthwash. Use as directed. I will also provide you with information on low-cost dental clinics in the area. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Look, thanks, I guess. I really need to get back to work. Hopefully this stuff works. And I really don't need that pamphlet. Thanks, but no. I've got things to do.
