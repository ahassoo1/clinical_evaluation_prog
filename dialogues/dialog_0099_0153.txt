DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Krahn. Sixty-nine years old… and quite thin, according to this. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… right. Well, it’s… something about a check-up. For… work. A performance, I think? It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. They said I needed to be cleared by a doctor. Something about being… fit enough? I do a lot of standing, you see. At the theatre. Mostly ushering, and taking tickets. But… honestly, I can’t quite recall the specifics. It’s been a long time, and a lot of faces… and forms.
DOCTOR: Right. A work clearance, then. Ushering, standing for long periods… yes, I see. And you said it’s been a while since you’ve had a proper check-up?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. A long while. Decades, probably. I mostly just… keep going. Never really felt the need, you know? Until they started asking for paperwork. And now here I am. Is this going to take long? I have… things to do. Not important things, but… things.
DOCTOR: Well, given the length of time since your last check-up, we’ll need to cover a fair bit of ground. Just routine things, really. We’ll go through your medical history, any medications you’re taking, allergies, and then do a physical exam. It shouldn't be excessively lengthy, but a thorough assessment is important, especially considering your role requires standing for extended periods. First, let's start with your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Significant… conditions? Hmm. That’s a tough one. Let me think… I had a bad back once, years ago. Pulled something lifting… a box, I think? It healed, though. And… I think I had the flu a couple of times. Nothing serious, really. My ex-wife… she always took care of all the doctor stuff. I just… went along. I don’t really remember being diagnosed with anything important. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I’m probably not much help.
DOCTOR: Right. A history of back pain, resolving on its own, and occasional influenza. And you entrusted your medical care to your ex-wife. I see. Alright. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Oh… no, I don’t think so. Never had anything like that. Never needed to, thankfully. I’ve always been… pretty lucky, I suppose. As far as I know, nothing ever required cutting. Definitely no surgeries. I’d remember that, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: Yes, you would. Good. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… That’s… complicated. My parents passed away a long time ago. Both of them. I have a sister, somewhere… haven’t spoken to her in years. She moved to… Canada, I think? As for medical history… honestly, I don’t really know. We weren’t very close, and we certainly didn’t talk about illnesses. They were… private people. I’m afraid I can’t offer much help on that front either. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Right. Minimal family medical history available. We’ll proceed without it for now. Let’s discuss your social habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Never liked it. Smells awful. Always thought it was a silly habit. No, definitely don’t smoke. And… never have. My ex-wife smoked, though. That was… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright. How about alcohol?
PATIENT: Alcohol… well, I have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Occasionally. Nothing excessive. Just a small glass. Red wine, usually. It helps me relax. And… before that, maybe a beer on a hot day. But I wouldn’t say I drink… it’s just… a little something. Not enough to cause trouble, certainly.
DOCTOR: “A little something,” you say. And any recreational drug use?
PATIENT: Recreational… drugs? Oh, goodness, no. Absolutely not. Never touched anything like that. I’m a simple man. Theatre, a glass of wine, the occasional crossword puzzle. That’s about as exciting as my life gets. No, definitely no recreational drugs. That would be… terrible.
DOCTOR: Alright. Good. Now, are you allergic to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me think. I think I had a rash once, after taking… some kind of pill. Years ago. A doctor gave it to me for a cold. But I don’t remember what it was. And… I’m a little sensitive to pollen, maybe? My eyes get itchy in the spring. But that’s just… seasonal, isn’t it? Nothing serious. I don't think I have any major allergies.
DOCTOR: Right. A possible rash to an unknown medication and seasonal allergies. And you're currently taking any medications at all, prescribed or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, not currently. I haven't needed anything. I just take a multivitamin sometimes, that's all. To keep healthy, you know? Nothing regular, though. I take it when I remember. And… that’s it. No prescriptions, no daily pills. I try to stay away from those things if I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Krahn, given your age and the nature of your work, I’m going to need to perform a physical exam. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, assess your reflexes, and a brief musculoskeletal exam to check your range of motion and strength. Just to get a baseline. First, could you please step onto the scale for me?
PATIENT: Oh. Right. A physical exam. Yes, of course. Fine. The scale… is that one over there? It feels like it’s been a long time since I’ve been weighed. I… hope it’s not too bad. I’ve always been… slender. But, yes. Let’s get this over with.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. 118 pounds. That is… quite low for your height of 199 centimeters. Please step off the scale, Mr. Krahn. Now, if you'll follow me over to the examination table. We’ll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Yes, yes, quite slender. Always have been. My ex-wife used to… never mind. An examination table… it’s been a while. This is… a little drafty, isn’t it? I hope this won’t take too long. I have… a crossword puzzle waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure is… 108 over 68. That's a little on the low side, but not concerning at the moment. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. A few slightly diminished breath sounds, but nothing immediately alarming. Now, let’s check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Yes… deep breaths. It’s a little difficult, actually. I haven’t been very active lately. Reflexes… are those good? I always had trouble with those tests as a child. Never could get them right. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… diminished, but not absent. It's not unexpected, given your age and… overall build. Now, I'm going to need to assess your range of motion. Can you please raise both of your arms above your head?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s a little… uncomfortable, actually. My shoulders haven’t been very cooperative lately. I think I slept on them wrong. It's probably just a bit of stiffness. I used to be very flexible, you know. I did a lot of gardening.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Limited range of motion in both shoulders. And can you please try to touch your toes?
PATIENT: Like this? It’s… not very good, I’m afraid. My back… isn't what it used to be. I used to be very limber, you know. I could do a full split when I was younger. But that was… a long time ago. Is something definitely wrong? I really must get back to my crossword puzzle.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, based on my examination, you are significantly underweight, have low blood pressure, diminished reflexes, and limited range of motion in your shoulders. This raises some concerns. While it's possible these are simply age-related changes, your overall presentation warrants further investigation. I recommend a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a Vitamin D level. We should also consider a chest X-ray to assess your lung function, given your slightly diminished breath sounds. Additionally, I’m concerned about the possibility of muscle wasting and potential malnutrition. I want to refer you to a registered dietitian for a nutritional assessment and guidance. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A… complete blood count? A metabolic what-now? And an X-ray? Goodness… that sounds… serious. A dietitian? Is something terribly wrong? I just wanted to be cleared for work… I didn't realize it would be… all this. I don't understand… I just usher at the theatre. I stand and take tickets. Is it… is it safe for me to keep doing that? And... what about my crossword puzzle?
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, it’s not necessarily a matter of “safe” or “unsafe” right now. It’s a matter of understanding why you’re presenting with these findings. The tests will help us determine if there’s an underlying medical condition causing these issues. We need to rule out things like malnutrition, vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or even… other possibilities. I strongly advise you to refrain from any strenuous physical activity until we have the results of these tests. Standing for extended periods could exacerbate the underlying problem, whatever it may be. I understand your concern about your work and your crossword puzzle, but your health is paramount. I’m going to write you a temporary work excuse while we investigate this further. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A temporary… work excuse? So I can’t usher? But… what will I do? And… what kind of possibilities? Are you saying… something serious? I don’t understand any of this medical jargon. What does “exacerbate” even mean? And… what if I can’t go back to work? I’ve been doing this for years. It’s… it’s all I know. Maybe… maybe I just need a good night’s sleep? I think I’ll just skip the tests and try to rest. Can’t I just do that? I promise I’ll be more careful… and take more vitamins. Please? I really need to get back to my crossword puzzle.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, with all due respect, “a good night’s sleep” and “more vitamins” are unlikely to address these findings. We need to investigate this properly. Ignoring the problem will not make it go away, and it could potentially worsen. "Exacerbate" means to make it worse. And while I understand your concern about your work, it's irresponsible to continue engaging in strenuous activity without knowing the underlying cause of these symptoms. I am not going to dismiss your concerns, but I am also not going to allow you to jeopardize your health by refusing testing. I am ordering the complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, chest X-ray, and a referral to a registered dietitian. My nurse will schedule these tests for you. I understand this is overwhelming, but it's a necessary step. We need to gather information to determine the best course of action. I'm not saying anything is definitely wrong, but we need to rule things out. Do you understand that much?
PATIENT: …Fine. Do the tests. Whatever you think is best. But… please, be quick about it. I really don’t want to be away from my work for too long. And… could I at least have a copy of the results? I want to… understand what’s going on, even if I don’t understand the medical terms. And… what if it is something serious? What if I… can’t work anymore? I just… I don't know what I’ll do. Is the nurse here? I just want to get this over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. Yes, my nurse will be in shortly to schedule the tests and provide you with the necessary paperwork. You will receive a copy of all the results, and we will discuss them thoroughly once they are available. And while I understand your anxiety about the possibility of a serious diagnosis, it's important not to jump to conclusions. We haven't even done the tests yet. Many things could be causing these findings, and hopefully, it will be something manageable. I will be honest with you, though. Your underweight status and diminished muscle mass are concerning and need to be addressed. The dietitian will provide guidance on proper nutrition and may recommend a tailored eating plan. Please try to remain calm, and focus on getting these tests done. We'll take it one step at a time. The nurse will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: …One step at a time. Yes. Thank you… I think. I hope my crossword puzzle isn’t too difficult today. .
