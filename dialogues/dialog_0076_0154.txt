DOCTOR: Right, yes. Claudene Wease, 66. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Ruocco, is it? Yes. Well, it's… my water. It hurts when I… go. Has been happening a bit, on and off. Not sure how long, exactly. A while, I think. It’s quite bothersome, really. I just want it fixed, if that’s possible.
DOCTOR: Hmm. “Hurts when you go.” Right. And by “go,” you mean urinate?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it. Urinate. That’s the… proper word, isn’t it? It burns, mostly. And feels… uncomfortable. I don’t like it at all. It’s happened a few times now, so I thought I best come in. Do you… need to know more? I don't really keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Burning… alright. And is this burning constant, or does it come and go during urination?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um… it’s not always burning. It usually starts… towards the end. When I’m finished, it stings a bit. Not right away, but… afterwards. And sometimes it feels like I still need to… empty it all, even when I think I have. It’s very confusing, honestly. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Right, right. Towards the end… residual emptying… Look, are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh my. Well… no. Not for… a very long time. Since my divorce, actually. That was… goodness, decades ago. No, not at all. Is that… important? It feels a bit personal to ask, doesn’t it? Though, I suppose you’re the doctor.
DOCTOR: It can be. We just have to rule things out. Alright. Any fever, chills, or pain in your back or side?
PATIENT: Oh, no fever, no. And… chills? Not that I recall. Back pain… well, I have a bit of back pain sometimes. But that’s just… old age, I think. It’s always there, really. Not a new pain. Does that make sense? It doesn’t feel connected to the… water problem.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood? Um… I don’t think so. Now that you mention it… maybe once? A very faint pinkish tinge, perhaps. But I thought it was just… something I ate. Beetroot, maybe? I can't be sure. It was a while ago. Honestly, I don’t pay much attention to these things. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Right. Beetroot. Look, I'm going to need a urine sample. We need to check for an infection. Can you do that for me now?
PATIENT: Oh. A sample? Yes, I suppose so. Where… where do I go? Is there a… a special room for that? I hope it’s not too… inconvenient. I don’t have much… control these days, if you understand me. It's a bit embarrassing, really. I hope you have… tissues.
DOCTOR: Down the hall, first door on the left. There’s a little room, instructions are on the counter. And yes, there are tissues. Just… try to get a clean sample. And don’t worry about it. It's part of the job.
PATIENT: Right. A clean sample… I’ll do my best. It’s all a bit… much. Thank you, Doctor. I hope I don’t take too long. This is… very unsettling.
DOCTOR: Just get the sample. The sooner we rule things out, the better. Honestly, people…
PATIENT: Here. I think I managed it. It wasn't easy, I must say. Is this alright? I spilled a little, I’m afraid. I do apologise. My hands were shaking. It’s just… everything feels so strange. I hope that's enough?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, that's… adequate. I'll send this to the lab. It will take a little while to get the results. In the meantime… do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… um… not that I know of. I haven’t taken much in the way of medicine lately. A bit of paracetamol for headaches, perhaps. But that was ages ago. No, I don’t think so. No allergies. Is this going to be a long process, Doctor? I have a hair appointment this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Look, until we know what’s going on, I can’t say. It could be a simple infection. It could be something else. I'll need the lab results first. And frankly, given your age and the residual emptying… we might need to consider further testing if this doesn’t clear up with antibiotics. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Further testing? Oh dear. What sort of testing? I… I don’t like the sound of that. I’m not very good with… procedures. And antibiotics? I’ve never taken those before. Will they make me sick? I just want this… burning to stop. This is all very upsetting. I'm not sure I understand any of this.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Wease. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We’ll start with the basics. If the urine test shows an infection, we'll prescribe antibiotics. Those can sometimes cause mild stomach upset, but they usually clear it up quickly. If that doesn’t work, then we might talk about further tests. Honestly, you’re making this much more difficult than it needs to be. Just try to relax, alright?
PATIENT: I am trying, Doctor. But it's all so… frightening. I don’t have anyone to help me understand these things. My husband… well, he’s gone a long time. And my daughter lives far away. I just want to feel better. Is there anything… anything at all you can tell me right now to ease my mind? I'm sorry to be such a bother. .
DOCTOR: Look. I’ll send the sample to the lab. They’ll call me with the results. If it’s a simple infection, I'll call you with a prescription. Try to drink plenty of water in the meantime. That's all I can tell you right now. Honestly, people… Next!
