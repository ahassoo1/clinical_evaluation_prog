DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. My name is Dr. Reisig. It's lovely to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me in? Well, my tummy feels… big. Bigger than usual, I think. And I don't want to eat much anymore. Not hungry, you see. It’s been… a little while now, I guess. I don't remember exactly when it started, though. Everything feels a bit fuzzy these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. Your stomach feels larger than usual, and you've noticed a decrease in your appetite. And you said this has been going on for a little while, but it's difficult to pinpoint exactly when it began. That’s perfectly alright; we’ll try to piece things together. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe what you mean by "big"?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. “Big”... it’s hard to say. Like… full of water, maybe? Not hard, not painful, just… swollen. Like a balloon, but not tight. And… rounder, I think. I usually wear this same dress, you see, and it feels… snugger. I don’t know if that makes sense. Everything just feels… different.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Ms. McConnon. So, it feels more like fullness or swelling, not a hard lump, and not painful. And you've noticed a change in how your clothes fit. That's helpful information. Now, have you noticed any other changes along with this fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm... other changes? Let me think. Oh! I go to the bathroom… more often. To pee, you see. Not a lot each time, but… more times in the day. And… I feel a little tired, maybe? It's hard to tell with my age, you know. I nap a lot anyway. But maybe a little more tired lately. I don’t know. It’s all just… a little off.
DOCTOR: Okay, so increased frequency of urination, and perhaps some increased fatigue. Thank you for sharing that. Just to be clear, when you say "more often," could you give me a rough estimate of how many times a day you're urinating now, compared to what's typical for you?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Numbers… I’m not good with numbers. Let me see… before, maybe… two, three times a day? Now… I think… four, maybe five? Sometimes more. I don’t keep track, you see. I just know I go more often. It wakes me up at night sometimes, too. Just a little, but enough to… bother me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so an increase from two or three times a day to four or five, sometimes more, and it’s waking you up at night as well. That's helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements? Oh… dear. You mean… going to the bathroom… the other way? Hmm. Let me think… I don’t… I don’t think so. It’s all a bit… slow, maybe? But that’s just… old age, I think. It’s always been a little slow. Nothing… different, really. Just… regular, but slow.
DOCTOR: Okay, so regular bowel movements, but perhaps a little slower than usual. Thank you. Now, Ms. McConnon, I’d like to ask about your medical history, if that’s alright. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… medical conditions… Let me see… It was a long time ago. I think… the doctor said I had something with my… blood pressure, maybe? A long time ago. And… I had my gallbladder out, years and years ago. But that was… a very long time ago. I don't remember much else, dear. I've seen many doctors in my life, you see. It all gets… muddled.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. McConnon. High blood pressure and gallbladder removal. We'll make a note of those. Do you happen to remember what medications you've taken in the past, or are currently taking, even if it's just something over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Oh dear, medications… No, I don't think so. I used to take something for my blood pressure, but… I stopped a long time ago. The doctor said it was okay. Now… I don’t take anything regularly. Sometimes I take a little something for… my knees, when they bother me. But it’s just… a little cream, you see. Not pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications, just a cream for your knees as needed. And you said you stopped taking medication for your blood pressure a long time ago. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don't think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I know. I used to love shellfish, but… I haven't eaten it in years. Not because I’m allergic, just… I don't have much of an appetite these days, you see. But no, I don’t think I have any allergies.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh… family history… That’s… difficult. My family… we didn’t talk much about such things. My mother… she died when I was young. And my father… he was a strong man, but… I don’t remember him being sick. I think… my aunt… she had something with her heart, maybe? But I’m not sure. It was a long time ago, and… I wasn't very close to her. It's all a bit fuzzy, dear.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. McConnon. It's common for family medical history to be difficult to recall. We’ll make a note of what you do remember—possible heart condition in your aunt. Now, lastly regarding your background, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle…? Oh, dear. What do you mean? I live alone, you see. I used to work… I was a sociologist, a long time ago. But now… I mostly stay home. I like to read, when my eyes are good. And… I watch television. I don't go out much anymore. It's hard to get around, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. McConnon. That gives me a good picture. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, dear. That’s alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. I'm not very strong, you see, but I’ll try to be still. Just… be gentle, please? My bones are… old.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. McConnon. I will be very gentle. Please lie back on the exam table. Take a nice deep breath for me... and another... Good. Your heart sounds a little… distant, but I don't hear any abnormal rhythms or murmurs. Your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to feel your abdomen. Just let me know if anything feels tender or uncomfortable. I do notice some… fullness in your lower abdomen, and it doesn't feel particularly firm. It’s soft to the touch, and there's no sharp pain when I press. I don’t feel any masses. It's a bit difficult to assess fully because of the fullness. Is this different than how your abdomen normally feels?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… that feels… about right. It’s always been a little soft, you see. But… it feels bigger now, doesn't it? Like… filled with water, maybe? And… heavier. Like something is… sitting there. It doesn't hurt, just… uncomfortable. It’s hard to explain. I just feel… swollen, you see. Like a balloon.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. McConnon. It feels fuller and heavier than usual, and more like distention than a solid mass. I don't detect any rebound tenderness or guarding, which is good. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Okay, Ms. McConnon. Based on what you've told me and the physical exam, you're experiencing abdominal fullness, decreased appetite, increased urinary frequency, and some fatigue. The exam reveals a soft, distended abdomen, and diminished reflexes. There are a few possibilities we need to investigate. Given your age and symptoms, I’m concerned about potential urinary retention, which means not being able to fully empty your bladder, and also about the possibility of constipation contributing to the fullness. We also need to consider other causes of abdominal distension. To help us determine the cause, I'd like to order a few tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh… tests? Yes, dear. If you think it’s necessary. I trust you. I just… don’t want anything too… complicated. I’m not very strong, you see. And… I don't like needles very much. But… if you think it will help, I’ll do whatever you think is best. What kind of tests are we talking about?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. McConnon. I understand your concerns. We’ll keep everything as simple and comfortable as possible. The first test I'd like to order is a urinalysis, which is a sample of your urine. This will help us check for infection or other abnormalities in your urinary tract. It’s a simple test – you just provide a sample in a cup. The second test I’d like to order is a blood test. This will give us information about your kidney function, electrolytes, and overall health. It will require a small blood draw. Finally, I’d like to get an abdominal ultrasound. This is a non-invasive imaging test that uses sound waves to create pictures of your organs. It doesn't involve any radiation and shouldn't be painful, just a little cool gel on your abdomen. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Oh… a urine sample, a blood draw, and… an ultrasound? Yes, I think so. The urine sample sounds easy enough. And… a little blood draw… I don’t like it, but… if you think it’s important. And… the ultrasound sounds okay, as long as it doesn't hurt. No needles, right? Just… gel? And it won’t take long, will it? I don’t have much energy these days, you see.
DOCTOR: That’s right, Ms. McConnon. No needles for the ultrasound, just cool gel. The blood draw will be quick, just a few vials. And the ultrasound shouldn’t take very long, perhaps 20-30 minutes. We'll get you scheduled for those tests as soon as possible. While we wait for the results, I'm going to prescribe you a stool softener to help with any potential constipation, and I'd like you to increase your fluid intake if you’re able. I’m also going to give you a list of symptoms to watch out for that would warrant immediate attention, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or inability to urinate. Do you have any questions about any of this?
PATIENT: Oh, a stool softener… and more fluids… Yes, I can try that. More fluids… I usually drink tea, is that okay? And a list of symptoms… Yes, that’s good. Severe pain… vomiting… I’ll watch out for those. Hmm… let me think… What if I just feel… very tired? And… a little confused? Is that something to worry about? Sometimes I get… mixed up, you see. And… I forget things easily.
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. McConnon. Yes, a sudden increase in fatigue or confusion would be something to be aware of. Any significant change in your mental status should be reported to me immediately. It could be related to a number of things, including dehydration or infection. I’m going to also include those symptoms – increased fatigue or confusion – on the list I’m giving you. I want you to feel comfortable contacting me if anything feels off, even if it doesn't seem severe. We'll review the test results as soon as they are available and discuss the next steps. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to know, dear. Thank you. I think… no. That’s all for now. You’ve been very helpful. And… very kind. I appreciate you listening to me. It's nice to… talk to someone who understands. I worry sometimes, you see. Getting old is… hard.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. McConnon. It's my pleasure. And you are absolutely right—getting older can be challenging. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Here’s the list of symptoms, the prescription for the stool softener, and the instructions for the tests. My office will call you to schedule the tests, and we'll get you in as soon as possible. Take care of yourself, and please, don't hesitate to contact us if anything changes.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. I will. And… thank you again. You’ve put my mind at ease.
