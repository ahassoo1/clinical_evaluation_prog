DOCTOR: Good morning, Mrs. Derasmo. I am Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you’re 75 years of age. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, seventy-five, though I sometimes forget. It’s… well, it’s a bit difficult to explain. I haven’t been myself lately. Just… down. Very down. I suppose that’s what you’d call it. I'd like to get this sorted quickly if possible, if you don't mind.
DOCTOR: "Not yourself," you say. And how long has this been going on, Mrs. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It’s been… several months, I suppose. At least six. It comes and goes, but lately it’s been… more and more often. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly, you see. I've always been a busy woman, always doing something. Ski patrol in the winter, lifeguarding in the summer… Now, well, even those don’t seem appealing. And that’s not like me at all.
DOCTOR: Ski patrol and lifeguarding, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. For… a long time. Nearly forty years with the ski patrol, and maybe thirty with the lifeguards. It kept me going, kept me strong. But like I said, even thinking about it now… it feels like too much effort. Everything does, really. I just don't have the… the spark anymore. It’s quite bothersome, honestly. I'm not one to complain, but it’s affecting everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything specific happened around the time this started, six months ago?
PATIENT: Hmm… specific? Well… my divorce was finalized about then, I believe. It wasn’t… amicable, let’s put it that way. We’d been separated for a while, of course, but the paperwork… it made it final, you understand? It’s just… a lot of years, gone. Perhaps that has something to do with it. Though I don’t want to dwell on it, if I can avoid it. It’s in the past, after all.
DOCTOR: A recent divorce. Yes, that could certainly be a contributing factor. Now, are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this… lack of motivation?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, symptoms. Let me see… I sleep… alright, I suppose. Not wonderfully, but alright. And my appetite… it's not what it used to be. I don’t feel hungry much of the time. I find myself losing weight, though I haven't weighed myself recently. And sometimes… sometimes I just feel… tired. Very, very tired, even after a full night’s rest. I suppose that's all. Nothing too dramatic, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Loss of appetite, some weight loss, and fatigue. And are you having any difficulty with concentration or memory?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it… yes, a little. I forget things more easily than I used to, of course, one expects that at my age. But it’s… more noticeable lately. And focusing on things… reading the newspaper, for instance, is harder. I have to read the same paragraph several times to understand it. It’s frustrating, honestly. I used to have a very sharp mind. It’s all rather upsetting.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any feelings of hopelessness or thoughts of harming yourself, Mrs. Derasmo?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Absolutely not harming myself. Never! Hopelessness… well, perhaps a little. It just feels like… what's the point, sometimes? I've lived a full life, I suppose, but… it's all rather empty now. But harming myself? No, never. I have too much pride for that. And my daughter would be terribly upset, of course. It’s just… a sad feeling. A very sad feeling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s go over your medical history. Do you have any chronic medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, let me think... I had a hip replacement about ten years ago, but that healed nicely. And I have a bit of arthritis, of course, but it’s managed with over-the-counter pain relievers. Nothing serious, really. High blood pressure, the doctor said, a while back, but it’s usually under control. I try to watch my salt intake. Is that all you need to know? I’ve always been quite healthy, for the most part.
DOCTOR: Hip replacement ten years ago, arthritis, and a history of hypertension. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, none at all. I’ve never had any allergic reactions to anything. My mother always said I had a strong constitution. And I’ve taken all sorts of things over the years – painkillers for the arthritis, antibiotics when I’ve been ill… never a problem. I'm a very straightforward patient, you see. No complications.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter supplements or vitamins?
PATIENT: Yes, let me see. I take a multivitamin every morning, just to be on the safe side. And I take ibuprofen occasionally for the arthritis, when it flares up. Other than that, no. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if possible. I believe in a natural approach, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's perfectly alright. Get on with it, if you must. The sooner we figure this out, the better. I have a luncheon with my daughter planned for next week, and I'd like to be myself for that. Do tell me how long this will take. I don't want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: It shouldn't take long, Mrs. Derasmo. If you’ll just have a seat here. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and do a quick neurological assessment. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 145/90. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit distant. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Reflexes are normal, but slightly diminished. No obvious focal neurological deficits. Alright. Everything seems within normal limits, though your blood pressure is a bit high.
PATIENT: Slightly high blood pressure, you say? Well, I did have a rather strong cup of tea this morning. Perhaps that’s it. So, what does all this mean, Doctor? Am I terribly ill? I'd appreciate a straight answer, if you don't mind. I don't like beating around the bush.
DOCTOR: Well, Mrs. Derasmo, based on what you’ve told me, and the brief exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. The loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed, the fatigue, the changes in appetite and sleep, the difficulty concentrating… these are all consistent with that diagnosis. The recent divorce is likely a significant contributing factor. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes for your symptoms. I'd like to order some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin D levels, and a complete blood count. This will help us ensure there isn't an underlying medical condition causing these issues. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a low dose of an antidepressant medication. It's a common and generally well-tolerated medication, and it can often help to improve mood and energy levels. We can adjust the dosage as needed. I also recommend you consider talking to a therapist. Talking about your feelings can be very helpful. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Depression? Hmm. I always thought that was for… weaker people, if you don’t mind me saying so. I've always been a strong woman, a very practical woman. But… I suppose it's possible. Medication, you say? I'm not keen on taking pills, as you know. And a therapist… well, I don't really talk about my feelings. Never have. But… I suppose I should do something. What kind of blood work are we talking about? And what are the side effects of this medication? I need to know everything before I agree to anything. And… how long will it take to see any improvement? I don't want to waste my time.
DOCTOR: Mrs. Derasmo, depression is not a sign of weakness. It's a medical condition, just like high blood pressure or a broken bone. It's caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, and it can affect anyone, regardless of their strength or resilience. The blood work will involve a simple blood draw, and it will check for things like thyroid dysfunction, vitamin deficiencies, and anemia – all of which can cause similar symptoms. The medication I'm prescribing is sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or SSRI. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and decreased libido. However, many people experience no side effects at all, or only mild ones that subside within a few weeks. It typically takes four to six weeks to see a noticeable improvement in symptoms. I understand your reluctance, but I believe this is the best course of action. We'll monitor your progress closely, and we can adjust the treatment plan as needed. I also have a list of qualified therapists in the area if you'd like to consider that option. Ultimately, the decision is yours, but I strongly recommend giving it a try. Would you like me to order the blood work and write the prescription for the sertraline?
PATIENT: Sertraline… it sounds… complicated. And side effects… ugh. But… you’re right, I suppose. Something needs to be done. I can't go on feeling like this. And the luncheon with my daughter… I need to be myself for that. Very well, Doctor. Order the blood work. And… write the prescription. But only a low dose, mind you. And if I experience any… unpleasant side effects, I’m stopping it immediately. And… perhaps give me that list of therapists. I haven’t made up my mind about that yet, but it’s good to have options. Let’s get this over with, shall we? The sooner this is done, the sooner I can get back to my life. Though I'm not sure what that is anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Derasmo. I’m ordering the blood work now. You can schedule an appointment with the lab at your convenience. I’m also writing a prescription for 25 milligrams of sertraline, to be taken once daily. Here's the list of therapists in the area, with their contact information and specialties. I’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment for you in four weeks to discuss the results of the blood work and assess your response to the medication. In the meantime, if you experience any concerning side effects, or if your symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to contact the office. Remember, this is a process, and it may take time to find the right treatment plan. But I’m confident that we can get you feeling better. Do you have any other questions or concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don't think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Twenty-five milligrams… I’ll try it, then. And I’ll take a look at that list of therapists. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. And… I hope you’re right. I really do. I think that’s all for now. I’m ready to leave, if you don't mind. I have a luncheon to prepare for, you know. .
DOCTOR: Of course, Mrs. Derasmo. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything. And best of luck with your luncheon. I hope you enjoy it. .
