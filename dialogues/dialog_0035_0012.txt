DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Squiers. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s Velda Squiers, yes. Thank you for seeing me. I’m hoping you can help me with something for a cruise I’m planning. It’s… well, they need some health information from me before I can go, and I thought it best to get it properly from my doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, a pre-cruise health assessment. I can certainly help with that. They usually have a form, right?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. A rather long form, actually. It asks about… everything, it seems! I have it here with me, if that would be helpful. It’s mostly just confirming things, I suppose, but I wanted to be sure I filled it out correctly, and maybe get a quick check to be on the safe side before I travel.
DOCTOR: Please, have a seat. Let's take a look at the form. We can go through it together. It’s always best to be thorough. Alright, let’s start with your current medications and allergies, if you have any.
PATIENT: Well, that's a simple question, thankfully! I’m not on any medications at all, Doctor. Never have been, touch wood. And I don't have any allergies that I know of. I eat everything, though I do prefer a good Scottish oatcake to most things! I’ve always been quite fortunate in that regard.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any chronic conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, asthma, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a thing. I’ve been, thankfully, very healthy all my life. My husband, God rest his soul, he was the one with a touch of this and that, but I always managed to stay quite robust. Just the usual bumps and scrapes, I suppose. A broken wrist when I was a girl, climbing a tree, but that healed perfectly well. I did have the measles as a child, of course, but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, and any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No surgeries, Doctor. Never needed them. I was always careful, you see. And I’ve always been lucky enough to have a strong constitution. My mother always said fresh air and good food were the best medicine, and I think she was right. Though I do enjoy a wee dram now and then, for medicinal purposes, of course!
DOCTOR: Right. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: That’s… a bit of a mixed bag, I suppose. My father lived to a good age, eighty-seven, but he had a touch of arthritis in his later years. My mother, she passed away relatively young, from… well, it was a chest infection, I believe. She wasn’t a strong woman, to be honest. My brother, he’s still alive, thankfully, but he has high blood pressure, I think. His wife manages it, though. It's not too bad. Nothing terribly serious on either side, really. Just the usual things, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. And just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, I live alone now, as I mentioned. I keep myself busy, though. I do a lot of… display work, you see. Window dressing, shop layouts, that sort of thing. It keeps me active and creative. I walk everywhere, I don’t drive. Fresh air is important, as I said. I enjoy a good book, and I meet friends for tea most weeks. I don't smoke, and I only drink socially, a glass of wine with dinner perhaps. I try to eat a healthy diet - lots of fruit and vegetables. Not much for sweets, to be honest. I find a good oatcake much more satisfying. Does that answer your question, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. Now, just a quick check-up, if you don’t mind. I just need to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your blood pressure. It’s standard procedure for a pre-travel assessment.
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Whatever you need. That sounds perfectly sensible. I'm happy to cooperate. I do hope everything’s alright. I wouldn’t want anything to spoil my cruise!
DOCTOR: Alright, everything sounds good. Your heart rate is normal, and your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not concerning for your age, and likely related to being in a clinical setting. Now, are you experiencing any current symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Oh, that's reassuring to hear, Doctor! Thank you. No, no symptoms at all, thankfully. Not a cough, not a cold, not a headache, nothing. I feel perfectly well, honestly. Perhaps a little excited about the cruise, but that’s all! I sleep well, eat well, and generally feel very fit for my age, if I may say so myself. No dizziness, no shortness of breath, no chest pain. Absolutely nothing to worry about, I hope?
DOCTOR: No, everything sounds good. Given your history and current state, I don’t see any reason why you shouldn’t be able to enjoy your cruise. I’ll just complete the form, confirming that you’re fit to travel. Here you go. This should satisfy the cruise line’s requirements. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful! That’s a great relief, Doctor, thank you so much. No, I don't think I have any questions, actually. You’ve been very thorough, and I feel much more confident now. Perhaps just… is there anything I should be particularly aware of while I’m away? Any little things I should look out for?
DOCTOR: Just the usual precautions. Stay hydrated, protect yourself from the sun, and be mindful of food safety. If you experience any fever, severe diarrhea, or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately. Have a wonderful time on your cruise, Ms. Squiers. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, that’s all, thank you. You’ve been most kind and helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to answer all my questions and putting my mind at ease. I shall certainly follow your advice and enjoy my cruise. And if anything does happen, I know what to look out for. Thank you again, Doctor Alzoubi. .
