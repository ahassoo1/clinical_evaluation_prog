DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. Welcome to my practice. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. Now, please, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away. It’s been… oh, goodness, maybe a month now? It started small, just a tickle, but now it’s… well, it feels deep, you know? And it makes me tired. Really tired.
DOCTOR: A month, you say. And it’s progressed from a tickle to… a deeper cough, accompanied by fatigue. I see. Can you describe the cough for me?
PATIENT: It’s not a dry cough, Doctor. There’s… something coming up. It's clear, mostly, but sometimes… sometimes it’s a little… bubbly. And at night, especially, it feels like there’s fluid. It makes me have to sit up to breathe. It's worse when I lie flat, for sure.
DOCTOR: "Bubbly," and worse when lying flat, causing you to sit up to breathe. Hmm. Do you have any accompanying symptoms, Ms. Sadhu?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My ankles… they swell up something awful by the end of the day. And I get short of breath just walking to the mailbox these days, which is silly, really. I used to walk all over! And… well, I don't have much of an appetite anymore. Everything tastes… bland. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Ankle swelling, shortness of breath with minimal exertion, and a decreased appetite… and the bland taste. Very good. Now, Ms. Sadhu, let's delve a bit deeper into your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions—heart problems, lung issues, perhaps diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, yes. My heart… the doctor told me years ago, maybe fifteen years ago now, that it wasn't pumping as strong as it should. He said something about… congestive heart failure. That's what he called it. I take a pill for it, every day. And I used to see a specialist, but… I haven't been in so long. It felt like just more pills, and I was feeling okay-ish. Until this cough, of course.
DOCTOR: Congestive heart failure diagnosed fifteen years ago, currently on medication… and you haven’t seen the specialist in some time. We will need to ascertain the medication name, dosage, and last refill date. Do you recall the name of the medication, Ms. Sadhu?
PATIENT: Let me think… it’s a white pill, small. And the name… it starts with an “F”, I believe. Furo… Furosemide! Yes, that's it! Furosemide. I take one every morning with my breakfast. As for when I last had it refilled… Oh dear. I let my granddaughter handle that for me usually, and I haven’t asked her recently. Maybe a month or two ago, I think? I really should pay closer attention. She means well, but… it’s best if I keep track.
DOCTOR: Furosemide, one tablet daily. And approximately one to two months since the last refill. Thank you for that information, Ms. Sadhu. Now, are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me see… besides the Furosemide, I take a baby aspirin every day. Doctor told me to, years ago, for my heart. And sometimes, if my arthritis is acting up, I take ibuprofen. Not every day, just when it really hurts. And… oh! I take a multivitamin. A gummy one, because the pills are hard to swallow. That's it, I think. Just those things.
DOCTOR: Baby aspirin daily, ibuprofen as needed for arthritis, and a multivitamin. Very good. Now, have you experienced any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thank goodness. I eat everything! Well, almost everything. I’m not fond of cilantro, but that's a taste thing, not an allergy! No, I don't have any allergies, Doctor. I’m pretty lucky that way, I guess.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Excellent. Now, Ms. Sadhu, let’s briefly discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – heart disease, lung problems, cancer, diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. My mother… she had high blood pressure, and she died of a stroke, I think. And my father… he had diabetes, and his legs were bad. They had to… take them off, eventually. And my brother… he had cancer, lung cancer, but that was a long time ago. He smoked, you see. No one else that I can really think of, not anything major. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: History of hypertension and stroke in mother, diabetes and lower extremity amputation in father, and lung cancer in brother who was a smoker. And finally, Ms. Sadhu, I'd like to briefly inquire about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or live alone?
PATIENT: No, I don't smoke, never have. My husband, he used to, but he quit years ago. And I don't drink alcohol either, not even a little. And yes, I live alone. My husband passed away ten years ago, and my son… he lives in California with his family. It’s nice to have them visit, but mostly it's just me. I keep busy, though. I like to cook, and I volunteer at the church. Keeps me out of trouble, you know?
DOCTOR: Non-smoker, no alcohol consumption, lives alone, widowed ten years ago, son lives in California. Now, Ms. Sadhu, if you don't mind, I'd like to conduct a brief physical examination. This will help me assess your overall health and determine the cause of your cough and fatigue. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgement. I’m ready when you are. Just… try to be gentle, my old bones aren't what they used to be!
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Sadhu. We'll proceed with the utmost care. First, I'd like to listen to your heart and lungs. Please, if you would, take a deep breath in through your mouth… and exhale slowly. Now, let's check your blood pressure. Hmm. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated. Now, I'll just listen again… I hear some crackling in your lungs, particularly at the bases. Now, I'd like to feel your ankles. I notice some swelling in your ankles, and it appears to be pitting edema. Finally, I'll just check your pulse. Your pulse is regular, but slightly weak. Alright, Ms. Sadhu. Thank you for your patience. The examination findings are consistent with fluid retention, and support the possibility of worsening congestive heart failure.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? Worsening… you mean my heart is getting worse? I thought the pill was keeping it under control. What does this mean, Doctor? Will I need to go to the hospital?
DOCTOR: Ms. Sadhu, please don't be alarmed. While the findings suggest a possible worsening of your congestive heart failure, further evaluation is necessary to confirm this. The crackling in your lungs and ankle swelling are concerning, but they are not definitive on their own. As for hospitalization, that is not necessarily the immediate course of action. However, we need to gather more information. I'd like to order some blood tests—a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a BNP level, which helps assess heart function. Additionally, I’d like to order a chest X-ray to evaluate for fluid in your lungs. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Blood tests and a chest X-ray. That sounds… thorough. Will they be able to tell a lot from those? And… what if it is getting worse? What happens then? I’m not a fan of hospitals, you know. I get very lonely there. Will I need more pills? I'm already taking so many...
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Sadhu, these tests will provide valuable information about your overall health and heart function. The blood tests will assess your kidney function, electrolyte balance, and overall well-being, while the chest X-ray will help determine if there is fluid accumulating in your lungs, which is common in congestive heart failure. If the tests confirm worsening heart failure, the treatment plan may involve adjustments to your medication, including potentially increasing the dose of your furosemide or adding another medication to help remove excess fluid and improve heart function. We would also discuss dietary modifications, such as reducing your sodium intake, and closely monitor your weight and symptoms. Hospitalization might be necessary if your symptoms are severe or don't improve with outpatient treatment, but we will do everything we can to manage your condition at home first. I understand your concerns about being lonely in the hospital, and we will certainly take that into consideration when making any decisions. Now, do you have any questions about the tests themselves, or how to prepare for them?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Just… how long will it take to get the results? And… will someone call me when they’re ready, or will I have to call you? I’m not very good with all the… phone systems, you know. My granddaughter usually helps with that, but she’s busy with school.
DOCTOR: The results typically take 24 to 48 hours to come back, Ms. Sadhu. And, please don't worry about the phone systems. My office will call you directly with the results. We will ensure that a member of the nursing staff is available to explain everything clearly and answer any questions you may have. They will also schedule a follow-up appointment with me to discuss the findings and develop a treatment plan. You do not need to worry about calling the office yourself, and we will make sure everything is explained in a way that is easy to understand. Does that alleviate your concerns?
PATIENT: Yes, that does. That’s very kind of you, Doctor. Knowing someone will call me… that makes me feel much better. And explaining it all clearly… I appreciate that. My granddaughter always speaks so fast, with all the medical terms, it goes right over my head. Alright, then. I guess I'll just wait for the phone call. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with an old woman like me.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Sadhu. It is my pleasure. Please, do not hesitate to reach out if you experience any worsening symptoms—increased shortness of breath, swelling in your ankles, or any new concerns—before we receive the test results. The nursing staff is always available to answer your questions. Now, do you have any difficulty ambulating, or shall I call someone to assist you to your car?
PATIENT: No, thank you, Doctor. I can manage. I walk a little slow, but I'm alright. Just… maybe I'll take a little rest when I get home. I appreciate you asking, though. Alright, then. I'll see you when you have the results. Thank you again for everything.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Sadhu. Please, take care of yourself, and rest well. My office will be in touch shortly. .
