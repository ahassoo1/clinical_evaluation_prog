DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Though I confess, I’d rather not be here. Workplace… difficulties, shall we say. A great deal of inefficiency, frankly. And young people… they simply don’t understand the value of a properly cataloged Dewey Decimal system anymore. Can we get this over with quickly? I have papers to grade.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. We’ll certainly try to be efficient. But to help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about these “workplace difficulties”?
PATIENT: It's… overwhelming. The library, it's not what it used to be. Students using computers for everything! No respect for books. And my colleagues… well, they're not as dedicated as I was. Constant chatter, rearranging things… it disrupts the order. Honestly, it's exhausting trying to maintain standards. I used to have a very efficient system, you see. Very efficient.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you're feeling quite stressed and frustrated with the changes at work. Has this been going on for a long time, or is this a recent development?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… years, I suppose. A gradual decline. It started with the internet, really. Then they started hiring… people who hadn't the slightest grasp of proper archival techniques. It’s a disgrace, truly. I don’t keep track of dates anymore. Everything blurs together when one is constantly battling incompetence.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds incredibly disheartening to see standards slip like that. Aside from the frustration, Mr. Schlatterer, have you noticed any changes in how you're feeling physically?
PATIENT: Physically? What do you mean? I’m an academic. We live on coffee and principle. A bit tired, perhaps. And my stomach… occasionally unsettled. Though that could be the cafeteria food. Dreadful stuff. Honestly, I mostly just feel… worn out. But that’s to be expected, isn’t it? When one is surrounded by… mediocrity.
DOCTOR: Okay. Fatigue and some stomach discomfort. Has the stomach discomfort been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes, mostly. Worse after lunch, naturally. The cafeteria… I told you. It’s… unsettling. Not a proper meal, you understand. Just… substances. And it tends to… flare up when I have to deal with particularly egregious examples of misfiling. It’s… a nervous reaction, I suspect. Though I’ve never bothered with doctors much. A waste of time, usually.
DOCTOR: I see. So it seems to be related to stress and possibly the food at the cafeteria. Have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Not really. Perhaps a bit… distracted. I forget things more easily now. Names, mostly. Though that’s probably just age. I’m 87, you know. Things… fade. It’s perfectly natural. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I have a stack of essays to review, and frankly, they’re not going to grade themselves.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer. It's good you mentioned the forgetfulness. While it’s common with age, it's worth noting. Just to get a better overall picture, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? No. I eat. Weight? I haven’t the faintest idea. I don't weigh myself. Honestly, doctor, these questions are… superfluous. I’m a scholar, not a… specimen. Are we finished yet? I assure you, my condition is simply a matter of dealing with a profound lack of intellectual rigor in the younger generation.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything else that might be contributing to how you’re feeling. I'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. It won't take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Really? Must we? I assure you, I am perfectly healthy, despite the… ordeal I’m subjected to at the library. Very well. But make it quick. And please, no unnecessary prodding. I haven’t the time for this.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Schlatterer. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. If you could just sit here for me... Okay, your blood pressure is 148 over 85. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Pulse is 72, regular. Heart sounds are normal, a slight crackling in the bases of the lungs on both sides, could be from a mild congestion. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Everything seems generally okay, though we should investigate the slightly elevated blood pressure and the crackling in your lungs.
PATIENT: Crackling in the lungs? Probably just the dust from those… modern novels they keep acquiring. And elevated blood pressure? I find dealing with incompetence quite stressful, naturally. Look, Doctor, I appreciate your… thoroughness, but I fail to see what any of this accomplishes. I suggest a strong cup of coffee and perhaps a more rigorous curriculum for the students. That, I assure you, would be a far more effective remedy than any medication. Are we finally finished?
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Mr. Schlatterer. However, it’s always best to rule out any underlying medical causes, even if stress seems to be the primary factor. To be on the safe side, I'd like to order a few basic blood tests – a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of your lungs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? A chest X-ray? Are you serious? I’ve lived a long and productive life, thank you very much. I assure you, my lungs are perfectly capable. And the thought of subjecting myself to further indignity… It’s preposterous! No. Absolutely not. I came here because I was told to come here. Now I know that was a mistake. I will stick to my coffee, thank you. And perhaps I’ll submit a formal complaint about the… unnecessary procedures. Good day, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Schlatterer. I respect your decision. However, I do strongly recommend reconsidering, even if just for peace of mind. Please, take care of yourself, and if you experience any worsening symptoms – shortness of breath, chest pain, or significant fatigue – please don't hesitate to seek medical attention. Have a good day, sir.
