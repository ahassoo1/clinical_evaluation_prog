DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. My name is Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Pirl, you say? That’s a nice name. Hmm… what brings me in… now let me think. It’s this cough. Been… a while now. A dry cough, mostly. Just… keeps tickling my throat, you know? Doesn’t bring anything up, just… bothersome. Been bothering me for… well, I can’t rightly say how long. A good while, though.
DOCTOR: Yes, a cough. I understand. A dry cough, you said, not producing any mucus?
PATIENT: No, no mucus. Just… scratchy. Like something’s stuck, but there’s nothing to stick. It’s worse when I lay down, I think. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes. Not every night, but… often enough. I used to… well, my wife, she always had a remedy for things. But… she’s gone now. So I don’t have that anymore.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s never easy adjusting to such a loss. We'll do our best to help you feel more comfortable. So, the cough is worse when you lie down… and has it been accompanied by any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see. I get a little… tired, maybe? But I’m an old man, Doctor. Being tired comes with the territory, I suppose. A little short of breath sometimes, when I walk up the stairs. But I haven’t been doing much walking, lately. It’s hard to say what’s normal and what’s not, at my age. I don’t… I don’t remember if it was always this bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, fatigue and some shortness of breath with exertion. I understand it can be difficult to pinpoint new symptoms when things have been changing over time. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you may have?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical conditions… well, I had my gallbladder out years ago. A long time ago, I don’t remember the exact year. And the doctor told me my blood pressure was a little high once, but I don’t… I don’t think I ever took anything for it. My wife handled all the doctor stuff, mostly. She kept track of everything. I just… went along. I think I had some trouble with my knee a while back, but it mostly just aches now. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal, a history of high blood pressure, and knee pain. Thank you. And are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, not really. Not anything regularly. I take a little… a little something for sleep sometimes, if I’m really having trouble. Just… one of those nighttime things. I can’t remember the name of it. It’s… a little blue pill, I think. My neighbor, old Mrs. Henderson, she gave it to me. Said it helped her. But I don’t take it every night. Just when I really need it. And… that’s about it, I think. Honestly, Doctor, I mostly just try to take it easy these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. A blue pill for sleep occasionally. We'll need to discuss that further. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. Never really had any trouble with allergies. Maybe a little sniffly nose in the springtime, but nothing serious. My wife always said I was a pretty hardy man. Didn’t get sick much, even as a boy. I don’t think so, Doctor. No, I don’t believe I have any allergies. Unless… I think I got a little rash once, from poison ivy, when I was a kid. But that wasn’t a medication.
DOCTOR: Very well. Thank you for that information. Now, if you don’t mind, I'd like to do a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your lungs and heart, and check your oxygen levels. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Just let me know if there's anything I need to do. My lungs… they haven’t been the same since… well, never mind. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m just going to listen to your breathing, both front and back. Please take slow, deep breaths when I ask you to. Your breathing sounds a little… diminished, particularly in the lower lobes. I also hear some faint crackling sounds. Oxygen saturation is 92%, which is a little low, but not critically so. Heart rate is regular, but slightly elevated. I’ll need to get a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs, Mr. Pavlovic. I’m also going to order some blood tests to check for any signs of infection or inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Diminished, you say? Crackling? That doesn’t sound good, does it? An X-ray… and blood tests. Well, if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then yes. Whatever you recommend. I trust your judgment. I just… I hope it’s nothing too serious. I’m an old man, you know. Just let me know what happens, and what I need to do. Is there anything I need to do now? Do I need to change clothes or something?
DOCTOR: No, you don't need to change clothes. We can get the X-ray done right here in the clinic. It’s a very quick and painless procedure. The blood tests will just require a small sample of blood. We’ll get those results back within a few days. It's good that we are getting this checked out now. The diminished sounds and crackling could indicate a few different things – perhaps a mild pneumonia, some fluid buildup, or even some chronic lung changes. We need to determine the cause before we can make a plan. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a mild cough suppressant to help with your symptoms. I'll also recommend you rest as much as possible and drink plenty of fluids. Would you prefer I explain everything to your family as well?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… complicated. Pneumonia, fluid… I just want to feel better, Doctor. A cough suppressant sounds good, thank you. Rest and fluids… I can manage that. Family… well, I don’t have much family left. My daughter lives far away, in California. She’s busy with her own life. She wouldn’t want to be bothered with this. No, Doctor, you don’t need to tell anyone. Just… please, let me know what the tests say as soon as you can. I appreciate you taking care of me.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Pavlovic. We’ll get the results back to you as quickly as possible. I’m also going to schedule a follow-up appointment for next week so we can discuss the results and create a treatment plan. Does next Tuesday at 2 PM work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday at 2… hmm. Yes, that should be alright. As long as I don’t forget. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know. Perhaps my daughter could be reminded? No, never mind. I’ll try to remember. Tuesday at 2 PM. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. Is there anything else I need to know, or anything else you want to ask me?
DOCTOR: No, I believe that covers everything for today. Just remember to rest, drink plenty of fluids, and try not to overexert yourself. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Mr. Pavlovic. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood, and then we’ll get you scheduled for that chest X-ray. Do you have any questions for me before I leave?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… thank you again. It’s nice to have someone listening, you know? Tell you what, maybe I’ll start writing things down. Like appointments and… what I’m supposed to do. That might help. No, I think that’s all. You go ahead, Doctor. I’ll wait for the nurse. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Pavlovic. You take care, and I’ll see you next Tuesday at 2 PM. Don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before then. .
