DOCTOR: Good morning, Kandy. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Fazzina. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my waterworks, really. I’m having a bit of trouble… going to the bathroom. It’s not easy, if you know what I mean. It takes effort, and sometimes it doesn’t come all the way out, you see?
DOCTOR: I understand. Trouble with urination… difficulty emptying your bladder, it sounds like. Okay. And how long has this been going on, Kandy?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… it started maybe… three months ago? At first it wasn’t so bad, just a little slow to start. But the last month or so, it’s gotten… noticeable. It wakes me up at night sometimes, too, needing to go. I have to get up a couple of times.
DOCTOR: Three months, worsening over the last month, with nocturia… needing to get up at night. Okay. And can you describe the stream itself?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, it’s not like a strong, steady flow, if that makes sense. It’s more… weak. And it kind of starts and stops. It's not just rushing out, you know? It’s… dribbly, sometimes, even after I think I’m finished. Does that explain it alright?
DOCTOR: Weak stream, intermittent, dribbling after voiding… yes, that's helpful. Have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate, Kandy?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Not burning, not anything like that. It’s just… difficult. And frustrating, to be honest. It doesn’t hurt, just… inconvenient, and a bit worrying, if I’m being frank. I don't like feeling like I can't completely empty myself.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and it’s good you’re bringing this to our attention. No pain is good. Okay, let’s talk about your medical history a little bit. Do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… well, I had my gallbladder out about twenty years ago, but that was no trouble. And I’ve got a bit of arthritis in my knees, but that’s just old age, I suppose. Nothing else really. I take a little bit of something for the knees, but that's it. Oh, and I had a bout of pneumonia a few years back, but I recovered fully. Is that everything you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, cholecystectomy twenty years ago, arthritis, and a past history of pneumonia. And you said something for your knees… what medication are you taking for that, Kandy?
PATIENT: It's… hmm, let me see if I can remember the name. It's a little white pill… starts with a 'N'… No, wait… it’s Naproxen, I think. Yes, Naproxen. Two of them a day. I’ve been taking it for a few years now. It helps with the pain, mostly. Not a miracle worker, but it takes the edge off.
DOCTOR: Naproxen, two times a day. Good. Any allergies to medications, Kandy?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I used to get stung by bees when I was a little girl, but I’m grown up now and they leave me alone! Nothing medical, anyway. I'm fine with most things.
DOCTOR: No known allergies. Alright. And just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Well, my mother had high blood pressure, and my father… he had some trouble with his heart when he got older. My brother is fine, as far as I know, but we don't see each other much. Nothing really stands out, honestly. No one ever talked about… water problems, if that’s what you mean.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure in mother, heart trouble in father. No family history of urinary issues. Okay. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, Kandy?
PATIENT: No, never touched a cigarette in my life. My husband, God rest his soul, he used to smoke, but I always told him to do it outside. I always believed fresh air was important. And I’m quite proud to say I’ve never had that habit myself.
DOCTOR: That's wonderful. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, I enjoy a little glass of wine with my supper sometimes. A small glass, mind you. Nothing excessive. Red wine, usually. It’s good for the heart, they say, in moderation. I don't drink every day, maybe two or three times a week. And it’s always with food. I'm not a big drinker, honestly.
DOCTOR: Small amount of red wine, two to three times a week with meals. Okay. And finally, do you have any difficulty with constipation?
PATIENT: Oh! Now that's a question. Yes, actually. A little bit, sometimes. It’s not terrible, but I do have to… push a bit more than I used to. It’s more common when I’m travelling, I’ve noticed. And sometimes if I don't drink enough water. Is that relevant? It's not something I usually bother the doctor about, but you asked…
DOCTOR: It is relevant, Kandy. Constipation can sometimes contribute to urinary symptoms. Okay. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to get a better idea of what's going on. It will involve listening to your abdomen, and a gentle exam of your lower abdomen. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that's alright. Go ahead. I don't mind. I suppose it's best to be thorough. Just be gentle, if you would, my knees aren’t what they used to be, getting up and down is a bit of a chore.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I will be very gentle. Just take deep breaths for me, Kandy. Okay, everything sounds normal there. Now, I'm going to just gently press on your lower abdomen. Anything feel tender here?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. It doesn't hurt, just… feels normal, I suppose. A little bit of a… fullness, maybe, lower down, but nothing sharp or painful. It feels like I haven't completely emptied myself, if that makes sense. Does that sound right? I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: No, you're not a bother at all, Kandy. It's good you're describing what you're feeling. Fullness, a sensation of incomplete emptying… that’s helpful. Okay, I don’t feel any masses or anything concerning. Your abdomen is soft, but I do note a bit of distention lower down, which likely corresponds with your sensation of fullness. Alright. Based on what you've told me and the brief examination, it sounds like you might be experiencing urinary retention, possibly with some degree of constipation contributing to your symptoms. It’s important to rule out other causes, though. I'd like to order a urine test to check for infection, and a blood test to assess your kidney function. I’m also going to order a post-void residual volume test, which measures how much urine is left in your bladder after you urinate. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. A urine test and blood test, and that… residual volume thing… yes, alright. I trust your judgement. Just tell me what I need to do, and I'll do it. I don't want to delay getting this sorted if it's something serious. And, when will I get the results?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The nurse will draw the blood now, and I’ll give you a container for the urine sample. You can collect that first thing in the morning, before you have anything to eat or drink. For the post-void residual volume, you'll just urinate as normally as possible, and then the nurse will use a small scanner to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder. It doesn’t hurt at all. As for results, the blood test will take a couple of days, and the urine test should be back by tomorrow. We'll get the residual volume reading right away. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results and come up with a plan. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly good, Doctor. A follow-up next week… I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me, and explaining everything so clearly. I feel a little better knowing there’s a plan in place. And the nurse will explain everything about collecting the samples? I'm not very good with these things. I'm an old woman, you see, and sometimes I forget things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Kandy. The nurse will go over everything step-by-step and answer any questions you have. Don’t worry at all about forgetting things; that’s perfectly normal. She’ll provide you with clear instructions and make sure you feel comfortable. If you do happen to forget anything, you can always call the clinic, and we’ll be happy to help. Alright. Is there anything else I can assist you with today before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough. Just getting this sorted is a relief. Thank you again for your kindness. I’ll see the nurse now, and I’ll call if I have any trouble remembering anything.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Kandy. It was my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions at all. The nurse is just outside the door, and she'll get you set up. Have a good day, and we’ll see you next week.
PATIENT: .
