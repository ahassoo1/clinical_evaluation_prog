DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cannington. I'm Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Humph. Good morning to you. It’s about my foot. This awful sore that just won't heal. I’ve had it for… well, a good while now. It’s quite painful, you know. And it smells. Really smells. Not a pleasant thing at all, I assure you. I keep it covered, of course, but still. It’s bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, a sore on your foot that's been present for a “good while” and is painful and has an odor. Right. And you said it’s bothersome. Can you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did I first notice it… let me think. It was after I stubbed my toe, I believe. Quite a nasty stub, actually. It was last November, I think. Yes, November. Right after Thanksgiving. I was visiting my daughter in Honolulu, and I tripped over her cat. A fluffy thing, that cat. Didn’t even apologize. Anyway, it started as just a little scrape, but then it just… didn’t get better. It got worse, and worse, and worse. And now this. It’s very inconvenient, you know. I have important things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, so November after Thanksgiving, after a toe injury while visiting your daughter in Honolulu. And it started as a scrape that progressively worsened. You mentioned it’s inconvenient. Can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Inconvenient is putting it mildly! I can’t go to church as often, and my garden is suffering. As for the pain… well, it throbs. A lot. Especially at night. And when I try to walk on it, it feels like little needles are poking me. It’s not a sharp pain, exactly. More like… a deep, burning ache. And it makes my leg feel tired. Very tired. I used to be able to walk for miles, you know. Miles! Now… well, now I mostly sit. It's dreadful.
DOCTOR: Throbbing, especially at night, and a burning ache with needle-like sensations when you walk. And it’s causing fatigue in your leg. Okay. And have you noticed any redness, swelling, or pus draining from the sore?
PATIENT: Pus? Oh, goodness, yes. There is some drainage. It’s… yellowish, and it smells, of course. That's why I said it smelled! And it does get red around the edges sometimes. Not all the time, but it does get quite red and puffy. It looks… unsightly, really. I’ve been trying to keep it clean, but it’s difficult. Everything seems to stick to it. I've tried all sorts of bandages, you know. The expensive ones, even. They don't seem to help much.
DOCTOR: Yellowish drainage with a foul odor and redness/puffiness around the sore. Alright. And have you had a fever, chills, or any other symptoms, like feeling generally unwell?
PATIENT: Fever? Hmm. Not a high fever, no. But I do feel a bit… run down, sometimes. Just generally tired and weak. Not my usual self, certainly. And my appetite hasn’t been very good lately. I used to enjoy my meals, you know. But now… I just don’t feel much like eating. It’s probably just old age, though. Everything starts to go when you get to be my age. Though I was very strong for a long time! A very strong woman, I assure you. But this foot… it’s just bringing me down.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, generally feeling unwell, fatigue, and loss of appetite, in addition to the sore, drainage, redness, and pain. Have you tried any treatments for this sore yourself, aside from the bandages?
PATIENT: Treatments? Well, my daughter, she suggested soaking it in Epsom salts. I did that for a while, but it didn’t seem to do much good. It just made the water smell worse. And I put some antibiotic ointment on it, the over-the-counter kind. But that didn’t help either. Really, nothing seems to help. I keep it covered, of course, to protect it, but it just keeps getting worse and worse. Honestly, doctor, I’m starting to think it’s never going to heal. It’s very discouraging, you know. Very discouraging indeed.
DOCTOR: Alright. Epsom salt soaks and over-the-counter antibiotic ointment, with no improvement. Okay. Let’s take a look at the foot itself. Could you please remove your shoe and sock?
PATIENT: Oh. Well. I suppose I must. It’s not a pretty sight, you know. I hope you don’t mind. It’s… quite bad. I haven’t wanted anyone to look at it, really. But if you must. It’s difficult to bend over these days, you know. My back isn’t what it used to be. And these shoes… they’re a bit tight. But I like them. They’re comfortable, usually. There. Be warned, doctor. It’s not a lovely sight at all.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, this is… quite involved. There’s significant tissue breakdown, and a considerable amount of purulent drainage. I’m going to verbalize my findings for the chart: "Examination reveals a heavily draining wound on the dorsal aspect of the foot, with extensive erythema and edema extending approximately 3 centimeters from the wound edge. There is significant tissue necrosis present, and a foul odor is noted. Palpation elicits significant pain." Based on what you’ve told me and my examination, it appears you likely have a complicated infection of the foot. This isn't something we can treat with over-the-counter remedies. I suspect this may be osteomyelitis – a bone infection – or a severe soft tissue infection. We need to get some cultures to determine the specific bacteria causing the infection. We’ll also need an X-ray to assess for bone involvement.
PATIENT: Osteo… what now? A bone infection? Oh, dear. That sounds dreadful. Really dreadful. Cultures and X-rays… Are you going to have to… cut it off? Is that what you’re saying? Because I’ve heard stories, you know. About people losing their feet. I need this foot! How will I walk to church? How will I tend my garden? This is terrible. Just terrible. I don’t want to lose my foot, doctor. I absolutely do not want to lose my foot.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Cannington, I am not saying we’re going to cut it off. Not at all. We need to gather more information before we discuss any drastic measures. The cultures will tell us what kind of bacteria are causing the infection, and the X-ray will show us if it’s affected the bone. Then we can determine the best course of treatment. This could involve a prolonged course of antibiotics, potentially IV antibiotics, and frequent wound care. It’s likely to be a long process, but we will do everything we can to avoid amputation. However, I need to be very clear. A severe infection like this can lead to amputation if left untreated, or if it doesn’t respond to treatment. It’s important to understand the potential risks. For now, we're going to focus on getting those cultures and X-ray done. I’m going to order them now. Do you have any allergies to antibiotics that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so. My daughter gave me some antibiotics for a sore throat a few years back, and I didn’t have any problems. But… oh! Wait. When I was a little girl, my grandmother gave me some sort of… herbal remedy. And it made me terribly itchy. All over! But that wasn’t an antibiotic, was it? It was some sort of… root, I think. And it was a long time ago. Probably doesn’t matter now, does it? I was just a child. But I don’t want to be itchy! I can’t stand being itchy. But no, I don’t think I’m allergic to any real medicine. Just that root, a long time ago. It was dreadful, though. Absolutely dreadful.
DOCTOR: Alright, so possible reaction to an herbal remedy as a child, but no known antibiotic allergies. Good. We'll still proceed with caution, of course. I’m going to order a complete blood count – that will check for signs of infection in your system – as well as the wound cultures and the X-ray. The lab will need a sample of the drainage from the wound. I’ll have the nurse come in and get that for you. In the meantime, it’s very important that you keep the wound clean and covered. Avoid putting any over-the-counter ointments or creams on it. Also, try to avoid putting any weight on the foot as much as possible. Do you have someone who can help you with this at home?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My daughter, Leilani. She’s very helpful. She visits me often. She can help me keep it clean, I suppose. Though she doesn't understand how important gardening is. She thinks it’s silly, all that dirt. But she’s a good girl, really. She worries too much, though. Always telling me what to do. But she can help with the cleaning, yes. She’s a nurse, you know. A real nurse. Not just some… assistant. She works at the hospital in Honolulu. A very important hospital. Though she prefers the fancy city to my quiet village. But she can help, yes. She always does. As long as it doesn’t interfere with her… social life.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s helpful to know. Once we have the lab results, we'll determine the best course of treatment. I’m going to write a prescription for a strong oral antibiotic to start in the meantime, while we await the culture results. It’s a broad-spectrum antibiotic, so it should cover most common infections. It's important you take it exactly as prescribed, even if you start to feel better. The nurse will also show you how to properly care for the wound and change the dressing. She’ll give you instructions on what to watch for – increasing redness, swelling, pain, fever, or drainage. If you notice any of those symptoms, you need to contact me immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Questions? Hmm. Well… how long will this take? This whole… process? I have a garden club meeting next month. And Leilani is planning a luau. I don’t want to miss those. And will this antibiotic make me… sleepy? I like to read in the evenings. And what if it doesn't work? Will I really have to… lose my foot? Oh dear. This is all very upsetting. It's dreadful, really. Absolutely dreadful. I just want to be able to walk to church again. And tend my garden. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Okay, let's address your questions one at a time. How long this will take… it’s difficult to say. It depends on the severity of the infection and how quickly you respond to the antibiotic. It could be several weeks, even months, of treatment. As for the luau and garden club meeting, we'll do everything we can to get you back on your feet in time, but I can't make any promises. The antibiotic can cause some drowsiness in some people, but it's not common. If you do feel sleepy, you can try taking it at bedtime. As for losing your foot… that’s the least likely outcome if we treat the infection promptly and effectively. I want to be very clear: we are doing everything we can to avoid that. However, it is a potential complication, and it's important to be aware of it. The nurse will go over all of this with you in more detail. She’ll also give you a handout with instructions on wound care and signs of infection. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes. I think so. It’s just… a lot to take in. Several weeks, even months. And the possibility of… losing my foot. Oh dear. Leilani will be upset. She worries so much. And I'll miss my garden club meeting. We're making rose water this year. It's very important. Will this hurt? The antibiotics, I mean. And the nurse… will she be gentle? I don’t like pain, you know. Not at all. It’s dreadful, really. Absolutely dreadful. And will it smell? Even with all the cleaning? Oh dear. This is all so upsetting. Absolutely upsetting.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Cannington, let’s address these concerns. The antibiotics themselves shouldn’t hurt. You might experience some mild side effects, like nausea or diarrhea, but those are usually temporary. As for the nurse, she is very gentle and experienced. She will explain everything she’s doing before she does it, and she will do her best to make you comfortable. And as for the smell… yes, it’s likely there will still be some odor, even with cleaning. But we will do everything we can to minimize it. We can provide you with special dressings that help control the odor. We’re doing everything we can to make this as comfortable as possible for you, and I want you to feel like you can talk to me about any concerns you have. The nurse will be in shortly to get a sample of the drainage and go over everything with you in more detail. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. For now. I just… I hope Leilani comes soon. And I hope this doesn’t take too long. Oh dear. I just want to be able to walk to church again. And tend my garden. Is that too much to ask? You’ll do everything you can, won’t you?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Cannington. I promise you, I will do everything I can. We will work together to get you back on your feet. And Leilani should be here shortly. Just try to relax, and we'll take things one step at a time. I’ll let the nurse know you’re ready. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
PATIENT: .
