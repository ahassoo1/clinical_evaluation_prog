DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Rover. I'm Dr. Cumper. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Mornin' Doc. Uh… somethin' about… insurance? My daughter, she set this up. Said it was important. I… don't rightly recall all the details, to be honest. It's about… gettin' help later on, I think? Long-term, she said.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here a preventative care appointment scheduled by your daughter. She’s very proactive, that’s good. It looks like she was concerned about establishing a baseline for future health needs. So, just to clarify, you weren’t experiencing any specific symptoms or issues when she booked this?
PATIENT: No, no symptoms. Not really. I feel… alright. Old, maybe. But old comes with the territory, right? I just… get tired easier these days. And my memory ain't what it used to be, but whose is at my age? She just wanted to make sure everything was… covered. For when I need somethin', I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. So, preventative care, establishing a baseline, and addressing some general concerns about fatigue and memory. Let’s go through a quick review of your medical history, just to be thorough. Have you been seeing a primary care physician regularly?
PATIENT: Regularly… hmm. Not… consistently, no. There was Doc Hanson, back in Kodiak. But that was… a long time ago. I mostly just… dealt with things as they came up. A little ache here, a little pain there. Never anything serious enough to keep me from work. Work keeps a man busy, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay. And what kind of work do you do, Mr. Rover?
PATIENT: I… move things. Freight, mostly. Stock. Whatever needs movin', I move it. Been doin' it a long time. Down at the docks, mostly. Hand work. Not fancy.
DOCTOR: Physical work, that’s good to know. Alright. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Let me see… I think… when I was a young man, I broke my arm fallin' off a boat. They set it, I think. But that was so long ago… and I don't rightly recall much about it. Just remember a lot of pain and bein' stuck inside for a while. Nothin' else major, I don't think.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fractured arm as a young man. And no other surgeries that you recall. Now, how about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… That’s… a tough one, Doc. My wife… she passed a few years back. And most of my family… they were out on the islands. Not a lot of record keepin' back then, if you know what I mean. Folks just… lived and died. Hard lives. I know my mother, she had… trouble with her heart, I think. But that’s all I really remember. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's common for records to be sparse. Heart trouble in your mother is good to know. Alright, let’s talk about allergies and medications. Do you have any known allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Not that I know of. I can eat most things. Never had a reaction to anythin'. My wife, she was always careful about what I ate, made sure I didn't get nothin' bad. I never really needed to worry about it. Still don't, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just… somethin' for my joints, sometimes. When they're achin' real bad. It's… ibuprofen, I think? The white pills. I get 'em at the store. Not every day, just when I need 'em. And… a little somethin' to help me sleep now and then. But it don't really do much.
DOCTOR: Okay, ibuprofen as needed for joint pain, and something for sleep that isn't very effective. Alright, Mr. Rover, let's do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline as your daughter requested. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Sounds good, Doc. Whatever you need. I ain’t afraid of a little look-see. Just try not to poke too hard, alright? My joints are a bit sensitive today.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rover. I’ll be gentle. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. ...Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 78. A little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes… … reflexes are normal. Strength appears good in all extremities. … Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Now, let’s take a look at your ears, nose, and throat… … Ears look clear. Nose is unremarkable. Throat is clear, no swelling or redness. Overall, everything appears normal, but your blood pressure is a bit high, and we'll need to monitor that.
PATIENT: A bit high, huh? Well, I get a little worked up sometimes. Worryin' about things. My daughter always tells me to slow down. She's a good girl. So... everything else lookin' alright? Like I ain't fallin' apart just yet?
DOCTOR: You don't seem to be falling apart, Mr. Rover. Everything else appears within normal limits for your age. The elevated blood pressure is something we should keep an eye on, though. It could be related to stress, as you mentioned, but it’s also important to rule out any underlying causes. We can start with some lifestyle modifications – diet, exercise, stress reduction – and monitor your blood pressure at home. I’ll give you some instructions on how to do that. Do you have a blood pressure cuff at home?
PATIENT: No, I don't. My wife, she took care of all that stuff. She had a machine for checkin' everything. But… after she passed, I just… didn't bother. Too many reminders, I guess. I mostly just try not to think about it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Rover. Losing a spouse is incredibly difficult. Alright, we can get you set up with a blood pressure cuff. I’ll write you a prescription for one, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to discuss your readings. In the meantime, let’s talk about your fatigue. You mentioned getting tired easier. Has this been a gradual change, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: It's been… slow, I think. A little more tired each year. Used to be able to work all day, no problem. Now, I need a nap in the afternoon just to get through. And sometimes, I just… don't have the energy to do anything. It's frustratin', you know? Used to be a busy man. Always somethin' to do. Now… not so much.
DOCTOR: Okay. And has anything changed in your daily routine recently?
PATIENT: Not really. Same old stuff. Get up, eat breakfast, maybe go down to the docks if they need a hand. Come home, watch a little TV, go to bed. I used to go fishin' more, but… it's hard to get out there by myself now. Used to love fishin' with my wife. She was a good fisherwoman.
DOCTOR: I understand. Okay. And are you having any trouble sleeping, besides the occasional use of something that doesn’t seem to be working?
PATIENT: Yeah, a bit. I wake up a lot during the night. Sometimes I can get back to sleep, sometimes I just… lay there thinkin'. About… things. My wife, mostly. Or worryin' about the future. It’s just… hard to quiet my mind, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, trouble sleeping, waking up during the night, and difficulty quieting your mind. That could be contributing to the fatigue. We can discuss some strategies for improving your sleep hygiene – things like establishing a regular bedtime routine, creating a relaxing sleep environment, avoiding caffeine and alcohol before bed. We might also consider some screening for depression or anxiety, as those can also cause fatigue and sleep disturbances. Would you be open to answering a few questions about your mood?
PATIENT: Uh… I don’t know. I ain’t really one for talkin’ about feelings. Always been a pretty private fella. But… I guess it couldn’t hurt. If it might help me sleep, maybe. Just… go easy on me, alright? I ain’t used to this sort of thing.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Rover. I completely understand. We’ll take it slow, and you can stop at any time. It’s just a few simple questions to get a better understanding of how you’re feeling. First, over the past two weeks, have you been feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?
PATIENT: Hopeless… sometimes. Not all the time, but… yeah. When I think about my wife… and how things used to be… it gets to me. It's just… different now. Everything's different.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you lost interest or pleasure in doing things you used to enjoy?
PATIENT: Yeah… I don’t really enjoy much these days. Used to love fishin’, like I said. And workin’. Just bein’ busy. Now… it all feels kinda… empty. I do it ‘cause I gotta, not ‘cause I want to.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Rover. Based on your responses, it sounds like you may be experiencing some symptoms of depression. It's important to remember that depression is a common condition, and it's treatable. We can explore some options, such as talking to a therapist, or considering medication to help improve your mood. Would you be open to discussing these options further?
PATIENT: Therapy… I don’t know… I ain’t really one for talkin’ to strangers about my problems. Seems kinda… silly. But… if it might help me sleep, and get my energy back… maybe. But I don't want nothin' too strong. I don’t want to feel like a different person.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your hesitation, Mr. Rover. It's perfectly normal to feel that way. We can start with a low dose of medication, and see how you respond. And we can also explore some non-medication options, such as mindfulness exercises, or joining a support group. The goal is to help you feel like yourself again, just with a little more energy and a better mood. I'm going to write you a prescription for a low dose antidepressant, and I'll also give you some information about local therapists and support groups. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to discuss how you’re doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright… that sounds… okay. A low dose, like you said. And I'll look at the information about the therapists. Maybe. No promises. Just… I want to feel better, Doc. I just want to feel like myself again.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Rover. That’s a perfectly reasonable goal, and we’ll work together to achieve it. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a blood pressure cuff, and I’ve given you information about local support groups and therapists. We’ve also discussed some lifestyle modifications to improve sleep. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: Uh… no, I think that’s all for now, Doc. You’ve given me a lot to think about. Thank you. I appreciate you listenin’ to me. It's been… a long time since I talked about any of this.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Rover. It was my pleasure. Remember, I'm here to help, so don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll see you in a month. Have a good day, and try to get some rest. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doc. You too. .
