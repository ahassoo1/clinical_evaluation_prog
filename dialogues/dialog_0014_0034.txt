DOCTOR: Alright, Emileigh, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um, hi. It's... well, my husband and I just moved here. I think this is, like, a check-up? He said I needed to come get things set up with a doctor since we're new. I don't really... remember all the details. Sorry. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Okay, a general check-up. That’s... fine. Moving is stressful, I suppose it’s easy to forget things. Right. So, you’re twenty-one, and newly arrived… anything in particular you've been feeling off about?
PATIENT: Um... not really? I mean, I get tired sometimes, but... doesn't everyone? I work with machines all day, so my back kinda hurts, but that’s just from bending and stuff. Nothing major, I don't think. My husband was worried, but... he worries about everything. Sorry. Is this helpful?
DOCTOR: Tiredness and back pain… vaguely helpful. It’s good your husband is attentive, even if… overly cautious. Let's try to be a bit more specific. When you say tiredness… is this new, or has this been ongoing?
PATIENT: Umm... I think it's kinda new? Maybe the last few months? It's hard to say, to be honest. I don't really... keep track of things like that. It's just... harder to get going in the morning, I guess? And I feel kinda sleepy in the afternoons, but... I just thought it was from working. Sorry, I'm not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: Okay, "harder to get going" and afternoon sleepiness... and you work with machines, bending a lot. Let's talk about this back pain for a moment. Where exactly is the pain?
PATIENT: Umm... it's mostly in my lower back. Like... right at the bottom of my spine? And sometimes it goes down my legs a little bit. Not all the way, just kinda... in my hips. It's worse after I've been working for a long time, but it kinda aches all day. Sorry, is that clear? I'm trying to remember what it feels like.
DOCTOR: Lower back, radiating into the hips… worse with prolonged work. Alright. And is there anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Umm... when I sit down and rest it feels a little bit better? And... sometimes if I take a warm bath. My husband gets mad at me 'cause I take long baths, but... it helps. Sorry, he just says I should be doing other things. It doesn’t go away completely, but... it feels a little bit better.
DOCTOR: Right. Warm bath provides some relief. Do you have any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Umm... sometimes? Like, not all the time. Just kinda... a funny feeling? In my toes, I think. Mostly at the end of the day. It's hard to explain. It doesn’t hurt, it just... feels weird. Like they’re falling asleep? Sorry, is that making sense? I don't know what it feels like normally.
DOCTOR: "Funny feeling," numbness… Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just want to check your reflexes and see how your back feels. Nothing invasive, I promise. Then we'll figure out what's going on.
PATIENT: Umm... okay. That sounds... okay. I guess. I don’t like doctors very much, but... I want to make my husband happy. Just... be gentle? Sorry. I'm kinda nervous.
DOCTOR: Of course, gentle. Just lie down on the exam table for me, please. We’ll start with your back. Alright, if you could just point to where you’re feeling the most pain right now.
PATIENT: Um... right here. It kinda hurts all over, but... mostly here. And it feels kinda... tight? Sorry, is that helpful? It’s hard to describe. I just feel achy and tired all the time.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, there’s definite tenderness here, and some muscle spasm. Now, can you lift your right leg straight up like this?
PATIENT: Ow... that kinda hurts. Not really bad, just... uncomfortable? It feels tight in my back when I do that. And... my leg kinda feels weak? Sorry, I'm not very good at this. Is that what you meant?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. And your left leg?
PATIENT: Ow! That one hurts more. It really tightens my back, and... my leg feels kinda numb? Like, not completely, but... tingly and weird? Sorry. I think it’s getting worse just from doing this? I don’t wanna be a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright, stop there. That's enough for now. It sounds like we’re dealing with some nerve irritation, likely from your work. It’s probably a combination of muscle strain and… possibly some early signs of a disc issue. I don’t want to alarm you, but it’s better to be thorough. I'm going to order some imaging – an MRI of your lower back – just to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’ll also send you to physical therapy. They can teach you some exercises to strengthen your core and back muscles.
PATIENT: Oh… an MRI? That sounds… scary? And physical therapy? My husband said physical therapy is just… pain. Is it gonna hurt a lot? Sorry, I’m getting really nervous now. What if it is something really bad? I just wanted to get a check-up.
DOCTOR: Look, it's not ideal, but it's standard procedure. The MRI isn’t painful, it’s just a scan. As for physical therapy... it can be uncomfortable initially, yes, but it's necessary. It’s to help you, not to hurt you. And honestly, worrying about it won’t help either. It’s likely not “something really bad”, but we need to rule things out. I’m going to write you a referral for the MRI and physical therapy. The imaging center will call to schedule the appointment. And I’ll give you a prescription for a muscle relaxant to help with the pain in the meantime. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Um… okay. A muscle relaxant… that sounds… good. Maybe. I just… I wish it wasn’t so complicated. I just wanted to get things checked out and then… go back to work. My husband’s gonna be mad about the MRI, but… I guess I have to do it? Sorry. I just… I don’t like feeling like something’s wrong. I just wanna feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we’re trying to get you there. Try to rest as much as possible, and take the muscle relaxant as directed. And don’t push yourself at work until we get the MRI results. I’ll call you with the results as soon as I have them. Next.
