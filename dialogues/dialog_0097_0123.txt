DOCTOR: Hi Carla, welcome to the clinic. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, my skin has been so itchy lately. It's really bothering me, especially at night. It’s just… a constant irritation, you know?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Constant itching can be incredibly disruptive. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, it's all over, really. My arms, my legs, even my back. It doesn't look like anything, no rash or bumps, just…itchy. And it started, oh, maybe a month ago? I don’t know for sure, time just slips away these days. It seems worse when I get warm, like after a shower or if I’m just a little stressed.
DOCTOR: Okay, all over, no visible rash, started about a month ago, and worse with warmth or stress. That gives us a good starting point. Now, when you say "worse", can you describe how much worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, normally it's just a mild annoyance, you know? I can ignore it most of the time. But when I get hot, or if I'm worried about something… it gets intense. Like I just want to scratch it 'til it bleeds, but I try not to, of course. It keeps me up at night sometimes, that’s the worst part. It’s hard to fall asleep when you’re constantly fidgeting.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's manageable most of the time, but escalates to intense itching with heat or stress, and is impacting your sleep. That's important information. Now, let's think about other things that might be going on. Have you tried any creams or lotions to help with the itch?
PATIENT: Oh yes, I have. I used some of that Aveeno lotion, the one for sensitive skin. Didn’t really do much, to be honest. And I had a little tube of hydrocortisone cream left over from… something, I can't even remember what, but I put that on for a few days. That helped a tiny bit, but not for long, and I didn’t want to use too much of it. I try to avoid putting things on my skin if I don’t have to, you know?
DOCTOR: That’s very sensible. So Aveeno didn't provide much relief, and the hydrocortisone only helped temporarily. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions, like diabetes, kidney problems, thyroid issues, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Well, my doctor told me a few years back my cholesterol was a little high, so I try to eat healthy. And I had some trouble with my gallbladder years ago, but that was taken care of with surgery, a long time ago now. Other than that…not really. I feel pretty good for my age, all things considered. I walk every morning, you know, try to stay active. I don’t think I have any of those other things you mentioned… diabetes or… what was it, kidney problems? I don’t think so.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high cholesterol managed with diet, gallbladder surgery in the past, and generally feeling well. That's good to know. And you walk regularly, which is excellent. Now, do you take any medications regularly?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a little something for my arthritis in my hands sometimes, when it flares up. It’s just ibuprofen, over-the-counter. Nothing else. I really try to avoid taking pills if I can, you know? My mother always said the less you put in your body, the better.
DOCTOR: That's a good philosophy. Just ibuprofen as needed for arthritis. Now, let's talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat pretty much everything. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thank goodness. I do get a little sniffly sometimes in the spring, with the pollen, but that’s just a normal allergy, nothing serious. Nothing I need to carry an EpiPen for, or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, just seasonal pollen sensitivity. That’s helpful. Now, thinking about your family… does anyone else in your family have similar skin issues, like eczema or chronic itching?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. My mother, she had dry skin, always. She used a lot of lotions. And my aunt, on my father’s side, she had some sort of rash when she was a little girl, but I don't really remember what it was. It wasn’t really talked about much. I don’t think anyone else had itching like this though, just… dry skin.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of dry skin, but not specifically chronic itching. And finally, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, my social history? Well, I’m divorced, been that way for… a long time now. I live alone, but I have a lot of friends, and my children come to visit when they can. I used to volunteer at the local library, but I stopped during the pandemic and haven't really gotten back into it yet. I don't smoke, and I only have a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Pretty quiet life, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, quiet life, divorced, children visit, no smoking, occasional wine. That gives me a good understanding of your lifestyle. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam if that’s alright. I'll just take a look at your skin and listen to your heart and lungs. Do you have any pain anywhere that I should know about before I start?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just the itch, of course! But that’s all. Go ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm just taking a look now. As you said, your skin appears normal – no rash, no redness, no bumps. Your heart and lungs sound clear. I'm palpating your skin now… no swelling or tenderness. Everything feels normal to the touch. I don’t notice any enlarged lymph nodes either. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, there isn’t an obvious external cause for the itching. This makes it a little trickier, and we’ll need to consider some possible internal causes. It could be something as simple as dry skin, even though you don’t see visible signs, or it could be related to your age, or even a medication side effect, though you aren’t taking many. We should also consider the possibility of something less common, like a thyroid issue or kidney problems, even though you don’t have any other symptoms. To rule those out, I’d like to order some blood tests. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood tests… I don’t love needles, you know. But if you think it’s necessary, I suppose so. If it will help figure out what’s causing this itch, then yes, let’s do them. It's just... a little worrisome, all this talk of thyroids and kidneys.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, and I assure you, we’re doing this to get to the bottom of things and find relief for you. It's better to be thorough and rule things out. The blood tests will give us a clearer picture of what's going on internally. I’m going to order a complete blood count , a comprehensive metabolic panel which checks your kidney and liver function, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test to check your thyroid. We’ll also do a basic allergy screening, just to be safe. The lab is just down the hall. They’ll need to draw a few vials of blood. It’ll take about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back – usually in a few days – we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to moisturize your skin, even if it doesn’t seem dry. Avoid harsh soaps and detergents, and try to manage any stress you might be experiencing. Do you have any questions about the tests or the follow-up?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… a lot. CBC, CMP, TSH… I’ll try to remember all that. And avoid harsh soaps… and manage stress. Easier said than done, you know? No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. Just… when will I hear about the results? And what if something is wrong?
DOCTOR: I understand it feels like a lot, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious. The lab will usually call us with the results in 3-5 business days. My nurse will then contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them with me. As for what if something is wrong, we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. If the tests reveal an issue, we’ll discuss the best course of action – whether it's medication, lifestyle changes, or a referral to a specialist. We'll make a plan together, and I'll explain everything clearly, so you understand what’s going on and what your options are. It’s important to remember that many of these conditions are very manageable, and early detection is key. Do you want me to give you a written list of the tests and instructions for after the blood draw?
PATIENT: Oh yes, please. A written list would be wonderful. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know. And instructions for after the blood draw… just in case. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Carla. It's my job, and I want you to feel comfortable and informed. Here you are. It lists all the tests we ordered, and the instructions advise you to drink plenty of water after the draw and avoid strenuous activity for a few hours. If you experience any pain or bleeding at the site of the draw, apply pressure with a clean cloth. If it doesn’t stop, please contact the lab or your primary care physician. My nurse, Maria, will be in shortly to review the paperwork and answer any questions you might have. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your kindness. I guess I’ll just go wait for Maria then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Carla. It was a pleasure meeting you. Don’t hesitate to let Maria or me know if anything comes to mind. We’ll get to the bottom of this itch together. Have a good day, and I'll see you at your follow-up appointment.
