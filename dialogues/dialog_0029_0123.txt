DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s my skin. It’s been so itchy lately. Just driving me crazy, really. It started, oh, maybe a month ago? Hard to say exactly.
DOCTOR: Okay, itchy skin for about a month now. Can you tell me a little more about the itch?
PATIENT: Hmm…well, it’s not all over, you know? Mostly on my arms and my back. And it comes and goes. Sometimes it’s really bad, I just have to scratch, and other times it’s just…annoying. Not painful, just…itchy! It’s worse at night, I think. Makes it hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright, so mostly on your arms and back, comes and goes, worse at night, and doesn’t seem to be painful, just intensely itchy. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse, besides just time of day?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… I don’t know if anything makes it better, really. I’ve tried lotions, different soaps…nothing seems to help much. And worse… well, I’ve noticed it seems a little worse after I shower. Maybe the soap? But I’ve tried a few different kinds now. I honestly can’t pinpoint anything specific.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lotions and different soaps haven’t helped, and it seems to be aggravated by showering, though you’re not sure if that’s the cause. Do you have any known allergies – to soaps, detergents, foods, medications, anything like that?
PATIENT: You know, that’s a tricky one. I don’t think so. Nothing I’ve ever been formally tested for, anyway. I used to get a little rash when I was a kid from poison ivy, but that was a long time ago! And I’ve never had a bad reaction to any medicine, that I recall. I'm pretty good with food, too. I eat everything. I like to cook, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you said you’ve been eating normally. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, anything at all?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis, sometimes. It's naproxen, the over-the-counter kind. I don't take it every day, only when my joints are really bothering me. And I take a multivitamin, just a regular one. Nothing else, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, naproxen as needed for arthritis and a multivitamin. Let's talk about your medical history for a moment. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions besides arthritis?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me see. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been pretty well controlled with diet and exercise for years now. My doctor used to have me on medication, but we took me off it. Other than that… nothing major, really. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, I guess! I used to be very active, but it's a little harder now.
DOCTOR: Alright, so controlled high blood pressure with diet and exercise. And any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! I had my gallbladder out, oh gosh, must be twenty years ago now? And I had a hysterectomy, even longer ago than that. Other than those two, nothing. They both went well, no problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal and hysterectomy, both in the past with no complications. Now, regarding your family… is there anyone in your family with skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… my mother had really dry skin, always. She used a lot of lotion. And my aunt, on my father’s side, she had something… it wasn’t eczema, I don’t think, but she had a lot of rashes and things. She went to the doctor a lot for it. I don't think anyone else had anything specific, though. It wasn’t something we really talked about much in my family.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of dry skin and rashes. And finally, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Well, I'm divorced, been that way for a long time now. I live alone, but I have a lot of friends, thank goodness. I used to work as a political scientist, but I'm retired now. I spend a lot of time with my friends, gardening, cooking… trying to stay busy. I don't smoke, and I only drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Not much of a partier these days!
DOCTOR: Okay, so retired political scientist, active social life, no smoking, occasional glass of wine. That gives me a good overview. Now, Ms. Cassimatis, I'd like to take a look at your skin. Could you please roll up your sleeves and, if you're comfortable, turn around so I can examine your back?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Here you go, Doctor. Let me know if you need me to adjust anything. It's just…it's itchy right now, so please excuse me if I fidget.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Cassimatis. I’m seeing some small, red patches on your arms and back. They don't appear to be infected, and there’s no significant blistering or open skin. Your skin is a little dry overall. Do you feel any burning or stinging with these patches?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not burning or stinging. Just…itchy. Really, really itchy. That’s the main thing. It’s not painful, just… irritating. It’s hard to describe. It feels like… like little ants crawling on my skin, sometimes. Especially at night.
DOCTOR: Okay, an itchy sensation, sometimes described as crawling, particularly at night. Based on what you've told me and what I’m seeing, it sounds like you might be experiencing a case of pruritus, which is just the medical term for itchy skin. There are many potential causes – dry skin, allergies, even stress can play a role. Given your history, it’s unlikely to be anything serious, but we'll want to rule a few things out. I'm going to order some basic blood work to check your thyroid function and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly alright. I'd rather be safe than sorry. Blood work is fine. I just want to get this itch under control. It’s really affecting my sleep. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Okay. For the blood work, I’ll give you a requisition form to take to the lab. They’re just down the hall. In the meantime, I recommend a few things. First, try switching to a hypoallergenic, fragrance-free soap and lotion. Aveeno or Cetaphil are good brands. Second, keep your skin well-moisturized, especially after showering. And third, try to avoid scratching as much as possible – I know that’s easier said than done, but scratching can make the itch worse and lead to infection. We'll also try an over-the-counter anti-histamine at night - something like diphenhydramine or loratadine, can help with the itching and hopefully improve your sleep. If the blood work comes back normal and these measures don't provide relief after a week or two, we might consider a referral to a dermatologist. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very reasonable, Doctor. Hypoallergenic soap, moisturizer, try not to scratch… and the anti-histamine at night. I can definitely do that. Thank you. And where do I go for the blood work? Is there anything else I should know?
DOCTOR: The lab is just down the hall to your left, Room 203. They’re open until 5 pm today. Just tell them Dr. Chora sent you for routine blood work. As for anything else… try to keep a log of when the itch is at its worst – after showering, at night, after certain activities – that information could be helpful if we do need to see a dermatologist. And if you develop any fever, chills, or signs of infection around the itchy areas, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. That’s all very clear. Thank you so much for your time and for listening to me. I really appreciate it. I’ll go get the blood work done now. I hope this helps!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Cassimatis. I hope it does too. If you have any questions or concerns after the blood work, don’t hesitate to call the office. Have a good day, and I hope you get some relief soon. .
