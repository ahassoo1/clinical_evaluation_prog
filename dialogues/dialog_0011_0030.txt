DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Purtee. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to the clinic?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s a bit embarrassing, really, but I’ve noticed a change in my body odor. It's… different. Not worse, just different than it usually is. I wanted to get it checked out, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Purtee. It’s always wise to investigate a change in your body, and there's certainly no need to feel embarrassed. These things happen, and we want to ensure everything is alright. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe this difference in odor?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. It’s hard to explain. I usually just smell… like me, you know? Normal. But lately, it’s… almost a little bit sweet? And maybe a little musky? It’s not a strong smell, and like I said, not unpleasant, just… not right. I've been using the same deodorant for years, too, so I don't think it's that.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying, Ms. Purtee. That’s helpful. A sweet or musky odor, especially with a recent change, can sometimes indicate a few different things. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me when you first noticed this change?
PATIENT: Let me think… It started, oh, maybe three or four weeks ago? I noticed it after I was gardening, actually. I always smell a bit earthy after gardening, but this was different on top of the earthy smell. I thought maybe it was just the dirt, but it’s still there even after a good shower. It's been pretty consistent since then.
DOCTOR: Alright, three to four weeks, consistently present even with good hygiene. That is important information. Now, have you noticed any other changes alongside this altered body odor?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I have been a little more tired than usual. Not exhausted, just… dragging a bit. And I’ve been sweating a little more, even when I'm not doing anything strenuous. I thought it was just the heat, honestly. It’s been pretty warm lately. But maybe it's connected?
DOCTOR: That is certainly worth noting, Ms. Purtee. Increased fatigue and sweating, coupled with the change in body odor, do potentially point to a few possibilities. To help me narrow things down, let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it's been controlled with medication for about five years now. Other than that, not really. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. Oh, and I had a hysterectomy about ten years ago. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Ms. Purtee. Both the controlled hypertension and the prior hysterectomy are relevant information. And to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications, other than those for blood pressure?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril for the blood pressure, 20 milligrams a day. And I take a vitamin D supplement, because my levels were a little low last year. Just a standard over-the-counter one, about 2000 IU. That's it, I think. Nothing else.
DOCTOR: Excellent. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I’ve been pretty lucky in that regard. I can eat anything, thankfully. My grandmother used to worry about me trying all sorts of things as a kid, but I never had a reaction.
DOCTOR: Good to know, Ms. Purtee. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like diabetes, heart disease, or cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had diabetes, type 2, and my father had heart disease. He had a stroke when he was in his 70s. And my aunt on my mother's side had breast cancer, but she was a smoker, so… I’m not sure if that’s relevant. On my father’s side, nothing much that I know of. They didn’t really talk about health much.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Purtee. That is helpful information regarding your family history. And finally, could you briefly describe your typical lifestyle?
PATIENT: Sure. I work as a floor layer, so it’s pretty physical work – lots of bending and lifting. I mostly do vinyl and laminate these days, not too much carpet. I live alone, and I try to eat a pretty healthy diet – lots of vegetables and fruit. I don’t drink or smoke, and I don’t do a lot of socializing, mostly just see my daughter and grandkids occasionally. I enjoy gardening when I have the time, and I walk my dog most days. It's pretty simple, really.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Purtee. That gives me a good overall picture of your health and lifestyle. Now, to get a clearer understanding of what might be causing this change in body odor, I'd like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement, Doctor. Just let me know what I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. First, I'll listen to your heart and lungs, then I’ll take your blood pressure and temperature. After that, I’d like to briefly examine your thyroid gland, as changes in thyroid function can sometimes cause altered body odor. Finally, I’ll just do a quick general examination to check for any other obvious abnormalities. If you could please lie back on the examination table, we can get started. Your heart rate is regular and normal, and your lungs sound clear. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is well-controlled. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Your thyroid feels normal in size and consistency, with no palpable nodules. I don’t detect any enlargement or tenderness. I don’t observe any obvious skin changes or other abnormalities during the general examination. Overall, the physical exam findings are unremarkable. However, given your reported fatigue and altered body odor, along with your family history of diabetes, I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out a few possibilities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Blood tests seem sensible. I just want to know what’s going on, so whatever it takes. What kind of tests are you thinking of? Just so I have an idea.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Purtee. I'd like to order a Complete Blood Count to check for any signs of infection or anemia, a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a Hemoglobin A1c to check your average blood sugar levels over the past three months, given your family history of diabetes. Additionally, I’d like to check your thyroid stimulating hormone level, just to be certain there isn't a subtle thyroid issue contributing to your symptoms. These tests will provide us with a more comprehensive picture of your overall health and help us determine the cause of your altered body odor and fatigue. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that all sounds very thorough. All those tests sound fine to me. The more information, the better, right? Will I need to fast before these tests? And where will I have them done? Is it here at the clinic?
DOCTOR: Precisely, Ms. Purtee. The more information, the better. You will need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood tests. That means no food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. The tests can be done right here at the clinic. Our phlebotomist, Sarah, usually draws blood on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Would either of those days work for you?
PATIENT: Tuesday would be better. I have a commitment on Thursday. And is there anything else I should do to prepare? Anything specific to avoid? Or just the fasting?
DOCTOR: Just the fasting, Ms. Purtee. Please continue taking your usual medications as prescribed. There’s no need to adjust anything unless I specifically instruct you to do so. Alright, I’ll have Sarah schedule you for blood draw on Tuesday morning. The results usually take a few days to come back. Once we have them, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan, if needed. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as fever, significant weight loss, or severe fatigue – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think you’ve covered everything. Thank you very much, Doctor Neppl. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me and being so thorough. I feel much better knowing we’re getting this checked out. Tuesday sounds good. I’ll make sure to fast.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Purtee. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance. It’s always best to investigate new symptoms, and you’re doing the right thing by getting this checked out. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment on Tuesday. Have a pleasant day, Ms. Purtee. I look forward to seeing you then.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. And thank you again for your help. Goodbye.
