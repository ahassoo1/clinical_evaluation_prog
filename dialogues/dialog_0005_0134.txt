DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I'm Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It's…well, it’s been a bit of a struggle lately. I get sick to my stomach a lot, even if I don't eat much. And I just…don’t feel hungry, you know? I get full awful quick. It’s just not right. I don't rightly remember when it started, though. Seems like a while now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay. So, nausea and early fullness… and you said it's been going on for a while. When you say "a while," can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tricky one. Let me think… Seems like after… after Harold passed, maybe? Or was it before? Everything's a bit muddled, bless my heart. Maybe three, four months? Could be longer, honestly. It’s hard to keep track these days. I mostly just try to take things one day at a time, you know?
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. It's perfectly alright if you're not precise. Three or four months is a good starting point. And you mentioned it started around the time of your loss. That certainly can cause a lot of changes in appetite and how you feel. Now, besides not feeling hungry and getting sick to your stomach, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… I’ve been a little tired, I suppose. Not awful tired, just… more tired than usual. And my stomach… it just feels kinda bloated, even when it's empty. Oh, and I’ve lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser, but I haven’t been weighing myself regularly. I mostly eat what I can keep down, you know? Soup and such.
DOCTOR: Okay, bloating, some fatigue, and unintentional weight loss. And you're mainly sticking to soup… Alright. And have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re asking things I don’t really… pay much attention to, if you don’t mind me saying. Let me see… I suppose things are…regular enough. Not… different, really. Maybe a little softer than usual, sometimes. But I wouldn't say it's been a big change. I take things as they come, you know? Harold always said worrying wouldn’t fix anything.
DOCTOR: Right. Okay. And are you having any heartburn, or trouble swallowing?
PATIENT: Heartburn… hmm. Not really. Sometimes a little sour taste in my mouth, but nothing awful. And swallowing… no, that hasn't been a problem. I can eat my soup just fine, thank goodness. It's about the wanting to eat, more than the being able to, if you understand. I used to love a good pot roast… but now it just doesn’t appeal to me.
DOCTOR: Okay. No heartburn or difficulty swallowing. Just a lack of appetite and the nausea. Now, Ms. Kelder, have you noticed any blood in your stool, or any black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Oh my. Now that’s a… a scary question, Doctor. Let me think… No, I haven’t seen any blood. Not that I recall. And my…well, you know… everything's been pretty normal colored, as far as I can tell. I haven’t been looking too closely, if you don’t mind me saying. It just sounds like… something serious.
DOCTOR: It’s good you haven't seen any blood. I just have to ask these questions, you understand. It's important to rule things out. Now, are you taking any medications currently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Just the one, for my blood pressure. A little white pill. Can’t remember the name of it right now… the pharmacist keeps track of it for me, you see. And sometimes a little something for my arthritis, when it flares up. But that’s it, mostly. I try to avoid taking too many pills, if I can. Harold always said they weren't good for you.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you have any allergies to any medications or foods?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… Not that I know of, no. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat most anything, although I don’t care for oysters much. But that’s just a preference, not an allergy, you see. I used to help Harold with the garden, and we ate a lot of fresh vegetables. He always said they were good for the soul.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies. Now, Ms. Kelder, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just listening to your stomach, feeling around, that sort of thing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That's fine. Go right ahead. I don’t mind a bit. I’ve had doctors poke and prod at me my whole life, you know? It’s all part of getting old, I reckon. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you could just lie back on the examination table, that would be wonderful. First, I’ll listen to your abdomen. Just take some nice, deep breaths for me. Sounds are a bit… diminished. Not what I’d expect. There's some tenderness here, in the upper abdomen. Nothing too severe, but it's worth noting. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not alarmingly so. Everything else seems… within normal limits, for your age.
PATIENT: Oh my. Diminished sounds… that doesn’t sound good, does it? And tenderness… I do feel a bit of a ache up there sometimes. It comes and goes, mostly. Is it…serious, Doctor? I’m a bit worried now, I confess. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? I miss my garden, and cooking for folks.
DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Kelder, based on the exam and what you've told me, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. The diminished bowel sounds and tenderness could indicate a few things – gastritis, a possible ulcer, or even something more serious. Given your weight loss and lack of appetite, we can't rule anything out at this point. Now, I'm going to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a test for Helicobacter pylori, which is a bacteria that can cause stomach ulcers. I’d also like to order a stool test, to check for any bleeding. And finally, I think a CT scan of your abdomen would be prudent, just to get a better look at everything. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh my goodness. A CT scan… that sounds…involved. And bacteria… and stool tests… It’s all a bit overwhelming, Doctor. I just… I don’t want anything too scary. But if you think it’s necessary, I suppose so. I trust your judgment. I just… I’m a bit nervous, if I’m honest. Is it going to hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to keep worrying about this forever.
DOCTOR: I understand your nervousness, Ms. Kelder. It is a lot, and it's perfectly natural to feel anxious. The CT scan itself is painless. You'll lie on a table, and a machine will take images of your abdomen. It takes about 20-30 minutes. As for the blood and stool tests, those are fairly routine. The results usually take a few days to come back, sometimes longer depending on the lab. Once we have those, we can get a better idea of what's going on and formulate a plan. Now, based on the preliminary findings, I'm also going to prescribe you a medication called a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI. It helps reduce stomach acid, which can alleviate some of your symptoms while we're waiting for the test results. It's a fairly common medication. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh, a medication to help right away… that does sound good. If it can take some of the sickness away, I'm willing to try it. A proton pump… what was it again? It's hard to keep track of all the names. And you said it's common? That makes me feel a little better. I just… I'm scared it's something awful. Harold always took care of things, and I never had to worry about this sort of thing before. And a CT scan… Is it safe? I’ve heard things about radiation…
DOCTOR: Yes, a proton pump inhibitor, or PPI. It's a medication that reduces the amount of acid your stomach produces. Think of it as helping to calm things down in there. It's very common, and generally well-tolerated. And I understand your concerns about the CT scan. It does involve a small amount of radiation, but the benefit of getting a clear diagnosis far outweighs the risk in this case. The dose of radiation is minimal, and the technicians will take all necessary precautions to minimize your exposure. Now, I'm going to write you a prescription for the PPI, and I'll give you a referral to the imaging center for the CT scan. They'll call you to schedule an appointment. And we'll schedule a follow-up appointment here in about a week to discuss the results. In the meantime, if you experience any severe abdominal pain, vomiting, or blood in your stool, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. That sounds… organized. A plan is good. Harold always said a good plan was half the battle. And I’ll remember the emergency room part. Thank you, Doctor. You've explained everything so clearly. It still scares me a little, but I feel… less lost, if that makes sense. And you’ll call me if the tests show something awful? I don't want to wait a whole week to find out…
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Kelder, that makes perfect sense. And yes, absolutely. If the tests reveal anything concerning, my office will call you immediately – not just to schedule a follow-up, but to discuss the findings with you directly. I wouldn't leave you waiting. Here are the prescription and referral. The imaging center should call within a few business days to schedule your CT scan. And please, don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns at all. We're here to help. Get some rest, Ms. Kelder. And try not to worry too much. We'll get to the bottom of this. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That means a lot. No, I don’t think so. Just… thank you again for being so patient. It's hard getting old, you know? I think I’ll just go home and take a nap. Maybe I’ll see if I can get some soup made… if I feel up to it. You have a good day now, Doctor Donate.
DOCTOR: You as well, Ms. Kelder. Take care of yourself, and get some rest. And don't hesitate to call if you need anything at all. .
