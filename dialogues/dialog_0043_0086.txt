DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Kovtun. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Right, yeah, hi Doctor. Results discussion, like the email said. I'm Kahrin, by the way. Just want to know what those tests showed, if that's okay. I don't really have time for a long chat, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Kovtun. I completely understand. We can certainly focus on the results. I have them pulled up here. Before we dive in, just to confirm, you are Kahrin Kovtun, age 29?
PATIENT: Yep, that’s me. August 2nd, 2025, right? Just making sure we’re on the same page. Let's just get to it, please.
DOCTOR: Yes, August 2nd, 2025. Excellent attention to detail, Ms. Kovtun. I appreciate that. Alright, let's review the results from your recent blood work and urine analysis. As you know, these tests were ordered to investigate some concerns regarding fatigue and frequent urination, as you mentioned in your initial phone screening. Do you recall anything specific that prompted those initial concerns, or any changes in your symptoms since then?
PATIENT: Honestly? Not really. I just... get tired a lot. And yeah, I pee a lot. It's always been that way, I think. No big changes, no. I just figured it was normal, you know? I really don't remember when it started being a problem, if it ever really was. Is something wrong? Can we just skip to the bottom line?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Kovtun, and I will do my best to be concise. However, it's important to understand the context of the results, even if there haven’t been recent changes. Let me lay out the findings. Your blood glucose levels were slightly elevated on two separate tests, and your urine analysis showed the presence of glucose as well. These results are suggestive of possible pre-diabetes or early-stage diabetes. However, a single set of results isn't always definitive. To clarify, have you experienced any increased thirst, unexplained weight loss, blurred vision, or frequent infections – perhaps skin infections or urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Okay, pre-diabetes... great. No, no increased thirst, definitely not losing weight—I wish! And my vision's fine. I get the occasional bladder infection, but that’s just… life, right? Happens sometimes. Look, I’m a logistician, I deal with problems and solutions. Is this fixable? What do I need to do? Pills? Diet? What's the plan?
DOCTOR: You’re very proactive, Ms. Kovtun, and that’s excellent. Yes, pre-diabetes is often very manageable, and in many cases, reversible with lifestyle changes. Pills aren’t necessarily the first step. The plan focuses on diet and exercise. Specifically, we want to aim for a diet lower in refined carbohydrates and sugars, focusing on whole grains, lean proteins, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. Regular physical activity—at least 30 minutes most days of the week—is also crucial. Before we jump into specifics, do you have any known dietary restrictions or allergies?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothing I can't eat. I mean, I don't love vegetables, but I can manage. And I walk a lot, my job requires it. Lots of running around warehouses. So exercise isn't a problem. Is that… it? Just eat better and walk more? Seems… easy. Will that really make a difference?
DOCTOR: It may seem straightforward, Ms. Kovtun, but consistency is key. And yes, those changes can absolutely make a significant difference. We'll need to monitor your blood glucose levels to track your progress. To get a baseline, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam – just checking your blood pressure, pulse, and a basic neurological assessment. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Quick is good. As long as it doesn’t take long. Blood pressure and pulse are fine. What does neurological have to do with… nevermind. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The neurological assessment is simply a routine check to ensure there aren't any underlying nerve issues that could contribute to your symptoms or be affected by changes in blood sugar levels. It's a standard part of a comprehensive evaluation. First, let’s take your blood pressure. 130/80. That's slightly elevated, but not concerning at the moment. Now, let's check your pulse. 72 and regular. Good. Now, I'm going to test your reflexes and briefly assess your sensation in your feet and hands. Just tell me if you feel anything different or unusual. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. Just don't poke me too hard. I have things to do. Go ahead. Quick, though, please.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as gentle as possible. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m going to lightly touch your feet with this cotton swab to check your sensation. Please tell me when you feel it. And how about here?
PATIENT: Yeah, I feel that. And… yeah, there too. It's… normal, right? I feel things normally. Look, Doctor, are we almost done? I really need to get back to work. There's a shipment arriving at 2 and I need to coordinate everything. This is taking way too long.
DOCTOR: Yes, everything appears normal so far, Ms. Kovtun. Your sensation is intact. Alright, the physical exam didn’t reveal anything particularly concerning. Based on your symptoms, blood work results, and the exam, my assessment is pre-diabetes. To confirm this diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, I’d like to order a fasting blood glucose test and a hemoglobin A1c test. This will give us a more comprehensive picture of your average blood sugar levels over the past three months. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Fine. Tests. Whatever. Can I schedule them now and get this over with? Honestly, this is cutting into my work day. And how much is this all going to cost? I don't have insurance, you know.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Ms. Kovtun. I'll schedule those tests for you right away. We can do them here at the clinic tomorrow morning, if that works. Let me see… the fasting blood glucose test will be $30, and the A1c test is $75. So, a total of $105. I understand that can be a significant expense without insurance. We do have a payment plan option if that’s something you’d like to discuss. In the meantime, while we wait for the results, I’d like to provide you with some resources on managing pre-diabetes through diet and exercise. This includes a sample meal plan and a list of recommended physical activities. Would you be open to receiving those materials?
PATIENT: $105… okay, that’s manageable. Yeah, schedule the tests for tomorrow. As early as possible, please. And the materials, sure, I guess. Can you just email them? I don't have time to sit here and read everything now. Look, is there anything else? Really? Because I seriously need to go.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Tests are scheduled for 8:00 AM tomorrow. I’ll email you the resources on managing pre-diabetes right away. To summarize, we’ve discussed your symptoms, reviewed your initial test results, performed a physical exam, and scheduled further testing to confirm the diagnosis of pre-diabetes. Before you go, do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think that's it. Just… get the tests done, tell me what to do, and I’ll try to fix it. Thanks. I really need to get back to work now.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kovtun. I understand. I’ll have the results sent to you as soon as they are available. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. Thank you for coming in today. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to helping you manage your health. .
