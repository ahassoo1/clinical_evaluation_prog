DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. I'm Dr. Annesley. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Oh, well... it’s my hands, mostly. They’ve been… tingling. Like pins and needles, you know? It’s been going on for a little while now, and it’s starting to bother me when I’m sorting the mail. I just want to get it figured out if that’s alright, I have a lot to do today.
DOCTOR: Okay, tingling in your hands, and it’s interfering with tasks like sorting mail. I understand you’d like to get to the bottom of this quickly. Let's start with a little more detail. When did this tingling first start?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… It started… maybe a couple of months ago? It was just now and then at first, barely noticeable. I thought it was just from being cold, you know, carrying the mail in the winter. But it’s been happening more lately, even when it’s warmer. It's hard to say exactly when it started, my memory isn't what it used to be. But definitely in the spring, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it began a few months ago, likely in the spring, and has gradually worsened. Does it happen in both hands, or just one?
PATIENT: It’s both hands, yeah. Not at the same time, usually. One will start tingling, then maybe a day or two later the other one will. Sometimes they both feel a bit… numb, but not often. It’s mostly the tingling. It’s a strange feeling. And it’s worse when I'm holding things, like… mail, obviously. Or a steering wheel.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it alternates between both hands, more often one at a time, with occasional numbness. It’s aggravated by holding things. Do you notice it at any other times?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Not when I'm resting. Or sleeping, thankfully. It's mostly when I'm doing something with my hands. Like, if I'm knitting… it's bad. I love to knit, but I haven’t been doing much of it lately because of this. It's frustrating. Is this something serious, Doctor? I really need to be able to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Uzarski, especially given that it's affecting your ability to work and enjoy your hobbies. We'll get to the bottom of this. Now, aside from the tingling, have you noticed any pain in your hands, wrists, or arms?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just the tingling. Sometimes a bit of weakness, maybe? Like, I drop things a little more easily than I used to, but I thought that was just getting old. But definitely no sharp pain or anything. Just… that pins and needles feeling, and a bit of trouble gripping sometimes. And that weakness, I suppose. Is it my arthritis? My mother had terrible arthritis in her hands.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know—no pain, just tingling, occasional weakness, and a bit of difficulty gripping. You’re understandably concerned about arthritis given your mother’s history. We'll factor that in. Now, have you noticed any swelling or redness in your hands or wrists?
PATIENT: No, no swelling or redness. They look normal, I think. I haven’t really looked closely, to be honest. I just notice the tingling. My daughter, she’s a nurse, she said I should come see a doctor, so here I am. She worries about me. I keep telling her I'm fine, just getting old. But she insisted.
DOCTOR: Alright, no swelling or redness, which is helpful. Your daughter sounds very attentive, and it’s good you came in. Let's move on to some other questions. Do you have any medical conditions like diabetes or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've never been diagnosed with anything. I go to the doctor for checkups every year, and they always say I'm healthy enough for my age. My blood pressure is a little high sometimes, but they just tell me to watch my salt intake. That's about it. I don’t take any regular medications either, except for a little something for my blood pressure when it gets really high.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions aside from occasionally elevated blood pressure, and you only take medication for that as needed. Have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve been lucky, I suppose. Just the usual childhood things, like tonsils out when I was little, but nothing major. I've always been pretty healthy. It’s just this tingling thing, and it’s really starting to worry me. I have bills to pay, you know? I can't afford to be sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, let’s talk about family history. Besides your mother’s arthritis, did any other family members have issues with their hands, nerves, or similar symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. My grandfather, on my father’s side, he used to complain about numbness in his hands, but he was a carpenter, always working with wood. I think it was just from the work, you know? And my aunt, she had carpal tunnel, I think that's what they called it. But that was a long time ago, and I don't remember much about it. She had to have an operation, but she was fine after that. Otherwise, not that I can recall.
DOCTOR: Okay, so your grandfather had hand issues related to his carpentry work, and your aunt had carpal tunnel syndrome. Now, just a couple more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. And I don't drink alcohol either. My husband… he used to enjoy a little wine with dinner, but he passed away a few years ago now. I just haven’t gotten back into the habit, I suppose. I prefer a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking or alcohol. Now, Ms. Uzarski, to get a better understanding of what’s going on, I’d like to do a quick physical exam of your hands and arms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to get this figured out, like I said. I have a lot to do today.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Ms. Uzarski, your grip strength is slightly diminished in both hands, and sensation seems a little reduced in your fingertips. Your reflexes are normal, and I don't detect any significant tenderness. There's no visible swelling or redness. Now, I'm going to ask you to close your eyes and tell me if you can feel when I touch different parts of your hands.
PATIENT: Okay, alright. This is… strange. It’s hard to explain. Some parts feel… tingly, even when you’re just touching them. Others feel a little numb. Like my pinky fingers, mostly. And the tips of my thumbs. Is that normal?
DOCTOR: That's helpful information, Ms. Uzarski. It’s not necessarily normal, but it does give us a clearer picture. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, possibly with some mild nerve compression. However, there are other possibilities, such as peripheral neuropathy, and we need to rule those out. To get a more definitive diagnosis, I'd like to order a Nerve Conduction Study and Electromyography . These tests can assess the function of the nerves in your hands and arms and help determine the cause of your symptoms. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests? Oh dear. What do those tests involve? And… will they be expensive? I don't have insurance, you know. I’m really just trying to figure out what’s going on so I can get back to work. Will it take long? I really don't have a lot of time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Uzarski. Let's address them one by one. The Nerve Conduction Study involves placing small electrodes on your skin to measure the electrical activity of the nerves in your hands and arms. It's a bit like having a mild electrical massage. It's generally not painful, but you might feel some tingling sensations. The Electromyography involves inserting a very thin needle into your muscles to assess their electrical activity. Again, it's generally not painful, but you might feel a brief discomfort, like a muscle twitch. The tests typically take about 30-60 minutes to complete. As for the cost, I realize you don’t have insurance, and I can certainly discuss options with you. Our billing department can explore potential financial assistance programs or a payment plan. I will also try to recommend a facility with lower costs if possible. Before we proceed with the tests, I’d like to mention one other possibility: vitamin deficiencies can sometimes cause similar symptoms. I’ll order a blood test to check your vitamin B12 and other nutrient levels. It’s a simple test and can rule out an easily treatable cause. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… a lot. But I suppose I should get it checked out properly. Blood tests and… the nerve tests. Vitamin deficiencies… that's something, I guess. Alright, Doctor. Do what you think is best. Blood tests and the… NCS and EMG, whatever they are. But please, can you help me with the cost? I really can't afford a big bill right now. And… how quickly can I get these tests done? I need to get back to work soon.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Uzarski. I understand your concerns and I will do everything I can to help with the cost. I’ll have my nurse, Sarah, contact you after our appointment to schedule both the blood tests and the NCS/EMG. She will also provide you with information about potential financial assistance programs and help you explore options for payment. I've written out a referral for both tests and will give it to you now. As for timing, we can usually get these tests done within a week or so, depending on the facility's availability. In the meantime, to help manage your symptoms, I recommend avoiding repetitive hand movements, taking frequent breaks while working, and keeping your wrists straight. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can also help with any discomfort. I want to reassure you that we’ll get to the bottom of this, and I will work with you to find a treatment plan that fits your needs and budget. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
