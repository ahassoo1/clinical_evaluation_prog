DOCTOR: Hi Early, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. I am Early Kammer. It’s… well, it’s not a sickness, you understand. I just… I was hoping you could write me a little card. A “Get Well” card. Or… something encouraging. My daughter, she thinks I need… well, she thinks I’m feeling down. She told me to come get a note from the doctor. Is that… is that something you do?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely, Early. I understand. It sounds like your daughter is looking out for you, and wanting to make sure you're doing okay. It’s perfectly fine to come in and discuss things like that. We’re here to support your overall wellbeing, and that includes emotional health. So, let me just ask a few questions to get a better understanding of how you're feeling. You mentioned feeling down – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Down… yes. It’s just… things aren’t like they used to be. I retired, you see? From the power plant. A good job, for many years. Stationary Engineer. Boiler Operator. Important work. Now… now I just sit. My wife… she left. A few years ago. Said I was… negative. Always looking at the bad side of things. Maybe she was right. I don't know. It's just… quiet now. Too quiet. It’s not a problem, Doctor. Just… empty.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, a big life change with retirement, and then the loss of your wife a few years ago. Both of those are incredibly significant events, and it’s completely normal to feel… empty, as you put it, after that. It takes time to adjust to new realities, and grief and loss can manifest in many ways. You mentioned feeling negative – has that been a long-standing feeling, or did it become more prominent after your wife left?
PATIENT: Prominent after… yes. Before, I had the job. Always something to do. Problems to fix. Things that needed my attention. I liked that. Kept me busy. Focused. My wife… she always said I worried too much. About everything. Said I needed to relax. But I had to make sure things were right. Everything had to be perfect. Now… there's nothing to fix. Nothing to worry about. And that… that feels worse, somehow. It's silly, I know. A retired man complaining.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Early. It sounds like your work gave you a real sense of purpose and structure, and losing that, combined with the loss of your wife, has left a significant void. It’s very common for people to struggle with finding meaning and purpose after retirement, especially when a big part of their identity was tied to their career. Have you found yourself trying to fill that time with anything new?
PATIENT: New? No. Not really. I try to watch television. But… it's all nonsense. My daughter, she tries to get me to go to things. Senior center. Bingo. Exercise classes. But… it’s not me. Those people… they talk about their aches and pains. Their grandchildren. I… I don't have much in common with them. Honestly, Doctor, I mostly just sit. And… think. And remember. And it's… not happy thoughts, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear you. It sounds like you're feeling a bit isolated and perhaps struggling with some difficult memories. That's understandable, Early. It takes courage to be honest about these things. Before we talk about potential ways to address this, I'd like to ask a few general health questions, just to get a complete picture. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep or appetite recently?
PATIENT: Sleep… not so good. I wake up a lot. Thinking. Mostly at night, when it’s quietest. And appetite… not much, either. I eat… enough, I suppose. But I don’t enjoy it. Everything tastes… bland. Like there’s no point. My daughter, she brings me food. Says I’m losing weight. She worries. I don't tell her the truth. I just… push it around on the plate. It’s not like I’m hungry.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that, Early. Changes in sleep and appetite can often be indicators of how we're doing emotionally. It sounds like these changes started around the same time as you were experiencing these feelings of isolation and loss. Have you been experiencing any feelings of hopelessness, or have you had thoughts of not wanting to be here anymore?
PATIENT: Hopelessness… yes. That’s a good word for it. It feels like… like nothing will ever be good again. Like I’m just waiting for… well, I don’t know what. And… Sometimes… sometimes I think it would be easier… just to go to sleep and not wake up. Not because I want to hurt myself, you understand. Just… tired. So very tired. It's just a thought, Doctor. A fleeting thought. But… it’s been there. A few times.
DOCTOR: Thank you for being so honest with me, Early. It takes a lot of courage to share those feelings, and I want you to know that you’re not alone. The thoughts you’re describing are serious, and I’m glad you told me about them. It sounds like you're experiencing symptoms of depression, and it's important that we address this. Based on what you've told me – the loss of your wife, the feelings of isolation, the changes in sleep and appetite, and these thoughts of hopelessness – I believe it would be beneficial for you to consider some further evaluation and treatment. Would you be open to discussing some options, such as talking to a therapist or exploring medication?
PATIENT: Therapist… medication… I don’t know, Doctor. I’m an old man. I’ve always been… practical. I fix things. I don’t talk about my feelings. And medication… that sounds… serious. Like something for people who are really… sick. I'm just sad. Lonely. Tired. Maybe… maybe I just need to try harder. Get out more. Do something. But… I don’t know what. It just feels like… a waste of time, trying. Everything’s just… going to stay the same.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Early. It’s perfectly normal to feel unsure about these things, especially if you've always been a practical person who prefers to fix things on your own. It's also common to feel like it’s a sign of weakness to ask for help. But think of it this way: sometimes, even the most practical things need a little maintenance. And sometimes, our minds and emotions need the same kind of care. Depression isn't a sign of weakness, it's a medical condition, just like any other illness. And there are many effective treatments available. I wouldn't recommend anything I didn't think would be helpful. We could start with a referral to a therapist who specializes in grief and loss, and see how that goes. You don’t have to commit to anything long-term, and it might give you some tools to cope with these feelings. If that doesn't feel right, we can discuss other options. Would you be willing to consider a referral to a therapist?
PATIENT: A therapist… Well… my daughter would be happy. She’s been saying I should talk to someone for years. She worries so much. And… I suppose it can’t hurt. Just talking. As long as it doesn’t involve… a lot of silly questions. And I don’t have to… share everything. If it’s just… a conversation. Maybe. Maybe I’ll try. But… if it’s not helping, I want to be able to stop. Can I do that? Stop if I want to?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Early. You are in complete control of your care. You can absolutely stop therapy at any time if you feel it’s not a good fit for you, or if it’s not helping. There is no obligation to continue. I'll provide you with a list of therapists in the area who specialize in grief and loss. They'll all have different approaches, so you can choose someone you feel comfortable with. I can also help you verify if they accept your Medicare insurance. Now, while we work on that, I want to make sure you’re physically okay. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. It’s standard practice when someone is experiencing these kinds of symptoms. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical… yes. Okay. That makes sense. I haven’t been to a doctor in… a long time. Just for checkups. Never for… this. But… if you think it’s necessary. Just… don’t poke too much. I’m an old man, you know. Everything creaks. And… I don’t like surprises. All right. Let’s get it over with. But… what about the card? The “Get Well” card? Did you forget about that? My daughter… she’s expecting it.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Early. I definitely haven't forgotten about the card. We'll get to that after the exam. It's a quick check, just to make sure everything's working as it should. And don't worry, I’ll be gentle. No surprises, I promise. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and taking a look in your ears and throat. Then I’ll feel your abdomen and check your reflexes. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Reflexes… what for? I'm not a… a nervous wreck. I just… I'm tired, Doctor. That's all. Fine. Do what you have to do. But if I flinch, don’t get upset. It's just… old age. Everything's a little sensitive these days. And… try to be quick, please. I don't want to be here all day. Just… get it over with. And then… the card. Don’t forget the card.
DOCTOR: I understand, Early. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. It’s just a routine part of the exam, helps me get a complete picture of your overall health. Okay, let’s start by listening to your heart and lungs. Just relax and take some deep breaths. Your heart rate is a little elevated, which isn’t uncommon when you’re feeling stressed or anxious. Breathing sounds are clear bilaterally, but I do hear some slight wheezing on exhalation. Any history of asthma or COPD?
PATIENT: Wheezing… no. Never asthma. Not COPD. I worked in the power plant, you see? Clean air… mostly. Some dust, sometimes. But nothing like… like a smoker. My wife… she smoked. Always coughing. No doctor ever said anything about wheezing. Just… old age. That's what they always said. Everything's just… wearing out. Like an old machine. Is it bad? The wheezing? Is something… broken?
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily something to be alarmed about, Early. Wheezing can be caused by a number of things, even a simple cold or allergies. It could also be a sign of mild inflammation in the airways. Blood pressure is a little elevated as well – 145/90. Temperature is normal. Ears look clear. Throat is a little red, but no signs of infection. I'm going to listen to your abdomen now, just to check for any tenderness or abnormalities. Is there any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: Ouch! That’s… sensitive. Yes. A little. It’s… my stomach. I haven’t been eating much, you see? Feels… bloated. Like there’s a rock inside. And… sometimes it gurgles. Not pleasant. Old age, again. Everything’s just… slowing down. Like a rusty pipe. I used to have a strong stomach. Could eat anything. Now… now it complains about everything. Just… be gentle, please. It’s not broken. Just… old. Very old. And tired. Everything’s tired.
DOCTOR: I understand, Early. I’m being as gentle as possible. It sounds like you may have some mild abdominal discomfort, possibly due to decreased appetite and digestive changes. It's common for digestion to slow down with age. I do feel some slight tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no signs of any masses or abnormalities. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is also common with age. Nothing to be concerned about. Alright, Early. That completes the physical exam. Everything seems to be within normal limits for your age, but we do have a few things to address – the elevated blood pressure and heart rate, the abdominal discomfort, and the decreased appetite. Would you mind if I order a few basic blood tests to rule out any underlying causes?
PATIENT: Blood tests… more poking? I don’t like needles. Never liked them. Is it… necessary? I’m an old man. I’ve lived a long life. I just want… some peace. And a card. A “Get Well” card. My daughter… she’s expecting it. If you have to, I suppose. But… no surprises. And… try to be quick. I don’t want to spend the whole day here. Just… get it over with. And then… the card. Don’t forget the card, Doctor. It’s important. Very important. Just… tell me when. And… try not to poke too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Early. I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is gentle and quick. We'll just need a small sample of blood to check your basic levels, including your complete blood count, kidney and liver function, and thyroid levels. It will give us a better understanding of what’s going on and help us determine the best course of action. We’ll get that done right away. After that, I promise, we can focus on the card. Now, before we get to the blood tests, I want to address your elevated blood pressure and heart rate. Are you currently taking any medications for high blood pressure?
PATIENT: No. Never any medications. I always prided myself on being… healthy. Strong. I worked hard. Physical labor. Never needed pills. My wife… she took pills. For her nerves. But not me. Never. I always said… good food. Fresh air. That’s all you need. Now… I eat little. And… I don't go out much. It's just… quiet. Too quiet. And… I worry. About everything. Old age. Everything wearing out. That's what worries me. But no pills. Never any pills. I don’t like them. They make me feel… weak. Like I’m falling apart. Just… forget the pills, Doctor. Just… the card. Please. Can we talk about the card now? My daughter… she’s expecting it.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Early. We can definitely talk about the card. And we won’t discuss any medications if you’re not comfortable with that. So, your daughter is looking for a “Get Well” card, and something encouraging. Tell me a little about your daughter. What would she like to hear?
PATIENT: Maria? She's… good. Very good. Too good for me, sometimes. Always worried about me. Always trying to help. She's a nurse, you see? Works at the hospital. She's got a family. Two boys. Very good boys. They call me Abuelo. Grandfather. She wants me to be… happier, I think. More active. She says I need to get out more. Meet people. But… I don't know. It's hard. Everything's changed. She'd like to hear… something positive. Something about… strength. About being proud of me. I used to be strong. A good worker. A good provider. She'd like to hear… that I'm still that person. Even if… even if I don't feel like it sometimes. Can you write something like that, Doctor? Something about… strength? About being proud? It would mean a lot to her. Very much. And to me, too, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Of course, Early. I can absolutely do that. Here you go. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… that’s good, Doctor. Very good. That’s… exactly what she’d like to hear. About the strength. About the pride. Thank you, Doctor. Thank you very much. You… you’re a good doctor. A very good doctor. Now… is there anything else? Or… can I go now? I need to… call Maria. Tell her I got the card. She’ll be happy. Very happy.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Early. You can go now. And yes, I’m sure Maria will be very happy. Before you go, I just want to reiterate that I’m here for you if you need anything in the future. And if you ever change your mind about discussing some additional support, please don’t hesitate to reach out. It was a pleasure meeting you, Early. Take care. And please, give Maria my best.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. And I will. I will tell Maria you said hello. Goodbye, Doctor. And… thank you again. You’ve been very kind.
