DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Let me see… what brings me here… Well, my tummy feels… puffy. And I don't want to eat much anymore. It’s just… not feeling right, you know? It's been a little while now, I think. Maybe a week? It's hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. "Puffy" and a decreased appetite… and this has been going on for about a week, you estimate. It is perfectly alright that remembering exact timelines can be difficult. Could you describe the “puffiness” a little more?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, it’s… bigger. My tummy. Not fat, not like before. Just… swollen. Like a balloon, maybe? And hard sometimes. Not always, but sometimes. It feels… uncomfortable. Not pain, exactly. Just… full. And heavy. Does that make sense? I’m sorry, I’m not good at explaining.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. McConnon. You are explaining it very well. So, a swelling of the abdomen, not a weight gain as you say, but a distinct fullness. And occasionally, a feeling of hardness. Not painful, but uncomfortable and heavy. Do you notice anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think… I don’t think so. Not really. Maybe… when I lie down it feels a little better? But not much. And… I don’t know if eating makes it worse. I just don’t feel like eating, so I haven’t been paying attention, I guess. It’s… everything feels a little slow these days. Not just my tummy. Everything.
DOCTOR: "Slow," you say. That’s helpful information, Ms. McConnon. Could you elaborate on what you mean by “slow”?
PATIENT: Oh, you know… just… tired. And things don’t… move so fast, inside. Like… taking a long time to get going in the morning. And… well, my mind doesn't work like it used to. I forget things. A lot of things. Not important things, I don’t think… just… names. And… what I was saying. It's silly, really. Old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: It isn’t silly at all, Ms. McConnon. Changes in energy levels, digestion, and memory are all things we see with age, and it’s important to discuss them. Let’s talk a bit more about these changes. You mentioned fatigue – is this a new development, or has it been ongoing for some time?
PATIENT: Oh… a long time, I think. Years, maybe? It comes and goes. Some days I feel alright, and some days… I just want to sit. And sleep. It's worse in the afternoons, usually. I used to be very active, you know. Worked hard all my life. Sociologist, I was. Lots of studying, lots of traveling. But now… not so much.
DOCTOR: A sociologist – that’s fascinating, Ms. McConnon! A very active profession, indeed. And it sounds as though you’ve led a full and busy life. This fatigue, ongoing for years, worse in the afternoons… We should explore this further. Now, let's move on to your bowel movements. Have you noticed any changes in your usual pattern?
PATIENT: Oh dear… bowel movements? Well, that's… a personal question, isn't it? Let me see… They're… less frequent, I think. And… harder. Not every time, but often. I don’t… go to the bathroom as easily as I used to. It's embarrassing to talk about.
DOCTOR: It isn’t embarrassing at all, Ms. McConnon. These are very important questions, and I assure you, I ask all my patients. Changes in bowel habits are common, and it helps me understand what’s going on. So, less frequent and harder stools, with some difficulty. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or changes in its color?
PATIENT: Oh… blood? No, I don’t think so. Not that I’ve noticed. Everything looks… normal, I guess. Darkish, like it always is. I haven't really been looking, if you know what I mean. I just… go. And hope for the best. Old lady problems, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Quite alright, Ms. McConnon. It’s perfectly natural not to pay close attention. Now, let’s talk about your diet. Could you describe what you typically eat in a day?
PATIENT: Oh… well, I don't eat much, as I said. Breakfast is usually just toast. Sometimes with a little jam. Lunch… maybe a small soup. Or a sandwich. If I'm feeling up to it. And dinner… usually something easy. Like… fish. Or chicken. Not much vegetables, I’m afraid. I used to like vegetables, but… they just don't taste good anymore. And I like tea. Lots of tea. Does that make sense? I don't cook for myself much anymore. It's too much trouble.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. McConnon. A lighter diet, primarily toast, soup, and small portions of protein, with a fondness for tea. I understand that preparing meals can become difficult. Now, regarding medications, are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter drugs?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I don't think so. Not really. I used to take something for my blood pressure, a long time ago. But the doctor said I didn't need it anymore. I take a little vitamin D in the winter, because the sun isn’t strong enough. But that's it. I don’t like taking pills. They make me feel sick. I'm trying to stay natural, you know?
DOCTOR: So, no regular medications currently, apart from occasional Vitamin D supplementation. That’s good to know. Now, have you ever had any major surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see… I broke my arm once, when I was a little girl. Fell out of a tree. And… I had my appendix out, a long, long time ago. But that’s it, I think. Nothing else. Maybe… I was in the hospital for a week once, with a bad flu? But it was so long ago, I don't really remember. It's all a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: A broken arm in childhood, appendectomy some time ago, and perhaps a bout of the flu… That’s helpful, Ms. McConnon. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family history? That’s a hard one. My parents… they’re both gone now. And I don’t have any siblings. I had a husband, a long time ago, but he passed away many years ago. We didn't have any children. As for illnesses… I think my mother had something with her heart. And my father… he had trouble with his memory, towards the end. It's all a bit sad, really.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. McConnon. It sounds as though you’ve experienced a great deal of loss. So, a family history of heart issues in your mother, and memory problems in your father. Now, before we proceed, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… allergies? No, I don’t think so. Not that I know of. I’ve never really had any problems with food or anything. Sometimes my skin gets a little itchy, but that’s just from the cold. I’m pretty sturdy, I think. Never been one for getting sick. Except for maybe those colds now and then.
DOCTOR: Very good. No known allergies. Now, Ms. McConnon, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just… be gentle, please? My bones aren't what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. McConnon. I will be very gentle. First, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out. Your heart sounds a bit… faint, but I don't detect any murmurs or abnormal rhythms. Your lungs are clear, although your breathing is somewhat shallow. Now, let's check your abdomen. Please lie back on the examination table. I notice some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, and it is slightly distended, as you described. It feels… firm, but not rigid. Does this cause you any discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a little uncomfortable, yes. Right there. Not pain, exactly. Just… a pressure. Like a fullness. It feels… bloated. And it’s… hard. Like a rock, almost. But not a sharp pain. Just… heavy. Are you finding something? Is it bad?
DOCTOR: I am noting the tenderness and firmness, Ms. McConnon. It doesn’t feel acutely painful, but it is significant. Your abdomen is indeed distended. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a bit… diminished, but that’s not uncommon at your age. And finally, I'm going to check your vital signs: blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is a little low, but your pulse and temperature are within normal limits. Based on my examination, Ms. McConnon, I’m concerned about the distention and tenderness of your abdomen, as well as the diminished appetite and fatigue you’ve described. It could be a number of things, ranging from constipation and a build-up of gas to something more serious. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count, electrolytes, and liver function tests. I also recommend an abdominal X-ray to see what’s going on inside. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… blood tests and X-rays? That sounds… scary. I don’t like needles. And I don’t want to be exposed to… radiation. Is it really necessary? Could it be… just gas? Like you said? I've always been pretty healthy, you know. Maybe it will just go away on its own? I'm not sure I'm strong enough for all that testing.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. McConnon. It is unsettling to think about tests, and you are right to ask questions. While it could be gas, the tenderness and distention, combined with your fatigue and decreased appetite, warrant further investigation. The blood tests will help us rule out any underlying infections or imbalances, and the X-ray will give us a visual look inside your abdomen to identify the cause of the distention. The amount of radiation from an abdominal X-ray is very low, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks. We’ll take every precaution to minimize your exposure. As for the blood test, we’ll use the smallest needle possible, and I’ll be very gentle. I want to assure you, Ms. McConnon, that we’ll take things one step at a time. We're not trying to overwhelm you, just to understand what’s going on and make sure you’re healthy and comfortable. Would you be willing to at least consider the blood tests to start?
PATIENT: Oh… well… blood tests are… less scary than an X-ray, I suppose. If it’s just a little prick… and you promise to be gentle… alright. I’ll do the blood tests. But I’m still not sure about the X-ray. Let's see what the blood tests say first. I trust you, Doctor. But I'm still a bit worried.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. McConnon. We'll start with the blood tests, and we can discuss the X-ray later, after we have the results. I promise to be as gentle as possible. We'll draw a small sample of blood, and the whole process will only take a few minutes. I'll have my nurse, Sarah, come in and draw the blood for you. She’s very skilled and will take good care of you. While we wait for the results, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids and eating small, light meals. If you experience any worsening pain, nausea, or vomiting, please contact my office immediately. I also want to address your fatigue. We can explore potential causes and discuss lifestyle changes to help improve your energy levels. Do you have any questions for me at this time, Ms. McConnon?
PATIENT: Oh… no, I don’t think so. You explained everything very well, Doctor. Just… thank you. For listening to me. And for being so kind. It’s… nice to have someone who cares. I suppose I’ll just wait for the nurse now. I hope it doesn't hurt too much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. McConnon. I’m glad I could help. And please, don't worry about the blood test. It will be quick and relatively painless. Sarah is excellent, and she’ll make sure you’re comfortable. I’ll be right here if you need anything at all. I’ll have Sarah come in now. We'll take it one step at a time, Ms. McConnon. And remember, I’m here to support you every step of the way. Sarah?
