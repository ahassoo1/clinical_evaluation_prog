DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Renzi. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Afternoon to you too, Doctor. Nice to meet you as well. Well, it's this headache I've been getting, right at the back of my head. Been botherin' me for a little while now, so I thought I'd best get it checked out. Not like any headache I've had before, either.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head that’s a little different than usual. I understand. Can you tell me a bit more about it?
PATIENT: Right. It's… hard to explain. Not a sharp pain, more like a dull ache, kinda constant. Feels like pressure, really. And it seems to get worse if I'm standin' for too long, or if I get too warm. Not that it's terribly bad, mind you, just… persistent. Been happenin' on and off for about three weeks now, I reckon. I hadn’t really paid it much mind at first, thought it was just somethin’ I was doin’. But it hasn't gone away.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull, constant ache, feeling like pressure at the back of the head, worse with standing or warmth… and it’s been going on for about three weeks. That's helpful. Have you noticed anything that makes it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Lyin’ down definitely helps. And a cool cloth on the back of my neck, that eases it a bit. But not for long, really. Mostly, it just… is. I’ve been tryin’ to drink plenty of water, like my wife says, but doesn’t seem to make much difference either way. I do a lot of standin’ at work, you see – manicurist, I am. So maybe that’s got somethin’ to do with it. Been doin’ that for… well, a long time now. Sixty years, I think it is.
DOCTOR: Sixty years as a manicurist – that’s wonderful! And a lot of standing, you’re right. That could certainly be a factor. Let’s talk a little more broadly. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… sometimes my vision gets a little blurry, but it's quick, comes and goes. I figured it was just my eyes gettin' old, to be honest. And I've been a bit more tired than usual, but again, I'm eighty-seven, Doctor! So who isn’t tired? No dizziness or nothin' like that, and no trouble with my balance. Appetite’s normal, sleep’s alright, though I do wake up a couple times a night. Nothing major, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand perfectly, Mr. Popova. And it's good you're noticing these things – even if they seem small. The blurry vision and increased tiredness are good to know. Now, just to get a fuller picture, have you had any other medical problems in the past?
PATIENT: Well, let me see. I had the flu pretty bad a few years back, but got over that alright. And my wife and I both had COVID, but it was mild for both of us, thankfully. Oh, and I had my appendix out when I was a young man, but that was ages ago. No high blood pressure, no diabetes, nothin’ like that. My wife keeps a close eye on me, she does. She's a retired nurse, so she knows all about these things. She’d tell me if somethin’ was seriously wrong, I reckon. She's a good woman, my wife.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Popova. It sounds like you've been quite healthy overall. And having a retired nurse for a wife is a definite advantage! Now, are you currently taking any medications for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, nothin’ at all. I don't take any pills, don't believe in 'em unless I absolutely have to. Just a bit of liniment for my joints sometimes, when they're achin’. But that's it. Always been a strong man, I am. Try to keep active, that’s what I always say. Keeps the blood flowin’, you know? Although, standin’ all day at work… maybe that's startin’ to catch up with me.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, have you ever had any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. My wife has a bit of a reaction to shellfish, but I’m fine with it. Never had a problem with any medicine, never needed any, to be honest. She always checks before I try somethin' new, just in case. She’s very thorough, my wife is. She’d never let me take anything without being certain it’s safe.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Popova. That’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Just to check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological check, mostly. It won't take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Go ahead, do what you need to do. Just let me know if it's goin' to be uncomfortable, alright? I'm not as young as I used to be, you know! But I’m a strong man, remember?
DOCTOR: Excellent. And you seem very strong, Mr. Popova! It won’t be uncomfortable at all, just a few quick checks. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Could you please roll up your sleeve?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. There you go. Ready when you are. My wife always said I had strong veins. Good for givin’ injections, she used to say. Though I never let her practice on me!
DOCTOR: Alright, deep breath in… and out… good. And again… alright. Blood pressure is 148 over 82. A little elevated, but not terribly concerning given your age and if you were feeling any stress about being here. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I'm going to do a quick check of your reflexes and balance. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I can. There you go. Nice and steady. Used to be a good shot with a rifle, you know. Steady hand is important for that. Though I haven't done much shootin' in years now. Too dangerous, I reckon. Still got good eyesight, though. Especially for an old man!
DOCTOR: Very good. And your reflexes seem normal as well. Balance is good. No signs of weakness or numbness in your arms or legs. Alright, Mr. Popova, that’s all for the physical exam. Everything seems pretty stable overall, but given your headache and the blurry vision, I think it would be a good idea to get a few tests done just to be on the safe side. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a CT scan of your head. The CT scan will help us rule out anything serious going on in your brain. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Hmm… a CT scan, you say? Sounds a bit serious, doesn't it? But if you think it's best, Doctor, then I trust your judgement. I’d rather be safe than sorry, I suppose. My wife will be glad to hear we’re gettin' it checked out properly. She worries about me, you know. As for the blood tests… well, I don't love needles, but I can manage. Just let me know if it's goin’ to hurt. And how long will all this take? I got a few appointments at the salon tomorrow…
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the CT scan, Mr. Popova. It's a precaution, truly. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong, but it’s the best way to get a clear picture of what's going on. The blood tests are quick – just a small prick. As for the CT scan, it shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes, and the results usually come back within a few hours. We can schedule it for tomorrow morning, if that works for you. It shouldn’t interfere too much with your salon appointments. I’m just getting the orders put in now. I’ll have the receptionist schedule the tests for you when you’re ready. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to drink plenty of water and getting adequate rest. And if your headache gets significantly worse, or you experience any new symptoms like weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor, that sounds reasonable. Tomorrow morning it is, then. And I’ll try to take it easy, drink more water, just like my wife says. And I'll definitely let you know if anything changes. She’s gonna be relieved to hear we're gettin’ this sorted. She always said I should’ve become a doctor myself, you know. Said I had a good head on my shoulders. Always was good at fixin’ things, I suppose. Manicures and pedicures… it's all about fixin’ things, really. Well, thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ the time to listen to an old man like me. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I'll go and tell my wife all about it. She’ll want to know everything. .
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Mr. Popova. It was a pleasure meeting you. And you're not just any old man – you're a strong, resilient man who’s kept busy for a long time! Don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment tomorrow. And please give your wife my best. Have a good afternoon.
