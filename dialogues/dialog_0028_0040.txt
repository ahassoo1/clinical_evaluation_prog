DOCTOR: Alright. Mr. Espinueva, yes?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Clearance Espinueva. It’s good to meet you, Doctor… Memmolo, is it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Memmolo. Though, frankly, titles aren't important. Just tell me why you’re here today. And please, be concise. I have a very full schedule.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Well, it’s my flank, mostly. It’s been hurting on and off for a while now. And I keep getting water infections, you see. The doctor back home – he said something about my kidneys, having a lot of little… pockets in them. Polycystic, he called it. It's been a bother, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Polycystic kidney disease… right. And how long have these infections been recurring?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… it’s hard to say exactly. Maybe… six months now? They come and go, but I feel like I’ve had three or four really bad ones in that time. Enough to need the antibiotics, you know? It's just uncomfortable, and worrying, really. I don't like feeling unwell.
DOCTOR: Three or four in six months is… not ideal. Any fever with these infections?
PATIENT: Sometimes, yes. Not a high one, mind you. Just feeling a bit warm and shivery. Mostly, it’s the pain in my back and… needing to go to the toilet a lot. It's a bit embarrassing, to be honest. Do you need me to be more specific about the pain? I’m not sure what details are helpful.
DOCTOR: "A bit?
PATIENT: Oh, well, not a raging fever, Doctor. Just a bit warm. And the pain… it's not constant, you see. It comes and goes, mostly on my side, lower down my back. It’s a dull ache, sometimes sharp, when I move a certain way. I suppose it depends on the day. It's hard to describe.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s have a look. Please lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with a basic abdominal exam, and then I’ll listen to your back.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. The examination table, is it? No problem. I hope I don’t have to take my shirt off. My skin gets a bit cold easily, you know.
DOCTOR: No, you don't need to remove your shirt. Just lie flat. And try to relax. I need to palpate your abdomen and auscultate your back.
PATIENT: Oh, good. Palpate, you say? Is that… pressing? I hope it doesn't hurt too much. I'm a bit tender there, you know.
DOCTOR: Tenderness present in the left flank, as expected. Decreased bowel sounds overall. No murmurs auscultated. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 145/90.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Is that… bad? The blood pressure, I mean. I don’t usually worry too much about those numbers. I try to eat healthy, mostly fish and vegetables. Is the tenderness… normal, with this kidney business? I'm not very good with medical things, you see.
DOCTOR: Elevated blood pressure isn’t ideal, no. And tenderness is… expected, given the history. But we need to investigate further to determine the extent of the problem. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. We'll also need to schedule an abdominal CT scan to visualize the kidneys. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh, a CT scan… that sounds… serious. And contrast dye? No, I don't think so. I’ve never had one before. I haven't had any reactions to anything, as far as I know. Though, I used to get a bit itchy when I was a boy, from some plants, but that was a long time ago. I suppose that doesn't count. Will these tests tell you how bad the kidneys are? Is it something I should be very worried about? I'm just a bit anxious, you see. It's all a bit overwhelming.
DOCTOR: The tests will give us a clearer picture of kidney function and rule out other possible causes. As for whether you should be worried… it’s best not to jump to conclusions. We'll have the results back in a few days. I'm going to prescribe you a course of antibiotics for now, to address the potential infection. It’s a standard protocol. And please, schedule the CT scan as soon as possible. The radiology department will contact you directly. Do you have any questions about the antibiotics?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Antibiotics, yes. How long should I take them for? And are there any… side effects I should be aware of? I sometimes get a bit of an upset stomach, you know. And will they interact with the little pills I take for my blood pressure? I usually take them in the morning. It’s just… I worry about taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Seven days. Common side effects include nausea and diarrhea. It shouldn't interact with your blood pressure medication, but it's always best to check with your pharmacist. I've noted your blood pressure pills on your chart. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Seven days. And check with the pharmacist. Yes, I can do that. No, I think that’s all. Just… thank you, Doctor. For everything. I’ll schedule the scan as soon as I can. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The radiology department will be in touch. Have a good day. .
