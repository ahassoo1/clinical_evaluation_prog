DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Uzarski. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Please, call me Teretha. Well, it's this tingling, you see. In my hands and feet mostly. It’s been… bothering me for a little while now. Not terrible, but enough to make me want to get it checked. I don't want it to get worse, you know?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Teretha. It's wise to get these things checked out promptly. “A little while now” is a bit vague, though. Could you tell me approximately when you first started noticing this tingling?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates... they slip my mind these days. Hmm… maybe… three, four months ago? Around Easter, I think. Yes, around Easter time it started. It wasn’t constant then, just now and then. But it’s been happening more often lately. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is quite helpful. Around Easter time… so roughly April. And it's been gradually increasing in frequency, you said. Now, can you describe the tingling itself?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… hard to explain. Not pain, exactly. More like… pins and needles? Like when your foot falls asleep, but not as strong. And it’s not always in the same place. Sometimes it’s just my fingertips, sometimes it goes up my arm a bit. And in my feet, it’s mostly the soles. Does that make any sense? I hope I'm not being a bother.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Teretha. You're explaining it perfectly. Pins and needles, intermittent, affecting your fingertips, soles of your feet, and sometimes extending up your arms... That gives me a good starting point. Does anything seem to trigger the tingling, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Cold weather definitely makes it worse. When I’m out delivering mail in the winter, it gets bad. And… sometimes when I'm standing for a long time. Like, after a long route. But honestly, it seems to come and go on its own too. It’s not always connected to anything specific, I don’t think.
DOCTOR: I see. Cold weather and prolonged standing seem to be potential aggravating factors. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the tingling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think hard. No, not really. I mean, I’m a bit tired sometimes, but who isn’t? And my knees ache a bit, but that’s just old age, I suppose. Nothing with the tingling, no. No weakness, no numbness, no pain shooting up my arms or anything like that. Just the tingling. Honestly, I was hoping it would just go away on its own.
DOCTOR: Alright, Teretha. Just tingling, worsened by cold and prolonged standing, no associated weakness, numbness, or pain. And it’s been present for approximately four months. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions previously?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let's see… Not much, really. I had the flu a few times, of course. And I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe… twenty years ago? But that’s about it. No diabetes, no heart trouble, nothing like that. I try to stay healthy, you know? Walk a lot with my job. I don't think I've ever been seriously sick. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Teretha. Gallbladder removal twenty years ago, otherwise generally healthy. And you mentioned walking a lot for your job - that’s excellent. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
