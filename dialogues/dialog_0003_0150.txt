DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Shteynberg. I am Dr. Yackey. Now, let’s get right to it. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yes, well. It's about having a baby. I don’t want any…problems. I’m not getting any younger, you know. And I’d like to be efficient about this. I want to make sure everything works before I even start trying. Is that clear enough?
DOCTOR: “Efficient,” you say. Right. Well, at your age, a thorough assessment is… prudent, certainly. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you had any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: No. Never. And frankly, I find that a rather…personal question right off the bat. But fine. No pregnancies. I’ve always been… careful. And healthy, generally. Though I had a divorce. A dreadful business, really. But what does that have to do with anything? Is this some sort of…psychological evaluation now? Because I assure you, my mental state is perfectly adequate.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Shteynberg. Certain stressors can impact hormonal balance, and, by extension, fertility. We need a complete picture. Past surgical history?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. I had my wisdom teeth removed. Ages ago. That’s it. A perfectly routine procedure. Honestly, I don't understand why we're going through all of this. I just want to know if I can have a baby without…complications. Are you going to actually do something, or just ask me about every little thing I’ve ever done?
DOCTOR: Right. Let's move on then. Family history—any genetic conditions, early-onset cancers, or reproductive issues on either side?
PATIENT: Look, my family was… Hungarian. We didn't discuss these things. My mother worried about cooking and my father about…well, everything. No early cancers, no…reproductive issues that I’m aware of. They didn’t exactly keep detailed medical records, you understand. It was a different time. Are you writing all this down? It seems rather…pointless.
DOCTOR: It's important to document everything, Ms. Shteynberg. Now, social history. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Good heavens, no! Do I look like the type? I cycle, for goodness sake. Several kilometers every day. And I maintain a…certain standard of living. Smoking is simply…uncivilized. This is becoming rather tedious, don't you think?
DOCTOR: Alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Occasionally. A glass of wine with dinner. A civilized indulgence. Not enough to…affect anything. Really. I don’t sit around getting… sloshed, if that's what you're implying. Are we getting anywhere with this, Doctor? Because my time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Allergies?
PATIENT: Pollen. Dreadful stuff. Makes my eyes itch. And dust. Everything's dusty these days, isn’t it? Honestly, I hardly think seasonal allergies are relevant to…conception. This is quite a waste of my afternoon.
DOCTOR: Any current medications you’re taking, prescribed or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. For…general health. Nothing else. Really, Doctor. I am a perfectly healthy woman. I cycle, I eat properly, I don't smoke. What more do you need to know? Are we going to do some actual tests, or just continue this…interrogation?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's proceed to a physical exam, then. It’s standard protocol to assess your overall health and…confirm what you’ve stated. Please step onto the scale.
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to do something physical. Finally. Honestly. This whole process has been quite…degrading. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Blood pressure first. Acceptable. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Normal. Palpate abdomen. No abnormalities detected. Is your menstrual cycle regular?
PATIENT: Yes, reasonably so. Give or take a few days. I've kept track, you know. Not entirely unpredictable. Though, with stress lately – this whole ordeal, for example – it’s been a bit…irregular. Honestly, I'm starting to suspect this visit is causing more problems than it’s solving. Are you going to order some blood tests, or what? Because I don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll proceed with blood work. Routine panel: complete blood count, metabolic panel, hormone levels—FSH, LH, estradiol, progesterone—to assess ovarian function. Also, a thyroid panel. And a rubella titer, just to be certain. It’s standard. The lab results will take a few days. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. How long will this "few days" be? And can't you just… expedite it? I don't want to be waiting around. And will these tests definitely tell me if I can have a baby without…issues? Because if they don't, I’m not sure what the point of all this is. Honestly, I expect a straight answer, Doctor. Don't give me vague assurances.
DOCTOR: The lab typically takes 3-5 business days for results. We cannot expedite the process. As for your question...the tests will provide information regarding your overall health and ovarian reserve. They will not guarantee a complication-free pregnancy. No test can. However, they will help us assess your chances and identify any potential concerns that may need to be addressed. Is there anything else, Ms. Shteynberg?
