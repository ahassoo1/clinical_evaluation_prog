DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pithan. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Bacy. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a cough, mostly. Been on me for a while now. And I get awful tired, real easy. Plus, these sinus infections… they keep comin’ back. I’d like to get it sorted, if that’s alright. I don’t have a lot of time today, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pithan. We'll do our best to get this figured out efficiently. A cough, fatigue, and recurrent sinus infections – I understand. Let’s start with the cough. How long have you had it, and has it changed at all since it started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s gotta be… close to three months now, maybe a little longer. It started kinda mild, just a tickle in my throat. Now it’s… well, it’s a productive cough, if that means anything. Lots of… stuff comin’ up. And it’s worse in the mornings, definitely. I've tried cough drops, that didn’t help much.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months of a productive cough, worsening in the mornings. And the cough drops didn’t provide relief. That's good to know. When you say “productive,” what color is the mucus you’re bringing up?
PATIENT: Oh, uh… mostly clear, I guess. Sometimes a little… yellowish. Not green, nothin’ bad lookin’ like that. Just… clear or kinda yellow. It ain’t ever been bloody or nothin’. I hope that makes sense. I ain’t good at describin’ things.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Pithan. No blood, just clear or yellowish mucus. That's helpful. And you mentioned fatigue – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: It’s just… tired. All the time. I used to be able to get a lot done around the house, work in the yard, you know? Now I get winded just walkin’ up the steps. And I sleep plenty, but I still feel wiped out when I wake up. It’s like… I’m always draggin’. It’s been gettin’ worse lately, with these sinus infections keepin' me up at night.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue with exertion, feeling wiped out despite adequate sleep, and it's worsening with the sinus infections. Let's talk about those infections. How often are you getting them, roughly, and what are your symptoms when you have one?
PATIENT: Roughly… every month or so, it seems like. Sometimes six weeks, sometimes a little less. My nose gets all stuffed up, head feels like it’s gonna split open, and my face gets real tender, especially around my cheeks and forehead. And then there’s the cough, of course. It gets worse when I have a sinus infection. I usually just try to tough it out, take some over-the-counter stuff for the pain. It usually goes away after a week or so, but then it just comes back. I don’t know… maybe I just got a weak immune system or somethin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, recurrent sinus infections every month or so, with nasal congestion, headache, facial tenderness, and worsening cough. You've been trying to manage it with over-the-counter medications. Let’s get a bit more background. Do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of. Never been tested for 'em, to be honest. I spend a lot of time outdoors, workin’ in the yard. Sometimes I get stung by a bee, but that’s about it. No real bad reactions to nothin’ that I can think of. I don't really eat anything unusual either.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you mentioned you spend a lot of time outdoors. Have you noticed if the symptoms are worse at certain times of the year, or after doing specific things in the yard?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, they do seem a little worse in the spring and fall, when things are bloomin’ or leaves are fallin’. And sometimes after I’m mowin’ the lawn, I get a real itchy throat. But I figured that was just the grass dust. I don’t really pay it much mind. It’s just… bothersome, you know? I just wanna feel normal again.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Pithan. We'll try to get to the bottom of this. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any other medical conditions, like asthma, COPD, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had nothin’ diagnosed, as far as I know. I used to smoke, a long time ago, but I quit about twenty years ago. Been healthy as a horse, mostly, 'til this cough started. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ older, you know? I haven’t been to a doctor in… well, a long time. Except for a check-up maybe ten years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses, you quit smoking twenty years ago, and haven’t seen a doctor regularly. That’s good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had surgery. Always been lucky enough to avoid that. I’m not a fan of hospitals, if you don’t mind me sayin’ so. I try to stay out of 'em if I can. Just wanna get this cough fixed and get on with my life. I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, no surgeries. And you prefer to avoid hospitals if possible, I understand. Now, thinking about your family… are there any medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, lung problems, or allergies?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had… I think it was high blood pressure. And my father… he had some kinda heart trouble when he got older. My sister has allergies, real bad ones. She’s always sneezin’ and snifflin’. Other than that, nothin’ that I can think of. We weren't a family that talked a lot about health problems, if you know what I mean. Look, Doctor, if you could just tell me what’s causin’ this cough, and what I can do to get rid of it, I’d appreciate it. I don’t wanna take up too much of your time.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Pithan. I appreciate you sharing that information. So, to summarize, you’ve had a productive cough for about three months, worsening in the mornings, with associated fatigue and recurrent sinus infections. You quit smoking twenty years ago, have no known allergies or prior medical diagnoses, and have a family history of high blood pressure, heart trouble, and allergies. Before we jump to conclusions, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your lungs and check your sinuses. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Sounds good. Just… quick, if you could. I got things to do this afternoon. I appreciate you listenin' to me, Doctor. I'm hopin' it's nothin' serious.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pithan. I'll be as efficient as possible. First, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in through your mouth, and then exhale slowly. Alright, breathing sounds are slightly diminished in the lower lobes, bilaterally, with some mild wheezing. Sinuses are tender to palpation, especially over the frontal and maxillary areas. No significant swelling or redness noted. Based on the exam findings, and your history, we need to consider a few possibilities. It could be bronchitis, a lingering post-viral cough, or perhaps a sinus infection with some bronchial involvement. Given the wheezing and diminished breath sounds, we should also rule out other lung conditions. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a complete blood count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-ray and blood work… alright. I guess so. As long as it don’t take too long. I got appointments tomorrow too. Is that gonna cost me a lot of money? I got private insurance, but… you know. Things add up.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about cost, Mr. Pithan. We’ll submit the tests to your insurance, and they will cover a portion of the cost. You will likely have a co-pay, depending on your plan. Our billing department can provide you with an estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses. I'll write the orders for the chest X-ray and blood work now. The X-ray can be done here at the clinic, and the blood draw will also be done here. Once the results are back, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to rest, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid irritants like smoke and dust. I can also prescribe an over-the-counter decongestant and a cough suppressant to help manage your symptoms until we get the results. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. A decongestant and cough suppressant… that’d be good. Anything to get some sleep. And, uh… tell me straight, Doctor. You think it’s serious? I ain’t lookin’ for a miracle, just… honest. I don’t want no fancy words, just the truth.
DOCTOR: Mr. Pithan, I want to be upfront with you. The wheezing we heard is something we need to investigate further, which is why I’m ordering the X-ray. It could be something relatively minor, like a lingering bronchitis, but we need to rule out other possibilities, like pneumonia or even COPD, given your past smoking history. It's important to get a clear diagnosis so we can provide you with the best possible care. I'm not trying to alarm you, but I want you to be aware of all possibilities. The tests will give us the information we need to make an informed decision. While we wait for the results, please monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience shortness of breath, chest pain, high fever, or any worsening of your condition, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. I’m prescribing you pseudoephedrine decongestant and dextromethorphan cough suppressant. Please follow the dosage instructions carefully. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah… yeah, that makes sense. Shortness of breath… chest pain… I’ll watch for that. Pseudoephedrine… dextromethorphan… okay. I'll try to remember that. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you bein’ honest with me. I don’t like bein’ in the dark. I just want to feel better. I guess… I guess I'll go get the X-ray and blood work done. What do I do after that? Do I just wait for a call? And how long will it take to get the results? I got appointments tomorrow, like I said. I need to know if I need to reschedule.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pithan. You’re welcome. I understand your concern, and I’m glad I could be upfront with you. After you have the X-ray and blood work done, the results will be sent to me electronically. I anticipate receiving them within 24-48 hours. My office will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment as soon as I have reviewed them. If you haven’t heard from us within 48 hours, please don’t hesitate to call the office to check on the status. Here is a paper with the instructions for the X-ray and blood work, as well as the contact information for the lab and radiology department. If you need to reschedule your appointments tomorrow, please let your other providers know that you’re undergoing medical testing. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
