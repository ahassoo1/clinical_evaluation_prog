DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. I am Dr. Mutnick. Now, let’s not waste any time. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s…it’s been my stomach, mostly. It feels sick a lot, and I just don’t have much appetite anymore. I get full awful quick, even if I barely eat anything. It’s been going on for…oh, goodness, a while now, I suppose. I can’t rightly say how long. It feels like forever.
DOCTOR: “A while now,” is not a particularly helpful timeframe, Ms. Kelder. Let’s try to be more precise. Has this been weeks?
PATIENT: Oh, you’re right, dear, I’m sorry. Weeks…yes, I think so. Maybe…six weeks? Or was it eight? It’s hard to keep track. Everything just sort of…blurs together these days. It definitely started before July, if that helps. I was hoping it would just go away on its own, but it hasn’t. It's just gotten…worse, I guess.
DOCTOR: Very well. And besides the lack of appetite and feeling “sick,” can you describe the “sick” feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s not like a bad tummy ache, not exactly. It’s more…a queasy feeling, all the time. Like I’m on a boat, maybe? But I haven’t been on a boat in years! It just kind of rolls around in my stomach. And sometimes I feel like I’m going to…well, you know. But I haven’t actually been sick, not really. Just…close. It makes me not want to eat, that’s for sure. I used to love a good piece of fried chicken, but now…it just doesn’t appeal to me.
DOCTOR: So, nausea without actual emesis. And this impacts your dietary intake. Have you noticed any specific foods that worsen or improve the nausea?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me think…I don’t know if anything helps, really. Everything seems to bother it pretty much the same. Maybe…strong smells? Like, cooking bacon makes it worse. And…oh, this might sound silly, but when my daughter visits and wears her perfume, I feel awful. It’s a sweet smell, but…it just sits wrong in my stomach. I haven't tried anything specifically to see if it helps, though. I mostly just try to avoid eating much of anything at all. It seems easier that way.
DOCTOR: Interesting. Aversion to certain smells. Now, Ms. Kelder, have you experienced any unintentional weight loss since this began?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, probably. I haven’t weighed myself in a while, to be honest. My scales broke a few months back, and I haven’t gotten around to getting a new one. But my clothes are…looser. And my daughter, bless her heart, keeps telling me I look thinner. I just figured it was getting older. But…yes, I suppose I’ve lost some weight. I don’t know how much, though. Everything's just a blur, like I said. It's hard to keep track of things these days.
DOCTOR: Unintentional weight loss, quantified as “clothes are looser.” Now, let’s move on. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now you’re asking about…well, things I don’t usually talk about. Let me see…I suppose they’re…slower. Not as regular as they used to be. And…harder, maybe? It’s not painful, exactly, but…uncomfortable. I take a little something to help sometimes, but…it doesn’t always work. I don’t want to go into too much detail, if you don't mind. It’s a little embarrassing.
DOCTOR: I understand. We need to establish a complete picture, Ms. Kelder. Now, are you experiencing any heartburn, indigestion, or difficulty swallowing?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, actually. The heartburn…it comes and goes. Especially after I try to eat something. And sometimes, yes, it’s hard to swallow. Not all the time, but…sometimes food just feels like it’s stuck. It’s not painful, really, but…uncomfortable. I usually have a glass of water and it goes down eventually. It’s been happening more lately, I think. It's just…another thing. Everything seems to be just…wrong. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's review your medical history. Do you have a list of your current medications with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now that's a good question. I have a little bag somewhere… Let me see…a grocery list, a picture of my granddaughter, some hard candies… Oh! Here we go. It’s a mess, I know. My daughter keeps telling me to organize it. I take something for my blood pressure, and something for my arthritis…and a little something to help me sleep. That's all I can think of right now. I’m sorry it's not very organized. It’s hard to keep track of everything these days.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril 20mg daily, Ibuprofen as needed, and Trazodone 50mg nightly. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… I don’t think so. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, not that I can remember. My daughter always asks me that, and I always tell her no. She worries a lot. I used to be allergic to bee stings when I was a little girl, but I haven’t been stung in…oh, goodness, decades. I think I’m fine. I don’t think I have any allergies. But if I start feeling funny after something, I’ll be sure to let you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, Ms. Kelder, I’m going to need to perform a brief physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, palpate your abdomen, and check your reflexes. Please lie down on the examination table.
PATIENT: Oh, alright, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. It’s been a while since I had a proper examination. I hope I’m not too much trouble. Is it cold in here? I think I brought a shawl…just in case.
DOCTOR: Please lie on your back, Ms. Kelder. And no, the temperature is within acceptable parameters. Take a deep breath...and another...Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, but with mild age-related reduction in intensity. Now, is there any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Taking a deep breath…and another… Ooh, that’s a little tender, there, on the right side. Not awful, just…uncomfortable. Like a dull ache, maybe? And a little bit…full. It feels like something's pressing on me. It’s been like that for a while now. I don’t know if that makes sense. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Mild tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant, consistent with possible hepatomegaly or cholecystitis. No rebound tenderness or guarding noted. Now, let’s check your reflexes… Patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Achilles reflexes are diminished, but symmetrical.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Just let me know if it hurts, dear. My legs always feel a little…tingly, you know? I thought it was just getting older. What do you think is going on, Doctor? Is it something serious? I’m getting a little worried now. I just want to feel normal again, like I used to.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kelder, based on the limited examination and your reported symptoms, several possibilities exist. The nausea, lack of appetite, weight loss, and right upper quadrant tenderness suggest a potential gastrointestinal issue. The diminished reflexes are consistent with age-related changes, but do warrant monitoring. I’m ordering a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and an abdominal ultrasound to rule out cholecystitis, hepatomegaly, or other structural abnormalities. We’ll also check your TSH to rule out thyroid issues.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. So many tests… Is it something bad, Doctor? Like…cancer? My sister, bless her heart, she had cancer a few years back…and it wasn’t pretty. I just…I just want to know what’s going on. And is this going to be expensive? I’m on Medicare, but… Will the tests tell you what’s wrong? And how long will it take? I don’t want to wait too long. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Ms. Kelder, please try to remain calm. It is far too early to speculate about cancer. The tests are necessary to rule out various possibilities and determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. Medicare should cover the majority of the cost, but billing can be…complex. The lab results and ultrasound report should be available within five to seven business days. I will schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. In the meantime, I recommend a bland diet – avoid fatty, fried, or spicy foods. And drink plenty of fluids. We’ll take things one step at a time. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. One step at a time… A bland diet…that sounds…difficult. I love my fried chicken, you know? But I’ll try. I’ll try anything to feel better. Well…I guess I just hope it’s not serious. And…will the tests hurt? I don’t like needles. And…what if it is something bad? What then? I don’t want to be a burden to my daughter. She’s got her own life… .
DOCTOR: The blood draw is a minor discomfort, Ms. Kelder. And the ultrasound is non-invasive. We will address any concerns as they arise. It is unproductive to speculate about worst-case scenarios at this juncture. Focus on adhering to the recommended diet and attending your follow-up appointment. I believe that is all for today. The lab technician will be with you shortly to collect the blood sample. Have a good day, Ms. Kelder. .
