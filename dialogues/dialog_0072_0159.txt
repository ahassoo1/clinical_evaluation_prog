DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Fratoni. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 26 years old. I see you're here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Morning, Doc. Yeah, that’s me. Twenty-six… feels longer some days, honestly. Uh, well, it’s kinda weird. I just… have a hard time gettin’ up outta chairs sometimes. Like, it takes effort, you know? Not always, but often enough that it’s botherin’ me.
DOCTOR: I see. Difficulty rising from a chair. And you say it's not consistent – it happens “often enough” to be bothersome. Could you elaborate on that, please?
PATIENT: Yeah, sorry, I ain’t the best at explainin’ things. It’s not like… every single time. Like, if I’ve been sittin’ for a long time, especially if it's a soft chair… it's worse. Or if I'm really tired after work. But sometimes I can just… pop right up. It's just… unpredictable, I guess. And it feels like I gotta push to get goin'. It doesn't really hurt, just… takes somethin’ extra.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, it seems to be exacerbated by prolonged sitting, particularly in softer chairs, and when you're fatigued. No actual pain, just a sensation of needing extra effort. Have you noticed any weakness in your legs, or any tingling or numbness accompanying this difficulty?
PATIENT: Nah, no tingle-y stuff. And my legs feel… normal, I guess. Strong enough. I do a lot of walkin’ at work, and liftin’. I mean, it’s oil fields, there's always somethin’ to lift. No weakness, nothin’ like that. Just… the gettin’ up part. It’s kinda frustrating, ya know? Makes me feel old.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration. It's good that you haven't experienced weakness or numbness. Oil field work is physically demanding, so that’s positive. Let’s go through some other questions to get a better picture of what might be going on. Do you have any past medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I was a pretty healthy kid, always runnin’ around. Nothing serious, ever. Had the usual colds and stuff. When I was… younger, I broke my arm once, fallin' outta a tree. But that healed up fine. Other than that… nothin’. Honestly, this whole chair thing is kinda outta nowhere. My wife… she passed last year, and… well, things kinda changed after that, but I still went to work every day. This just started maybe… six months ago?
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry to hear about your wife. That must have been incredibly difficult. It's important to note when symptoms arise in relation to significant life events. Six months ago, then. And no past surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Nope. No surgeries, no hospital stays. Just… normal check-ups when I was a kid, gettin' shots and stuff. Never needed anythin’ serious. I kinda avoided doctors if I could help it. Still do, to be honest. But this ain’t goin' away on its own. It’s startin’ to worry me a little, ya know? Especially if I gotta run or somethin’. Don’t wanna fall.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, but you're right to address it. It's good you're taking this seriously. Now, regarding your family history - are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Uh… that's a tough one. My wife's family, yeah, a little bit of high blood pressure on her mom’s side, I think. But my family… my dad, he worked the oil fields his whole life, tough as nails. He’s still goin’ strong, actually. My grandma… she had arthritis, I think, in her hands. But other than that… not really. We didn’t really talk about health stuff much. Just… work, and bein’ tough, ya know? We were Aztec, we were taught to handle things ourselves. It wasn’t really somethin’ we discussed.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Nah, never touched ‘em. My wife hated ‘em, and I didn't want to start after she... well. And I don't really drink much either. Maybe a beer with the guys now and then, but nothin' regular. Mostly just work, and tryin’ to keep busy. I eat… okay, I guess. Whatever’s quick and easy, mostly. Not a lot of fancy cookin’ goin’ on around here. Usually somethin' I can throw on the grill.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a single one. Like I said, I try to avoid doctors when I can. I've always been pretty lucky, health-wise. Never needed anythin’. Just… this chair thing is new, and kinda scary, to be honest. I was hopin’ it was just somethin' I could work through, but it ain’t gettin' better.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Fratoni. I appreciate you being so thorough. Now, I'd like to conduct a quick physical examination to assess your strength, reflexes, and range of motion. This will help me to get a better understanding of what might be causing your difficulty rising from a chair. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do, Doc. I trust your judgement. Just… try not to make me look too silly, alright? I ain’t the most coordinated guy. Still, thank you for takin' the time to listen, and tryin’ to figure this out. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Fratoni. No need to worry about looking silly. This is a routine examination, and I'll explain everything as we go along. First, let’s have you stand up from this chair. I’ll observe how you do it. Please do it at your own pace. And if you feel any pain or discomfort, please let me know immediately. Okay. Now, please walk a few steps for me, normally. Alright. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Please sit back down. I’ll start with your knees.
PATIENT: Alright. Whatever you need. My knees… they feel fine, usually. Just… this gettin’ up part. It’s kinda weird. I ain’t used to bein’ so… awkward.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are present, but a bit weaker than expected. Now, I’d like you to resist as I try to push your leg down, and then pull your foot up. This will assess your strength. Please push and pull as hard as you can. Okay. And finally, I'm going to check your range of motion in your hips and ankles. Please lie down on the examination table. Alright. That's all for the physical examination.
PATIENT: Okay, done. What do you think, Doc? What’s wrong with me? Is it somethin’ serious? I gotta get back to work, ya know? Can’t afford to be laid up.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Fratoni. Based on your history and the physical exam, I don’t believe it's something immediately serious, but we need to investigate further. Your symptoms – the difficulty rising from a chair, the slight weakness in your legs, and the diminished reflexes – suggest possible weakness in your lower extremities. However, it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further testing. It could be related to several things, including deconditioning due to prolonged sitting, a mild form of neuropathy, or even early signs of a muscle disorder. The fact that you recently experienced a significant life event, the loss of your wife, could also be a contributing factor. Stress and grief can manifest in physical symptoms. I’d like to order some blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions. These tests will include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a vitamin D level. I also recommend a nerve conduction study to assess the function of your nerves. This will help us determine if there is any nerve damage contributing to your symptoms. Do you have any allergies to any medications or contrast dyes?
PATIENT: Uh… allergies? No, not that I know of. Never had any problems with medicine before. I just… try to avoid it when I can. What about the nerve thing? Will that hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I really need to know if I can still work. That's… important.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Fratoni. The nerve conduction study involves placing small electrodes on your skin to measure the electrical activity of your nerves. There may be some mild discomfort, like a tingling sensation, but it's generally well-tolerated. It typically takes about 30-60 minutes to complete. The blood tests should be back within a few days, and the results of the nerve conduction study should be available in about a week. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of treatment. In the meantime, I recommend that you avoid any strenuous activity that exacerbates your symptoms. And I would also like to refer you to a physical therapist for an evaluation. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your legs and improve your balance and coordination. Do you have insurance?
PATIENT: No, I don't have insurance. Not since… well, not for a long time. My wife's insurance didn't cover much, and I haven’t been able to afford it since she passed. How much is all this gonna cost, Doc? I ain’t got a lot of money. I can pay somethin’, but I need to know. And what if… what if it's somethin’ serious?
DOCTOR: I understand your situation, Mr. Fratroni. I’m aware that the cost of medical care can be a significant burden, especially without insurance. Let me see what resources are available to help. Our clinic does have a financial assistance program for patients who qualify. I will have our billing department contact you to discuss your options. The cost of the blood tests is relatively low, approximately $75. The nerve conduction study is more expensive, around $300, but we can explore options for discounted rates or payment plans. In the meantime, I recommend continuing to avoid strenuous activities and resting your legs when possible. I’ll write you a referral to a physical therapist. We can start with a basic exercise program to see if it improves your symptoms. If, after the tests, we find something concerning, we can discuss further treatment options, and I'll do my best to help you find affordable care. I also want to emphasize that even if it is something serious, many conditions are manageable with appropriate treatment. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… better. Thank you, Doc. That really means a lot. Uh… yeah, one question. You said it could be from stress? From… grievin’? Can exercises really help with that? It just feels… weird to think muscles are involved in all this. It feels like somethin’ in my head, not my legs.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid question, Mr. Fratroni. It may seem counterintuitive, but there's a strong connection between your mind and your body. Grief and stress can manifest in physical symptoms like muscle tension, weakness, and fatigue. Exercise releases endorphins, which have mood-boosting effects and can help reduce stress and anxiety. It also improves blood flow to the brain, which can help with cognitive function and emotional regulation. Think of it this way: when you’re stressed, your muscles tense up, and your body goes into a fight-or-flight response. Exercise helps to release that tension and restore balance. It might not be a cure-all, but it can be a valuable tool in managing your symptoms and improving your overall well-being. We can start with gentle exercises and gradually increase the intensity as you feel more comfortable. The physical therapist can help you develop a program that's tailored to your needs and abilities. I'm also happy to provide you with resources for grief counseling or support groups if you're interested. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all for now, Doc. Thank you. Really. You've been a big help. Just… let me know about the money stuff, and when I can schedule the tests. And I’ll think about the… exercise. It sounds… okay, actually. Maybe better than just sittin’ around feelin’ sorry for myself.
