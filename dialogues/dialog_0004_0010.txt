DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Tomassoni. I'm Dr. Deschane. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it's a bit difficult to explain precisely. I’ve noticed some swelling, yes. It’s been…present for a little while now, I believe. Though, honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be, so pinpointing when is tricky.
DOCTOR: Swelling, alright. And where exactly are you noticing this swelling, Mr. Tomassoni?
PATIENT: Primarily here, Doctor. Around my neck, mostly. It feels…fuller than usual, if that makes sense? And sometimes a little…tender to the touch. It’s not painful, exactly, but…noticeable. I apologize for being so vague. I wish I could be more specific.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, we’ll get there. “Fuller than usual” is a good start. Has this swelling been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Hmm… I believe it comes and goes, yes. There are days when it’s barely there, and others…like today, when it’s quite prominent. I haven’t been able to identify anything specific that makes it worse or better, though. It just…happens. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Frustrating, I understand. And has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed…? That’s a good question. Let me think… Not that I’m aware of, no. My routine is fairly…consistent. I work, I eat, I sleep. Perhaps a little more stress at work lately, if anything. But nothing major, Doctor. I truly don't recall anything out of the ordinary that would explain this.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is there any difficulty with swallowing, or breathing, or changes in your voice?
PATIENT: Swallowing… no, I don’t believe so. Breathing, either. No trouble there. My voice… hmm. That’s a good question. I haven’t particularly noticed a change, but… I suppose it's possible. It’s difficult to self-assess, isn't it? I wouldn’t know if it sounds different unless someone pointed it out. I apologize for being unhelpful.
DOCTOR: It’s alright. We’ll see. Let's do a quick examination, Mr. Tomassoni. I'm going to palpate your neck to assess the swelling and check for any abnormalities. Please just relax. If you could just sit up here for me.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Please, do whatever you need to. I'll remain as still as possible.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to feel for any enlarged lymph nodes or masses. Just breathe normally. I’m noting some mild enlargement of the submandibular lymph nodes bilaterally. They are soft, mobile, and slightly tender to the touch. No obvious masses are palpated at this time. Thyroid is normal to auscultation. Any pain with this palpation?
PATIENT: A little… yes, right there. It’s not sharp, more of a… dull ache, really. But definitely noticeable. It's…uncomfortable, but not unbearable. I'm glad you asked. I wasn't sure if I should mention it, as I didn't want to seem… dramatic.
DOCTOR: Dull ache noted with palpation of the right submandibular region. Right. Well, that’s… helpful. Do you have any history of thyroid problems, Mr. Tomassoni?
PATIENT: Thyroid problems… hmm. That’s… another good question. I believe not. As far as I recall, I’ve never been diagnosed with anything related to my thyroid. My family… I don’t believe anyone on either side has either. But, again, my memory is… unreliable. Perhaps my medical records would be more informative? I apologize for being so vague. This is rather unsettling.
DOCTOR: We'll check your records. And have you noticed any changes in your weight, appetite, energy levels, or bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Weight… no, I don’t believe so. I’ve maintained a fairly stable weight for some time now. Appetite is… normal, I suppose. Nothing drastically different. Energy levels… perhaps a little lower lately, but I attribute that to stress at work. And bowel habits… no significant changes there either, thankfully. I apologize; I feel like I'm offering little in the way of useful information. This is… frustrating for both of us, I imagine.
DOCTOR: Let me just pull up your records here. Hmm… alright. No prior diagnoses of thyroid issues. Last physical was… two years ago. No mention of any neck swelling. No abnormal lab results. Alright. I’m going to order a complete blood count and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, just to rule out anything obvious. We'll also do a metabolic panel to get a broader overview of your health.
PATIENT: That sounds… sensible, Doctor. I appreciate you being thorough. A complete blood count and a TSH test… and a metabolic panel, you said? I trust your judgment completely. Please, let me know if there’s anything else I can do to assist. And… when should I expect the results? I’m a little anxious, I confess.
DOCTOR: It's standard procedure, Mr. Tomassoni. The lab should have the results back within three to five business days. I'll have my assistant contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once we have them. In the meantime, if you experience any difficulty breathing, or any significant changes in your symptoms, seek immediate medical attention. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Let me see. No, I don't believe so. I've never had any adverse reactions to any medications, as far as I'm aware. No allergies to penicillin, no food allergies, nothing like that. I'm quite fortunate in that regard, I suppose. Although, again, my memory isn't what it used to be. I could be forgetting something, but I genuinely don't think so. Is there anything else you require, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am not currently taking any medications. Nothing at all. I prefer to avoid them if possible. Just… vitamins occasionally, but nothing regular. I strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and thankfully haven't had the need for prescription drugs. I hope that’s not a problem?
DOCTOR: No, that’s fine. Just needed to be certain. Alright, Mr. Tomassoni. We’ve covered most of the basics. We'll await the lab results and then discuss the next steps. For now, I wouldn't worry unduly. It's likely something benign. Here’s the lab requisition. Any questions before you go?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That’s…reassuring, to hear. No, I believe that covers everything for now. I appreciate your thoroughness and your patience with my… lack of clarity. I will head to the lab as soon as possible. Thank you again, Doctor Deschane. And please, let me know if there's anything else I should do or be aware of.
DOCTOR: Just follow up with my assistant to schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are in. Have a good day, Mr. Tomassoni.
