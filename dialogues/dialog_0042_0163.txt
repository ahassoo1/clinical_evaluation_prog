DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Vodzak. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. A pleasure to make your acquaintance as well. Well, it’s rather a silly thing, truth be told. I’ve been…experimenting, let’s call it, with some rather drastic eating plans. My daughter – bless her heart – suggested I come speak with a professional before I do something entirely foolish. She worries, you see. And honestly? I suspect she’s right to. It’s all these newfangled diets popping up online… quite bewildering.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Vantine. It is quite overwhelming with all the information available these days, and it’s very wise of you to seek advice. It's good you have a daughter who looks out for you. So, these “drastic eating plans” – can you tell me a little more about what they involve?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, the first one was… the "Air Diet," as it were. Rather self-explanatory, I suppose. One consumes only air. For three days, mind you. Utterly exhausting, and quite unpleasant. Then there was the "Cotton Ball Diet." Now, that was a mistake. Highly indigestible, and caused a… considerable disturbance. Most recently, I attempted a purely grape-based regimen. Purple grapes, specifically. For five days. It was… monotonous, to say the least. And I believe I turned a rather alarming shade of violet. My daughter nearly fainted.
DOCTOR: Goodness me, Mr. Vantine. Those all sound… incredibly challenging, and frankly, quite dangerous. It’s good you have a supportive daughter – and that you haven't continued them for long. These types of diets can have serious consequences for your health. Let’s put those aside for now. To get a better understanding of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about any medical conditions you've been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, I had a rather nasty bout of pneumonia back in ‘68, during a particularly cold winter shoot in Scotland. Recovered fully, thankfully. Beyond that… I suppose I have the usual aches and pains for a man of my age. Arthritis in my hands, makes animating rather difficult on occasion. And my doctor – old Dr. Hemmings, retired now – diagnosed mild hypertension some years ago. It’s generally well-controlled with medication, though. I take a small pill each morning. Otherwise, relatively sound, I believe, for eighty-five years.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Vantine. Pneumonia is certainly something we want to be aware of, and it’s helpful to know about the arthritis and hypertension. You mentioned a medication for the hypertension – do you recall the name of it?
PATIENT: Ah, let me see… it’s been some time since I actively memorized these things. It's a small, white pill, and the name… begins with an “A,” I believe. Amlodipine, yes! That’s it. Amlodipine, five milligrams, taken daily. I believe it’s a calcium channel blocker, though I confess I don’t fully understand the intricacies of its function. My wife – God rest her soul – always handled the medication details.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, 5mg daily. That's very helpful, Mr. Vantine. And it's perfectly understandable that you don't recall all the details - it's a lot to keep track of, and you’re right to rely on those who support you. It’s quite common to take medication for hypertension as we age. Now, have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. A rather unfortunate incident involving a rogue prop during the filming of “The Martian Menace” back in ‘72. A section of a spaceship model… fell rather dramatically. Required a rather extensive repair to my left shoulder. And… a rather less exciting, but necessary, appendectomy in my youth. Perhaps… sixty years ago? Both procedures were successful, thankfully, with no lasting complications. Though the shoulder does occasionally ache in cold weather.
DOCTOR: Right, shoulder repair and appendectomy. Good to know. The shoulder ache is worth noting – it’s not uncommon to have some residual discomfort after surgery, especially with changes in the weather. Now, thinking about your family, are there any medical conditions that run in your family that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see. My mother suffered from diabetes, unfortunately. Type 2, I believe. And my father had… heart trouble. A rather sudden heart attack, as I recall. No prior warning. My sister, bless her, has osteoporosis. Rather frail now, and prone to fractures. Beyond that… not particularly, as far as I’m aware. A fairly healthy bunch, all things considered. Though my great-uncle Bartholomew was convinced he could communicate with squirrels. But I don’t believe that’s a hereditary condition.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, we can certainly exclude squirrel communication! Thank you for sharing that, Mr. Vantine. Diabetes, heart trouble, and osteoporosis are all important to know. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Well, as you can likely surmise from my age, I’m rather… retired these days. No more dashing about on film sets, thankfully. I spend most of my time at home, reading, listening to music – primarily classical, though I have a fondness for old jazz standards – and tinkering with miniatures. I used to be a rather avid gardener, but my arthritis makes bending rather difficult now. I live alone, as I mentioned, my wife passed some years ago. I have a daughter, Penelope, who is most attentive, thankfully. She visits frequently and ensures I’m not entirely neglecting myself. I enjoy a small glass of sherry with dinner, occasionally. And I do confess to a fondness for biscuits.
DOCTOR: That sounds lovely, Mr. Vantine. A quiet but fulfilling life. And it's wonderful to have such a supportive daughter. A small glass of sherry and the occasional biscuit – perfectly reasonable. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm, that’s a good question. Let me see… No, not that I’m aware of. I’ve never had any adverse reactions to any medication I’ve taken. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard. I’ve never experienced any food allergies, thankfully. Though I’ve always been rather cautious about shellfish. Not an aversion, per se, but I've always found the texture… unsettling. And I have a slight aversion to bees, naturally. But that's more a matter of general apprehension than an actual allergic reaction.
DOCTOR: Right, no known allergies, a slight apprehension towards bees – perfectly understandable. That completes the initial questions, Mr. Vantine. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination, if you don't mind. This will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a general check of your reflexes and mobility. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please proceed. I haven’t had a proper check-up in… well, rather too long, I suspect. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Though I must warn you, my joints may protest slightly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Vantine. We'll take things slowly and gently. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Blood pressure is slightly elevated at 142 over 88. We’ll keep an eye on that. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take some deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular, but there’s a slight murmur. Lungs are clear, but there is some diminished breath sounds at the bases. Reflexes are a little slow, as expected for your age. Mobility is somewhat limited in your joints, particularly your hands, consistent with arthritis. Alright, Mr. Vantine. That completes the physical examination. Everything appears consistent with your age and medical history, but the slightly elevated blood pressure and diminished breath sounds warrant some further investigation.
PATIENT: I see. Further investigation, you say? Rather alarming, is it? I confess I’ve always been a bit… constitutionally weak. Perhaps it’s simply the natural decline of age. But I appreciate you being thorough, Doctor. What sort of investigation are you proposing? And… will it be unpleasant? I’m rather averse to needles, you see.
DOCTOR: Not alarming, Mr. Vantine, simply prudent. It's always best to understand what's going on. The slightly elevated blood pressure requires monitoring, and the diminished breath sounds could indicate a minor chest infection or some mild congestion. As for investigation, I'd like to order a few simple tests. Firstly, a complete blood count to rule out any infection. Secondly, a basic metabolic panel to assess your kidney function and electrolyte levels. And finally, a chest X-ray to get a better look at your lungs. As for needles, the blood tests will require a small blood sample, but it's a quick procedure. We can also use a numbing cream if you're particularly anxious. The chest X-ray doesn't involve any needles at all. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: That… sounds rather less daunting than I anticipated. No extensive poking and prodding, thankfully. A small blood sample and a picture of my lungs. Manageable, yes, quite manageable. And the numbing cream is a thoughtful suggestion, Doctor. Perhaps I shall avail myself of that. My nerves are not what they once were, you see. So, a blood sample and an X-ray. And then what? Will I need to return for further tests, or will you be able to determine a course of action based on these initial findings?
DOCTOR: Excellent, Mr. Vantine. I'm glad to hear that sounds manageable. The lab technician will draw the blood sample right here in the examination room, and we can schedule the chest X-ray for tomorrow morning at the imaging center just across the street. Once we have the results, we’ll review them together and determine the appropriate course of action. In many cases, these tests will simply confirm that everything is as expected, and we can focus on managing your blood pressure with lifestyle modifications and possibly medication adjustments. If we find anything concerning, we’ll discuss further testing and treatment options. I’ll write you a requisition form for the blood work and a referral for the chest X-ray. Penelope can assist with scheduling the X-ray if you’d like. Does that sound satisfactory?
PATIENT: That sounds… remarkably sensible, Doctor. A reasonable plan, clearly articulated. Yes, Penelope would be most helpful with scheduling the X-ray. She's far more adept at navigating these bureaucratic matters than I am. Lifestyle modifications, you say? What sort of modifications are you envisioning? Less sherry, perhaps? Fewer biscuits? I suspect my daughter will be pleased to hear that suggestion. She’s always been rather insistent on a healthier regimen. Very well. Less sherry and fewer biscuits it is. Lead on, Doctor. Let us vanquish this elevated blood pressure.
DOCTOR: A moderate reduction in sherry and biscuits would certainly be a good start, Mr. Vantine! But more importantly, we'll focus on a balanced diet, regular gentle exercise – even a short walk each day can make a difference – and stress reduction. We can discuss these in more detail once we have the test results. I'll also provide you with a handout outlining some helpful resources for managing hypertension. And, as promised, here are the requisitions for the blood work and the chest X-ray referral. Do you have any questions for me before we conclude today’s consultation?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe you’ve addressed all my concerns admirably. You’ve been most patient and thorough, and remarkably reassuring. A gentleman couldn’t ask for more. I shall endeavor to follow your instructions regarding the sherry and biscuits, and I leave my well-being in your capable hands. Thank you again for your time and expertise. And… thank you for not judging my eccentric dietary experiments. I believe that concludes my part. Perhaps… perhaps we shall meet again when the results are available?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vantine. And no judgement at all! It’s always best to be proactive about one’s health, even if it involves a few misguided experiments along the way. Yes, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available. My receptionist will contact you to arrange a convenient time. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or significant fatigue – please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. It was a pleasure meeting you, Mr. Vantine. And please, do take care of yourself.
