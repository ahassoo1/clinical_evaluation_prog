DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s rather embarrassing, to be frank. I seem to be going to the restroom… a great deal. More than usual, certainly. It’s been going on for a little while now, I believe. Though pinning down when it started is proving difficult. I apologize for the vagueness.
DOCTOR: Right. Frequent urination. It is best to be specific, honestly. “A little while now” doesn’t give me much to work with. But we'll get there. Let’s start with this: is it only frequent urination, or are you experiencing any urgency?
PATIENT: Urgency… hmm. Yes, I believe so. A sudden need to go, quite insistent at times. It’s not always… predictable. Sometimes I have time, other times… not so much. It’s… disruptive, shall we say? I don’t recall this happening before, though, as I said, my memory isn’t what it once was. Is that what you mean by urgency, Doctor? The sudden, compelling need?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's exactly what I meant. Sudden, compelling need. Good. That narrows things down slightly. And is it painful when you urinate?
PATIENT: Painful… no, not precisely. There’s no sharp pain, thankfully. Sometimes a little discomfort, a slight burning sensation perhaps, but it’s fleeting. It’s hardly noticeable most of the time, to be honest. It’s more the… inconvenience, and the sheer frequency of it all. I find myself constantly… aware of where the nearest restroom is. It’s rather undignified for a man of my age.
DOCTOR: Right. So, frequent urination, urgency, and occasional mild burning. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color and smell… that’s a good question. I confess, I haven’t been paying close attention. I suppose it looks normal. Pale yellow, as it should be, I presume. And I haven’t detected any unusual odors, no. Though my sense of smell isn’t what it used to be either, I’m afraid. I apologize for being so… imprecise, Doctor. It’s just… things aren’t as clear as they once were.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on. Do you have any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever or chills… no, I don’t believe so. I haven’t taken my temperature, but I haven’t felt feverish. No shivering or anything of that nature. And abdominal pain… well, sometimes a slight discomfort, a general feeling of… fullness, perhaps. But nothing severe, nothing that would cause me to seek medical attention on its own. It comes and goes, really. Is that helpful, Doctor? I’m trying my best to recall everything.
DOCTOR: It's… something. Now, have you noticed any changes in your thirst?
PATIENT: Thirst… yes, actually. Now that you mention it, I have been rather thirsty lately. More so than usual, certainly. I find myself reaching for water quite frequently. I’ve been attributing it to the warm weather, perhaps. But… now that I think about it, it could be related to this issue. I suppose I hadn’t made the connection before. It’s a bit of a puzzle, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Right. Increased thirst, frequent urination, urgency, mild burning… We need to rule a few things out. Have you had any recent illnesses, like a cold or the flu?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses… hmm. Let me see. I believe I had a bit of a cold a few months ago, perhaps in March? It was nothing serious, just a stuffy nose and a cough. It cleared up on its own, quite quickly, as I recall. Nothing beyond the usual seasonal ailment, I assure you. I haven’t been feeling unwell recently, aside from this… peculiar situation with my bladder. I do try to stay healthy, Doctor. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, Mr. Verbos, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, and I'd like to order a urinalysis and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and blood sugar. It’s standard procedure, given your symptoms. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I’m aware of. Nothing significant, at least. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. Perhaps a slight sensitivity to certain pollens during the spring, but nothing that requires medication. A bit of sneezing, that's all. Is that what you mean, Doctor? Serious allergies? No. I’m rather unremarkable, medically speaking, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let's get this over with. If you’ll just follow me to the examination room. I’ll need a urine sample first. There's a cup in the bathroom, and instructions on the counter. Try to collect a mid-stream sample, if you can. And please, try to be as precise as possible with your responses when I ask you questions during the exam. It helps me rule things out more quickly.
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. A mid-stream sample, you say? I'll do my best. It’s… a bit awkward, collecting samples at my age, but I understand it’s necessary. I’ll try to be as… precise as possible. Lead the way. And thank you for your patience, Doctor. I appreciate it.
DOCTOR: Alright, have a seat. I'll be back in a moment with the collection cup. And please, don’t feel embarrassed. It's all part of the process. Here you are. Take your time. I'll be just outside. Let me know when you’ve collected the sample.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. Thank you. I shall endeavour to be as… thorough as possible. Mid-stream… right. This is… quite a process.
