DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s about my bruising. It's been getting worse, and I'm on… well, a blood thinner. I take it every day. It just feels like I bump into stuff and end up with a huge mark. It's a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Hmm. A blood thinner, you say?
PATIENT: Yep. The red pills. I think it's called… Warfarin? Something like that. My regular doctor prescribed it after… well, after the clot. It was in my leg. But now, even little things… I’m bruising like crazy. I don’t remember changing anything about how I take it, or anything else, really.
DOCTOR: Warfarin, yes. I see the history of a deep vein thrombosis in the left leg, diagnosed approximately one year ago. And you’ve been on a stable dose of 5mg daily since then, according to the records. Now, when you say “little things,” can you give me a specific example of a recent incident and the size of the bruise that developed?
PATIENT: Okay, um… let me think. Yesterday, I was carrying groceries – just a normal bag, not super heavy – and I bumped my arm on the doorframe. Not hard, honestly. Usually, it wouldn't even leave a mark. But this time? It’s… maybe the size of my hand now? And it’s really purple. Like, a dark, dark purple. It's on my forearm. It didn’t even hurt that bad when I bumped it. That's what's weird.
DOCTOR: Alright. A hand-sized bruise developing from a minor bump, with minimal pain… That is concerning, especially given you're on Warfarin. We need to investigate why your bruising is increasing despite a stable medication dose. First, let's go through a more detailed history. Have you noticed any other bleeding – nosebleeds, bleeding gums when brushing your teeth, heavier menstrual periods than usual, or blood in your stool or urine?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. My periods are… regular, I guess. Maybe a little heavier than they used to be, now that you mention it, but not a lot. And no nosebleeds, no bleeding gums, definitely no blood in anything. Just… the bruising. It's really just the bruising that’s different. And it's getting me worried about falling or something and really hurting myself.
DOCTOR: Okay. Increased bruising with otherwise normal bleeding patterns. Now, have you started any new medications, vitamins, or herbal supplements recently?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I take the Warfarin, and I take a multivitamin every morning. That’s it. I did try some ginger tea last week for my stomach, but that was just for a couple of days. Not a supplement, just tea. I stopped it when it didn't help. Nothing else, I promise. I’m pretty careful about mixing things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your diet?
PATIENT: My diet? Well, I eat… normal stuff. I try to eat healthy, you know? Lots of vegetables, some fish, chicken… I like my taro, but I don't eat that much of it. I don’t drink a lot of alcohol, maybe a glass of wine on the weekend sometimes. Why is my diet important? Is that affecting the bruising? I really don’t change anything, so I’m not sure what's going on.
DOCTOR: Diet can affect how Warfarin works, specifically foods high in Vitamin K can interfere with it. But given you haven’t changed anything, we'll need to look at other possibilities. I'm going to need to perform a physical examination. Can you please lie down on the examination table?
PATIENT: Okay, sure. Examination table, right. No problem. I hope it’s nothing serious. I really don’t like being poked and prodded, but I understand you need to check things.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hainley. I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll take a look at the bruise on your forearm. I’ll also check for any other unexplained bruising. Heart sounds are normal. Lungs are clear. The bruise is significant in size, as you described – approximately 10cm in diameter. It's tender to palpation, but not acutely painful. No signs of active bleeding. No swelling or warmth around the site. I notice some smaller, older bruises on your lower legs. No acute injuries apparent. Skin is generally normal in appearance. Alright. Based on the physical exam, there’s no immediate cause for alarm, but the size of the bruise and the presence of other unexplained bruising is concerning. We need to check your INR level. It's a blood test that measures how long it takes your blood to clot, and it's how we monitor Warfarin.
PATIENT: Okay. INR level… right. So, my blood is clotting too slow or something? Is that what that means? I don't like needles, but if you need to check it, I guess you need to check it. How long will it take to get the results? And what happens if it is too slow? Will I need more tests?
DOCTOR: Precisely. The INR test tells us how well your Warfarin is working. A higher INR means your blood is taking longer to clot, which can increase your risk of bleeding. A lower INR means it's not working effectively enough, putting you at risk of clots. We’ll draw some blood right here in the office. It usually takes about 10-15 minutes to process. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine if any adjustments to your Warfarin dose are needed. Depending on the results, we may need further testing to rule out any underlying causes for the increased bruising, such as a vitamin deficiency or a problem with your blood cells. But let's not jump ahead. We’ll get the INR first, and then we’ll go from there. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… reasonable. Get the test, see what the numbers say. I guess. The numbers are the numbers, right? Fine. Let’s just get it over with. Where do I go?
DOCTOR: The phlebotomist is just down the hall, in room three. They'll take care of drawing your blood. Once you're done, you can come back here, and we’ll wait for the results together. I'll let you know as soon as they're available. Is there anything I can get for you while you wait?
PATIENT: No, I'm alright, thank you. Just… get it over with. Hopefully it doesn’t take too long. I’ve got things to do, you know?
