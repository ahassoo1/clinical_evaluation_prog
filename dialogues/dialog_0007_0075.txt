DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. I'm Dr. Hernandez. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this daytime sleepiness, really. I’ve been using one of those machines at night – a CPAP, I think they call it – for my sleep apnea, and it is helping, but I’m still awfully tired during the day. It’s just… persistent, you know? It’s making things a bit difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Persistent daytime sleepiness even with CPAP use… that’s definitely something we need to look into. Just to clarify, how long have you been using the CPAP machine?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It must be… almost two years now. Yes, two years in March. And at first, it was wonderful! I felt like a new man. But this tiredness… it crept back, slowly. Not as bad as before the machine, mind you, but enough to be bothersome. It’s just… draining, really. I find myself napping in the afternoon, which I never used to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, two years. That’s good to know. And it sounds like the CPAP was initially very effective, but the benefit has decreased over time. Napping isn't ideal, and that suggests the sleepiness is significant. Let me just take a look at your records here… Okay, I see the sleep apnea diagnosis from Dr. Ramirez back in 2023. And it looks like your last CPAP compliance check was… six months ago?
PATIENT: Yes, Dr. Ramirez. A good doctor, she was. And six months ago… yes, that sounds about right. They called to check if I was still using it regularly, and I told them I was. Which I was, mostly. It's just… sometimes, when I travel, it’s a bit of a hassle to take with me, so I miss a night here and there. Nothing major, I thought. But maybe that's it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional non-compliance with the CPAP when traveling. That's definitely something we need to consider. Even a few nights of missed use can impact sleep quality. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your sleep. Besides the daytime sleepiness, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… Let me see. Well, my wife and I divorced about five years ago now, so things are… quieter at night, that’s for sure. But that’s not new, obviously. Physically… I don’t think so. No headaches, no snoring – well, not that I know of. My memory is… well, I'm 83, you know? It’s not what it used to be. But that’s just age, I suppose. Oh! And I wake up to pee more often these days. Now that I think about it. Not every night, but frequently. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely counts! The nocturia – waking up to urinate – is important information. And it’s good you mentioned the divorce; changes in life circumstances can certainly affect sleep patterns. Okay, so we have daytime sleepiness despite CPAP use, occasional non-compliance when traveling, nocturia, and a history of life changes. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any other health conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… I have high blood pressure, which I take medication for. A small dose, thankfully. And my cholesterol is a little high, but the doctor says it's nothing to worry about right now. Oh, and I had my prostate checked a few years back, and it was… enlarged, they said. But no treatment needed at the time. Just regular checkups. And I had a bout of pneumonia about ten years ago, but I recovered fully. I think that’s everything. Nothing major, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hypertension, high cholesterol, a history of an enlarged prostate, and a past episode of pneumonia. And you're currently taking medication for the blood pressure. Good. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just the blood pressure medication. A small white pill, I think it’s called Lisinopril. And… oh, sometimes I take a little something for my knees, when they act up. Ibuprofen, I suppose. But not every day, just when I’ve been walking a lot or something. And I take a multivitamin, just to be on the safe side. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril, occasional Ibuprofen for knee pain, and a multivitamin. Good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. I can eat anything, take most medications without issue. My wife used to joke that I had a cast-iron stomach. She was probably right. Nothing bothers me. I'm pretty lucky that way, actually. No hives, no breathing problems, nothing.
DOCTOR: That's excellent. So, no known allergies. Okay, Mr. Paske, we've covered a lot. Before we move on to a physical exam, I just want to ask about your family history. Do you know of any sleep disorders, heart problems, or other significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm, family history… Let me see. My father had high blood pressure, like me. And he also had some heart trouble later in life, but I don't recall the specifics. My mother, she was healthy as a horse, really. No major problems. My brother… he snored a lot, terribly, but I don’t think he ever got diagnosed with anything. And my sister… she had some trouble sleeping when she got older, but that was mostly anxiety, I think. Nothing really significant. Mostly just the usual aches and pains of getting old, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of hypertension, some heart trouble, and a possible predisposition to sleep difficulties. Thank you. Alright, Mr. Paske. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Just a basic check of your heart, lungs, and a neurological exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly fine, Doctor. Go right ahead. I'm used to doctors poking and prodding. It’s all part of getting old, I suppose. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Alright. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths for me. Heart sounds are regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated. Lung sounds are clear bilaterally, no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Good air entry in all fields. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and strength. Could you please hold out your arms?
PATIENT: Alright, here you go. Arms outstretched. Not as strong as they used to be, but they still work, I suppose. Do what you need to do, Doctor. Just let me know if anything is uncomfortable. I’m not ticklish, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. No focal neurological deficits noted. Cranial nerves II-XII are grossly intact. Now, I'm just going to gently feel your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, nothing there. Just a little… soft, maybe? I’m not as trim as I once was, but no pain or anything. Feel free to poke around. I’ve had a long life, and I’ve eaten a lot of good food.
DOCTOR: Abdomen is soft, non-distended, and non-tender. Mild abdominal adiposity noted. No organomegaly appreciated. Blood pressure is 138/82. Okay, Mr. Paske. Thank you for that exam. Everything seems within normal limits, although there is some abdominal adiposity which is not surprising given your history. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam, it sounds like the daytime sleepiness could be multifactorial. We need to consider several things.
PATIENT: Multifactorial, you say? That sounds… complicated. Is that bad? I just want to be able to get through the day without feeling like I need a nap every afternoon. I understand things aren't always simple, but what are we thinking? Is it the machine? Something else? Do you think I need more tests?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily "bad", Mr. Paske, just means we have a few possibilities to consider. The CPAP is a good start, but it doesn’t always solve the problem entirely. It's possible the CPAP isn’t optimally titrated – meaning the pressure setting isn’t quite right for you. Also, your nocturia could be disrupting your sleep. And, given your age and history of hypertension, we need to rule out other causes like heart failure or other medical conditions. I'd like to order a few tests to get a clearer picture. First, a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your overall health. Second, a sleep study – a repeat polysomnography – to re-evaluate your CPAP settings and rule out any other sleep disorders. And finally, a urinalysis to check for any infection or other abnormalities that could be contributing to the nocturia. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, Doctor. And I appreciate that. Yes, let's do those tests. A sleep study again… well, it’s not my favorite thing, but if it helps, I’m willing. And I understand checking everything else is important. The nocturia is bothersome, so finding out what’s causing that would be good. So, complete blood count, metabolic panel, another sleep study, and a urinalysis. Is there anything else? Do I need to do anything to prepare for these tests?
DOCTOR: No, that’s it for now, Mr. Paske. For the complete blood count and metabolic panel, you’ll need to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand – that means no food or drinks except water. For the urinalysis, you’ll just need to provide a sample first thing in the morning. The sleep study will be scheduled at the sleep lab. They’ll give you specific instructions on how to prepare. I'm also going to prescribe you a medication called Tamsulosin. It's an alpha-blocker that can help improve urine flow and reduce the frequency of nighttime urination. We can see if that helps alleviate your nocturia while we await the results of the tests. Here are your lab orders and the prescription. I’ll also have my nurse schedule a follow-up appointment with you in two weeks to discuss the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: That sounds very good, Doctor. So, fast for the blood work, give a urine sample in the morning, take the Tamsulosin, and follow up in two weeks. I think I can manage that. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I feel a bit better knowing we’re looking into this thoroughly. Hopefully, we can figure out what’s going on and get me back to feeling like myself again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. I’m glad I could help. Remember, don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll do everything we can to get you feeling better. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and get some rest.
