DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Paguió. So, you’re here today… what brings you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Havird, is it? Yes, that’s right. I’m here for a vaccination. I believe it’s time for a booster, but honestly, I get a little mixed up with the dates these days. They send me so many reminders! Is that what I’m here for, a booster shot?
DOCTOR: A booster, yes. It should be time for something, given your age. Though honestly, these reminders are a mess. Let's not rely on those. I'll pull up your records here… just a moment. Okay, it says here you had your initial series and one booster already. Are you up to date on the updated COVID vaccine as well?
PATIENT: Oh, good. I was worried I was forgetting something important! Updated COVID… hmm. You know, I think I got one of those last fall, but I really don’t remember exactly when. I was trying to keep up, but things got a bit hectic around the holidays, and… well, you know how it is. Is there a way to check? I don’t want to double up on anything.
DOCTOR: Let me see… ah. Yes, it appears you received the updated COVID vaccine on October 27th of last year. So, you're good there, thankfully. No need to repeat that one. Now, are you here for anything else besides ensuring you're up-to-date on vaccinations?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a relief! October… yes, that sounds right. No, no, nothing else today. Just making sure everything is as it should be. I like to stay on top of these things, you know? It's good to be prepared. My mother always said that. So, about this booster… what exactly are we boosting against this time? Is it the same as before?
DOCTOR: It’s… it’s a reformulated version of the previous ones, to better match the circulating strains. Honestly, they change it so often it’s hard to keep track. It’s still influenza, of course. The usual seasonal flu shot. It's recommended annually, as the virus mutates. Do you have any allergies that I should be aware of before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, influenza, right. Yes, I remember getting those every year. The strains… well, that’s why I get confused! Allergies… hmm. Let me see. No, not really. I used to have a bit of a reaction to bee stings when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. Nothing that affects vaccines, I don't think. Just a little itchy sometimes, that’s all. Is that something to worry about?
DOCTOR: Bee stings… okay, good to know, but shouldn't affect the flu shot. It’s a very mild reaction. Just local redness and swelling at the injection site is what we’re looking for. We'll administer it in your left deltoid. Please roll up your sleeve. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Left deltoid… right. I’m not much of a medical person, you see. I just want to make sure I’m protected. Go ahead, Doctor. I'm ready when you are. Though, if it stings… well, don't be surprised! Just a little joke.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it shouldn't be too bad. It's a standard injection, shouldn't be much more than a little pinch. Try to relax your arm. There we go. All done. Just a little pressure there. Keep that on for about fifteen minutes.
PATIENT: Oh! That was quick. A little pinch, you said? Yes, that was… manageable. Fifteen minutes, alright. Is there anything I should be watching out for afterwards? Like, if I get a fever or something? I don't want to worry unnecessarily. My sister gets very anxious when I have things like this done.
DOCTOR: A mild fever, some muscle aches, fatigue… those are all possible, but usually resolve within 24-48 hours. Nothing to be overly concerned about unless it’s a high fever – over 101.5 – or you develop difficulty breathing. If either of those happen, contact your primary care physician immediately. Otherwise, just rest and drink plenty of fluids. And try not to let your sister worry too much. It’s a standard vaccine. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh, over 101.5… alright, I’ll remember that. And I'll try to reassure my sister, she can be a bit much sometimes. No, I think that's everything, Doctor. Thank you for your help. And for being patient with my… forgetfulness. I appreciate it. I’ll just sit here for fifteen minutes like you said, then I guess I’ll be on my way. Have a good day!
DOCTOR: Alright. Just let the nurse know if you experience any concerning symptoms before you leave. Have a good day as well, Mr. Paguió. Stop.
