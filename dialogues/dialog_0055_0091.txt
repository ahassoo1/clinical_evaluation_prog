DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Zicarelli. I am Dr. Eaddy. Please, have a seat. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Thank you. Well, is just… I does be feeling very thirsty all the time, you know? And hungry too. Even after I eat a good plate of food, I still feel like I need more. It not making sense.
DOCTOR: Thirsty and hungry, even after eating… I see. And how long has this been going on, Ms. Zicarelli?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Is start, I think, maybe… two, three months now? Is not one day thing, you know. Is happening on and off, but more and more lately. Is really bothering me. I does drink a lot of water, and still feel dry.
DOCTOR: Two to three months… and it's been progressively worsening, you say. Has anything changed in your diet or lifestyle around the time this started?
PATIENT: Well… not really. I does eat what I always eat. Rice and peas, chicken, fish… sometimes callaloo. I does try to eat healthy, you know? And I does go to church every Sunday, same as always. I haven't start doing anything different, I can tell you that. Maybe the heat is getting to me? Is real hot these days.
DOCTOR: It’s possible the heat is a factor, certainly. However, persistent thirst and hunger, even with a normal diet, can indicate other issues. Let's explore this a bit further. Do you experience any other symptoms alongside the thirst and hunger?
PATIENT: Hmm… well, sometimes I does feel a little tired, you know? Like… more tired than usual. But I does work, so I figure is just the work. And… maybe I does go to the bathroom more often than before. But I does drink a lot of water, so… is hard to say. Is not like is a pain or anything, just… more often. I don't know if that making sense.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and increased urination… Those could be related, Ms. Zicarelli. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No, Doctor, never. The doctor always checking me when I go for my check-up, and he never tell me nothing about that. High blood pressure… I don’t think so. Sometimes my head does feel a little heavy, but I thought is just from the heat. I don’t take any pills for nothing, I can tell you that. My husband always says I too stubborn to take medicine.
DOCTOR: Very well. And has anyone in your family—parents, siblings, grandparents—been diagnosed with diabetes or any other significant medical condition?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. My mother, she used to get really sick with her sugar, yes. The doctor used to come to the house and give her injections. Is a long time ago, though. And my father, he had problems with his heart, I think. He passed away a long time ago. My sister, she healthy as a horse, always running around. I don’t know if that helping you, Doctor? Is hard to remember everything.
DOCTOR: A family history of diabetes is significant, Ms. Zicarelli. Alright. I'd like to perform a quick physical examination, if you don't mind. Just to assess your overall health. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll also want to check your feet. And I'll need to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sound alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. My feet? Is because of the shoes? I does wear comfortable shoes, I promise. I just want to feel better, you know? This thirst is really bothering me.
DOCTOR: Not specifically the shoes, Ms. Zicarelli. It’s just part of a routine examination. Now, if you could please sit back and relax while I check your blood pressure. 140/90. Slightly elevated. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly fast. Lungs are clear. And finally, let's take a look at your feet. No obvious signs of injury or infection, but some slight swelling. Pulses are present, but weak. Alright. As I suspected, some indicators here suggest we need to investigate further. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a fasting blood glucose test. This will give us a clearer picture of your overall health and help us determine the cause of your symptoms.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Blood tests… is going to be a lot, yes? I don’t like needles, you know. But if you say is necessary, I will do it. When will I get the results? And… what if is something bad? I does worry easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, it's a few vials of blood, Ms. Zicarelli. It will be a slight discomfort, but a necessary step. The lab results typically take 24 to 48 hours. Once they are available, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. As for “something bad,” it’s premature to speculate. We are simply gathering information at this point. However, given your symptoms and family history, we need to rule out certain possibilities, such as diabetes. It's important to remember that early detection is key with many conditions. And if anything is amiss, we will develop a plan to manage it effectively. In the meantime, I recommend you try to maintain a healthy diet, drink plenty of water—though not excessively—and avoid sugary beverages. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Sugary beverages… I does like a little mauby sometimes. But I will try, Doctor. I will try my best. Hmm… is the thirst and hunger going to get worse while I wait for the results? And… what if I feel really sick? Should I come back to the hospital? I does get scared easily, you know.
DOCTOR: A small amount of mauby is unlikely to significantly impact the results, Ms. Zicarelli. However, I advise limiting it until we have a clearer understanding of your condition. As for your symptoms worsening, it's possible. But it's also possible they may remain stable. If you experience any new or concerning symptoms—such as excessive fatigue, blurred vision, unexplained weight loss, or frequent infections—please seek immediate medical attention. Do not hesitate to go to the emergency room if you feel unwell. I have provided you with a lab requisition form and instructions for fasting before the blood work. The lab is located at [address of lab]. Unless you have any further questions, I believe we have covered everything for today. I will see you again once the results are available. Do you require a work/school note?
PATIENT: A work note… yes, please. I work at the water plant, you know. It can be a heavy job. And I don't want them thinking I just taking a day off. I does always try to be responsible. Thank you, Doctor. You been very patient with me. I does worry a lot, you know. I hope everything is alright. .
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here is your note, excusing you from work for the blood work appointment. I understand your concern, Ms. Zicarelli. We will address your symptoms systematically and develop an appropriate plan. Try to remain calm and follow the instructions I have provided. I will see you again in a few days. Please do not hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any concerning symptoms before then. .
