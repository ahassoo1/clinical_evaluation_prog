DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Oh, goodness... what did bring me in? Well, it's been... a bit of a bother, really. I just haven't been keeping much food down lately. And I get full so quickly. It's... unsettling. I feel like I ate a whole feast after just a few bites. It's been going on for... well, I'm not sure how long, truthfully. Time gets away from me these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. That does sound unsettling, Ms. Kelder. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. It's not unusual to experience changes in appetite or have difficulty eating, especially as we get older. Let’s try to get a better understanding of what’s been going on. You mentioned not keeping food down and feeling full quickly… can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… when did it start? I really wish I could pinpoint it… It feels like it crept up on me, not all at once. Maybe… a couple of months ago? Possibly longer. It's hard to say. It was around the time… around the time things started feeling… different with my energy. I just haven’t been myself, I suppose. Does that make any sense? I used to be able to eat a good meal and then get right back to work with the animals, but now… not so much.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Ms. Kelder. It sounds like this has been a gradual process. And it’s helpful to know it's been accompanied by a change in your energy levels. When you say you haven’t been keeping food down, is that meaning you’re experiencing nausea or vomiting?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. It’s mostly nausea, really. A queasy feeling… like my stomach is always a little upset. I haven’t actually thrown up much, thankfully. Just… this constant feeling like I might. And it makes me not want to eat, which then makes me even weaker, I reckon. It's a bit of a cycle, really. It's not every single day, mind you, but it's often enough to be a real nuisance.
DOCTOR: I understand. A persistent feeling of nausea can be very draining. And you’re right, it can easily become a cycle. Let's try to get a more complete picture. Besides the nausea and feeling full quickly, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Well, I've been... more tired than usual, as I mentioned before. And… my stomach feels bloated a lot of the time, even when I haven't eaten much. Oh, and I've lost a little weight, I think. My clothes are a bit looser than they used to be, but I haven't really weighed myself recently. I don’t have much use for scales these days. Everything feels… off, to be honest. It’s hard to explain. I just don’t have my usual pep.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Kelder, that’s helpful. Fatigue, bloating, and unintentional weight loss along with the nausea and early satiety—all of these are important pieces of information. Now, just to get a better understanding of your overall health, can you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh my. Well... that’s a bit of a long story. I had my share of aches and pains over the years, as anyone my age does. Arthritis in my knees, mostly. And I had my gallbladder out… oh, goodness, must be twenty years ago now. But… the biggest thing, I suppose, is the cancer. I was diagnosed with… well, I don't even remember the exact name of it. It’s in my stomach, Doctor. I’ve been getting treatment for it for… a while now. It’s been on and off, honestly. Sometimes it’s better, sometimes it’s worse. And these symptoms… they feel a bit like when the cancer flares up, but not exactly the same. I just… I’m a bit confused about it all, to be honest. Is that alright to say?
DOCTOR: Of course, that's perfectly alright to say, Ms. Kelder. It's completely understandable to be confused, especially given your history. And thank you for sharing all of that with me; it’s very important information. So, you’ve had treatment for stomach cancer in the past. Do you recall what type of treatment you received – was it chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I really don't remember the specifics. I was so… overwhelmed at the time. I know I had… pills. Lots and lots of pills. And I went for… I think they called them infusions. I sat in a chair for a long time while the medicine went into my veins. And then there was… a procedure. I think they put a little camera down my throat to look around. It wasn’t very pleasant. But honestly, Doctor, the details are blurry. It was a long time ago, and I've had a lot on my mind since then. My husband… he passed away a few years back, and that just… scrambled everything, I think. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: You don't need to apologize at all, Ms. Kelder. It's completely understandable that the details are blurry, given everything you've been through. It sounds like you’ve faced a great deal. Let's move on. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see. Just a few, thankfully. I take something for my arthritis… these little white pills. And… oh, yes, a heart pill, Doctor. My heart sometimes skips a beat, so I take a tiny blue one for that. And… and that’s about it, I think. The doctor at the cancer clinic gives me things from time to time, but I can't recall the names of them. They’ve changed it a few times, I reckon. It's hard to keep track! Do you want me to tell you the names of the ones I can see in here? They're all so tiny, and the writing is so small.
DOCTOR: Yes, please. If you don't mind, telling me the names on the pill containers would be very helpful. Even if we can’t determine everything right now, it gives me a starting point. And don't worry about the small writing; we'll figure it out.
PATIENT: Alright… This one says… “Naproxen.” N-A-P-R-O-X-E-N. That’s for my arthritis, like I said. And this tiny one… oh, goodness… “Lisinopril.” L-I-S-I-N-O-P-R-I-L. That’s the heart one. And… This one… it’s so faded. I can barely make it out. It looks like… "Omeprazole?" O-M-E-P-R-A-Z-O-L-E. Maybe? It’s very hard to read. I apologize for being so clumsy. My hands aren’t as steady as they used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Kelder. You're doing great. Naproxen, Lisinopril, and potentially Omeprazole – that’s very helpful information. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... Not that I know of, Doctor. I've never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything, although I don’t have much of an appetite these days. And I don't recall ever being allergic to a medicine. My husband, bless his soul, had allergies to pollen, but I never did. I think I'm pretty lucky in that regard. Unless… I sometimes get a bit of itching when I'm around cats, but that's just a little skin irritation, not a real allergy, I don't think. Is that something I should worry about? I do love animals, you see. I used to work with them, training them... but that was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Kelder, a little itching around cats doesn’t sound like a severe allergy. It’s good to be aware of it, but it doesn’t seem to be relevant to your current concerns. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh my, goodness, no! I never smoked a day in my life. My mother always warned me about it, said it would ruin your lungs. And I don't drink alcohol either. Never really appealed to me. And drugs… oh, heavens, no! I'm an old woman, Doctor, not a… not a troublemaker! I always lived a pretty clean life, I reckon. I spent most of my time working, raising my family, and taking care of animals. That was enough excitement for me. Is that alright? I hope I'm not boring you with all this.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Ms. Kelder. You’re not boring me in the least. I appreciate you sharing this information with me. Now, let's talk about your social history a little more. Do you live alone, or do you have family or friends nearby?
PATIENT: I live alone, yes. My husband passed away a few years back, and my children are grown and live in different states. We keep in touch, of course, with phone calls and visits when they can, but it’s not the same as having them nearby. I have a few friends in town, but most of them are… well, they’re not as active as I used to be. I mostly keep to myself these days. But I have my animals, you see. They keep me company. I've got a couple of cats and a little dog. They're good friends, even if they don't talk much!
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very comforting arrangement, Ms. Kelder. It’s wonderful that you have your animals for companionship. Okay. We’ve covered a lot of important information, Ms. Kelder. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your weight and blood pressure. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I trust your judgment. I don’t mind at all. Just… be gentle, if you would. My stomach has been a bit tender lately. And don't be alarmed if you hear some creaking… my old bones aren’t what they used to be! I'll do my best to stay still.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Kelder. Take nice, deep breaths for me. Your heart rate is a little slow, but regular. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles that I can detect. Now, I’m going to gently feel your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender or painful. There's a bit of firmness when I press here in your upper abdomen, but no sharp pain. I'm also going to check your weight and blood pressure. Your weight is 56 kilograms, and your blood pressure is 130/80. It’s a bit elevated, but not critically so. Everything seems within normal limits, aside from the slight firmness in your upper abdomen and the slightly elevated blood pressure. Based on your history and the exam, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. Given your past history of stomach cancer, recurrence is a concern. However, other possibilities include gastritis, or potentially a gallbladder issue, even after previous removal. We need to investigate further. I think the best course of action would be to order some blood work and an imaging scan—a CT scan of your abdomen—to get a better look at what's going on. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That… sounds very sensible, Doctor. A scan… that does seem like the best way to find out what’s going on, doesn’t it? I just… I don’t want it to be the cancer again. But I understand we need to know one way or the other. Blood work and a scan… yes, alright. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. When can we do these tests? And will they… will they be painful? I don't have a strong stomach, you see. I'm easily rattled.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Kelder. It’s natural to be anxious. We’ll take things one step at a time. The blood work is just a routine check and will only involve a small needle prick—it shouldn’t be very painful at all. As for the CT scan, it’s a painless procedure. You'll lie on a table, and the machine will take images of your abdomen. It's a bit like a large X-ray. It usually takes about 30 minutes or so. I can order these tests today. The lab is right across the hall, and we can schedule the CT scan for sometime this week—perhaps Wednesday?
PATIENT: Wednesday sounds alright. Yes, that would be good. I suppose I should call my daughter, then, let her know what’s going on. She always worries about me. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the scan? Should I fast or anything? I always forget these things. And… will the results be available quickly? I just want to know one way or the other, so I can… well, so I can prepare. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It really does put my mind at ease. Just a little.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Kelder. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Yes, you will need to fast for at least six hours before the CT scan – that means no food or drink, except for water. It's important for the images to be clear. And the results usually take about 24 to 48 hours to come back, but I’ll have my nurse contact you as soon as they’re available. Here’s a slip with the lab order and the information for scheduling the CT scan. Don't hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before the tests. And please, try not to worry too much. We’re going to get to the bottom of this. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. And very kind. I appreciate it more than you know. I suppose I should go call my daughter, then, and schedule those tests. Thank you again for everything. I feel a bit better, knowing we have a plan. I’ll let you know if anything comes up. Goodbye, Doctor. And thank you again. It means a lot.
DOCTOR: It was a pleasure meeting you, Ms. Kelder. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you need anything at all. Goodbye, and take care.
