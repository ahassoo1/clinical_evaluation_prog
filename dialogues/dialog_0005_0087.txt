DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Croonquist. I’m Dr. Donate. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… lab work, I think? The lady on the phone said something about it. Honestly, I don’t really remember much these days. Just gotta get it done, you know? The quicker, the better.
DOCTOR: Right. “Lab work.” Well, we can certainly get that sorted. It sounds like you're here for your annual check-up and some routine blood tests, but let’s just confirm a few things, shall we?
PATIENT: Annual… blood tests? Maybe. Look, I’m a pretty simple guy, Doctor. Worked at the power plant most of my life. Don't need a lot of fuss. Is that what this is about? Just checking things are… working? I suppose that sounds right.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, “checking things are working” is a perfectly valid way to put it. And yes, that’s part of it. We like to do a baseline assessment, especially as we get older, just to make sure everything’s running smoothly. Now, have you been feeling alright generally?
PATIENT: Generally? Hmm. I get tired, I suppose. Old age, you know? Everything aches a little. Nothing specific… I haven’t been sick sick. Mostly just… being old. Does that make sense? I don’t really go to doctors unless I absolutely have to.
DOCTOR: It does, Mr. Croonquist. “Being old” is a perfectly understandable complaint. Fatigue and aches are common. But we still want to rule out anything else going on. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite lately?
PATIENT: Appetite… not really. I eat when I’m hungry, don't eat when I'm not. Same as always, I think. Maybe a little less these days… but that's probably just 'cause I don't get around as much. I used to be able to put away a whole plate of Kabuli palaw, but… that was a long time ago. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It can be. A decrease in appetite can be a sign of other things, so it’s good to know. Now, have you had any trouble with your digestion?
PATIENT: Digestion…? Oh, goodness. Well, I'm an old man, Doctor. Things aren’t what they used to be, if you know what I mean. Some… discomfort sometimes. Nothing I haven't dealt with for years, though. Just part of getting older, right? Look, are we getting close to the blood work part? I really don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: We are getting there, Mr. Croonquist. I just need to ask a few more questions to get a full picture. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Bowel habits…? Oh, for goodness sake. Doctor, I don't even know where you’re going with this! Look, I'm a simple man. Yes, things change as you get older. Everything changes. Is this really necessary to know before you take some blood? Honestly, I think I'm getting a bit flustered. Just the tests, please. Can we please just do the tests?
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I understand your frustration, Mr. Croonquist. I apologize if I'm asking too many questions. It’s just… it’s important to rule things out. But, yes, we can proceed with the blood work. I'm just going to need to ask one final quick question: Have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… hmm. I haven’t weighed myself in… a long time, probably. Maybe I'm a bit thinner than I used to be? It’s hard to say, I haven't been paying attention. Look, just take the blood, please. I'm getting tired of talking about all this. I’d like to get this over with. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Croonquist. Let's get this over with. I’m going to have the nurse draw some blood. She'll be in shortly. Just try to relax. Nurse Fatima, could you please come in here?
