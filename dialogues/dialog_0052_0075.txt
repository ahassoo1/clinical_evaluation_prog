DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Paske. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Patricia Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you please tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Shely. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this daytime sleepiness, really. Even with the machine… the one I use at night for my sleep apnea. It just doesn’t seem to be doing the whole job, you know? I still find myself awfully tired during the day.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Paske. Daytime sleepiness despite using a CPAP machine for sleep apnea is certainly something we need to investigate. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a bit more about this sleepiness?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me see. It's not like I'm falling asleep standing up, thankfully. But it’s a constant drag, a sort of…fogginess. Especially in the afternoons. I try to take a little nap, but sometimes that doesn’t even help, and then I feel even worse! It makes it hard to concentrate on my reading, and frankly, just enjoying things. I used to be much sharper, you see. I taught college courses for years, and that requires a clear head.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you describing that so clearly, Mr. Paske. A persistent “drag” and fogginess, particularly in the afternoons, even with CPAP use, is helpful information. And it’s understandable that it's affecting your concentration and enjoyment of activities, especially given your history as a professor. To get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little about how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think... It's been… well, since I started using the machine, really. So, about six months now, I suppose. At first, I thought it was just getting used to it, you know? The mask, the air pressure… But it hasn’t really improved. It’s just… been this way. Maybe it's a little worse now than it was initially, but honestly, the whole thing is a bit of a blur. Six months, I believe. Yes, six months.
DOCTOR: Six months of persistent daytime sleepiness despite CPAP use is certainly concerning. It’s good you’ve been consistent with the machine, but it suggests we may need to explore other potential causes. Before we proceed, let's review a bit of your medical history. Do you have a list of your current medications with you today, Mr. Paske?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Here you are. Mostly just things for my blood pressure, and a little something for my arthritis. Nothing too exciting. Oh, and a vitamin D supplement, the doctor said I was a bit low on that last year.
DOCTOR: Thank you. This is helpful. I see you're taking amlodipine for hypertension and naproxen for arthritis, and a vitamin D supplement. Do you experience any side effects from these medications?
PATIENT: Not really, no. The blood pressure pill, sometimes my ankles feel a little swollen, but nothing major. I just wear compression socks when I’m going to be on my feet a lot. And the naproxen… well, sometimes it upsets my stomach, so I take it with food. Nothing I can’t handle. The vitamin D, no problems at all. I’m a fairly sturdy fellow, you see. Don’t bother easily.
DOCTOR: I'm glad to hear you're managing the side effects well, Mr. Paske. Now, regarding your past medical history – besides hypertension and arthritis, have you been diagnosed with any other conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Oh! I had pneumonia a few years back, but that was a one-time thing, recovered completely. And… I had my appendix out when I was a boy, of course. But nothing else significant, really. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. No heart trouble, no diabetes, nothing like that. I did have a rather nasty bout of the flu last winter, but that’s hardly a diagnosis, is it?
DOCTOR: No, a bout of the flu isn't a diagnosis, Mr. Paske. It’s good to know you’ve had no major health issues aside from the hypertension, arthritis, and the prior pneumonia. Now, could you tell me about any family history of medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see... My mother had high blood pressure, like me. And my father… he had some trouble with his heart when he got older, I believe. It was a long time ago, so I don’t recall the specifics. My sister, she's perfectly healthy as far as I know. And my son… he's doing well too, thankfully. No major health problems on either side, really. It's a rather unremarkable family history, if you want the truth. We're a durable bunch, the Paskes.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Mr. Paske. A family history of hypertension and some heart trouble is relevant, but overall, it sounds fairly unremarkable. Now, a few quick questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Never. Absolutely not. I’ve always been rather careful about my health, you see. My father smoked a bit when he was younger, and it didn’t do him any favors. So, I swore off it early on, and I’ve never looked back. And I don't drink much either, just a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. Mostly water, really.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Mr. Paske. Not smoking and limited alcohol consumption are both very positive. And how about caffeine?
PATIENT: Oh, I do enjoy my coffee! A cup or two in the morning, that’s all. Maybe one in the afternoon if I’m feeling particularly sluggish. Nothing excessive, I assure you. It helps me focus, you see, especially with my reading. I don't go overboard, though. Too much caffeine makes me a bit jittery.
DOCTOR: A moderate amount of caffeine is unlikely to be the primary cause, but good to know. Now, before we move onto a physical exam, are you currently experiencing any other symptoms – anything at all – besides the daytime sleepiness and fogginess?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, sometimes I wake up with a bit of a headache. Not a terrible one, just a dull ache. And my wife – before my wife… she always said I snored, but I don’t really remember that. But I've been using the machine for six months now, so I'd think that would take care of that. Oh! And occasionally, my legs feel a little restless at night. Not every night, but sometimes. Nothing too bothersome, really. Just little things, you see. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Paske. Those details are helpful. The headaches, the history of snoring, and the restless legs could be relevant. Now, I'd like to conduct a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Go right ahead, Doctor. I’m ready when you are. I always figured a good check-up was the best way to figure things out.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’m going to start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look in your ears, nose, and throat. Finally, I’ll do a quick neurological assessment. Your blood pressure is 142/88, which is slightly elevated. Your pulse is 72 and regular. Your heart sounds are normal, no murmurs or abnormal rhythms. Your lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Your ears and throat look normal as well. Your reflexes are normal, and your balance appears stable. Now, one final thing. Could you please lie back on the examination table?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Whatever you need. I’m happy to cooperate. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is soft, and there's no tenderness. Your bowel sounds are normal. I notice some mild edema in your ankles, which you mentioned previously. Alright, Mr. Paske. Thank you for your patience. That completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’ve found during the exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. What sort of possibilities are we looking at? Is it something serious, do you think? I must admit, I’m a little anxious to hear what you’ve found.
DOCTOR: It’s good you're being open about your anxiety, Mr. Paske. While it’s too early to say definitively, it doesn’t sound like something immediately life-threatening. However, daytime sleepiness despite CPAP use can have several causes. We’ve ruled out some obvious physical issues during the exam. The most common possibilities at this point include sleep disorders beyond simple apnea – like central sleep apnea or REM sleep behavior disorder – medication side effects, underlying medical conditions that haven’t been diagnosed yet – like hypothyroidism or vitamin deficiencies – and less commonly, neurological issues. The restless legs and headaches could be related, or separate concerns. To get a clearer picture, I recommend we start with some blood work to check your thyroid function, vitamin levels – including D – and rule out any other underlying medical issues. I also think a referral to a sleep specialist would be beneficial to review your CPAP data and potentially perform a more comprehensive sleep study. Would that be agreeable to you?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, yes. A sleep study and some blood work. It’s better to be thorough, I suppose. A sleep specialist… I hadn’t even thought of that. Yes, I’m agreeable to that. I trust your judgment, Doctor. When can we get the ball rolling on these things? And… about the cost? My insurance, Medicare, is… well, it covers things, but not always everything.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I completely understand your concern about costs, Mr. Paske. Let me coordinate the blood work order and the referral to a sleep specialist right now. The blood work will be done here in the clinic, and we'll send the results to you as soon as they’re available, usually within a few days. I'll make the referral to Dr. Emily Carter, a highly respected sleep specialist in the area. Her office will contact you to schedule an appointment. As for costs, I will have my billing department check your Medicare coverage for both the blood work and the sleep study. They can provide you with an estimate of your out-of-pocket expenses. I will also provide you with a referral slip and the specialist's contact information. Do you have any questions about that process, or anything else at this point?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, which I appreciate. Getting the billing department involved right away is a good idea. No, I think that covers everything for now. You’ve put my mind at ease a bit, Doctor. Just knowing we’re taking steps to figure it out is a relief. Thank you.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Paske. That's my goal – to help you understand what's going on and develop a plan to address it. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. Here is the lab order for your bloodwork and the referral information for Dr. Carter. My nursing staff will also ensure you receive a summary of today’s visit. Is there anything else I can assist you with today before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I believe that's all. Thank you again, Doctor Shely. You’ve been very helpful and… reassuring. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Paske. It was a pleasure meeting you. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to hearing from you regarding the results of your tests and your visit with Dr. Carter. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Have a good day as well.
