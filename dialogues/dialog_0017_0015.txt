DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. Dr. Blim. Now, let's get straight to it. You’re here today because…?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Uh… my nose. It’s been… bothering me. A little. It feels… full. Like when you have a cold, but… not so bad. I don't really know how to explain. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: “A little uncomfortable,” you say. Right. And how long has this “little discomfort” been going on, Ms. Boham?
PATIENT: Oh… a while now. Maybe… a month? Or more? Time… it goes fast. It’s not… sharp pain. Just… stuffy. And sometimes, my head hurts a little on the sides. Not all the time, though. I try to drink lots of water.
DOCTOR: A month or more, you say. And you’ve tried increasing your fluid intake. Very well. Is this congestion constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It comes and goes, Doctor. Some days it's… better. I can breathe okay. Other days… it feels like there’s something blocking it. Especially when I lie down at night. That's when it's worse. I… I don't sleep so good those nights.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this nasal congestion and occasional headaches?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No fever, I don't think. No cough. Sometimes… I feel tired. But I work hard, so… maybe that’s just the work? I don't… I don't know if that counts. I haven’t noticed anything else… not that I remember.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies, Ms. Boham?
PATIENT: Allergies? I… I don't know, Doctor. I've never really… thought about it. I work with… machines. Oil and things. Maybe? Does that count? I'm not sure what allergies are, really. I’ve never been sick from flowers or cats or anything.
DOCTOR: Very well. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical… history? Oh… that’s… a hard question. I haven't been to the doctor much. I work, and… things are expensive. I don't remember having anything… serious. Maybe a little sick when I was a little girl? But nothing lately. I… I have my husband, he takes care of me when I need it. I don’t really keep track of these things, Doctor. It's all a little… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Any surgeries, Ms. Boham?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No, Doctor. Never. I've never had a surgery. I… I’m pretty healthy, usually. Just this nose thing now. It's been worrying me a little. It feels… different than a normal cold. That’s why I came. I hope it's nothing bad.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a look. Please remain still. Hmm. There’s some slight swelling and redness of the nasal mucosa. Your tympanic membranes appear clear. Take a deep breath for me. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Tell me, Ms. Boham, do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, Doctor. I don't smoke. Never have. My husband doesn't smoke either. It's bad for you. We work with… oil, you know. Enough bad things around there already. It’s a dusty job, though. Maybe that has something to do with it?
DOCTOR: Dusty work. Yes. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family… history? Oh dear. That’s a hard one. My mother… she had problems with her stomach, I think. And my father… he worked very hard. I don't really know much about their… illnesses. We didn't talk about those things much. I have a brother, he’s healthy, I think. He lives far away. I'm sorry, Doctor. I wish I could tell you more. It’s just… not something we kept track of.
DOCTOR: Very well. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No medications. I don't like taking pills if I can help it. Just… water. And rest when I can. Sometimes my husband gives me a tea when I'm not feeling good, but that’s it. Nothing regular. I hope… I hope that’s okay. I don’t want to be on lots of medicine.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Boham. Based on your history and examination, it appears you are likely experiencing allergic rhinitis, possibly exacerbated by your work environment. It’s a common condition. I recommend over-the-counter saline nasal sprays to help clear the congestion, and an antihistamine for symptomatic relief. I will document this, and provide you with a printout of recommended products. If your symptoms worsen, or you develop a fever, please return immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Saline… nasal sprays? And… antihistamine? What does that do, Doctor? Will it make me sleepy? I need to work, you know. And… will these sprays help with the headache, too? I just want to feel normal again. It's hard to concentrate when my head feels full. And… how much do these things cost? I… I don’t have much money. I hope it's not too expensive.
DOCTOR: The saline spray simply helps to moisturize and clear your nasal passages. The antihistamine will reduce the inflammation and alleviate your symptoms. Some antihistamines can cause drowsiness, but there are non-drowsy options available. As for the cost… they are relatively inexpensive. I will print out a list of affordable options. Here. This lists the medications and their approximate cost at a local pharmacy. If these measures do not provide relief within a week, return to the clinic. We may need to consider a referral to an allergist. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… thank you, Doctor. A week… I’ll try these. And… non-drowsy… that’s good. An allergist? Is that… serious? Is it something bad? I hope it won’t take too much money. I… I appreciate you helping me, Doctor. I just want to get back to work. And sleep better. Thank you.
DOCTOR: An allergist would simply provide more specialized testing to identify any specific triggers. It’s not necessarily serious, Ms. Boham. We will cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, focus on these over-the-counter medications. Are there any other questions I can answer for you today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that's all. Thank you very much for your time. I will try the sprays and… the pills. And I'll watch out for… getting worse. I appreciate you explaining everything. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Very well. You too, Ms. Boham. .
PATIENT: .
