DOCTOR: Hi Leander, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, yes, hello Doctor. It's… my ear. Feels blocked, you know? Full. It’s been… a while now, I think. Not sure exactly how long, to be honest. It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your ear feels blocked and full, and it's been going on for a bit. Noted. Let's try to get a better idea of what's going on. When you say “a while,” can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Rough estimate… hmm. Maybe… a month? Or two? It’s all a bit blurry, I’m afraid. Things haven’t been… easy, since my wife… well, never mind. It’s hard to keep track of these things. It just is blocked. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Leander. Life happens, and it's completely understandable to lose track of things when you're dealing with a lot. A month or two… okay, that gives us a starting point. Is the blockage constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Constant, I think. Though… sometimes it feels worse than others. Like when it’s humid, maybe? Or when I bend over. It’s not painful, just… there. A dull pressure, really. I just want it gone.
DOCTOR: Okay, constant with some variation, worse with humidity or bending over, and you describe it as a dull pressure. No pain, which is good. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the blockage?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No… I don’t think so. Maybe a little… dizziness sometimes? But I get dizzy easily, always have. Probably not related. And my hearing… seems alright. I can hear you perfectly well, can’t I? I mean, I think so. It’s just the fullness.
DOCTOR: You do hear me perfectly well, yes. And it's good that your hearing seems okay. Dizziness that you already experience… we'll keep that in mind. Have you had any discharge from your ear?
PATIENT: Discharge? No. Not that I've noticed. I… I clean my ears regularly. Well, I try to. It’s just… this blockage. It’s the main thing. I don't think anything is coming out of it. I’d notice that, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: You definitely would. Okay, no discharge. And you said you clean your ears regularly. Do you use cotton swabs, or anything else?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. Cotton swabs. I know, I know, they say not to. But… it feels cleaner. I just… I can’t help it. My father always used them. Old habits, I suppose. Though, maybe I shouldn’t be. Is that bad? I’m sorry, I don’t mean to be difficult.
DOCTOR: It’s not difficult at all, Leander. It’s good you're honest about that. Cotton swabs can sometimes push wax further in and cause a blockage, or even irritate the ear canal. We'll talk about safer cleaning methods later. Now, have you had any recent colds, allergies, or sinus infections?
PATIENT: Hmm… a cold, maybe? A few weeks ago, I think. Nothing serious. Just a bit sniffly. Allergies… possibly. The hay fever has been bad this year. And… sinus, no. I don't think so. I get headaches sometimes, but those are just… headaches. Old age, probably. I’m not sure. It's all a bit of a blur, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a recent cold, possible allergies, no sinus infection. And headaches, but you're not sure if they're related. Alright. Let's do a quick exam of your ear, just to take a look and see what's going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that's fine. Please, go ahead. I just… I hope it’s nothing serious. I haven’t got the energy for… well, never mind. Just do what you need to do, Doctor. I’ll try to be still.
DOCTOR: Okay, Leander, I'm taking a look now. I see some wax buildup in your ear canal, which is likely contributing to the blockage. The ear canal itself looks normal, no signs of infection. Your eardrum appears a bit… dull, but I can't see any perforations or fluid behind it. Based on what I'm seeing, it looks like we're dealing with impacted earwax. It's a common problem. We can try to remove it. Would you like to try that?
PATIENT: Impacted earwax… alright. That sounds… manageable. Yes, please. If that’s all it is, that would be wonderful. I just want it gone. How do you… remove it? Is it… painful? I don’t really like things being poked around in my ears.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It is usually pretty straightforward. There are a few ways we can go about it. We can try using ear drops to soften the wax, and then gently flush it out with warm water. That’s usually the first step. Some people find it a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. We can also use a small tool to carefully remove the wax if the drops don't do the trick, but I'll explain everything before doing that. Would you prefer to start with the ear drops?
PATIENT: Ear drops… yes, that sounds… less scary. Less poking. Please, let's start with the drops. And… explain everything, like you said. I just… I like to know what’s happening. Old habits, I suppose. Being a farmer, you get used to knowing what’s going on with things.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand. I'll explain every step. These are just mineral oil-based ear drops. They help to soften and loosen the wax, making it easier to remove. I'll instill a few drops into your ear canal, and you'll lie on your side for about 5-10 minutes to let them work. You might feel a slight fullness or tingling sensation, but it shouldn't be painful. After that, we'll gently flush the ear with warm water using a syringe. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… reasonable. Mineral oil, warm water… alright. Five to ten minutes on my side… I can manage that. And you’ll explain everything before you do it? Promise? I just… I get anxious easily. It’s… a long story. But yes, let’s do it. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Leander. I promise to explain everything before I do it, and I will be as gentle as possible. We'll take things slow. First, I'm going to warm up the ear drops. Then, I'll have you lie on your side, and I'll instill a few drops into your ear. After 5-10 minutes, we’ll proceed with the flushing. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… alright. Warm drops first… good. I’ll just lie here, then? On my side? Is there anything I need to do? Like… hold still, or… I don’t want to make a mess. I'm a bit clumsy, you see.
DOCTOR: You’ll just lie on your side, the ear that’s blocked facing upwards. You don’t need to do anything special, just relax. I’ll put a towel under your head to protect your clothes. I'll also have a basin nearby just in case, but it’s unlikely you’ll make a mess. Just try to stay as still as possible while the drops are working. I'll let you know when I'm about to instill them, and when the 5-10 minutes are up. Okay, let’s get started. I’m warming up the drops now…
PATIENT: Alright. Yes, go ahead. Just… try not to poke too hard. It's a sensitive ear, you see. And… thank you, Doctor. For being patient. It’s just… hard to explain sometimes. It’s been a rough year.
DOCTOR: Okay, Leander, I've just put a few drops in. It might feel a little cool at first. Now, just relax on your side for about 5-10 minutes. I'll set a timer. Let me know if you feel any discomfort, but it should just be a slight fullness or tingling. I’ll be right here if you need anything.
PATIENT: Cool, yes… and a bit… bubbly. It's alright. Just… lying here. Five minutes, you said? I’ll just… close my eyes. It's… quiet, thankfully. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, Leander, the 7 minutes are up. How are you feeling?
PATIENT: Hmm. A little… full, still. And maybe a bit… itchy? But not painful. It's… hard to describe. It's just… there. Still blocked, I think. It hasn’t magically disappeared, has it?
DOCTOR: No, it hasn't magically disappeared, no. It often takes a bit of time for the drops to fully soften the wax. The itchiness you're feeling is likely from the wax loosening up. Now, we'll try gently flushing the ear with warm water. I'm going to use a syringe, and it might feel a little strange, but it shouldn't be painful. I'll start with a gentle stream and see how you do. Let me know immediately if you feel any pain or discomfort. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Gentle stream… alright. Pain or discomfort… yes, I will tell you. Immediately. I don’t like pain. It’s… been a rough year, you see. Gentle… alright. Go ahead. Just… be careful. And… slow. Very slow.
DOCTOR: Okay, Leander, I’m just starting now. Let me know if you feel any pressure or discomfort. This might feel a little strange, like water moving around in your ear. How are you doing so far?
PATIENT: It’s… watery. And a bit… cold. Not painful, exactly, but… unsettling. Like something’s moving around in there. It’s… hard to explain. It feels… strange. Please… just a little slower, maybe? It’s… making me anxious.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m slowing down now, and I’ve adjusted the temperature. I’m so sorry that it’s making you anxious. We can stop at any time if you’d like. I’m just trying to gently flush out the wax. Let me know immediately if anything feels uncomfortable. Are you okay to continue, even slowly?
PATIENT: Yes… slowly, yes. Just… slowly. It’s… alright. It’s just… unsettling. Like something’s… swimming in there. But not painful. No, not painful. Just… strange. Please… just keep talking to me. It helps.
DOCTOR: Okay, Leander, I’m still gently flushing with the warm water. You might feel some movement, that’s just the water dislodging the wax. I’m seeing some wax starting to come out now, which is good. We’re making progress. I’ll keep flushing until the water runs clear. Just breathe deeply and let me know if anything changes. You're doing great. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: It’s… getting warmer. And… less bubbly. I think. It’s still strange, but… less unsettling. I can feel… something moving. Like… little bits coming out. Yes, I think. It’s… progress, you said? It’s… good. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very patient.
DOCTOR: Okay, Leander, the water is starting to run much clearer now. I'm seeing a lot of wax coming out. We're almost there. Just a few more seconds. Okay, all done! Let me take a look now… Hmm… the ear canal looks much clearer now. The eardrum still looks a little dull, but that's likely from the wax. Your hearing seems better too, when I asked you to say a few words. How are you feeling now?
PATIENT: Hmm. Lighter. Yes, definitely lighter. And… quieter. Not… muffled anymore. It’s… strange. Good strange. It feels… open. Like a weight has been lifted. It’s… hard to explain. Thank you, Doctor. Really. You’ve… made a big difference. It’s… a good day. A very good day.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear, Leander! I’m so glad I could help. It sounds like the wax removal was successful. To prevent this from happening again, I recommend avoiding cotton swabs in your ears. You can use over-the-counter earwax softening drops a few times a year if you feel wax buildup, or you can come see me for a cleaning if you prefer. Do you have any other concerns or questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. No cotton swabs, yes. I’ll remember that. And… ear drops. Good. Just… avoid the swabs. I can do that. It’s… a relief to finally have it sorted. Thank you again, Doctor Ranjan. You’ve been very kind. And… patient. Really. I appreciate it. I think… I think I’ll go home now. And… have a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Leander. It was my pleasure. A cup of tea sounds like a perfect idea. I'll have the nurse print out a discharge summary with instructions on ear care. And please, don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any concerns in the future. Have a wonderful day, and enjoy your tea!
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
