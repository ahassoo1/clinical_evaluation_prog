DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Creagh. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I've been experiencing a… well, a persistent pressure in my bladder. It’s been bothering me for a little while now, and I thought it best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand. A persistent pressure in the bladder. And how long exactly has this been bothering you, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think… it started, I believe, approximately three weeks ago. Perhaps a little longer, but definitely around three weeks. It comes and goes, but it's been fairly consistent lately.
DOCTOR: Three weeks, consistent lately… and would you describe this pressure as painful, or more of a discomfort?
PATIENT: It’s not really painful, Doctor. More… uncomfortable, and a little urgent, even when I don’t necessarily need to go. It’s a strange sensation. Like there’s something…full, all the time.
DOCTOR: I see. So, a sensation of fullness and urgency, even after voiding. Have you noticed any changes in your urinary stream – difficulty starting, stopping, or a weaker stream perhaps?
PATIENT: No, not really. The stream itself feels normal, thankfully. It starts and stops as usual, and the strength hasn’t changed that I’ve noticed. It’s just this… feeling afterwards, and sometimes even before I go, that’s concerning me.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this pressure?
PATIENT: No, not that I can recall. No fever, no pain in my back or side, no blood in the urine… just the pressure. I have been a little more tired than usual, perhaps, but I attributed that to work. Is that something I should mention?
DOCTOR: Fatigue is a rather non-specific symptom, Ms. Creagh. We can revisit that later if necessary. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Have you had any prior medical conditions diagnosed?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I was diagnosed with mild hypertension about five years ago, but it's well-controlled with medication. I also had a bout of bronchitis last winter, but that resolved completely with antibiotics. Otherwise, I’m generally quite healthy. I have Medicare, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Hypertension, controlled with medication. And are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Yes, I take Lisinopril for the hypertension, 20mg daily, as prescribed. And I take a daily multivitamin, just a standard one from the drugstore. Nothing else. I don’t really believe in a lot of supplements, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Lisinopril, 20mg daily, and a multivitamin. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t have any known allergies. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. My husband always jokes I’ll eat anything, but that’s not entirely true! I just haven’t encountered anything I’m allergic to.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. I've been very fortunate, I've never needed surgery and I've only been hospitalized once, when I was a child, for a bad case of the flu. It was quite a long time ago. It’s not relevant, I imagine.
DOCTOR: Indeed. And regarding family history – do any of your close relatives have any medical conditions, particularly related to the urinary system or kidneys?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother had diabetes, type 2, but no kidney problems that I’m aware of. My father had heart disease. And my grandmother, on my mother's side, had a bladder infection, many years ago, but nothing serious. I don’t recall any other family history of urinary issues.
DOCTOR: Diabetes, heart disease, a prior bladder infection… acceptable. Now, Ms. Creagh, a few questions regarding your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t smoke, and I rarely drink alcohol – perhaps a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions. And I certainly don’t use any recreational drugs. I'm a graphic designer, so I need a steady hand and a clear mind!
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. I'd like to check your abdomen and perform a quick neurological assessment, and then I will need a urine sample. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly acceptable. I’m happy to do whatever you need to get to the bottom of this. Just let me know if there’s anything specific I need to do.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you’ll just lie down on the table, please. I’ll begin with an abdominal examination. Please inform me immediately if you experience any discomfort. I'm feeling for any tenderness or masses… Your abdomen is soft, no noticeable masses. No significant tenderness upon palpation. Bladder is not distended. Now, let’s quickly check your reflexes. Reflexes are within normal limits. Finally, I will need a urine sample. There’s a specimen cup in the restroom; please collect a midstream sample, if possible.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. That didn’t hurt at all. I’ll go collect the urine sample now. A midstream sample, you said? I remember that from… well, I think I remember that from a previous check-up. I’ll be right back.
DOCTOR: Midstream sample… essential for accurate results. It’s remarkable how often patients neglect these simple instructions.
PATIENT: Here you are, Doctor. A midstream sample, as requested. I tried to follow the instructions as best I could.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Creagh. I will send this to the lab for a urinalysis and culture. We’ll have the results back within a few business days. While we await those results, based on your history and this initial examination, it is possible you are experiencing a urinary tract infection, although the absence of fever or flank pain is somewhat atypical. We will need to rule out other possibilities. I will order a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel as well, just to have a more complete picture. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very reasonable. I appreciate you being thorough. I’d like to know what the results mean, of course, when they come back. I trust your judgment. Are there any precautions I should take in the meantime? Should I be drinking more water, perhaps?
DOCTOR: Certainly. In the interim, I recommend increasing your fluid intake to at least eight glasses of water per day. Avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. If you experience any fever, chills, back pain, or blood in your urine, please contact the office immediately. And as a preventative measure, I advise practicing good hygiene – wiping front to back, urinating after intercourse. We will discuss further treatment options once we have the lab results. I will have the lab orders and a prescription for the blood work sent to your pharmacy. Do you have any other questions for me at this time, Ms. Creagh?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very helpful and thorough, and I appreciate your patience. I’ll follow your instructions and wait for the lab results. Thank you again. I suppose that concludes the visit?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Creagh. That concludes the visit. The nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results. She will also provide you with a discharge summary outlining all the instructions we've discussed today. Do not hesitate to call the office if you experience any worsening of symptoms before your appointment. Get well soon. .
