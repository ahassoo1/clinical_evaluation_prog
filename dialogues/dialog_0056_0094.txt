DOCTOR: Hi Airam, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um... hi. I think... the lady on the phone said something about... learning? I work with metal. Sheets of it. It's... hard work. Not that I need learning. I know how to do my job.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's... helpful. Just to clarify, were you referred here for a work evaluation, or something related to your job at the metal shop?
PATIENT: Evaluation? No! Nobody said anything about that. I just… my husband said I should come. He worries too much. He says I need to... know things. About… staying healthy, I guess? I don’t get sick often. Mostly just tired. Metal is heavy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like your husband is concerned about your health, given the physical demands of your work. That's good he's looking out for you. Just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: It’s… just always there. Like a weight. Even when I sleep. Not a bad sleep, just… not restful. I wake up still feeling it. And my back… my back always aches. But it’s metal, right? You lift heavy things, your back hurts. It’s normal. I take some pills sometimes, the red ones. But they don’t really fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re acknowledging the aches and pains, and that you've been trying something for them. Would you mind if I just take a quick look at your back, and maybe listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Listen? To my heart? What for? I told you, I'm fine. Mostly. It's just... work. I don't need you to listen to me. Unless... is this going to cost a lot of money? I don't have insurance.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the cost, Airam. We can definitely talk about that. I just want to rule out anything that might be contributing to the tiredness and back pain, beyond the physical demands of your job. Listening to your heart and lungs is a quick part of a general check-up, and it helps me get a complete picture. It’s not about thinking you're not fine, it's about making sure you are as healthy as possible. We can discuss payment options after the exam, okay?
PATIENT: Payment... yes. That's good. But… what if it’s nothing? What if you just tell me to lift less metal? Because I need to lift the metal. It's my job! Will I have to pay for you to tell me that?
DOCTOR: That’s a fair question, Airam. If it is just related to the physical demands of your work, we can discuss strategies for safe lifting techniques and managing the strain. And we can absolutely talk about potential resources available to you to help with that, without additional cost. The exam itself is relatively quick and will help me determine if we need to do any further testing. I won’t charge you for things we don’t need to do. How about we proceed with a quick look, and then we can talk about everything else afterwards?
PATIENT: Fine. But quick. Very quick. And you better not find anything. I have work to do. Metal doesn’t lift itself, you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, very quick. If you could just turn around and lean forward a little… I’ll just feel along your spine, checking for tenderness or tightness. And then I'll listen to your back, heart, and lungs. It won’t take long. Okay, I’m hearing some… slightly diminished breath sounds on your lower left lung. And your back muscles are quite tense, as you mentioned. No major tenderness to the spine itself. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Diminished…? What does that mean? Is something wrong with my lung? I told you, I’m fine. I just lift heavy metal. It makes you breathe hard. And my back is always tense. It’s a metal worker’s back! You don't need to tell me that’s not normal.
DOCTOR: It means your breathing sounds a little quieter in one part of your lung than I’d expect, that’s all. It could be perfectly normal, given the physical nature of your job, and the dust or particles you might be exposed to. But it’s something I want to investigate a little further, just to be safe. Do you cough often?
PATIENT: Cough…? Sometimes. Not a lot. Mostly when I swallow dust. Metal makes a lot of dust. Everyone at the shop coughs. It's… part of the job. We wear masks sometimes, the paper ones. But they don’t always help. My husband keeps telling me to ask for better masks… he worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful information. Given the potential dust exposure at work, and the occasional cough, I'd like to recommend a chest X-ray, just to get a clearer picture of your lungs. It will help us rule out any potential issues related to dust inhalation. Would you be able to get that done?
PATIENT: X-ray…? Another thing to pay for? My husband is going to be so mad. He already said I shouldn't spend money on doctors. He says I should just rest more. Metal is heavy, what do you want me to do? Is it… expensive? And will it take a long time? I have to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your worries about the cost and time, Airam. There may be options available to help with the expense. This brochure lists some local resources that offer financial assistance for medical tests. We can also discuss payment plans with the hospital. The X-ray itself doesn't take very long – usually about 10-15 minutes. We can try to schedule it for tomorrow morning, and I'll have the results back within a day or two. It's better to be safe, especially given your work environment. If you’re willing, we can also discuss strategies for protecting your lungs at work, like ensuring proper mask fit and ventilation. What do you think?
PATIENT: Ventilation…? Proper mask… My boss says the masks are good enough. He's been working with metal for 30 years, he knows. I don't want to cause trouble. Tomorrow… maybe. If I can get someone to cover my shift. And if it doesn't cost too much. I really need to get back to work. Metal doesn’t lift itself, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. Let’s do this – I’ll write down the number for the radiology department, and you can call them directly to inquire about the cost and schedule an appointment at your convenience. No pressure at all. I’m also going to write a note for your primary care physician, outlining my findings and recommendations, so they can follow up with you as well. Here’s the information. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns.
