DOCTOR: Good morning, Brendan. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this itching, really. It’s… everywhere, almost. Been going on for a few weeks now, and it’s driving me a bit mad, to be honest. It doesn’t seem to be getting better, and I figured I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, itching all over, for a few weeks. I understand that can be very frustrating. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s not… like a rash, exactly. There’s no bumps or anything, just… the skin feels itchy. It’s worse at night, I think. Keeps me up sometimes. And it doesn’t really look different, which is strange. I’ve tried some lotions, you know, the usual, but they don’t seem to help much. It’s just… constantly irritating.
DOCTOR: Hmm, no visible rash, worse at night… and the lotions aren’t providing relief. That's helpful to know. Have you noticed if anything specific seems to trigger it or make it worse besides just nighttime?
PATIENT: Let me think… no, not really. I haven't changed anything in my routine, not that I can recall. Same soaps, same detergents, same everything. I haven’t been traveling or anything like that either. I eat… fairly normally, I suppose. Nothing new on the menu, if you catch my drift. It just… started. Which is what’s so unsettling about it.
DOCTOR: Right, no obvious changes in your routine. That does make it trickier. And you said it's been going on for a few weeks?
PATIENT: Yes, about three weeks, maybe a little longer. I remember noticing it around the 15th of July, give or take a few days. It started subtly, just a little discomfort, and then gradually got worse. It’s really been the last week or so that it’s become a proper nuisance. I keep scratching, even when I don't realize I'm doing it. My wife… well, she used to tell me to stop. She’d rub lotion on my back for me. It’s just… different now.
DOCTOR: Okay, about three weeks, progressively worsening. I appreciate you giving me those details. Do you have any other symptoms along with the itching?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever, no fatigue, no weight loss… nothing like that. I’ve been sleeping okay, apart from the scratching, of course. And my appetite is normal. I haven't noticed any changes in my, uh, bowel habits or anything like that either. Just… the itching. It's really isolated. That's why I'm worried, I suppose. It just feels… off.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other associated symptoms. That's good, but also makes it harder to pinpoint. Let's go through a quick review of your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control for years now with medication. Just a small dose, nothing major. And I had my gallbladder removed about fifteen years ago. Other than that, nothing significant. Oh, and I used to smoke, but I quit about twenty years ago. Doctor told me it was the best thing I ever did. He was right, as it turns out.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension, gallbladder removal fifteen years ago, and a history of smoking, but you quit twenty years ago – that’s excellent. Any family history of skin conditions or anything like excessive itching?
PATIENT: That's a good question. Hmm… my mother had eczema when she was a child, I think. Nothing serious, just a bit of a rash now and then. And my grandmother, on my father’s side, she had very sensitive skin. She always complained about dryness and irritation. But nothing… excessive like this. It wasn't a family thing, as far as I know. We didn’t really talk about medical stuff much back then. It wasn’t really the done thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. No significant family history of skin conditions. And are you currently taking any medications, besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yes, just the lisinopril for the blood pressure. Twenty milligrams a day. And I take a multivitamin every morning, but that’s it. Nothing else. I try to stay away from pills as much as possible, honestly. I’m not a fan of loading up on medication if I can avoid it. Is that alright? Should I be taking something else for the itching?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, and I understand your preference. We’ll try to find the cause and address it with the least amount of medication possible. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty lucky in that regard. I can eat anything, take most pills without issue. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can recall. My wife used to tease me about having a cast-iron stomach. She tried all sorts of things on me, just to see if she could get a reaction. Nothing ever worked.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay, Brendan, based on what you've told me, it sounds like you have a persistent, widespread itching without any obvious rash or other symptoms. Given the duration and lack of clear cause, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, and potentially some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust your judgment. A physical exam and blood work sounds… sensible. I just want to figure out what’s going on. It’s been unsettling, to say the least. Let’s get it done. Where do we start?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s start with a visual examination of your skin. Please loosen your shirt and trousers so I can get a good look. I’ll be looking for any subtle changes in your skin, even if you can’t see them yourself. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and check your lymph nodes. I’m not seeing any obvious rash, redness, or hives. The skin appears generally normal in color and texture, although it does seem slightly dry… Have you been using any new soaps or lotions recently?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Same old stuff. Dove soap, mostly. And a basic, unscented lotion. I’ve even tried switching back to what I used years ago, just to be sure. No difference. It’s still itchy, regardless of what I put on it. It’s hard to describe… it’s just a general, all-over discomfort. Like my skin is constantly… tingling. It's not painful, just… irritating. And it’s worse at night, like I said. Keeps me awake scratching. It’s driving me mad.
DOCTOR: Okay, no changes in products, and worsening at night… I’m not feeling any unusual lumps or bumps. Your skin feels warm and dry, as I mentioned, but no significant tenderness. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, let me check your lymph nodes… Lymph nodes are not enlarged or tender. Alright. Everything feels normal on the physical exam, which is good. However, to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing the itching, I'd like to order some blood work. We'll check your complete blood count, liver function, kidney function, thyroid levels, and rule out any other basic causes. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever tests you think are necessary, Doctor. Blood work sounds sensible. I just want to get to the bottom of this. It’s been unsettling, to say the least. As long as it helps figure out what’s going on, I’m happy to have them check anything. Is there anything I should do before the blood work? Fasting or anything like that?
DOCTOR: Yes, good question. For this particular panel, I’d like you to fast for eight to twelve hours beforehand. So, no food or drinks other than water. We can schedule the blood work for tomorrow morning, if that works for you?
PATIENT: Tomorrow morning works perfectly. Eight to twelve hours, no food or drink except water. Got it. I suppose I should have a light dinner tonight, then. And avoid anything… spicy? Would that affect the results? I just want to make sure I do everything right.
DOCTOR: That's a good question, and yes, avoiding anything overly spicy or fatty tonight would be best. It's unlikely to significantly affect the results, but it's always best to be cautious. Alright, so we’ll schedule you for blood work tomorrow morning, fasting for eight to twelve hours. Once we have the results, we’ll give you a call to discuss them and determine the next steps. In the meantime, you can continue using your usual unscented lotion, and try to avoid scratching if possible. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Brendan?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and run some tests. It’s a relief to finally be doing something about it. I’ll see you tomorrow morning, then. And I’ll make sure to fast properly. Hopefully, we can get some answers soon. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright, Brendan. You’re very welcome. I'm glad we could get this started. And you’re right, hopefully, we’ll have some answers soon. We’ll see you tomorrow morning. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions before then. Have a good evening.
