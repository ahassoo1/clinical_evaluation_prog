DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Segretto. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hmm? Oh, yes, the doctor. Well, it’s this… this going to the bathroom business. It’s just… more often than it used to be, you see? Especially at night. Wakes my wife up, poor thing. It’s a nuisance, really. Not a big deal, I suppose, just… bothersome.
DOCTOR: “More often.” Right. And how much more often, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Numbers… I’m not good with numbers. Let me see… Before, maybe once or twice during the night. Now? Seems like… every couple of hours. Maybe three times? It’s hard to say, honestly. It’s not like I count every trip, you know? Just… a lot. It’s a disruption, that's what it is. A disruption.
DOCTOR: A disruption. Very well. And when you go, Mr. Segretto, is it a full emptying of the bladder, or just… a little at a time?
PATIENT: A little at a time, I reckon. Not a… gush, if that makes sense. Just… a steady stream. Not much force, either. It's… weak, I suppose you could say. Like an old garden hose with a kink in it. Does that help? I don't know what you doctors want to know these days.
DOCTOR: Weak stream, frequent small amounts… Alright. And have you noticed any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no pain. Not exactly. Maybe a little… discomfort. A little achy feeling afterward, sometimes. But not burning, no. It's not painful, if that makes sense. It's just… not comfortable, like something's not quite right. Old age, probably. Everything starts to feel a bit… off, you know?
DOCTOR: “Old age.” Right. Do you have any difficulty starting the stream, or does it come easily once you’re in the bathroom?
PATIENT: Hmm… Starting… Well, it doesn’t come immediately, if that’s what you mean. I have to… wait a moment. Push a bit, maybe. Not a struggle, mind you. Just… a little encouragement. Like starting an old tractor. You have to prime the pump a bit, you see? It’s not like it used to be, when you could just… go. Back in my day… anyway, it takes a moment. A small moment.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any changes in the color of your urine?
PATIENT: Color? Goodness, I don't pay attention to the color of my… well, you know. It's… yellow, I suppose. Sometimes lighter, sometimes darker. Depends on what I drink, I imagine. Water, mostly. Sometimes juice. I haven't been looking at it, doctor. Really. What does the color matter? Is something wrong with the color? You doctors always ask about the most peculiar things.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s all part of the process, Mr. Segretto. Now, if you’ll permit me, I’d like to do a quick examination. Just a simple abdominal palpation and a quick check of your prostate. It will only take a moment. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: A… prostate check? Oh dear. Is that… necessary? I don't like doctors poking around down there. Really, is it absolutely required? I mean, I'm an old man, doctor. Haven't you seen enough of those by now? I suppose… if you insist. But be gentle, will you? It's a sensitive area, you understand. Very sensitive.
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Mr. Segretto. It's standard procedure when evaluating urinary frequency. Now, please relax. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Prostate is… enlarged, slightly firm. No obvious nodules felt, but there is some asymmetry. Hmm. That’s what I suspected.
PATIENT: Enlarged? Asymmetry? What does that mean, doctor? Is it something serious? You're not telling me everything, are you? I can tell. Is it… is it cancer? My brother had… well, never mind. Just tell me straight. What’s going on down there? Don’t beat around the bush with me, doctor. I’m an old man, I deserve to know the truth.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, please. Do not jump to conclusions. An enlarged prostate is very common at your age—benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. It simply means the prostate gland has grown larger, which can cause the urinary symptoms you're experiencing. The asymmetry could be nothing, or it could warrant further investigation. However, based on your symptoms and the exam, I suspect BPH is the most likely cause. We will need to confirm with a PSA blood test and a urinalysis to rule out infection and other possibilities. I will order those tests immediately.
PATIENT: BPH… that’s it? Just an old man thing? Still… tests. Always tests. I don’t like the sound of that. Blood tests… poking around… What if something is wrong? I don’t want to spend my remaining years worrying about… things. Can’t you just… give me something for it? A pill or something? To stop the nighttime trips? I’m not asking for a cure, just a little relief. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, I understand your concerns, but a proper diagnosis is essential before starting any treatment. I will not prescribe medication based on speculation. Once we have the results of the tests, we can discuss treatment options—which may include medication, lifestyle changes, or, in some cases, a referral to a urologist. For now, I will order the PSA and urinalysis. The lab technician will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend limiting your fluid intake before bedtime and avoiding caffeine and alcohol. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: I suppose not. Tests… always tests. Limiting fluids… no caffeine… It sounds like a miserable existence, doctor. A miserable existence. Fine. Just… get it over with. I’ll see what the lab says. And if it’s bad news… well, I suppose I’ll deal with it then. Though, frankly, I don’t know if I have the energy for any more dealing. Thank you, doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mr. Segretto. The results will be sent to your primary care physician, and someone will contact you with the details. .
