DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Schieber, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Though, if you must know, it’s pronounced “Shee-ber.” And frankly, I have other things I need to attend to this afternoon, so if we could expedite this…
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let’s get on with it then. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s… rather embarrassing, to be quite honest. It’s a… a white coating in my mouth. It’s uncomfortable, and my wife insisted I come. She worries over everything, you understand. It’s probably nothing, but she’s been quite persistent.
DOCTOR: A coating in your mouth… right. And how long has this “coating” been present?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, I’m not entirely certain. A week, perhaps? Maybe a little longer. I don’t spend a great deal of time examining my mouth, if you catch my drift. It doesn’t feel particularly serious, and I have a demanding schedule.
DOCTOR: Demanding schedule notwithstanding, Mr. Schieber, ignoring potential medical issues is rarely advisable. Is it painful?
PATIENT: Painful? Not precisely. More… irritating. It’s particularly bothersome when I eat something sweet, or something acidic. Though, I suppose a little discomfort is to be expected. I had a rather… robust lunch today.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm. Let me think… no, not really. Perhaps a bit more tired than usual, but that could be the long hours, couldn’t it? I haven’t noticed anything particularly alarming. And frankly, I don’t have time for a comprehensive symptom list.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's have a quick look, then. Please open wide. I'll need to examine your oral cavity.
PATIENT: Get this over with quickly, if you would. I have a very important phone call scheduled in… well, never mind. Just look.
DOCTOR: Hm. Yes, I see a whitish coating on your tongue and the buccal mucosa. No obvious lesions or ulcerations. It could be a number of things, likely a mild fungal infection, possibly candidiasis. Are you using any inhaled corticosteroids or antibiotics currently?
PATIENT: Inhaled corticosteroids? Antibiotics? Goodness, no. I rarely even take an aspirin, if I can avoid it. I prefer to let my body handle things naturally. All those pharmaceuticals… they simply mask the underlying problem, you know? Frankly, I’m not sure what you expect me to know about inhaled… whatever you said.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, given your history – or lack thereof – and the presentation, I suspect it's a relatively benign case of oral thrush. I recommend improving your oral hygiene – brush twice daily, floss, and consider an over-the-counter antifungal mouthwash. If it doesn’t improve within a week, then we can revisit. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? No, none that I'm aware of. I eat everything. I have a very robust constitution, as I mentioned. Look, is that all? I really must be going. I appreciate your time, Doctor, but I do have a very pressing engagement.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll document my findings. Since you're uninsured, I won't be prescribing anything at this time. Over-the-counter should suffice. If it worsens, seek immediate medical attention. Here. This summarizes our discussion. Next patient.
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you, I suppose. Though, I fail to see what all the fuss was about. Honestly, a complete waste of time. .
