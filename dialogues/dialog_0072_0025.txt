DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Scobie. I’m Dr. Hembrey. It says here you’re 85 years old. Welcome to the clinic. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yes, eighty-five. Feels like yesterday sometimes! I want to... how you say... find out where my people come from. My family, long, long ago. I hear you can do that now with... spit? DNA, is it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, this is a medical clinic. We address health concerns. While I understand you’re curious about your ancestry, that falls outside the scope of my practice. There are genealogical services specifically designed for that purpose. However… … if you’ve been experiencing any health issues that prompted you to consider your family history, perhaps we should focus on those. Are you having any symptoms – anything at all – that brought you in today?
PATIENT: Oh. I didn’t… I thought doctors could do everything. My niece, she told me this place could test the DNA. She said it could show me where my ancestors come from, maybe even tell me about sicknesses in the family, long ago. No, no sicknesses now. I feel okay, mostly. Just… old. Sometimes my knees ache when the weather changes, but that’s just getting old, right? Not a doctor problem?
DOCTOR: While DNA testing can reveal predispositions to certain conditions, it’s not simply a tool for tracing ancestry. And it’s certainly not something we routinely offer here. Your niece is…misinformed. Knee pain can be a doctor problem, Mr. Scobie. Especially if it’s interfering with your daily life. How much is it interfering?
PATIENT: Not too bad, Doctor. I still walk to the store, slow, but I walk. And I still make my wood carvings. Little boats, mostly. Used to make them for the tourists, but not so many tourists anymore. It’s just a little pain when it rains, or when it’s cold. Nothing I can’t handle. But… …I really wanted to know about my family. About where they really came from. Is there… any way you could just… look at the DNA, just a little bit? Even if you can’t tell me everything?
DOCTOR: Mr. Scobie, I understand your curiosity, but I must reiterate that this clinic focuses on medical care. Performing a DNA test solely for genealogical purposes is ethically questionable and frankly, a misuse of medical resources. It’s not within the scope of my practice, and I will not be doing it. Now, let's focus on your health. You mentioned knee pain. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain on a typical rainy day?
PATIENT: Oh. I see. Okay. No DNA test. I understand. Rainy day… hmm. Maybe a four? It’s not…sharp pain, Doctor. More like a ache. A heavy ache. Makes me walk slower, that’s all. And sometimes I have trouble getting up from my chair. Is there anything you can do for that ache?
DOCTOR: A four is…manageable, but persistent. Trouble getting up from a chair is also concerning. It could be simple arthritis, Mr. Scobie, or something else entirely. I’m going to perform a brief physical examination of your knees and hips. It will involve me asking you to move them in certain directions while I assess your range of motion and look for any tenderness. Do I have your permission to proceed?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. If you think it will help the ache, yes, please. I’ll do whatever you think is best. Just be gentle, okay? My bones aren't what they used to be. Eighty-five years will do that to a person.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Scobie. I will be as gentle as possible. Please sit here on the table. “Alright, Mr. Scobie, I’m going to bend your knee now. Just let it go as far as it comfortably will. Okay… a bit of crepitus there, which is common with age. Range of motion is slightly limited. Now, can you rotate your hips?
PATIENT: Okay… That little pop… that’s always there. My wife used to say it was the ghosts in my joints. Ooh… that one’s a little tight. Feels…stiff. Like a rusty gate. Is that bad, Doctor?
DOCTOR: "The crepitus is not necessarily alarming, Mr. Scobie, as you said. It's often just the sound of cartilage moving. However, the stiffness and limited range of motion are concerning. I’m detecting some tenderness here, on the outer aspect of your right hip. It sounds like you may have some osteoarthritis, particularly in your right hip. I’m going to listen to your knees now. Just relax. Any history of injury to either hip or knee?
PATIENT: No, no injuries. Not that I remember, anyway. I used to play a little baseball when I was a boy, but nothing serious. Just… running around, catching the ball. Oh! Wait… maybe when I was… oh, a long time ago, I fell off a roof when I was trying to fix it. But that was… sixty years ago, at least? Didn’t bother me much then. Just a little scrape. Maybe that’s it? The scrape?
DOCTOR: “Sixty years ago is…quite a long time, Mr. Scobie. It's possible that fall contributed to some underlying issues, but it's difficult to say definitively at this point. Your reflexes are normal, and there's no swelling in your joints. Based on my examination, I believe you are experiencing osteoarthritis in both knees, with a more pronounced degree of involvement in your right hip. This is a common condition in individuals of your age, due to wear and tear on the joints over time. It’s not something we can “cure”, but we can manage the symptoms. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Wear and tear… like an old boat? Yes, I think I understand. It’s just… getting old, right? Not a big surprise. But… what does “manage the symptoms” mean? Does that mean… pills? I don’t like taking pills, Doctor. They make me sleepy. And my stomach doesn’t like them much either. Is there… anything else? Maybe some kind of cream? Or… something I can do? Like exercises? I still like to walk, you know. I don’t want to stop walking.
DOCTOR: “Pills are often the most effective way to manage pain, Mr. Scobie, but I understand your concerns. We can explore other options, although they may not provide the same level of relief. There are topical creams available, but their efficacy is limited, particularly for deeper joint pain. Physical therapy can be helpful, but it requires commitment and consistent effort on your part. And it's unlikely to completely eliminate your symptoms. I recommend a course of low-dose naproxen to start, taken with food to minimize stomach upset. We can reassess in a month and adjust the dosage if needed. And I’ll provide you with a referral to a physical therapist. It's your choice whether or not to attend. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Naproxen… that’s a pill, right? I don’t think I’m allergic to anything… my wife used to give me all sorts of things when I was sick, and I never had a problem. But I don’t like taking pills, even if they’re not bad for me. They just make me feel… slow. And my stomach… it rumbles. Physical therapy… that sounds good! Maybe someone can show me some exercises to keep my legs strong? Like… walking exercises? I like walking. Can they teach me how to walk better? So my knees don't ache so much? That would be good. Yes, please. A physical therapy. And… maybe just a little bit of the pill, if you think it's really necessary? Just to help me walk.
DOCTOR: “Very well, Mr. Scobie. We can start with a low dose of naproxen – 220 milligrams twice daily with food. We’ll monitor your tolerance and adjust as needed. I’m writing you a referral to Dr. Chen at the Rehabilitation Center. She specializes in geriatric physical therapy. I cannot guarantee that physical therapy will eliminate your pain, but it can help improve your strength, flexibility, and range of motion. And it’s important to maintain an active lifestyle, as long as it’s safe and comfortable for you. I’m also going to provide you with a handout on osteoarthritis, with information on self-management techniques. Do you have any further questions at this time?
PATIENT: Handout… okay. Yes, that’s good. I like pictures. Makes it easier. Just… one thing, Doctor. About the DNA test… I know you said you can’t do it here. But… do you know anyone who can? Maybe a different doctor? Or a… a place? I just… I really want to know where my people come from. It feels important, you know? Even if it costs a little money. It feels like… finding a missing piece.
DOCTOR: “Mr. Scobie, with all due respect, I’ve already addressed this matter. I do not endorse or recommend pursuing genealogical DNA testing, particularly for medical purposes. It is not within my scope of practice to provide referrals for non-medical procedures. I suggest you consult with your primary care physician or conduct an online search for reputable genealogical services. However, I cannot provide any further assistance on this topic. Let’s focus on your health and managing your osteoarthritis. Do you have any questions regarding the medication or the physical therapy referral?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. I see. No… no more questions, Doctor. Just the pills and the therapy. Thank you, Doctor. For… trying. And for the handout. Pictures are good. I guess I’ll… go home and take a nap. And try not to ache too much. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: “You’re welcome, Mr. Scobie. Follow up with me in one month to discuss your progress. And please, prioritize your health. Good day.” .
