DOCTOR: Good morning, Airam. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Huh? Oh. Good morning. I... think my husband made this appointment. Something about... learning things? I work with metal, you know. Big sheets. It's... hard work. I don't really feel sick.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this appointment may have been scheduled for a general health assessment, perhaps related to your work with metal. That's perfectly alright. We can definitely do that. Just to be clear, when you say you don’t feel sick, are you experiencing any pain, fatigue, shortness of breath, or any other unusual symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Unusual symptoms? What does that mean? I get tired, of course. Metal is heavy! And my back… sometimes it aches. Everyone's back aches, right? I don't go around thinking about… symptoms. My husband worries too much. He always has.
DOCTOR: You're right, back aches are very common, especially with physically demanding work. And it’s good you’re aware of your fatigue. “Unusual symptoms” just means anything different than how you normally feel. Okay, let’s focus on the back pain for a moment. Can you describe where exactly it hurts?
PATIENT: Ugh, everywhere! No, not everywhere. Mostly… lower back. And sometimes it goes down my leg. Not always, though. Depends. Depends on how much I lift, I guess. And if it's cold. Cold makes it worse. It's just… work.
DOCTOR: I see. So, lower back pain that sometimes radiates down your leg, and is aggravated by lifting and cold temperatures. That gives us a good starting point. When did this pain first start?
PATIENT: Ugh… a long time ago. Honestly? I don’t remember exactly. Years. Maybe… five years? Or more? I just… always have a little ache. It gets bad sometimes, then better. I just… take something for it. A little pill. I don’t even know what it is. My husband gets it for me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a chronic lower back pain for approximately five years, with intermittent flares. And you manage it with a pain medication your husband provides. Do you remember anything about the pill – the color, shape, or size?
PATIENT: Ugh. White, I think. Small. Little round thing. That's all I know. Honestly, doctor, I don’t pay attention to pills. I just… take it when it hurts. And then it stops hurting. What does it matter what color it is?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Airam. It's good you’re able to manage the pain. Knowing what the medication is helps us ensure it’s safe and effective for you long-term. I understand you don’t focus on that detail. Let's move on. Besides the back pain, are you experiencing any other health concerns?
PATIENT: Concerns? No. I mean… I get a little winded sometimes. But that's just… the metal. It's heavy! And my hands are always sore. From bending and… everything. But that's just work. I'm a sheet metal worker. What do you expect?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like you're very dedicated to your work, and it's physically demanding. Fatigue and hand soreness are certainly expected with that type of labor. To get a clearer picture of your overall health, could you tell me a bit about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? Ugh. I don't have a medical history. I never go to the doctor! Except for… when I broke my arm when I was little. Fell out of a tree. But that was ages ago. My husband said something about… high blood pressure? Last year? But I don't feel any different. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of a broken arm in childhood, and your husband mentioned potentially elevated blood pressure last year. We'll want to look into that blood pressure reading, if possible. Do you recall where it was checked, or do you have any records of it?
PATIENT: Ugh. No! He took me to… the pharmacy, I think. The one near the grocery store. He said the machine said something about… numbers. He got all upset. I don't remember the numbers. He just said I needed to… watch it. He keeps saying that. Watch it. Everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like your husband is concerned about your blood pressure and has encouraged you to monitor it. That’s good of him to be proactive. Let’s do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of your current condition. I’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your back and hands. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. But don't expect anything. I'm a sheet metal worker. I'm supposed to be sore.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand your work is physically demanding. This is just a routine assessment to get a baseline and ensure everything is healthy. If you could please have a seat on the table, we'll start with your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is a bit elevated. That’s consistent with what your husband mentioned. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me… And now, could you point to where you're experiencing the most pain in your back?
PATIENT: Here. Right here. And it goes down my leg sometimes. Like… a shooting pain. Not all the time. But when I lift something heavy, or it's really cold. It's just… work. You wouldn't understand. It's hard work.
DOCTOR: I can see you're experiencing discomfort. It sounds like you may have some muscle strain, possibly with some nerve involvement given the pain radiating down your leg. I understand your work is physically demanding, and I appreciate you explaining that. Now, I'm just going to check the range of motion in your back. Could you please bend forward and touch your toes, if possible?
PATIENT: Ouch! No. I can't. Not really. It hurts too much. See? I told you. It's just… work. You doctors always say it's muscle strain. It's not! It's… heavy metal. And long hours.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. No need to push through the pain. It sounds like your back muscles are quite tight and restricted. I want to rule out anything more serious causing the pain radiating down your leg. Given the description and your physical exam, it is possible you have a lumbar strain, but we need to be cautious. I would like to order an X-ray of your lower back to assess the alignment of the vertebrae and rule out any fractures or other structural issues. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: X-ray? Ugh. More tests. Is it going to cost a lot of money? My husband is already upset about the blood pressure thing. And I don't see what looking at my bones is going to do. They'll just say it's muscle strain, like always.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the cost and the usefulness of the test. We can discuss options for making it affordable, and I assure you, the X-ray will help us get a clearer picture of what's going on and rule out anything serious. It’s a preventative measure, and will allow us to create a plan to help relieve your pain. We can also discuss a referral to a physical therapist, who can work with you on exercises and stretches to strengthen your back and improve your flexibility, whether or not the X-ray reveals anything significant. Does that sound like a reasonable approach?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. But if it's just going to say muscle strain, I'm not paying for it. And I don't want to go to any fancy physical therapist. I just need a pill. A stronger pill, maybe? My husband… he’ll handle the money. He always does.
DOCTOR: Okay, Airam. We’ll proceed with the X-ray, and I’ll ensure the results are thoroughly reviewed. I will also document your preference for avoiding physical therapy at this time. However, I want to emphasize the importance of addressing the underlying cause of your pain. Regarding medication, I understand you’re looking for pain relief. While I can prescribe something for the discomfort, I’m hesitant to simply mask the pain without knowing the source. I can start you on a mild anti-inflammatory medication while we wait for the X-ray results, but I would strongly recommend we follow up once we have those results to discuss a more comprehensive treatment plan. I'll also write a note for your husband regarding the blood pressure reading and recommend he schedule a follow-up appointment with his primary care provider to discuss further monitoring and potential treatment options. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Whatever you say. Just… don’t make me come back too often. I have work to do. And tell my husband not to worry so much. He's always worrying. And… can I get the prescription now?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand you have a busy schedule, and I’ll do my best to make this as efficient as possible. I'm prescribing you Naproxen 500mg twice daily for pain and inflammation. It's a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication. Here is the prescription for your husband to fill at the pharmacy. I’ll also give you a referral slip for the X-ray, and the instructions are on the slip. Please call to schedule that at your earliest convenience. To recap, we have: a prescription for Naproxen, a referral for an X-ray, and a recommendation for your husband to follow up with his primary care physician regarding his blood pressure. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Naproxen… okay. No. I don't think so. Just… don't expect me to be happy if this doesn't work. I need to be able to lift things. That’s my job. And tell my husband not to bother me about it too much.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. I will document your concerns and emphasize the importance of finding a solution that allows you to continue working comfortably. I'll also inform your husband of your preferences regarding follow-up and monitoring. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you experience any worsening symptoms or have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Thank you for coming in today, Airam. I wish you the best, and I hope you feel better soon. .
PATIENT: Whatever.
