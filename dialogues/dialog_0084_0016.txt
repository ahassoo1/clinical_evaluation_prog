DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Farson. I’m Dr. Voytek. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's about my… well, it’s about old man Hemmings. He’s been bruising like a peach lately. He’s on that blood thinning medicine, you know, to keep the clots away, and it seems to be doing too good a job, if you ask me. Frankly, he's a bit of a mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re concerned about Mr. Hemmings and the bruising he's experiencing while on a blood thinner. And you say he's bruising "lately"—could you give me a little more detail about when you first noticed this, and how often it’s been happening?
PATIENT: Well, “lately” is… a couple of weeks, I suppose. Maybe three? Honestly, I don’t keep meticulous track of the old man’s mishaps. He trips over everything. But it’s more than usual. Usually it’s a little bump, a small thing, and he’s fine. Now? He looks like he’s been in a fight. Yesterday he just brushed against the coffee table and got a huge purple mark on his arm. It’s… concerning. He's not a young man, you know.
DOCTOR: Right, I understand. A noticeable increase in bruising with minimal trauma over the past couple of weeks. That is concerning, especially given his age. And he’s on a blood thinner. Let’s get some more information. First, do you know the name of the blood thinner he's taking, and what dose is he on?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor, I don't. He handles all his own medication. I just… check on him. He’s a bit… independent. Stubborn, really. He’ll say it’s “warfarin” or something like that, I think he mentioned it once. But I have no idea what the dosage is. He gets a prescription, he takes his pills... that's about all I know. I wouldn't want to interfere. He'd complain for weeks.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's alright. We can definitely look that information up in his records. Ah, yes. Mr. Hemmings is on warfarin 5mg daily. Now, besides the increased bruising, has he had any bleeding anywhere else?
PATIENT: Bleeding? Hmm… let me think. No, not that I've seen. No nosebleeds, no blood in his stool… nothing like that. He did complain of a headache a couple of days ago, but he gets those all the time. Old age, you know. Probably just a headache. I wouldn’t call that bleeding, really. Just… a pain in the head. He took some aspirin and seemed to be alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, no other obvious signs of bleeding. He had a headache a few days ago, which he treated with aspirin. Aspirin can also thin the blood, so that’s good to know. Now, has he had any recent falls, even minor ones, that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Well, like I said, he trips over everything. He’s got a rug in the living room, a perfectly good rug, and he just seems determined to fall over it. I'd say he's had... two minor stumbles in the last week. Nothing major, he didn't break anything, just a bit shaken up. He refuses to get rid of the rug. Says it “ties the room together.” Honestly, it’s a hazard. But he’s a grown man. What can I tell him?
DOCTOR: Okay, so two minor falls in the last week, and he’s refusing to address the potential hazard of the rug. We need to check his INR, that’s how we measure how effective the warfarin is. According to his records, his last INR was checked a month ago and was within the therapeutic range, but a month is a while. I’d like to do a quick physical exam just to get a better idea of what's going on and then we can order a new INR. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. A physical exam. Whatever you think is necessary. Though honestly, I’m not sure what you’ll find. He's an old man. A bit frail, yes, but he's always been that way. Just… be gentle with him, alright? He doesn't like being poked and prodded. Makes him cranky. And please don’t tell him I sent you. He’ll complain for a week about unnecessary doctors’ visits. It's a whole ordeal.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. We'll be gentle, and I won’t mention that you sent him. Let's start by just taking his blood pressure and listening to his heart and lungs. Then I’ll take a look at the bruising you mentioned. Can you tell me where specifically he's been bruising?
PATIENT: Mostly on his arms, you know, where he tries to catch himself when he falls. And a bit on his legs. Yesterday it was his forearm. A nasty purple mark. He’s always getting them on his shins, too, from bumping into furniture. He’s a bit… clumsy. And a couple on his back, I think. Though it's hard to say, he wears those loose shirts. He doesn’t like tight clothing. It “restricts his circulation”, apparently. Honestly, he's just a mess. A very stubborn mess.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising on his arms, legs, forearm, and possibly his back. I’ll document that. And how’s his energy level been lately?
PATIENT: His energy? Hmm… about what you’d expect for an 87-year-old man. He naps a lot. He always has. He gets tired easily. Complains of feeling “weak”, but he says that every time I visit. He used to be quite the gardener, you know, but he hasn't been able to do that for years. Now he just sits in his chair and watches television. Mostly old westerns. And complains about the news. It's… depressing, to be honest. It's just… old age, I suppose. He’s slowing down.
DOCTOR: Okay, decreased energy level, spends most of his time resting, and some generalized weakness. His heart sounds are regular, and his lungs are clear. I’m not hearing anything concerning there. Blood pressure is a little elevated at 148/82, but not dramatically so. Now, can you describe the bruising itself?
PATIENT: Well, it's… purple. A nasty, dark purple. It varies in size, of course. Yesterday’s one on his forearm was a good four inches long. Not raised, not swollen, just… purple. Like someone had grabbed him really hard. And it doesn’t fade quickly. It sticks around for a good week, sometimes longer. He complains about it being tender, but he’s always complaining about something. Honestly, it looks… alarming. Even for an old man who trips over his own feet. And it’s spreading, I think. He seems to get a new one every other day. It’s… concerning. Very concerning.
DOCTOR: Okay, dark purple bruising, approximately four inches in length in some areas, slow to fade, tender, and increasing in frequency. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, it sounds like Mr. Hemmings may be over-anticoagulated on the warfarin, or there may be another underlying cause for the increased bruising. I’m going to order a new INR right away. While we wait for the results, I’m also going to order a complete blood count to rule out any other issues. We'll also need to consider if he’s taking any other medications, even over-the-counter ones, that could be contributing. Do you know of anything else he’s taking?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medications… let me think. He takes something for his arthritis, I think. A little white pill. And something for his cholesterol. He always has a bottle of aspirin in the kitchen, but he only takes it when he has a headache, he says. And… that's about it. He’s very particular about not taking too many pills. “They all have side effects”, he always says. He gets a lot of supplements too, from those television commercials. Vitamins and minerals and… I don’t even know what else. He doesn't tell me much about them. He just orders them online. Honestly, I wouldn't trust half of them. He's a bit… gullible, when it comes to those things. But I don’t monitor his medication closely. He gets upset if I ask too many questions.
DOCTOR: Okay, so he's taking something for arthritis, cholesterol medication, occasionally takes aspirin, and also takes a variety of supplements he orders online. We really need a complete list of everything he’s taking, including the names and dosages. I’ll ask him directly, but it would be incredibly helpful if you could try to get a list from him as well. While we wait for the INR and the complete blood count, I’m going to recommend he stop taking the aspirin, just to be safe. Also, I will ask him to be very careful to avoid any injuries. Do you think he'll be receptive to that?
PATIENT: Stop the aspirin? Probably not. He's very stubborn, you know. He'll say it helps with his headache, and he doesn't like being told what to do. He’ll probably just ignore me. As for being careful… well, he trips over everything, even when he is being careful. He'll say he’s being careful, but then he'll stumble over that rug again. Honestly, it's going to be an uphill battle. I doubt he'll listen to a word I say. But I’ll try, I suppose. I always try. It's just… he's a difficult man. A very difficult man. But he’s all I have left. So I’ll try my best to get him to listen. I just don’t have much faith that it will work.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We'll do our best to work with his stubbornness. I will document his reluctance to stop the aspirin and his history of falls. We’ll get the lab results back as quickly as possible, and then we can discuss a plan of action. For now, the most important thing is to avoid any further injuries. If he experiences any signs of bleeding – unusual bruising, bleeding gums, blood in the stool or urine, severe headache – he needs to go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Unusual bruising, bleeding gums, blood in anything… emergency room immediately. I've got it. Though honestly, the old man would probably try to treat it with some herbal remedy he ordered online before going to the hospital. He's… unconventional, to say the least. But I’ll make sure he understands. As best I can. And I'll keep a close eye on him. I always do. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns. It's… reassuring, knowing someone is taking this seriously. He’s a bit of a mess, but he’s my mess.
DOCTOR: Okay. You're very welcome. I’m glad I could help, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns in the meantime. We’ll do everything we can to get Mr. Hemmings back on his feet. I'll let the nurse know to draw the labs. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Thank you again for your time and attention. I feel… a little better, knowing we’re taking this seriously. Though honestly, I still worry. He’s not a young man, you know. But I’ll do my best to keep him safe. And I’ll try to get a list of those supplements. No promises, though. He's very protective of his little pills. .
