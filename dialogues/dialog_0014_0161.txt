DOCTOR: Right. Helaina Trefren, 55 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, honestly? My niece, Layla, she told me I should come. She’s… very informed. She said I should talk about something to help prevent HIV. I don’t even know where to begin, really. It’s a little embarrassing talking about this with a stranger, but Layla was pretty insistent.
DOCTOR: Preventative measures… yes. Well, it's good you're being proactive, I suppose. Though, frankly, I see a lot of people for actual problems, not… theoretical ones. But alright. Let’s start with the basics. Are you sexually active?
PATIENT: Um… yes. I am. Not a lot, lately, but… yes. I’m single, you see. It’s… complicated. And I just want to be careful. Layla said there was a pill you could take, even before anything happens, and that’s what I wanted to ask about. Is that… PrEP? She used that word.
DOCTOR: PrEP, yes. Pre-exposure prophylaxis. Your niece seems to have done her research. It is an option. But it’s not just… taking a pill and being done with it. There are considerations. We need to rule out other things first, and make sure it's even appropriate for you. Have you ever been tested for HIV?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. I had a test… let me think… about five years ago, I think? When my son was getting married, actually. They wanted everyone to get checked, just to be safe. It was negative, definitely negative. I remember being relieved. It was at that big clinic downtown, near the market. They called me with the results. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Five years is… not recent, unfortunately. Things change. We'd need a current test to establish a baseline. And frankly, knowing which clinic downtown helps… there are several. But alright. We can do that here today. Besides HIV, have you ever been tested for any other sexually transmitted infections?
PATIENT: Let me see… No, I don't think so. Not that I remember, anyway. I… wasn’t very active back then. And I haven't really been with anyone consistently since… well, a long time. It just hasn’t come up. Is it something you usually do? I feel a little silly being asked all these things, but… Layla said you’d ask. She really thought this was important.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Ms. Trefren. If we’re discussing preventative medication for potential exposure, we need to know your current status regarding actual exposures. It's not about judging your lifestyle, it's about providing appropriate care. And honestly, your niece is right to be concerned. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any chronic health conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let’s see… I have a little bit of arthritis in my hands, mostly. It’s not too bad, I can manage. And my blood pressure runs a little high sometimes, but I take a pill for that. Just a small one, every morning. And… oh! I had my gallbladder out about ten years ago. Does that matter? I'm on Medicare, if that helps. I think that covers everything, really. I try to stay healthy, you know? I walk every day.
DOCTOR: Alright. Arthritis, hypertension, cholecystectomy. And Medicare is noted. Do you know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. It’s a white pill, small… it starts with an ‘A’, I think? Amlodipine? Is that right? My pharmacist knows, of course, but I never really bothered to memorize the name. It’s just… the little white pill. I take it with my breakfast every morning. I get it automatically refilled. Does that help? I'm sorry I'm not very good with these things.
DOCTOR: Amlodipine, yes. That's helpful. Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I used to get penicillin shots as a kid, and that was fine. And I’ve taken all sorts of things for colds and headaches over the years, never any problems. I'm a pretty sturdy person, usually. But I’m getting a little tired of all these questions, if you don’t mind me saying. I just wanted to know about that pill Layla mentioned.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Trefren. But these questions are necessary to ensure PrEP is safe and appropriate for you. We need to rule out contraindications. Now, have you ever had a liver or kidney problem?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. No! Never. I eat pretty healthy, mostly vegetables. I drink a lot of water. My doctor always says my blood work is good, except for the blood pressure, of course. I… I don’t understand why you’re asking about my liver. What does that have to do with anything? I just want to know if this pill will protect me, that’s all. And I’m getting a little worried about all this now, honestly. Is it a complicated pill? Will it make me sick?
DOCTOR: PrEP can have some side effects, yes, and it does affect the liver, which is why we ask. It’s not a major issue for most people, but we need to be aware of it. We’d monitor your liver function with blood tests if you were to start it. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you use recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not. I haven't touched a thing in my life. I drink a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but that’s it. Honestly, I’m a very… a very respectable woman. I’m a little offended you’d even ask. I just want to know if this pill is safe. Is it going to interact with my blood pressure medication? That’s what I’m really worried about now. This is getting much more complicated than Layla made it sound.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I apologize if my questions seem… intrusive. It's just standard procedure. There can be interactions with certain medications, including blood pressure medication, yes. Amlodipine itself isn’t a major concern, but we’d still need to check levels and ensure there aren’t any issues. Now, before we proceed any further, let's do a quick physical exam. It’s just a basic check to make sure everything is alright. Can I take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just get it over with. I really don’t have all day. And please, can you explain everything in plain English? No medical jargon, please. Just tell me if this pill is safe for me or not. And if it’s going to make me sick. That’s all I want to know. This whole thing is just… exhausting.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm… and take a deep breath. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated, but not surprising given your history. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation. No noticeable swelling in your extremities. Now, before we discuss PrEP specifically, we need to get some blood work done. We'll check your kidney and liver function, your HIV status, and screen for other sexually transmitted infections. That's the only way to determine if it's safe and appropriate for you. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… get it over with. I don’t want to keep coming back here. And please, tell the lab I don’t like needles. And can you promise me you’ll explain everything in plain English when the results come back? No complicated words, just yes or no. Is it safe or not safe? That’s all I need to know. I'm really starting to regret listening to Layla.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Trefren. I’ll make a note about your aversion to needles and ensure the lab technician is aware. And I promise to explain the results in plain English, as clearly as possible. We’ll focus on a simple "safe or not safe" answer, as you requested. I'll send the order to the lab now. They should be able to see you shortly. Once the results are back – usually a few days – my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
