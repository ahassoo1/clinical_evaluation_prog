DOCTOR: Hi Smith, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Yoshino. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… well, it’s about… starting a family, I think. My… someone special and I, we’re thinking about having a baby. But I am… old. Maybe too old. That’s why I came. To… check if it’s okay. I don’t really… understand much about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s a really good question, and it’s smart to come in and talk about it. It’s definitely possible to have children later in life, but there are some things we need to consider. And you're right, it's good to get all the information. First, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. You mentioned being concerned about your age – 66 is a little later in life for starting a family, and we want to make sure everything is working as it should. Have you had a regular doctor checking in with you?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I used to… a long time ago. But… things happened. Lots of things. I’ve been mostly okay, I think. No big problems. Just… tired sometimes. And my memory isn’t what it used to be. Is that bad? For… this? Having a baby? I don't remember if I have any health papers anywhere. I moved a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. It's completely understandable that things have been… complicated, and that keeping track of medical records can be difficult with a lot of moving around. And no, being tired or having some memory issues doesn't automatically mean it’s not possible, but they can be things we want to investigate a little further to make sure they aren't related to something that could affect things. Let’s start with a quick review of your medical history, as best as you can recall. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High blood… pressure? I think the doctor said something about that, a long time ago. Maybe. He gave me some pills, I think. But I stopped taking them. They made me feel… funny. Diabetes… no, I don’t think so. My mother had something with her sugar, maybe that was it. I don't… I don't remember much about it. Heart… no, never anything with my heart. I used to be very active. Lots of walking. Is that helpful? I'm sorry I can't remember better. It’s all… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It's very common to not remember everything perfectly, and we can work with what you do recall. The potential high blood pressure is something we definitely want to check, and family history can be helpful too. Let’s move on to surgeries. Have you ever had any operations or surgical procedures?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a boy. That's all I really remember. Maybe a small thing on my knee, when I was playing football, but it was a long time ago. Nothing big. I don’t think so, anyway. It’s hard to be sure. I was very young, and my memory… well, you know. Is it important what I did when I was a boy? It feels like a long time ago. I’m sorry. It’s frustrating, even for me.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not frustrating at all. You’re doing great just telling me what you remember. The tonsils and the small thing on your knee aren't a big concern right now. Now, can you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… nothing. I don't take anything regularly. Not anymore. Like I said, I used to take pills for my blood… pressure, but I stopped. Sometimes, if my back hurts, I take something for the pain. Just when it’s really bad. An over-the-counter thing, from the shop. Ibuprofen, maybe? It’s… white. Small pills. But I don’t take it often. Maybe once a month, if that. Is that important? It's just for pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. It’s good to know you're not on any regular medications. And occasional ibuprofen use isn't usually a problem. Let's talk about allergies. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I used to get hay fever when I was younger, but that was a long time ago. I don’t really have problems with food. I eat… everything, I think. I haven’t had anything… react badly with me, not for a long, long time. I don't… I can’t remember ever being allergic to anything. Is that okay? It’s just… I don’t have very good recall. Everything is a bit… distant.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No known allergies is helpful. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you smoked in the past?
PATIENT: No. Never smoked. I… I don’t like it. It smells bad. My father used to smoke, but I always hated it. I always told him to stop. He… he didn’t listen. But I never smoked. No. Never. It’s bad for you, isn’t it? I always thought so. I drank sometimes, socially, with friends. But not much. Not anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. That's very helpful. Now, just a few more questions about your family history, if you don’t mind. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No. My… my mother passed away many years ago. And my father… he passed away before that. A long, long time ago. I have… a sister, but I haven't seen her in years. We don't… speak anymore. It's a long story. A sad story. I don't like to talk about it. But no, I don't have living parents. I’m… alone, mostly. Is that important? For… having a baby?
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for sharing that with me. It's alright if you don't want to go into detail. Knowing that your parents are deceased is sufficient for now. Do you know if any of your family members—your parents, siblings, or grandparents—had any significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My mother… she had problems with her sugar, like I said before. Diabetes, maybe? And my father… he had heart problems, I think. He… he wasn’t very healthy. He smoked a lot. And my sister… I don’t know. We haven't spoken in so long. I don’t know anything about her health. I don't… I wish I did. But it’s been years. It’s all… very distant. I’m sorry. I can’t remember much. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, thank you. Knowing about the diabetes and heart problems in your family gives us a good starting point. Okay, let’s move on to a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes. That’s… fine. Whatever you need to do. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I get… tired easily. But yes. Go ahead. Just… be gentle, please. My bones… they aren’t what they used to be. And… and be patient. It’s… hard for me to remember things. It’s always been hard.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll take things at your pace, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. We’ll just do a basic exam – check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and a quick look at a few other things. First, let’s check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 148 over 92. That’s a little elevated, which supports what the doctor may have mentioned previously. I'm going to listen to your heart now. Heart sounds are regular, but a little faint. Lungs are clear. Now, I’m just going to take a quick look in your ears, nose and throat. Everything looks okay there. And lastly, I'm just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but that’s not uncommon with age. Okay, that completes the basic exam. Now, I'd like to order some blood tests to get a more complete picture of your health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Yes. If you think it’s necessary. I don’t like needles… but if it will help… yes. Do whatever you need to do. But please… be quick. And… and tell me if it will hurt. I get… anxious easily. And please don't leave me alone. It’s… hard for me.
DOCTOR: Of course. I understand. We’ll take it very slowly, and I won’t leave you alone. The blood tests will give us a lot of information about your overall health, including your blood sugar levels, kidney function, and cholesterol levels. We'll also check your complete blood count to assess your red and white blood cells. The blood draw itself will only take a few minutes, and there will be a little pinch, but it's usually very quick. I’ll be right here with you the whole time. I’ll write the order now and we can head over to the lab. Would you like me to explain what we're looking for in these tests, or would you prefer to wait until we have the results?
PATIENT: Maybe… maybe later. I don't want to get… confused. It’s hard for me to remember things when you say a lot of… medical words. If the results are… not good, you can tell me then. Just… just tell me what it means. Simply. Don't use big words, please. And… and please be honest. Even if it’s… bad news. I need to know. If it’s… if it’s not possible… I need to know.
DOCTOR: Of course. I completely understand. I will explain everything in simple terms, and I promise to be honest with you, even if the news isn’t what we hope for. We will go over the results together, and I'll make sure you understand everything. Okay, here is the lab order. The nurse will come to get you shortly. They are very good at making you comfortable. And I’ll be right here when you get back. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. I think… I think you’ve asked me everything. I’m just… nervous. And tired. I hope it doesn't take too long. And… thank you. For being… patient. And for not making me feel… silly. It’s… hard. Forgetting things. And being old. But… thank you. That’s all. I think. I just… I just want to know if it’s okay. If… if I can still have a family. That’s all.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Smith. It’s completely understandable to be nervous, and you haven't felt silly at all. And that’s exactly what we’re going to find out, one step at a time. Let’s see what the blood tests tell us, and we’ll go from there. I’ll be right here when you get back from the lab. .
