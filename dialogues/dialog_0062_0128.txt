DOCTOR: Hi Lilliana, good to meet you. I’m Dr. DeCosta. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Hmm... what brings me in? Let me think... It’s my joints, mostly. They get so stiff in the mornings. It's a bother, really. I forget just why I came, sometimes, but that's what I've been thinking about lately. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Lilliana. Joint stiffness in the mornings is definitely something we can explore. And it’s perfectly normal to have some trouble remembering everything – we all do! To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about this stiffness?
PATIENT: Oh, good. I thought I was just rambling. It’s... well, it's mostly my hands and knees, I think. And my back a little. It’s worse when I first wake up. Like... everything just won’t move right. I have to kinda... work it out of them, you know? It doesn’t last all day, just the morning. Do I need to tell you why my joints are stiff? I forget things, like I said.
DOCTOR: No, don't worry about needing to explain why, that’s what we’re here to figure out. And no, you’re not rambling at all! So, hands, knees, and back, worst in the morning and eases up as the day goes on. That's helpful. About how long does this stiffness typically last when you first wake up?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. It's hard to say, exactly. Maybe... an hour? Sometimes longer, if it’s been cold. Or if I’ve been doing a lot... I forget what I've been doing! I used to help with the kids at the center, but now… well, it’s been a while. It’s just… a long time in the morning until I feel normal, I guess. I don't know if that helps.
DOCTOR: It absolutely helps, Lilliana. An hour or longer, and it seems to be affected by cold weather and activity levels – that's good information. Now, when you say “normal,” can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Oh... well, just... not achy, I suppose. And able to move without... grunting, haha. Not painful exactly, just… tight. Like there's… glue in the joints? Is that a silly way to describe it? I can still do things, but it’s not easy. It’s… different than it used to be, that's for sure. My husband… well, he always used to help me with things. I forget what he used to do, but he was always helpful.
DOCTOR: No, “glue in the joints” isn’t silly at all! That’s a very descriptive way to put it, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. It sounds like it's more of a tightness and stiffness than a sharp pain. Okay. Let's switch gears a bit. Have you noticed any swelling in your hands, knees, or any other joints?
PATIENT: Swelling… Hmm. I haven’t really looked for swelling, to be honest. I just try to get moving, you know? I don’t know… maybe a little in my knuckles sometimes? But I forget if that's always been there. I have… bumpy knuckles, always have. Are you asking if they’re bigger than usual? I really can’t say. It's just hard to remember, Doctor. I have a bad memory, as you can tell.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Lilliana. Don't worry about remembering everything perfectly. It's common for things to be a little hazy. Okay, so potentially some slight swelling in the knuckles, but it's hard to tell if that’s new. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like arthritis or anything similar?
PATIENT: Oh dear… arthritis? I don’t think so. My doctor… I forget his name now… he used to give me pills for… something. For aches, maybe? But I don't remember him saying anything about arthritis. I've always just been… achy, you know? It's just gotten worse lately. I used to be able to do so much more… gardening, mostly. But… oh, I just can’t seem to recall all the details. It's frustrating. Is it bad if I can't remember?
DOCTOR: It’s absolutely not bad if you can’t remember, Lilliana. It’s completely understandable, and we’re not here to quiz you. We’ll figure things out together. So, you’ve been given medication for aches in the past, but no specific diagnosis of arthritis that you recall. Let's talk about your family. Do any of your family members have arthritis, or similar joint problems?
PATIENT: Oh… my mother… she used to complain about her hands a lot. They were always stiff, she said. And she had trouble walking in her later years. I think… I think it was her hips? But I was younger then, and I forget a lot of the details. My father… he was always very active, so I don’t really remember him having any trouble with his joints. Is it important to know about my father? I just can’t recall everything, Doctor. It’s a blessing and a curse, this memory of mine.
DOCTOR: It is helpful to know, Lilliana. So your mother had stiffness in her hands and trouble walking, potentially with her hips. That’s good information. Knowing about your father is helpful too, even if he didn't have joint issues. Okay. Now, just a few quick questions about your daily life. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh my, no, I don't smoke. Never have. My husband… he used to smoke a little, but he stopped years ago. And alcohol… I have a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Just one, usually. I don’t really care for it much, to be honest. It makes me sleepy. Is that important, Doctor? I forget why you're asking all these questions, sometimes. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: It is important, Lilliana. It helps me get a full picture of your health. So, no smoking and just a small glass of wine occasionally – that’s good to know. Alright. I'd like to do a quick physical exam if that's okay. I’ll just take a look at your joints, check your range of motion, and feel for any swelling or tenderness. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I hope it won't be too uncomfortable. I'm a little worried about my knees, they creak a lot. Just… be gentle, please? My memory isn’t the best, so if you need me to repeat something, just let me know. I forget things easily, as you can tell. I hope it doesn’t take too long. I get tired easily these days.
DOCTOR: Of course, Lilliana. We’ll take it very slowly and gently. I’ll let you know exactly what I’m doing each step of the way, and we’ll stop whenever you need a break. And yes, please remind me to repeat anything if I’m going too fast or you forget. That’s perfectly alright. Okay. I'm just gently moving your hands and fingers now. Any pain or tenderness with this?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s… a little uncomfortable in my knuckles. Not sharp pain, just… a dull ache. And this one… yes, that one feels a bit stiff. It’s always been that way, I think. It doesn't really hurt unless you… push on it, like that. It feels bumpy, too. I forget if it's always been bumpy. It's just hard to keep track of things. Is that bad, Doctor? Should my knuckles be bumpy?
DOCTOR: It's okay, Lilliana. It's perfectly fine to express any discomfort. So, dull ache in the knuckles, particularly on movement and with pressure, and you notice some bumps. Bumps in the knuckles are common – they can be bone spurs, and often aren’t a cause for concern, but we’ll consider everything. Now let’s check your knees. I’m just gently bending and straightening them now. Any pain with that?
PATIENT: Oh… yes. That creaks a lot. It always creaks. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… feels a bit grinding, you know? Like sandpaper. And it’s a little stiff when you bend it that far. It doesn’t feel warm, though. I forget if it's supposed to be warm. Is it bad if it creaks? My husband used to say I sounded like an old door… but he’s gone now. I just want it to stop creaking.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright, Lilliana. It's very helpful for me to know what you're experiencing. So, creaking, a grinding sensation, and some stiffness in the knees. The creaking itself isn’t necessarily a bad sign—it can be due to normal changes in the joint. However, we need to investigate the stiffness further. Okay, Lilliana. Thank you for letting me examine you. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, it sounds like you have some joint stiffness and discomfort, particularly in your hands and knees. The stiffness is worse in the morning, seems to be affected by activity levels and cold weather, and you have some creaking in your knees. You’ve also mentioned some bumps in your knuckles. Now, based on this, the most likely possibility is osteoarthritis. It’s a common condition that happens when the cartilage in your joints wears down. However, to be certain, I’d like to order some blood tests and an X-ray of your hands and knees. The blood tests will help rule out other causes of joint pain, like rheumatoid arthritis, and the X-ray will show us the condition of the cartilage in your joints. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear… tests? I don’t like tests. What will the tests show? And rheumatoid arthritis? That sounds… scary. Is osteoarthritis bad? I just want to feel better, Doctor. I forget what all those words mean. Will it hurt? I get nervous easily. And my memory… well, you know. Will someone explain the results to me? I get confused easily. Is it expensive? I don't have much money.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to feel nervous about tests, Lilliana. We'll take things one step at a time. The blood tests are just to help us rule out other possible causes of your joint pain. They won’t show anything specific about osteoarthritis, just help us to be sure. The X-rays will give us a picture of the bones and joints in your hands and knees so we can see if there's any cartilage loss or bone changes. Rheumatoid arthritis is a different condition, an autoimmune disease. It can be more serious than osteoarthritis, but we’re just ruling it out. Osteoarthritis is very common, especially as we get older. It can cause pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion, but it's usually manageable with treatment. The blood tests and X-rays shouldn’t be painful at all. The blood test is just a quick prick of a needle, and the X-ray is just a quick exposure to some radiation. And yes, absolutely, someone will explain the results to you in detail, and we’ll discuss all your options for treatment. I understand you get confused easily, so please don’t hesitate to ask questions. As for the cost, let me check with the billing department to see if there are any options for financial assistance. I understand you don’t have much money, and we’ll do everything we can to make sure you get the care you need. Does that help ease some of your concerns?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s… a little better, thank you. Financial assistance would be wonderful. I really appreciate that. And someone will explain the results… that’s good. I always forget everything the doctor says. So, tests and then… treatment? What kind of treatment? Pills? I don’t like pills. I used to get headaches from the pills. And what if it’s really bad? Will I be able to walk? I just want to be able to garden again. I forget what it's like, not being able to do things. It makes me sad. Maybe… maybe I should just forget about it. It's just old age, right?
DOCTOR: It’s alright to feel overwhelmed, Lilliana. Let's break it down. Yes, after the tests, we'll discuss treatment options. Treatment for osteoarthritis doesn’t always mean pills. There are many other options, such as physical therapy, exercise, weight management, and injections. We'll start with the least invasive options first and see how you respond. If pills are necessary, we can try different kinds to find one that doesn’t cause side effects. We’ll work together to find the best approach for you. And don’t worry about not being able to walk. Most people with osteoarthritis can still live active lives with proper treatment. We’ll do everything we can to help you keep your mobility and get back to gardening. It’s not just old age, Lilliana. Osteoarthritis is a medical condition, and it’s treatable. Don't give up hope. I’m going to have my nurse draw some blood and schedule your X-rays. Would you like me to write down the instructions for the blood test and X-ray so you don’t forget?
PATIENT: Oh… that would be wonderful. Writing it down would be perfect. My memory… well, you know. I always forget things. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. I’m still nervous, but… a little less so. It’s just… hard getting old. I forget what it's like, being young and strong. I just want to feel better, and get back to my garden. And maybe… maybe I can make a nice tomato sauce again. I forget the recipe, though. Oh dear… I’m rambling again, aren’t I? Thank you, Doctor. Truly.
DOCTOR: You're not rambling at all, Lilliana. It’s perfectly alright to share your feelings. And we will work towards you feeling better and getting back to your garden—and making that tomato sauce! Here’s the paperwork for the blood tests and X-rays. It includes instructions on how to prepare, and the nurse will be happy to answer any questions you have. I'm optimistic that we can manage your condition and improve your quality of life. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or questions. And I look forward to seeing you again to discuss your results. .
