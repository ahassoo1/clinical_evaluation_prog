DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Trefren. I am Dr. Pipkorn. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Honestly? It's… a bit embarrassing, but my daughter suggested I come talk to you about… well, she called it PrEP. Said it was good to look into, just to be safe. I'm not even sure I understand what it is, exactly. But she was very insistent.
DOCTOR: PrEP, you say?
PATIENT: Yes. She said something about a pill… to prevent… things. I don't really… follow all the news, and she lives in the city, so she hears about things faster than I do, you know? I work at the parking lot down by the harbor, mostly. It's quiet work, but it keeps me busy. I just want to be sure I'm doing the right thing, if that makes sense. Is it… is it for older people, too? I'm 55, if that matters.
DOCTOR: Yes, age is certainly a factor to consider. PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, is a medication taken to prevent HIV infection. It's typically prescribed to individuals at high risk. While there isn’t a strict age limit, it’s more commonly discussed with younger, sexually active individuals. Could you elaborate on what led your daughter to suggest this?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… she said that even if I’m not… actively looking for a relationship, it’s still good to be prepared. She worries, you know? She said things are… different now than when I was younger. She also mentioned something about it being easier to catch things, even with… one encounter. I haven't been with anyone in a very long time, to be honest. Decades. But she said it's better to be safe than sorry. She's a very practical girl, my daughter. Always thinking ahead. I just… I don’t want to offend anyone by even asking about this. Is this something people my age even talk about?
DOCTOR: It's reasonable to feel hesitant discussing such matters, Ms. Trefren. However, preventing illness is a responsible course of action at any age. Your daughter is correct in that preventative measures are important. To properly assess whether PrEP is appropriate for you, I need to understand your risk factors. While you state you haven’t been sexually active recently, have there been any instances, however infrequent, where you might have been exposed to bodily fluids?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Exposed… that sounds… dramatic. No, not recently. Like I said, decades. Not even a… a casual thing. I mean, I've had a few medical procedures, of course. Dental work, a check-up last year… but nothing… that kind of exposure. I’m a widow, Doctor. My husband passed away fifteen years ago, and I haven’t… well, I haven’t been close to anyone like that since. I just want to make sure my daughter isn’t worrying over nothing. She’s always been a bit… anxious. Is it… is it really necessary for someone like me? It just seems like a lot for someone who… doesn't really need it, if that makes sense. I take my Medicare seriously, and don't want to waste resources on something unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns regarding resource allocation and potential unnecessary medication. And it’s good you are being conscientious. However, while infrequent, any potential exposure carries some level of risk, however small. Let’s review your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well… I have high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication. I also had a hip replacement about five years ago, but that healed up nicely. Otherwise… no, I’m pretty healthy for my age, I think. I walk a lot at work, which the doctor always said was good. And I try to eat a balanced diet, although I do have a sweet tooth. I’m not diabetic, though. I get a yearly check-up, and everything is always… stable. I take my health seriously, Doctor. I really do. I don't want to be a burden on anyone. Is that something you consider with Medicare? Like, if someone is… older, are they more carefully evaluated? Because I wouldn't want to take something I didn’t really need, just to be cautious.
DOCTOR: It is prudent to be mindful of medication use, especially given your existing health conditions. Your concern is valid. Hip replacement and hypertension are relevant factors. To determine if PrEP is appropriate, we need to rule out any other potential underlying factors and assess your overall health risk. I will need to perform a physical exam and order some routine blood work. This will include a test for HIV to establish a baseline and assess kidney function, as PrEP can sometimes impact renal health. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. A physical exam and blood work. That seems reasonable. I'm not afraid of needles, and I understand needing a baseline. Kidney function… that's something I hadn't even thought of. My daughter didn't mention anything about that. So, if everything is… normal, then we can talk about the pill itself? Like, what it does, and if there are any side effects? I just want to be fully informed before making any decisions. And… how long would this all take? I have to get back to work tomorrow, you know. I have a shift at 8 am. The harbor doesn't run itself!
DOCTOR: Excellent. A thorough evaluation is paramount. The physical exam will be relatively standard – blood pressure, heart and lung sounds, and a general assessment of your well-being. The blood work typically takes a few days to process. We can discuss the pill itself – its mechanism of action and potential side effects – once the results are available. Potential side effects are generally mild, but it’s crucial to be fully informed. I anticipate the exam and initial consultation will take approximately thirty to forty minutes. If you’ll excuse me, let’s begin with the physical exam. Please disrobe to the waist and lie down on the table. We’ll start with your blood pressure.
PATIENT: Alright. Thirty to forty minutes. That’s… manageable. Just… let me know if there’s anything specific I should do. I don't want to be a bother. I haven’t been to a doctor in a while, so I’m a bit rusty. And… is it alright if I leave my undergarments on? I always feel a bit exposed… even though I know it's necessary.
DOCTOR: Leaving your undergarments on is… acceptable, though it may slightly hinder the examination. However, your comfort is important. We will begin with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm and keep it still. I will need to palpate your pulse as well. Tell me, are you currently experiencing any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No, no pain. Just a little… nervous, I suppose. It's been a long time since I had a proper medical exam. My husband always took care of all of that. I just… I don't want to waste your time, Doctor. I appreciate you being patient with me. Is the harbor getting more crowded these days? Do you ever go down there? It's a nice view, when it's not too busy.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, but not significantly concerning given your recent anxiety. I am not a frequent visitor to the harbor, Ms. Trefren. My time is… rather occupied. Let’s focus on the examination. Now, can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Is this… is this going to take much longer? I really need to get back to work…
DOCTOR: Your lung sounds are clear. Now, if you could just lie flat on your back for a moment. We need to check your reflexes. The examination will take approximately fifteen more minutes, Ms. Trefren. I understand your concern regarding your work schedule, and I will make every effort to be as efficient as possible. Now, close your eyes. I’m going to tap your knees with this small hammer.
PATIENT: Alright… Is everything alright? You seem… rather brisk.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal, albeit slightly diminished, which is not uncommon for your age. Do you experience any abdominal pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: No… no pain. Sometimes a little indigestion, but nothing serious. I eat a lot of sweets, you know. Is… is something wrong? You're being very thorough.
DOCTOR: I am simply conducting a thorough examination, Ms. Trefren. It is standard procedure. Do you have any history of constipation or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: No! No constipation. Everything is… regular. I mean, for my age. Is everything alright? You seem… concerned.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen is slightly tender to the touch. It could be indicative of several things, none of which are immediately concerning. The blood work will provide more clarity. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to review your medical history in detail. Please get dressed. I will be with you shortly.
PATIENT: Alright… Is… is everything alright? Should I be worried? .
