DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pavlovic. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It's nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just… a cough. Been hangin’ on for a while now. A dry cough, mostly. It’s… bothersome. I don’t rightly remember when it started, to be honest. Things don’t stick like they used to.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. It’s common for things to feel a little… less clear as time goes on. A dry cough, you say?
PATIENT: Mm-hm. Just… scratchy. Feels like somethin’ stuck in my throat, even when nothin’ is. It doesn't bring nothin’ up, if you know what I mean. Just… irritatin’. More at night, I think. Makes it hard to sleep sometimes. Though… maybe that's just old age.
DOCTOR: No, it’s good you're bringing this to my attention, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s certainly worth investigating, regardless of age. A cough that's worse at night can be a sign of several things. You mentioned it doesn’t produce anything – no mucus or phlegm?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothin’ comes up. Just… air. Sometimes a little tickle, then I cough and… nothin’. It's a strange cough, really. My wife… she always knew what was what when it came to sicknesses, but… she’s gone now. I just… don’t remember much about what helps or what doesn’t.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Mr. Pavlovic. It's always hardest when you lose someone who knows your history so well. We'll do our best to figure this out together. Now, besides the cough, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I get a little… tired, I suppose. But I’m ninety years old! Everything takes a little more effort these days. Maybe a little short of breath when I walk up the stairs… but again, could just be the age. I haven't had a fever or anything like that, if that's what you mean.
DOCTOR: That’s all helpful information, Mr. Pavlovic. No fever is good. And it’s very important to consider what’s typical for you at your age. Now, have you had any recent changes in your appetite or weight?
PATIENT: Appetite… well, I don’t eat as much as I used to, that’s for sure. Things don’t taste the same. My daughter brings me food, bless her heart, but I don’t always finish it. As for weight… I don’t know. I haven't weighed myself in… goodness, probably years. Everything's a little looser these days, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. Changes in appetite and some weight loss can sometimes be a part of aging. It's good your daughter is helping you out. Now, have you had any chest pain or shortness of breath at rest, or just with exertion like walking upstairs?
PATIENT: No chest pain, Doctor. Not that I recall. Shortness of breath… mostly just when I push myself. Like climbing those stairs, you mentioned. If I sit down and rest a bit, it goes away. It’s not… terrible. Just… noticeable. I used to be able to chop wood all day, you know. Now… well, now I mostly sit.
DOCTOR: Yes, things do change over time. Now, Mr. Pavlovic, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. That’s a good question. I don’t think so. Never had much trouble with anything. My wife used to say I could eat anything and not get sick. But… I don’t remember her giving me any medicines that bothered me. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t have a very good memory for things like that. I’ve never really needed much medicine in my life, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Pavlovic. No known allergies is helpful. And it's perfectly alright that you don't recall specifics—we'll proceed carefully. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my joints. My daughter brings it. A little white pill, I think. Helps with the ache. Here. Maybe you can tell me what it is. I forget the name, always. She fills it for me, so I don't have to worry about it.
DOCTOR: Let me see… Ah, yes. This is Meloxicam, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, often used for joint pain. That explains the help with the ache. Now, one last thing for the history. Do you have any family history of lung problems, like asthma, emphysema, or lung cancer?
PATIENT: Lung problems… My brother, he smoked, always did. He got something… a bad cough, and then… he had trouble breathin’. They said it was somethin’ with his lungs. He passed away a long time ago now. My mother, she was healthy as a horse. Never a sick day in her life. I don’t think anyone else in the family had trouble with their lungs, but… my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Pavlovic. That’s very helpful information. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just listening to your lungs and heart, checking your oxygen levels, and a general check-up. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if it’s gonna be uncomfortable. I’m an old man, but I still have my feelings.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pavlovic. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, I’ll listen to your lungs with my stethoscope. Take a nice, deep breath in… and exhale slowly. Alright. I'm hearing some mild wheezing, particularly on your left side. It’s not severe, but it’s something we should investigate further. Now, let me check your oxygen saturation with this clip on your finger. … 92%. That’s a little on the lower end of normal, but not alarmingly low. Now, I’ll just check your heart sounds. … Heart sounds are regular, but a bit faint. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, and pulse is 78. Now, I’ll take your temperature. … 98.6. All in all, everything seems stable, but the wheezing and slightly lower oxygen levels are what I want to focus on.
PATIENT: Wheezing, you say? That doesn’t sound good. Is that what’s causin’ the cough? My daughter said somethin’ about the air quality bein’ bad lately. Is that connected?
DOCTOR: It's possible, Mr. Pavlovic. The wheezing could be related to poor air quality, especially if it's triggering some inflammation in your airways. It could also be a sign of mild bronchitis or even early pneumonia, though given your stable vital signs, that's less likely at this moment. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a chest X-ray. It will help us rule out any lung infection or other underlying issues. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An X-ray, huh? Never had one of those before. Seems a little… serious. But… if you think it’s best, Doctor, then I trust you. I just don’t want any unnecessary fuss. Is it painful? And will I be exposed to somethin’ bad?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly understandable to feel a little anxious about it, Mr. Pavlovic. An X-ray is a very common and safe procedure. It doesn't involve any needles or painful sensations—you’ll simply stand or sit while a machine takes a picture of your lungs. There is a small amount of radiation involved, but it's a very low dose and not harmful. The benefits of getting a clear diagnosis far outweigh the risks in this case. We'll take all necessary precautions to minimize your exposure. Would you like me to explain the process in more detail?
PATIENT: Well… if you say it’s safe, Doctor, then I suppose I can agree. I trust your judgment. Just… don’t keep me waitin’ too long. Old bones get stiff easily. So, what happens next? Do I need to go somewhere special? And will my daughter need to come with me? She handles all the arrangements, you see.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pavlovic. We can get the X-ray done right here in the clinic, so you won’t have to go anywhere special. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. Your daughter doesn’t need to come with you, but if she makes you feel more comfortable, she’s welcome to stay. Once the X-ray is taken, the radiologist will review the images and send a report to me. It usually takes a few hours to get the results. While we’re waiting, I’m going to prescribe you a mild bronchodilator inhaler to help open up your airways and ease your cough and wheezing. It’s available over the counter, so you can pick it up at your local pharmacy. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An inhaler… okay. That sounds… helpful. Anything to get rid of this cough. And you're sure this X-ray won't cause any harm? I worry about these things, you know. Old man's worries. My daughter always said I fuss too much.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Pavlovic. It’s perfectly natural to be cautious, especially with your health. I want to assure you again that the amount of radiation from an X-ray is very low—comparable to the natural background radiation we’re exposed to every day. The benefits of getting a clear diagnosis and ruling out any serious issues far outweigh the minimal risk. The inhaler will help ease your symptoms while we wait for the X-ray results. We'll review them together and discuss the next steps. If you’re still worried, you can always consult with a radiologist directly—they can explain the process and safety measures in detail. Now, let me write you a prescription for the inhaler and then we’ll schedule your X-ray. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I trust you. Write me the prescription, and let’s get this X-ray done. Hopefully, it’s nothin’ serious. I just want to be able to sit comfortably without coughin’ all the time. My wife always made the best tea when I was coughin’…
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Pavlovic. Let's get this taken care of, and hopefully, we can get you feeling more comfortable soon. Here’s the prescription for the inhaler – it’s called Albuterol. The dosage is two puffs every four to six hours as needed. And I’ve scheduled your X-ray for this afternoon at 2:30 PM. The technician will guide you through the process. After the X-ray, we’ll review the results together and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, if your cough worsens or you experience any shortness of breath, fever, or chest pain, please don't hesitate to call the clinic or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any questions for me before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that covers everything. Thank you for takin’ the time to listen to an old man fuss. I appreciate your patience. I’ll see you this afternoon then.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Pavlovic. It's my pleasure. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before this afternoon. Get some rest, and we’ll see you then. .
PATIENT: .
