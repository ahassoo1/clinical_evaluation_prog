DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you are a new patient with Medicare. Thank you for choosing our clinic. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my stomach, mostly. I’ve been having… trouble. A lot of it, actually. It’s been going on for a while now, and it's… well, diarrhea. Pretty constant. I think that’s the right word. It’s just… a lot. I’m not really sure what's causing it.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Jase. Constant diarrhea can certainly be disruptive. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Hmm… more about it… Okay. Well, it’s… watery, obviously. And it’s… frequent. Like, several times a day. I don’t really keep track, to be honest. I just… go when I need to go. Sometimes it’s after I eat, but not always. And it’s not always what I eat… I don't think. It's hard to say. I just feel… uncomfortable a lot of the time, and worried about going out, you know? It’s been stressing me out.
DOCTOR: I understand. That sounds very distressing, Jase, and I appreciate you being so open with me. The worry about going out is a significant factor. To get a clearer picture, let’s try to pinpoint some details. When did this start?
PATIENT: Oh, gosh. When did it start… That’s a good question. It feels like… a long time. Maybe a few months ago? It wasn’t sudden, it kind of… built up. At first it was just occasional, like after trying new foods, but then it just… kept happening more and more. I honestly don’t remember the exact date. Everything feels a bit blurry, if that makes sense?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Jase. A few months is helpful to know. It sounds like it developed gradually, which is important information. Besides the diarrhea, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I’ve been feeling… tired, a lot. Just really drained, even when I’ve had enough sleep. And sometimes… my stomach cramps. Bad cramps. Like, really uncomfortable twisting pains. And… I’ve lost a bit of weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser. I haven’t weighed myself recently though, so I’m not sure how much. It's all a bit of a mess, honestly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that, Jase. Fatigue, cramping, and unintentional weight loss are all important things to note. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… That’s… a tricky question. I think… when I was younger, a doctor said something about my stomach being sensitive? I don’t remember exactly what he said, or what it was called. And… I think my husband mentioned something about celiac disease in our family, on his side? But I’m not sure if I have it, or anything. I've never been officially diagnosed with anything, if that makes sense. Everything feels a bit… vague. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Jase. It's common for details to be a bit vague, and you’re doing a wonderful job remembering what you can. Sensitivity and a family history of celiac disease are both important pieces of information. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… No, I don’t think so. Not that I remember, anyway. I mean, maybe when I was a baby, but I definitely haven't had any surgeries as an adult. Nothing major, at least. I'm pretty sure about that. I'm not good with remembering things like that. Sorry again!
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Jase. It's helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your family history a bit more. Besides your husband's side, do any other family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have any medical conditions, particularly anything related to the digestive system?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mom… she always had a sensitive stomach. She complained about bloating and things a lot. And my grandmother, on my dad’s side, she had… something with her bowels, I think. But I don’t remember what it was called. Again, it’s all a bit hazy. She was always going to different doctors, though. I think it was something chronic. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful! It's just… a lot of years ago.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Jase. You're providing valuable information, and I appreciate your honesty. Now, let's talk about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Absolutely not. I don't smoke, I barely drink any alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but that’s it. And definitely no drugs. Never have, never will. I’m a pretty healthy person, otherwise. It’s just… this stomach thing. It’s really worrying me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Jase. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: Um… Just some vitamins, really. A multivitamin, and sometimes vitamin D in the winter. Nothing for my stomach, though. I haven't really taken anything specifically for this. I thought it would just… go away on its own. But it hasn't, so that's why I'm here. Sorry. It's probably silly to not have tried anything.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Jase. Many people try to wait things out initially. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven't ever had a reaction to anything, so I don't think so. I eat a pretty varied diet. My husband likes to try new things, so I’ve had lots of different foods. No problems so far, thankfully. I'm a bit worried about developing allergies, though, with all this going on. Is that a thing?
DOCTOR: It's a valid concern, Jase, and developing sensitivities is possible, though not necessarily common. Now, to get a better understanding of your current condition, I’d like to do a brief physical exam. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what’s going on, and hopefully get some relief. I’m just a little… nervous, if that’s okay to say. I don’t really like doctors very much. But I trust you, I think.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright to say, Jase. It’s very common to feel nervous. We’ll take things slowly and at your pace. I’ll explain everything as we go. First, I’ll listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then, I'll gently palpate – that means press on – your abdomen to check for any tenderness. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, alright?
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… okay. Just be gentle, please? And tell me what you’re doing as you go. I just don’t like surprises. Hopefully it won't be too bad. I feel a bit silly worrying about this, but… I’m just a nervous person.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jase. I will explain everything and be as gentle as possible. First, let's listen to your abdomen. I'm listening for bowel sounds - the noises your intestines make as they digest food. It helps me assess how active your digestive system is. Can you tell me if you’ve been experiencing any nausea or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: No, thankfully, no nausea or vomiting. Just the diarrhea. And the cramps. It's mostly just… uncomfortable. It's weird, it doesn’t hurt exactly, it just… feels really wrong. Like everything is churning inside. Is that… normal? The sounds… are those normal sounds? Sorry, I'm probably being annoying.
DOCTOR: You're not being annoying at all, Jase. It's good you're asking questions. The churning sensation you describe is common with diarrhea. The bowel sounds I'm hearing are a bit… hyperactive, which isn't entirely unexpected, given your symptoms. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Please tell me immediately if you feel any pain or tenderness. I'm starting on the upper right side. Does this feel uncomfortable anywhere?
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s a little tender, actually. Right… there. Not painful, but definitely uncomfortable. Like… a dull ache. It’s been like that for a few days, I think. I haven't really paid much attention to it, to be honest, because I've just been focused on the diarrhea. Is that… bad?
DOCTOR: Thank you for letting me know, Jase. Tenderness in the lower right abdomen is something we need to investigate further. It could be a number of things. I also note some mild guarding – that means you're tensing your muscles in that area when I press, which can also suggest some inflammation. To help us get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. I’m thinking a complete blood count to check for signs of infection, a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your kidney and liver function, and a stool sample analysis to look for any bacteria, parasites, or viruses. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests… Okay. If you think it’s necessary. It's just… I don't really like going to the lab. But I guess it's better to know what's going on. A stool sample… ugh. That sounds… unpleasant. Is there any way to avoid that one? I’m just… squeamish, I guess. Sorry.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Jase. The stool sample isn’t the most pleasant thing, but it’s very helpful in identifying the cause of your diarrhea. The lab will provide you with instructions and collection materials – it’s a relatively straightforward process, and we can discuss any concerns you have. To be thorough, I would also like to consider a possible referral to a gastroenterologist – a specialist in digestive disorders – after we have the results of these initial tests. They may recommend further investigation, such as a colonoscopy, if necessary. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: A colonoscopy…? Oh, goodness. That sounds… scary. Is that definitely necessary? I mean, I'm just having diarrhea. I don’t think it’s that bad. Can’t we just try some medication first? I’m really not good with… procedures. This is all a bit overwhelming, to be honest. Sorry, I'm probably being ridiculous.
DOCTOR: You're not being ridiculous at all, Jase. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed, and it's good you're expressing your concerns. A colonoscopy isn't necessarily needed right now. It's something we would consider if the initial tests are inconclusive or if your symptoms persist despite treatment. Let’s focus on the initial tests first and see what they reveal. I can prescribe an anti-diarrheal medication to help manage your symptoms in the meantime, but it’s important to remember that it will only address the symptoms, not the underlying cause. We need to find out why you’re having diarrhea. I’ll write up the prescriptions and lab orders now. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment. Do you have any questions before I finish?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… please explain everything clearly when I get the results. And if I need a colonoscopy, you'll explain it all to me, right? And we can take it slow? I just… I'm really nervous about all of this. Thank you for being patient with me.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Jase. I will explain everything clearly, and we will absolutely take things slow. If a colonoscopy is recommended, we’ll discuss the procedure in detail, address all your concerns, and ensure you feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. I’m glad I could help put your mind at ease a little bit. Here are the prescriptions and lab orders. The lab is located at [clinic address] and their phone number is [clinic phone number]. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment with you in one week to discuss the results of the tests. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen significantly, or if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or notice blood in your stool, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any other concerns before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you so much, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I feel a little bit better knowing we’re trying to figure this out. I hope the tests don’t take too long. And I really appreciate you being patient with me. I’m just a bit of a worrier, I guess.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jase. I'm glad I could help. Remember, I'm here to support you throughout this process. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns at any time. Take care, and I'll see you next week. .
