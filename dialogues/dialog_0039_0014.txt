DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Limtiaco. Welcome to the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, well... my wife, she said I should come. Something about… papers? For work, maybe? It’s all a bit fuzzy, to be honest. I think it has to do with… taking some time off? I work with the church, you see. Religious activities and education... that's me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so paperwork for work, possibly related to taking some time off. That’s perfectly alright, we can certainly help with that. It sounds like you're here for a medical certificate of some kind?
PATIENT: A… medical certificate? Is that what they call it? Yes, that sounds right. My wife, bless her heart, she filled out a lot of things… something about FMLA, maybe? Or disability? It’s all… a jumble, really. I just want to get it sorted so I don't cause trouble at work, you know? It’s important to keep things running smoothly.
DOCTOR: Yes, FMLA or disability paperwork… that makes sense. To help me fill this out accurately for you, could you tell me a bit more about why you might need to take time off?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well… it's hard to explain. It's not a sudden thing, you see. Just… getting older, I suppose. Things aren't working quite like they used to. A little… tired, mostly. And sometimes… things are just… not clear in my head. Like now, remembering things. It’s not painful, or anything… just… frustrating. It’s been going on for a while, slowly getting worse. I don’t want to make a fuss, but it makes it harder to do my job properly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so fatigue and some memory difficulties, gradually worsening over time. That's helpful to know. And it's not causing you any pain, is that right?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. Just… weariness. And the forgetting... it's more annoying than anything. I can usually manage, but sometimes… sometimes I need a little help. It doesn’t happen all the time, but it's enough to worry my wife. She’s the practical one, always thinking ahead. That's why she sent me here, I think. To get everything official, just in case.
DOCTOR: Alright. And when did you first start noticing these changes—the fatigue and the memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. It’s difficult to say exactly. A couple of years, maybe? It was very gradual, like a slow fade. At first, I just thought it was normal getting older. You know, a bit more forgetful, needing more sleep. But it's… gotten more noticeable lately. I'd say within the last six months, it's really started to bother me… and my wife, of course. She notices everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, about six months of more noticeable changes. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the fatigue and memory issues?
PATIENT: Let me think… not really, not that I can recall. I suppose I’ve been a bit more… quiet, maybe? Not as much energy for socializing. And… sometimes I have trouble finding the right words, you know? Like a word is right on the tip of my tongue, but I just can’t quite grasp it. But that happens to everyone sometimes, doesn’t it? Nothing major, just little things.
DOCTOR: Those little things can be important. Difficulty finding the right words... okay. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… well, I eat when my wife cooks, of course! She makes lovely meals. I haven't really noticed any big changes. As for my weight… it's always been a bit of a problem, to be honest. I tend to… carry a little extra. I haven't weighed myself recently, though. My wife handles all that. I just know I'm… not getting any smaller.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, not a single one. Never really been much of a pill person. I try to stay healthy, you see? Good food, plenty of rest… well, as much rest as I can get these days. Just vitamins, sometimes. My wife makes sure of that. She’s very insistent on the vitamins! But no prescriptions, no regular medications. Just the basics.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me see. When I was a young man, I broke my arm playing rugby, but that was a long time ago. And I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles and such, but nothing serious. As for anything… diagnosed? No, I don't think so. The doctors always said I was a strong, healthy man. Just… getting older now, I suppose. Nothing major ever needed a diagnosis, if that makes sense. I've been very lucky, I think. Until recently, that is.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior major medical diagnoses. And what about your family – do any of your close relatives have any medical conditions, like heart disease, diabetes, or memory problems?
PATIENT: That's a difficult question, Doctor. My family… they lived a long way away, in Tahiti. I haven't seen most of them since I was a boy. I know my mother had… some kind of trouble with her legs when she got older, but I don’t know what it was. And my father… he was a strong man, a fisherman. He lived a long life, but I don’t recall him having any specific illnesses. Memory problems… no, not that I remember. It's been so long, and we didn’t talk about these things much. Sorry, I wish I could be more helpful. It’s just… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Limtiaco. It's not always easy to remember these things, especially when family is far away. Before we move on, let me ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor! Certainly not. I've never touched a cigarette in my life. And alcohol… just a small glass of wine with dinner sometimes, on special occasions. And recreational drugs? Heavens no! I'm a church man, you see. I live a quiet life. A good book, a nice meal with my wife… that’s my idea of a good time. I’m a very simple man, Doctor. Very simple.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of your overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it’s necessary. I’m not a fan of doctors, to be honest, but… I trust your judgment. Just… be gentle, if you would. And try to be quick, if possible. My wife is expecting me home for tea.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Limtiaco. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. First, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs. After that, I’ll take a quick look in your ears, eyes, and throat. Finally, I'll check your reflexes and strength. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. Please relax your arm, and I’ll put this cuff on.
PATIENT: Alright. Just try to be quick, please. My wife makes a lovely cup of tea, you know. And I don't want it to get cold.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 140/90. That’s slightly elevated. Your pulse is 72, which is normal. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Ear canals are clear. Throat appears normal. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. Strength is 5/5 in all extremities. Alright, everything seems relatively normal physically. Your blood pressure is a bit high, but that can fluctuate. The rest of the exam is within normal limits. Now, based on what you've told me – fatigue, memory issues, and slightly elevated blood pressure – I'd like to order some blood work and a thyroid test. This will help rule out any underlying medical conditions. We can also consider a cognitive assessment if you’re willing. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Blood work… a thyroid test… and what did you say, a… cognitive assessment? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. I just wanted some papers for my work, you know? Are all these tests really necessary? I feel fine, mostly. Just a bit tired, and… forgetful. I don’t want to cause any trouble, Doctor. And my wife… she worries enough as it is. Could we maybe just get the papers I need and skip the tests? Perhaps it's just old age?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Limtiaco. It does sound overwhelming, and I apologize if it feels that way. The blood work and thyroid test are fairly standard and can help rule out common causes of fatigue and memory issues, such as vitamin deficiencies or an underactive thyroid. They're relatively simple and provide a lot of information. As for the cognitive assessment, it's a series of simple questions and tasks that help us evaluate your thinking skills. It’s not a pass or fail test, and it won’t change anything about your care if you’re not comfortable with it. It would simply give us a baseline to monitor any changes over time. However, I absolutely respect your wishes. If you're not comfortable with the tests, we can focus on getting the paperwork you need for work. But I do want to be thorough and make sure we’re not missing anything. To proceed with just the paperwork, I’ll need to document your fatigue and memory issues. Would you agree to that?
PATIENT: Documenting… you mean writing it down? Alright, I suppose that's okay. As long as you're not going to make me do any… complicated tests. And you’ll fill out the papers for my work? The FMLA or whatever it was? My wife will be very relieved. Just… please don’t make a big fuss about it, Doctor. I just want to get back to my tea.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Limtiaco. I understand. I'll document your fatigue and memory issues, and I’ll fill out the necessary paperwork for FMLA. I’ll also write a note recommending a follow-up appointment with a neurologist to further evaluate your memory concerns, but that is entirely your decision. Okay, I just need a little more information for the FMLA form… Do you have any restrictions on what you can do at work?
PATIENT: Restrictions? Oh dear. Not really… I mean, I can still do my job, mostly. Just… slower, maybe. And I have to be careful with remembering things. Perhaps… perhaps I shouldn’t be responsible for any… important numbers or dates. And definitely no late-night meetings! My brain just doesn’t work well after sunset. But other than that, I’m perfectly capable, I think. Just… a little slower, and a little more forgetful. Is that enough for a restriction?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Mr. Limtiaco. I’m noting “difficulty with complex tasks and remembering details; avoids late-night meetings.” I’m also including a note about the slightly elevated blood pressure and recommending a follow-up with his primary care physician. Alright, I think I have everything I need. I’ll print this out for you. Here you are. This should be sufficient for your work. Do you have any questions about it?
PATIENT: Oh… well, it looks very official. And a lot of writing! I’m not sure I understand all of it, but… I trust you, Doctor. As long as my wife says it’s okay, I suppose it’s fine. Thank you, Doctor Kamahele. You’ve been very kind, even if you did try to make me do a lot of tests. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really should get home for tea. Perhaps I'll see you again… someday.
