DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Tofani. Welcome. I’m Dr. Burlingham. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s a bit hard to explain, really. My memory isn’t what it used to be. My daughter, bless her heart, she made the appointment. Something about… weakness? And headaches. My family… we’ve always had trouble with bad headaches. It’s been going on for years, I suppose. But lately… well, she thought I should come in, just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Weakness and headaches, you say. “Years,” you mentioned. Alright. Let’s try to pinpoint things a bit more specifically, shall we?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, specifically. That’s good. Let me think… The headaches… they come and go. Not always terrible, you know? Sometimes just a dull ache. But my mother… she used to get them bad. Really bad. She'd have to lie down in a dark room for hours. And my sister… she had them too. It's… on one side, usually? Or maybe both. It's hard to remember. The weakness… that’s newer, I think. Just… feeling a little clumsy sometimes. My hand… feels a bit heavy, occasionally. Is that what my daughter meant? I don't quite recall.
DOCTOR: Right. A family history of headaches, and this weakness is a more recent development. “Clumsy” and a “heavy” hand. Okay. And when did you first notice this weakness, Ms. Tofani?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did I first notice… that’s a tricky one. Not long ago, I don’t think. Maybe… a few months? It’s hard to say exactly. It comes and goes, you see. Some days I feel perfectly fine, and other days… well, I drop things more easily, perhaps. Or I fumble with buttons. Small things, really. I didn’t think much of it at first. Old age, you know? But my daughter, she worries so. She says it could be something more.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s good your daughter is attentive. “Small things” can sometimes be… indicative of larger issues. Let’s go through a bit of your medical background, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with anything in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical background… let me think. Well, I’ve always been pretty healthy, all my life. Nothing major, I don’t believe. I had the usual childhood illnesses, you know, measles, mumps… But as an adult? Not much. My blood pressure… the doctor always said it was a little high, so I take a little pill for that. And my cholesterol… something about that being up, too. But nothing… serious, not like my cousin Maria. She had… oh, what was it? Something with her heart. But me? Just the usual aches and pains of getting older. I'm not sure what else. Do you need specific names of doctors or anything? I don't keep track of those things.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure and cholesterol… alright. And you take medication for that?
PATIENT: Oh yes, yes, I do. A little white pill, every morning. And a little pink one, sometimes. The doctor told me what they were for, but… well, my memory, you know? I just take them like she tells me. They help, I think. I haven't had any… problems, or anything. Just… the usual feeling a bit tired sometimes. It's probably the pills, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, Ms. Tofani?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That’s a good question. Let me think… I don’t think so. Never had a reaction to anything, as far as I recall. I used to be able to eat anything, but now… well, my stomach isn't as strong as it used to be. Spicy foods don’t agree with me, but that’s not an allergy, is it? Just… indigestion. No, I don’t think I have any allergies. My daughter doesn't think so either. She's always asking me about these things.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Tofani, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just basic things… check your reflexes, listen to your heart and lungs, that sort of thing. Can you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. A physical exam… yes, that's sensible. Just a little slow, if you don't mind. My knees aren't what they used to be. There! All right. Do you need me to stand on one leg? My balance isn't so good, you see.
DOCTOR: No, no, standing is fine. Let’s just start with your blood pressure. 148 over 86. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly muffled. Lungs are clear, but breath sounds are a bit diminished. Alright, Ms. Tofani, now I'm going to check your reflexes. Please relax your arm. Reflexes are diminished, but symmetrical. Now, can you squeeze my hands?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Squeeze your hands? Here you are. I hope they’re not too weak. My daughter says I don’t grip things as tightly as I used to. Is that… good enough? It's probably just old age, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Grip strength is diminished bilaterally. Alright, Ms. Tofani. That will be all for the physical exam, for now. Now, I’d like to order some blood work and a CT scan of your head. The blood work will give us a better look at your overall health, and the CT scan will help rule out anything serious going on in your brain. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh my. A CT scan… and blood work? That sounds… serious. Is something wrong, Doctor? My daughter didn’t say anything about a CT scan. Is it painful? And blood work… I hate needles. What exactly are we looking for? I don’t understand. Is it something I should be very worried about?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tofani, please try to remain calm. We are not assuming anything is seriously wrong. These are simply precautionary measures. The blood work is routine—we’ll be checking things like your electrolytes, blood sugar, and kidney function. As for the CT scan… it’s a painless imaging test that will give us a detailed picture of your brain. We are looking to rule out any structural abnormalities that could be causing your headaches and weakness. It’s a standard procedure, and we take every precaution to ensure your comfort and safety. The fact that your symptoms are new, and you have a family history of headaches, warrants further investigation. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… I see. Routine, you say? And… painless? Well, that’s… reassuring. Structural abnormalities… that sounds frightening. But if it helps rule things out… alright. Yes, I understand. So, blood work and a scan. My daughter can help me with the arrangements, I suppose. Will it take long? And will I have to… lie still for a very long time? I get uncomfortable easily.
DOCTOR: The blood work will only take a few minutes, Ms. Tofani. As for the CT scan, you will need to lie still for approximately 20-30 minutes. The technician will explain everything in detail before the procedure. We'll do our best to make you comfortable. I'm going to write you a referral for the imaging center, and a lab order for the blood work. My nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss the results once they are available. Do you have any other questions at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… twenty to thirty minutes… Well, that’s… not too bad, I suppose. I just… I don’t like being confined. And I always worry about being forgotten. Will someone be with me during the scan? And will you… will you be the one to tell me the results? I trust you, Doctor, but… it’s just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Tofani, a technician will be with you throughout the entire CT scan. They are trained to ensure your safety and comfort. And yes, I will be the one to discuss the results with you personally. I understand this is a lot to take in, and I assure you, we will take things one step at a time. Do you have someone who can drive you to the imaging center and the follow-up appointment?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, my daughter, bless her heart. She’s wonderful. She’ll drive me everywhere. And she’ll be with me when we talk about the results. She always comes with me to the doctor. I don’t think I could manage it alone, to be honest. My memory… it’s just not what it used to be. So, I’ll see the technician, and then… then I’ll see you again? When should I expect to hear about the results? And… will it hurt? I just want to know… is it something serious?
DOCTOR: Ms. Tofani, I understand your anxiety. I’ve already explained the procedure. We are not assuming anything is seriously wrong. The results will be available in approximately three to five business days. My nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once they are ready. And no, the CT scan itself will not hurt. It is a non-invasive imaging procedure. Now, is there anything else I can clarify for you at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… three to five days. That seems a long time. Alright. I suppose I’ll just have to wait. And trust my daughter and you. No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Doctor. Though… I might forget some of it. My memory… Just… thank you. For being patient with me. And for taking the time to listen. I appreciate it very much. I think that’s all for now. .
DOCTOR: Very well. My nurse will see you to the door. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions. And Ms. Tofani… try not to worry.
