DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Drahota, it's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Decosta. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s about this… discoloration. My skin. It’s darkening. And frankly, I’m tired. Terribly tired. I haven't the energy for this, you understand. Just want to get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Darkening skin and fatigue. That's definitely worth looking into. Let's start with the discoloration. Where on your body are you noticing this darkening, and about how long has it been happening?
PATIENT: Everywhere, really. Arms, face… difficult to say precisely when it started. Months, I suppose. Time… it all blurs together. It’s not as though I’ve been meticulously documenting it, Doctor. A man has work to do. Rebar doesn’t bend itself, you know.
DOCTOR: I appreciate that, Mr. Drahota. And I understand it’s hard to pinpoint exact dates. “Months” is helpful. Has the discoloration been getting progressively darker, or has it stayed relatively the same?
PATIENT: Worse, I believe. Definitely worse. I’ve noticed it more recently. It’s… unsettling. Makes me look older than my years, and I've had enough of that, thank you very much. Not that it matters much at this stage of things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been progressively worsening in recent months. And you've noticed it on your arms and face. Has anything changed in your routine around the time you first noticed it – new soaps, lotions, exposure to the sun, anything like that?
PATIENT: New soaps? Doctor, I use the same bar of soap my wife buys. Been buying it for… decades. Sun? I work inside most of the time. Though… there was that job at the new high-rise last spring. Plenty of sun then. But that was months ago. Honestly, I don't recall anything significant. I told you, I'm a working man. I don’t have time to ponder lotions.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good information. So, potential increased sun exposure last spring with the high-rise job. Let's talk about that fatigue you mentioned. How would you describe it?
PATIENT: Exhausting. Utterly exhausting. It's not just being tired after a long day, Doctor. It's… a bone-deep weariness. Difficult to get out of bed. Difficult to concentrate. My wife keeps telling me I need to rest, but there's work to be done. Always work. It’s… debilitating, frankly. I used to be able to work a double shift without a second thought. Now… now I struggle to get through the day.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s more than just being tired; it’s a deep weariness that’s impacting your ability to function. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the fatigue – like weight loss, fever, night sweats, or any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Weight loss… perhaps a little. My wife says I haven’t been eating as much. Appetite… not what it used to be. Everything tastes… bland. Fever? Night sweats? No, no. Nothing like that. Just… tired. And this… darkening. Look, Doctor, are we getting anywhere with this? I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are, Mr. Drahota. You’ve given me a lot of helpful information. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. I want to take a look at the skin discoloration and check your overall health. It will help me narrow down what might be going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Very well. Get it over with. But be quick about it. I have… commitments. And don't poke and prod unnecessarily, Doctor. I'm a practical man, not some specimen.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Drahota. I’ve listened to your heart and lungs, and checked your pulse and reflexes. Your heart sounds good, but your pulse is a little weak, and your reflexes are diminished. Your skin is noticeably hyperpigmented on your arms and face, and feels slightly rough. Do you notice any itching or pain associated with the discoloration?
PATIENT: Itching? No. Pain? No. Just… unpleasant. And a constant reminder of my declining state, if you must know. It feels… dry, perhaps. Like sandpaper. Nothing more. Look, Doctor, is this leading anywhere? Or are we simply cataloging my ailments for posterity? I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no itching or pain, just dryness. Given your symptoms – the progressive darkening of the skin, the fatigue, the decreased appetite, and the dryness – and based on the physical exam, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. One potential cause is a condition called Addison's disease, which affects the adrenal glands. Another possibility, considering your age and sun exposure, could be a form of skin cancer, although the lack of itching or pain makes that less likely. However, these are just initial thoughts. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests to check your adrenal function and other key markers. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Honestly, Doctor. More delays. More poking and prodding. Very well. Do what you must. But I expect a swift diagnosis. And I’d appreciate a clear explanation, in plain language. I’m a practical man, not a medical student. No jargon, please. And I want to know what this will cost. My wife handles the finances, and I don't want to bother her with unnecessary expenses. Now, get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota, I understand your concerns. We’ll get these tests done as quickly as possible. The blood tests will help us assess your adrenal function, check your kidney and liver function, and look for any signs of infection. I will explain the results to you in plain language – no medical jargon, I promise. As for the cost, the tests will likely be around $200-$300, depending on the specific panel we use. Given that you're uninsured, we can discuss potential options for financial assistance or a payment plan. We can also see if there are any community resources available to help cover the costs. In the meantime, I'm going to write an order for the blood tests. They can be drawn at the lab downstairs. Once we have the results, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Acceptable. Just… get it done. And please, expedite the process. I haven't got time for protracted procedures. $200-$300... I will discuss that with my wife. Just… finish with me, Doctor. I have commitments. Now, where is this lab?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Drahota. I understand. Here’s the lab order. The lab is just downstairs, to your left. Tell them Dr. Decosta sent you, and they'll take care of everything. It should take about 30-45 minutes. Once the results are back – usually within 2-3 business days – my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – like severe weakness, dizziness, or confusion – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you go?
PATIENT: No. None. Just… thank you. Now, if you’ll excuse me.
