DOCTOR: Well, Mrs. Sadhu, it's good to meet you. I'm Dr. Batara. Now, you're 89, if I’m reading your chart correctly… quite a milestone! But let’s get down to business. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Dr. Batara. It is good to meet you too. Eighty-nine years… feels like yesterday and a lifetime ago, all rolled into one! Well, this cough… it just won’t go away. It's been bothering me for a few weeks now, and it feels…deeper than just a cold, you know? And my heart... it doesn't feel right either. It gets tired easily.
DOCTOR: A cough for a few weeks and… a tired heart. Right. "Tired heart" is rather vague, Mrs. Sadhu. Can you describe what you mean by that?
PATIENT: Well, it's hard to explain. It's not pain, exactly. More like… when I walk to the kitchen, even just from the living room, I get winded. And sometimes I feel… a fluttering. Like a little bird trapped in my chest. It doesn't happen all the time, but enough to worry me. And the cough makes it worse, naturally. It just feels like my heart is working too hard to do simple things. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Fluttering…winded with minimal exertion. Yes, that's… somewhat more specific. And how about this cough?
PATIENT: Oh, the cough. It's… it's a wet cough, if that makes sense. I have to spit up something sometimes. Clear stuff, mostly. Not much, but it’s there. It’s worse at night, when I’m lying down. Keeps me up, it does. I’ve tried some cough syrups, the ones my daughter brings, but they don't seem to do much good. It just feels like something stuck in my chest, that I can’t get rid of.
DOCTOR: "Something stuck." Right. And has anything changed about this cough recently?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, yes. It's been getting a little… frothier. That's the best way I can describe it. And just yesterday, I noticed a tiny bit of pink in the phlegm when I coughed. It scared me a bit, to be honest. I haven’t eaten anything pink, I assure you! It was just… a speck. But it was there.
DOCTOR: Pink tinged sputum. That is more concerning, Mrs. Sadhu. Now, let’s go over some other things. Have you ever been diagnosed with any heart conditions before?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Years ago, Dr. Ramirez – lovely man, retired now – he told me I had congestive heart failure. That was… oh, maybe ten years ago? Something like that. He put me on some pills… water pills, mostly, to get rid of the extra fluid. And another one, for my heart. I’ve been taking them ever since, mostly. My daughter helps me keep track of them now, bless her. I can't always remember everything, you know.
DOCTOR: Congestive heart failure, ten years ago. And are you still taking those same medications?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Well, mostly. Dr. Ramirez, he changed them once or twice. My daughter, Elena, she keeps the list up to date. Let me see… Here it is. Furosemide, that's the water pill, 40 milligrams every morning. And Lisinopril, 20 milligrams, also every morning. And… something for my blood pressure, I think. Amlodipine, 5 milligrams. I take them with my breakfast, always. Elena makes sure of it.
DOCTOR: Alright. Furosemide, Lisinopril, and Amlodipine. Good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a good question. Let me think… Not that I know of. Dr. Ramirez asked me that years ago, and I told him no. I’ve never had a bad reaction to any pills, not that I remember. Elena always asks when she picks up my prescriptions, too, and she says I haven't got any allergies listed. I think I’d remember if I was allergic to something, wouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: One would think. Now, have you smoked at any point in your life?
PATIENT: Oh, my goodness, yes. When I was young, everyone smoked! It was… fashionable, I suppose. I smoked maybe half a pack a day for… oh, twenty years, maybe longer. But I quit a long time ago. About forty years ago, when Dr. Ramirez told me it was killing me. It was hard, but I did it. Haven’t touched a cigarette since. I’m proud of that, I am. Though, sometimes I miss it, to be honest. But my health is more important.
DOCTOR: Forty years since quitting. That’s… commendable. And what about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Well, I don't drink much. Never really have. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe, on special occasions. Christmas, birthdays, things like that. But not every day. Certainly not every week. My husband, God rest his soul, he liked his beer, but I never cared for it much. A little sip now and then, to be polite, but that's about it. I prefer a nice cup of chamomile tea, you know? It helps me sleep.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I need to listen to your lungs and heart, and check your legs for swelling. If you don’t mind. Please, have a seat.
PATIENT: Oh, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need. . I hope it's not too much trouble. My bones aren't what they used to be, you know. I'll try to stay as still as I can.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just breathe normally. Deep breaths if you can. Hmm. Crackles bilaterally, mostly in the lower lobes. Murmur present, grade II/VI systolic ejection murmur at the mitral area. Slightly irregular rhythm. 2+ pitting edema bilaterally. Crackles, murmur, edema… as expected. Your lungs sound a bit congested, and I can hear a murmur when I listen to your heart. You also have some swelling in your legs. This is consistent with your history of congestive heart failure, though the new pink tinged sputum is concerning.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound good, does it? Congestive heart failure… I was afraid something like this was happening again. The swelling I noticed… I thought it was just the heat. But the pink stuff… What does that mean, Doctor? Is it bad? Am I… am I getting worse? I just want to be comfortable, you know? I'm an old woman, and I’ve lived a good life. But I don’t want to… well, you understand.
DOCTOR: The pink tinged sputum suggests possible pulmonary edema, Mrs. Sadhu, which means fluid is building up in your lungs. This can be serious. We need to determine the cause of this flare-up. It could be a simple adjustment to your medication is needed, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a chest X-ray and some blood work, including a BNP level to assess your heart function. We’ll also check your electrolytes. I want you to go to the lab immediately after this, and then return here. I will review the results as soon as they are available. Depending on the results, we may need to consider a referral to a cardiologist. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A cardiologist… oh dear. That sounds… serious. Chest X-ray and blood work… yes, yes, I understand. Lab immediately… right after this. Elena drives me, bless her heart. She'll know where to go. Is there anything I should do now? Before the tests? Should I… lie down? Or drink less water? I always drink a lot of water, you know, to stay hydrated. Just tell me what I need to do, Doctor. I’ll do whatever you say.
DOCTOR: For now, Mrs. Sadhu, try to rest. Limit your fluid intake to 1 liter—that’s about four glasses—until we have the lab results. And, no extra salt. Don't worry needlessly. It's likely just a medication adjustment. I will review the results and call Elena with any urgent findings. Here’s a requisition for the lab. Just give this to the lab technician. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Elena will know where to go.
PATIENT: .
