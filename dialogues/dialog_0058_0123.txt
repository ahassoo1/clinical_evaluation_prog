DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Cassimatis. Have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. It's this itch. Everywhere, really. It's been going on for…well, I don't even know how long now. A few weeks, maybe? It's just…driving me crazy. It’s not painful, just…constant.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. It started…slowly, I think. Just a little here and there. I thought it was the heat, you know? It has been a scorcher this summer. But it hasn't gone away, and now it's…well, it’s all over. My arms, my back, even my legs. It’s really bothersome when I’m trying to sleep.
DOCTOR: Okay. And is it just itching, or are you seeing any rash, bumps, redness… anything visible?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. I haven’t really looked closely, to be honest. I just feel it. I assumed it was just dry skin, maybe. It doesn’t look different, not that I’ve noticed, anyway. My skin is…well, old skin, you know? A little thin here and there. I don’t think there’s anything on it, but I could be wrong.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, let’s take a look. Please, if you could just loosen your clothing a bit… arms and back, if you don't mind. I need to actually see the skin to get a better idea of what we're dealing with.
PATIENT: Oh, of course, dear. It's a little warm in here, anyway. I haven’t been dressing for company, if you catch my drift. Just comfortable things. There. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Hm. Yes. Skin is…as you said, thin. Some expected age spots. I do see some very faint excoriations – small scratches from the itching, mostly. No obvious rash or lesions. It's...subtle. Have you changed any soaps or detergents recently?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, that’s a good question. Let me think… No, not really. I’ve been using the same things for years. That lavender soap from the drugstore, and…well, the usual laundry detergent. I did try a new fabric softener a couple of months ago, maybe? It was supposed to smell like…sunshine. Didn’t really like it, so I switched back to the old one pretty quickly. Could that have been it? It seemed harmless enough.
DOCTOR: Possible, but unlikely. Fabric softener alone rarely causes a widespread itch like this. It's probably something else. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well, I've been a little more tired than usual, I suppose. But that could just be my age, you know? And…my stomach hasn’t been quite right lately. A little…upset, if you catch my drift. Nothing serious, just…not regular. Do you think that could be connected? I haven’t mentioned it to anyone before.
DOCTOR: “Connected”?
PATIENT: Oh, dear, I didn’t mean to… I just wondered if everything was…working together, you know? The tiredness, the stomach trouble, the itch. Sometimes things just…add up. I’m an old woman, I’ve seen things. Maybe I’m just rambling now. I apologize. I just want to get to the bottom of this itch. It’s driving me crazy.
DOCTOR: Right. Look, Mrs. Cassimatis, it's unlikely all of this is connected. Fatigue and stomach upset are…common. As for the itch, it could be a number of things – dry skin, allergies, even stress. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Not that I know of. I used to be stung by a bee when I was a little girl, but that was a long time ago. And I get a little sniffly sometimes in the spring, but everyone does, don’t they? Dust, probably. Nothing serious. I've never been to an allergist, never had any tests done. I just…avoid bees. Is that enough of an answer? I'm not a very complicated woman, dear.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… Just a little something for my arthritis, you know, to help with the aches and pains. It’s just ibuprofen, usually. Nothing fancy. And sometimes, if I can’t sleep, I take a little…over-the-counter sleep aid. Melatonin, I think it’s called. Just when I really need it, though. Is that important? I don’t take a lot of pills, if that’s what you’re asking. I try to stay natural as much as I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, Mrs. Cassimatis, it sounds like you've got a lot going on. The itching could be a number of things, and without more information, it’s difficult to say definitively. I'm going to order a basic blood panel to rule out any underlying medical conditions. And I want you to stop taking the melatonin for now. It can sometimes cause skin reactions. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: A blood panel? Oh, goodness. I always get nervous around needles. But alright, if you think it’s necessary. And stop the melatonin…yes, I can do that. Will the blood tests tell us what's causing the itch, though? That's really what I’m worried about. It's just…so uncomfortable. And it’s been going on for so long. Will it help?
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Cassimatis, blood tests aren’t a magic bullet. They’ll rule out certain conditions. If they come back normal, then we’ll have to consider other possibilities—like allergies, or a skin condition. It's a process of elimination. I'm also going to prescribe a topical steroid cream to help with the itching in the meantime. Apply it twice a day. If it doesn’t improve after two weeks, we’ll revisit this. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A process of elimination… Yes, dear, I understand. It just…sounds like a long road. And a topical cream…twice a day. Alright. I can do that. What kind of side effects should I watch out for with the cream? I don't want anything worse happening. I'm a little sensitive, you know. And…will the blood tests be expensive? I'm not really on a fixed income, but…
DOCTOR: The cream can cause some mild skin irritation, redness, or thinning of the skin if used for extended periods. Just follow the instructions carefully and don’t use it on broken skin. As for the blood tests…I’m not sure of the exact cost. You’ll have to check with the lab. Here’s the prescription for the cream. The lab will bill your insurance, if you have it. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh… No insurance, dear. I haven't been able to afford it for a while now. Well…that’s alright. I’ll just have to pay out of pocket, I suppose. Thank you for your time, dear. I appreciate you trying to help. I just…I really want this itch to go away. It's driving me crazy. I think…that’s all the questions I have for now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Look, Mrs. Cassimatis, I'm also going to refer you to a dermatologist. They specialize in skin conditions and might be able to offer a more definitive diagnosis. Here’s the referral. Call and schedule an appointment as soon as possible. And the lab will give you a price list. If the itching gets significantly worse, or you develop a fever, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A dermatologist…yes, alright. Another appointment… Yes, I understand about the emergency room. Thank you, dear. You’ve been very…thorough. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I’ll try to schedule the appointment with the dermatologist as soon as I can. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Alright. You too. .
