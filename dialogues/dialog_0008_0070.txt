DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. I'm Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Doctor… Cumper, yes? Just moved here. Need… check-up, I think. Old doctor… far away now. Not remember everything, you know? Medicare… they said come here.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. Welcome to the clinic, Mr. Szmyd. A general check-up is perfectly fine. We can definitely get that sorted for you. And Medicare sent you over, excellent. To start, could you tell me a little more about why you feel you need a check-up now?
PATIENT: Feel…? Hmm. Not feel anything special, really. Just… getting older. Things… slow down. Wife… ex-wife, she said I should. Always nagging. Makeup… still work, but hands… not as steady as before, you know? It's… normal, I think. Old age.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s good you’re being proactive about your health, even if you aren’t experiencing specific complaints. “Just getting older” is a perfectly valid reason to come in. We can assess everything and make sure things are normal, or address anything that isn't. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you had any major illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgery… yes. Long time ago. Appendix… when young. Very sick. And… maybe tonsils? Can’t remember. Other than that… nothing much. Always healthy. Strong Russian stock, you know? No time for being sick. Lots of colds, maybe, but nothing serious. Wife always worried about everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix and possibly tonsils. That's good to know. And you've generally been quite healthy otherwise. Do you know roughly when those surgeries were, even just a ballpark year?
PATIENT: When…? Oh, goodness. Very long ago. When I was… young man. Maybe… 1970s? Yes, 1970s, I think. Or maybe early 80s. Things… get mixed up, you know? So many years. Not good memory anymore. Sorry.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Mr. Szmyd. Memory can be tricky. The 1970s/early 80s is helpful. And you said you’ve generally been healthy – have you been hospitalized for anything other than those surgeries?
PATIENT: Hospital… hmm. Not really. Maybe… pneumonia, once? Very bad cough. But not hospital, I think. Just… doctor at home. Gave me… pills. Wife took care of everything. She liked doctors. I prefer to work. Lots of medicine these days. Too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no hospitalizations, and a possible bout of pneumonia treated at home. We're getting a good picture here. Now, how about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Complicated. Ex-wife… two children. Boy, girl. They… okay, I guess. Don't see them much. Living far away. She… made sure I knew they were doing fine. Always… very organized, my ex-wife. Never sick. My mother… strong woman, very strong. She… gone now. Long time. Father… I don't remember him well. Lots of history. Don't need to know all that.
DOCTOR: Alright, thank you for sharing that, Mr. Szmyd. It's helpful to have a general sense. Did either your mother or father have any significant medical problems that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Medical problems…? Hmm. Mother… heart trouble, I think. Always complaining about her heart. Old age. She lived long life, though. Very strong. Father… Can’t really remember. He wasn’t around much. Maybe… something with his lungs? Smoked a lot. But honestly, I don't know. Not close. Don't remember details. Old stories.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart trouble in your mother and possible lung issues in your father. We'll make a note of that. Now, just a few questions about your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Never smoke. Bad for makeup! Alcohol… maybe sometimes. A little vodka, with friends. Not much. Once in a while. Recreation… no. I work. Making up beautiful people is enough recreation for me. That's all I need. Drugs… no. Never. Bad for business. Very bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so occasional vodka, but no smoking or recreational drugs. Good to know. And you work as a makeup artist, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, yes. Makeup artist. Theatrical. Performance. Been doing it… long time. Very good, if I do say so myself. Not easy work, you know? Need… steady hand. These hands… not what they used to be. That's why I'm here, I think. To check the hands.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll definitely take a look at your hands. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Medications…? Hmm. Let me see… Oh! For the… joints. Sometimes, when the weather is bad. Little pills. Blue ones. My ex-wife got them for me. She said it was for the… arthritis. I forget the name. And… maybe something for the blood pressure? Doctor… old doctor, he gave it to me. Small white pills. But I stopped taking it. Made me… sleepy. Too many pills. Don't like pills.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve taken medication for joint pain and possibly blood pressure in the past, but aren't currently taking the blood pressure medication. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. Not that I know of. Maybe… a little itchy sometimes, with some perfumes. But nothing serious. Ex-wife… she always used strong perfumes. Irritated my eyes. But not… allergic. Just… unpleasant. No food allergies. I eat everything. Strong Russian stomach, you know? Everything is good. Except maybe… cheap vodka. That makes me sick.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's helpful. Alright, Mr. Szmyd, I think we've covered a good deal of your history. Now, if you're comfortable, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your hands, as you requested. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam…? Yes, yes. Fine. Check hands first, please. That’s most important. Need these for work, you know? And… make it quick, if you can. Not good at sitting still.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please have a seat. And I'll do my best to be quick. First, let’s just check your pulse in both wrists… good strong pulse there. Now, I’m just going to examine your hands… I notice some slight swelling in the knuckles of both hands, and a little bit of redness. Range of motion seems a little limited, particularly in the fingers. Do you experience any pain with movement?
PATIENT: Pain…? Yes. Sometimes. When cold. Or… when working, if I push too hard. Not always. But it… aches. Especially in this one. The right hand is… the working hand. Need this one. Very important. It’s… not comfortable. Like… grit in the joints, you know? Old age, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay. I do feel some mild tenderness around the wrists as well. It sounds like you may be experiencing some early signs of osteoarthritis in your hands and wrists. This is fairly common, especially with age and repetitive hand use. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath for me... and another... Heart sounds are regular and within normal limits. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 142/88. A little elevated. We'll want to keep an eye on that. Do you have any other concerns I should address?
PATIENT: Elevated…? What does that mean? Is it bad? Blood pressure… I don't understand all this. Doctor… old doctor… he just gave me pills. Didn’t explain anything. Other concerns…? Just… the hands. Need these for work. Very important. Don't want to lose the hands. That's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Let's talk about the blood pressure first. 142/88 is a little high, but it’s not an immediate emergency. High blood pressure, if left untreated, can increase your risk of heart disease and stroke. That’s why it's important to keep it under control. We can try some lifestyle changes first – diet, exercise, stress reduction – and if that's not enough, we can consider medication. As for your hands… it does sound like osteoarthritis. We can try some over-the-counter pain relievers, like ibuprofen or naproxen, to help with the pain and inflammation. Physical therapy can also be very helpful. I'm going to write you a prescription for a topical anti-inflammatory cream as well. Is there anything else you're experiencing - any numbness or tingling in your hands or fingers?
PATIENT: Topical… what? Cream…? Will it… help? Numbness…? Sometimes. A little… tingling. Especially at night. When cold. Or… if I work too long. Makes it hard to hold the brushes. Very important brushes, you know? Very expensive brushes. I need these brushes to work. This is… complicated. I just want my hands to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, the topical cream is a medication you apply directly to your skin to reduce inflammation and pain. It shouldn’t interfere with your work. The tingling suggests some possible nerve compression, which is also common with osteoarthritis. It’s good you mentioned that. To get a better understanding of the nerve involvement, I'd like to order some blood tests, including a complete blood count and a rheumatoid factor test. This will help rule out other possible causes of your hand pain and tingling. I will also send you to a physical therapist for an evaluation. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your hands and improve your range of motion. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Blood tests…? More tests…? This is… a lot. Very complicated. Rheumatoid… what was that? Is it bad? Will I need… more pills? I just want to fix my hands. Can the cream… fix my hands? And the exercises… will they really help? I have work… need to work. I don't want to lose my work. This is… stressful.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd, I understand this is a lot to take in, and I apologize if it feels overwhelming. Let’s break it down. The blood tests are just to help me get a clearer picture of what's going on, and rule out other possibilities. Rheumatoid factor is a test for rheumatoid arthritis, which is a different type of arthritis than what I suspect you have, but we need to rule it out. The cream will help reduce the inflammation and pain, but it's unlikely to "fix" your hands completely. It's part of a larger plan. The physical therapy is very important. They can teach you exercises to strengthen your hands and improve your range of motion, which will help you continue to work. It will take some effort, but it can make a big difference. I will also print out a sheet with exercises you can start doing at home. Let’s focus on getting the blood tests done and starting the physical therapy. We’ll re-evaluate in a few weeks and see how you’re doing.
PATIENT: Okay… exercises… blood tests… Fine. Whatever you think. Just… need hands. Let's get it done. Where do I go for blood tests? And… thank you, Doctor. I just… want to work.
