DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Calvery. I'm Dr. Todoro­vich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Todoro… Todoro­vich, is it? Yes, well, honestly? Just… curiosity, I suppose. My daughter kept saying I should get a check-up, just to be sure. Everything feels alright, you know? I’ve been a surgical tech for… oh, goodness, a long time. You’d think I’d know if something was wrong with myself. But she worries so.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s good your daughter is looking out for you. Even those of us in medicine benefit from an outside perspective. “Just to be sure” is a perfectly valid reason to be here. So, let’s start with the basics. When you say everything feels alright, can you be a little more specific?
PATIENT: Specific… hmm. Let me think. No aches, really. My knees get a little creaky when the weather changes, but that’s just old age, isn't it? And I get tired, but who doesn’t? I sleep alright, I think. Though, sometimes I wake up and… well, I forget what I was doing. Not all the time, just… occasionally. It's probably nothing. Honestly, I just don't want to waste your time. You probably have real patients with real problems.
DOCTOR: Ms. Calvery, your concerns are real problems, and wasting my time is not one of them. Everyone's experience is valid. Forgetting things occasionally… can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, alright then. It's just… little things. Like, I'll go into the kitchen to get something, and completely forget what I went in there for. Or I'll start a sentence and… the word just escapes me. It’s not constant, mind you. And it doesn’t happen every day. It's just… becoming more frequent, maybe? My daughter keeps saying it's a sign of something… something bad. But I think she’s just dramatic. Still, it's unsettling, I suppose. And I don’t want to be a burden.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a difficult question. It feels like… a while. Maybe six months? A year? Time just sort of… blurs, you know? It’s not like it happened overnight. It was gradual. At first, I barely noticed it. I just thought I was getting more absent-minded. But now… well, now it’s hard to ignore. My memory was always pretty good, actually. I had to remember so many instruments during surgery… it was second nature. Now… it's like trying to grasp smoke.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the memory issues, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… let me think. My daughter also says I've been… quieter. More withdrawn, she says. I don't know. I've always been a bit of a loner, to be honest. My husband… he passed away five years ago. It's hard to be cheerful all the time, you know? Maybe I'm just… grieving still. I do seem to get… frustrated more easily. Small things that wouldn't have bothered me before… they just seem to get under my skin now. And… oh, I don't know. It's hard to explain. It just feels like… something isn't quite right. Like a fog, hanging over everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. We've covered a lot. Now, let's go through some of your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Well, I had my gallbladder out, oh, must be twenty years ago now. And I had a hip replacement about ten years ago. Apart from that… not much, really. High blood pressure, the doctor said, but it's been managed with medication for years. I think. I take a little white pill every morning. And… oh, yes, arthritis in my hands. It doesn’t bother me too much, mostly just a little stiff. I try not to think about it. Honestly, I’ve always been pretty healthy. That’s why this whole thing is so… unsettling. It's not like I’m expecting anything serious, mind you. But my daughter… she worries so.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what medications are you currently taking, besides the white pill for blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that’s a good question. Let me think. The white pill, yes. And… something for my hands, a little pink one. It helps with the stiffness, but I can't recall the name. And… oh, sometimes I take something for sleep if I'm really restless. A little blue one, I believe. I get them all mixed up, you know? My daughter handles most of the refills. She keeps a list. I should really pay more attention. Honestly, I try not to dwell on all the pills. It makes me feel… old. And fragile. I just want to feel normal again.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… let me see. No, not that I know of. I’ve always been able to eat anything. My husband used to tease me about my cast iron stomach. And I've never had a reaction to any medication. Though… I did have a bit of a rash once, years ago, after using a new hand lotion. But that wasn’t serious. Just a little itchy. I can’t recall the brand now. Honestly, I’m usually pretty careful about what I put on my skin. I don’t want to risk irritating it. It's sensitive, you know? Being a surgical tech, I have to wash my hands constantly. They get so dry. It’s a constant battle. But allergies… no, not that I’m aware of.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. Let me just take a look at your records here…Okay, I see a history of hypertension, as you mentioned, and a previous cholecystectomy and hip replacement. The medication list confirms the lisinopril for blood pressure, and… ah, yes, naproxen for arthritis. And occasionally, zolpidem for sleep. No documented allergies. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. Just to get a baseline assessment. It will involve checking your blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs, and a basic neurological assessment. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible. Yes, go right ahead. A sensible doctor is a good doctor, I always say. I trust your judgment. Just… please don't take too long. I have a bit of a lunch date with my daughter later. She's making my favorite bibimbap. I wouldn't want to keep her waiting. Though, honestly, she's probably expecting me to be late. I always lose track of time, you know? Still, a sensible doctor… yes, do what you need to do. Just be gentle, alright? My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Let's start with your blood pressure. Could you please sit comfortably and relax your arm?
PATIENT: Alright, dear. Relax... easier said than done, really. It's always a bit nerve-wracking being poked and prodded. But I’ll try. Just tell me if it’s going to pinch, alright? I don’t like surprises. And… oh, is that bibimbap spicy? My daughter makes it very spicy sometimes. I can never get enough water. Honestly, it's a delicious torture.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 148/85. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit distant. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and balance. Could you please follow my finger with your eyes without moving your head?
PATIENT: Oh, is that high? My daughter is always telling me to watch my salt intake. Honestly, I just love a good pickle. Reflexes… balance… Oh dear, I’m not very good at this sort of thing. I always tripped over things as a child. It's probably just old age creeping in. I'm not as steady on my feet as I used to be. And… oh, is this going to involve standing up? My knees aren't very cooperative today. Honestly, I should have worn more comfortable shoes. Bibimbap and balance tests… it's a strange combination, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Your gait is slightly unsteady, and there’s a mild tremor in your hands when you extend them. Balance is a bit impaired. Now, I'm going to do a quick cognitive assessment, just a few simple questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. Are you alright with that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A tremor… that’s not good, is it? My daughter will be beside herself. Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit… anxious now. Cognitive assessment… questions… Oh, I’m terrible at tests. My mind just goes blank sometimes. I always forget what I was going to say. Honestly, it’s probably just nerves. Yes, go ahead, ask your questions. But be gentle, alright? Don’t expect miracles. Bibimbap, tremors, and… brain tests. It's a very stressful lunch date.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. We’ll take it slow. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Oh dear… today’s date… Hmm. Let me think… It’s… August, isn’t it? Yes, August. But what’s the date? Is it the… the second? No, wait… the first? Oh, honestly, I’m terrible with dates. My daughter handles all the appointments and birthdays. It’s… it’s the second, isn’t it? August second? Or is it the third? Honestly, I just can’t seem to keep track of time anymore. It’s all a blur. Bibimbap, tremors, brain tests, and now… the mystery of the date. It’s a very confusing day.
DOCTOR: Alright. And can you tell me where we are right now?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s an easy one, I think. We're… in a doctor’s office, aren’t we? Yes, a very nice doctor's office. All clean and white. Is that a good thing? It feels… clinical, doesn’t it? Is this a good doctor’s office? I can’t recall the name of the practice. Honestly, I just follow my daughter. She knows all these things. Bibimbap, tremors, brain tests, and the elusive location. It’s a very stressful trip.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Three words. This is where I’ll really fail, isn’t it? My mind is already a blank slate. Go ahead, tell me the words. But be patient, alright? I’m not as sharp as I used to be. Bibimbap, tremors, brain tests, and the three words of doom. It’s a very long lunch date.
DOCTOR: Apple, table, penny. Please repeat them for me. Don’t worry if you don’t remember them immediately. Just try your best.
PATIENT: Oh… Apple… table… penny. Hmm. Apple… I remember apple. And… table, yes. But what was the third one? It’s on the tip of my tongue… Was it penny? Or was it… something else? Oh dear. Apple… table… I can’t seem to grasp it. It’s like trying to catch smoke. Honestly, this is terrible. Bibimbap, tremors, brain tests, three words, and a failing memory. It’s a very, very long lunch date. I feel… flustered.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Calvery. Thank you for your patience. Based on the physical exam and cognitive assessment, as well as your reported symptoms, I'm concerned about possible early signs of cognitive impairment. I want to be upfront with you; it's too early to make a definitive diagnosis, but your difficulties with memory, orientation, and recall warrant further investigation. I recommend a comprehensive neurological evaluation, including an MRI of the brain to rule out any structural abnormalities, and a series of more detailed neuropsychological tests. I can provide you with referrals to specialists in this area. It's important to rule out other potential causes of your symptoms, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems, so I also recommend some blood work. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… cognitive impairment… That sounds… serious, doesn’t it? Like… like my mind is fading away. An MRI… tests… specialists… It’s all so overwhelming. Honestly, I just wanted to be sure everything was alright. I didn’t want to be a burden. My daughter… she’ll be beside herself. She’s always worried about me. She’s the sensible one. I just… follow her lead. Blood work… tests… specialists… It’s all too much. But… yes. Alright. If you think it’s necessary, then… yes. Do what you need to do. Just… please be gentle. And… could you explain it all to my daughter? I don’t think I can handle it right now. Honestly, I just want to go home and eat some bibimbap. Even if I can’t remember what day it is.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. I understand this is a lot to process. I will absolutely explain everything to your daughter. I'll write you a referral to a neurologist, Dr. Lee, who is excellent, and a lab order for some basic blood work. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to discuss the results. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. These tests will help us get a clearer picture of what's going on. We'll take things one step at a time. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Oh… Dr. Lee. Alright. A neurologist… yes. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. Questions… hmm. No, not right now, I think. My mind is a bit… foggy. I just want to go home and… rest. And maybe eat some bibimbap. It’s a strange comfort, even if I can’t remember what day it is. Could you… just tell my daughter that I’m alright? That I’m not in any pain? She worries so much. Honestly, she’s the sensible one. And… thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. It’s all a bit… overwhelming.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Calvery. I will definitely let your daughter know you're not in any pain, and that we're simply taking some precautionary steps to get a better understanding of your condition. Here’s my card. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And don’t worry – we’ll figure this out together. I'll have the nurse escort you to the checkout desk. I hope you enjoy your bibimbap. And please, try to relax. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. I will. Bibimbap and… relaxing. Yes. Thank you again. Goodbye.
