DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m Dr. Todorovich. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Just... peeing. It's hard. Been hard for a bit now, I think. Not sure how long, exactly. Things get fuzzy, you know? My husband, he says it's been a few weeks, but... well, he remembers more than me these days.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Hard to pee,” meaning it takes effort to start, or a weak stream?
PATIENT: Hmm… both, maybe? It feels like I have to push a little, and then it doesn’t come out strong. More like… dribbles. It’s embarrassing, to be honest. I used to be able to… well, never mind. Old lady problems, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And is there any pain or burning when you pee?
PATIENT: No, no burning. Not really any pain, either. Just… frustrating. Feels like it takes forever, and I never feel like I get it all out, you know? Like there’s still some left in there. It’s just… uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? No, I don’t think so. I haven't felt hot or anything. And my tummy… no, it doesn't hurt down there. Just the peeing thing. Maybe a little tired, but I'm always a little tired. Old age, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any health problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a lot to remember. Let me see. I used to have high blood pressure, I think. But I take pills for it. And… arthritis, in my hands and knees. That's why they ache sometimes. And… oh, my husband takes care of the medicine, mostly. I forget which ones are for what. He's a good man. Does that help? I'm sorry, I wish I could be more clear.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me think. I had my appendix out when I was young, a long, long time ago. And… oh! I had a hysterectomy, too. Quite a while back. My husband will remember the dates, I'm sure. He's got a good memory for things like that. Is that important? I don't usually think about those things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about family?
PATIENT: Family… I have a son, lives out of state. Doesn't visit much, but he calls. And my husband, of course. He's… well, he's everything. We’ve been married a long time. As for family history… I don’t really know. My parents are gone now, and I never paid much attention to what they had, if you know what I mean. I'm not very good at remembering things like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, not that I know of. I eat everything. Never had a problem. Maybe a little sensitive to the cold, but that's just old age. My husband says I shouldn’t eat too much sugar, but that’s not an allergy. I’m pretty lucky, really. Never been much trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Stoffregen. I’m going to listen to your abdomen and do a quick pelvic exam. Please lie back on the exam table. I’ll let you know what I find.
PATIENT: Oh. A pelvic exam? Oh dear. I haven't had one of those in… well, a very long time. Is it necessary? I’m not very comfortable with that, if you don't mind. But… if you think it's important… I suppose I can do it. Just… be gentle, please.
DOCTOR: It is necessary to get a better understanding of what's going on, Ms. Stoffregen. It will help me determine the cause of your difficulty urinating. I will be as gentle as possible, and I'll explain everything as I go. It won't take long. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh. Well… no, I don't think so. Just… it’s been a long time. And I'm a little… fragile, you know? But if you say it's important… then I trust you, Doctor. Just… take your time. And please, let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable. It's just... it's a little scary, that's all.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your abdomen is soft, and I don’t feel any masses or tenderness. Now, I’m going to perform a pelvic exam. I’m using a lubricated speculum to gently open the vaginal canal so I can visualize the cervix and surrounding tissues. I don’t see any obvious signs of infection or abnormality, but your vaginal tissues appear somewhat thin and dry. I'm going to do a quick digital exam now to assess the tone of your pelvic floor muscles. Your pelvic floor muscles are weak. This could be contributing to your difficulty urinating. Okay. That’s all for the physical exam. I will need to collect a urine sample to rule out any infection.
PATIENT: Oh. Weak muscles. That explains a lot, I guess. I always thought I was just getting old. Is it… serious? What can we do about it? And… a urine sample? Oh dear. Where do I even… I haven't gone in hours, I think, since I got here.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily serious, Ms. Stoffregen, but it does require attention. Weak pelvic floor muscles are common with age and can lead to urinary incontinence and difficulty emptying your bladder. Fortunately, there are treatments available. I’ll give you a sterile cup. You’ll need to collect a midstream sample – that means you’ll start urinating, then collect the sample mid-stream, without stopping completely. I'll show you how. It's important to use a clean cup. I'll leave the room for you to do that. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh. A cup? Mid-stream… that means… start and stop? That sounds… complicated. And what if I can’t… you know? I haven’t gone in hours. I’m a little nervous, Doctor. Maybe I should try when I get home? It’s just… a little embarrassing, you know? To have to… start and stop. And what if it doesn’t come out?
DOCTOR: Ms. Stoffregen, it’s important that we collect a urine sample today to rule out any infection. An infection could be causing your difficulty urinating. It's a simple procedure. I can provide you with privacy, and I can step out completely if you prefer. I will be right outside. Just relax and try your best. If you are unable to provide a sample, we can reschedule, but it's preferable to have one now. I will be right outside if you need assistance. Would you like me to step out now?
PATIENT: Oh. An infection… that sounds scary. I don't want an infection. But… I'm just so nervous. And I don't want to make a mess. Maybe… maybe if you could just… stay nearby? Just in case? I don't want to be alone. It's just… a little embarrassing, you know? To have to… start and stop. I trust you, Doctor, but… it’s just… a little scary. Would you mind terribly staying nearby? Just in case?
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Stoffregen. I will remain just outside the door. Please take your time. Let me know if you need anything at all. I understand it's a little uncomfortable. I’ll be right here.
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, Doctor. That's very kind of you. Here goes nothing… .
