DOCTOR: Good morning, Melvenia. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, to be quick, I need some forms signed and… verified, I guess you’d say. It’s for some health things. I don’t really understand all the paperwork, honestly.
DOCTOR: Forms, yes. While I can certainly review paperwork, this is a medical consultation, Melvenia. I need to understand why these forms are needed. What “health things” are you referring to?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Right, sorry. It’s… it’s for a program. A little help with some bills, you see. They need a doctor to say I… well, they need it verified that I need the help. It’s not a big deal, I hope. I just don't want to take up too much of your time. It’s just a signature, right?
DOCTOR: Melvenia, simply signing a form without understanding the medical necessity is… inappropriate. It defeats the purpose of a medical evaluation. This program requires verification of a medical need. So, let’s start with this need. What health issues are you experiencing that necessitate financial assistance?
PATIENT: Well, my knees, mostly. They’ve been giving me trouble for years, but it’s gotten worse lately. Walking is… difficult. And it aches all the time, even when I’m sitting. I try not to complain, but it’s getting harder to get around, you know? It makes things… complicated. I haven't really seen a doctor about it in a while, though. Just been trying to manage with over-the-counter things.
DOCTOR: Okay. And how long have your knees been bothering you, specifically?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A long time. Probably… fifteen years? Maybe longer. It started as just a little ache after a lot of walking, but it’s just gotten steadily worse. I used to be able to ignore it, but now it’s… hard to ignore. I just figured it was old age, mostly. It happens, right?
DOCTOR: "Old age" is not a diagnosis, Melvenia. Fifteen years is a significant amount of time to have ongoing knee pain without a proper evaluation. Have you noticed any swelling, locking, or giving way of your knees?
PATIENT: Oh, swelling, yes, sometimes. Especially after I’ve been on my feet a lot. And… locking, I think so? It feels like it catches sometimes when I try to bend them. Not every time, but often enough to be annoying. Giving way… not really giving way, but they feel unstable, like they might. It's hard to explain. I just try to avoid doing things that make it worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been under control with medication for years now. And… I had a gallbladder removed about twenty years ago. Other than that… not much. I try to stay healthy. I really do.
DOCTOR: Do you currently take any medications for your blood pressure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Yes, I do. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Just a small dose, once a day. And… sometimes I take ibuprofen for my knees, when they’re really bad. But I try not to, because I heard it's not good for you to take it all the time.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen is a temporary fix, Melvenia, and can indeed have side effects with prolonged use. Alright. Let's proceed with a physical exam of your knees. Please lie down on the examination table. I’ll need to assess your range of motion, stability, and look for any signs of inflammation.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Yes, that’s fine. Just… give me a moment. They aren’t what they used to be, you know?
DOCTOR: Take your time. Please lie flat on your back. I’ll start with your right knee. Now, can you bend your right knee as far as you comfortably can?
PATIENT: Okay, here goes. Ow… that’s… not very far. It feels… tight. Like something is blocking it. Is that enough? It really doesn’t like being bent very much.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s sufficient. Limited range of motion noted. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ooh! Yes, right there. That’s… tender. Not sharp, just… a dull ache. It's been like that for a while, I guess I just got used to it.
DOCTOR: And on the left side?
PATIENT: It's… similar on the left, but maybe not quite as bad. Still tender in the same spot, on the inside. And it feels… creaky. Like there’s something rubbing together. You can hear it, right? It's embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Yes, crepitus is present bilaterally. A slight positive drawer test noted on both sides. Okay. Based on my examination, you have bilateral knee pain with limited range of motion, crepitus, and signs of instability. This is consistent with osteoarthritis. However, we’ll need to confirm this with X-rays.
PATIENT: Osteo… what now? X-rays? Oh dear. Is that… serious? I just thought it was old age, like I said. Will it hurt?
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease, Melvenia. It’s very common, particularly with age. It means the cartilage in your knees is wearing down. X-rays will help us determine the severity of the damage. And no, the X-rays themselves do not hurt. It’s a quick and painless procedure. We need to establish a baseline. Then, depending on the results, we can discuss treatment options. These may include physical therapy, pain management, and potentially injections. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh! Contrast dye? No, no allergies. I don’t think so. I’ve had a few tests in my life, but nothing major. Injections… those sound… scary. Are there other options? I just want to be able to walk without hurting, you know?
DOCTOR: Injections are a common and effective treatment for osteoarthritis, Melvenia. They are not without risk, of course, but the potential benefits often outweigh them. However, we can explore other options, such as physical therapy and over-the-counter pain relievers. But realistically, without a definitive diagnosis from the X-rays, and without addressing the underlying cause, these will only provide temporary relief. I'm going to order X-rays of both knees. The radiology department will contact you to schedule an appointment. Please bring a list of any medications you are currently taking, and any previous medical records you have. Do you have any questions before I finalize the order?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that's all. Just the X-rays. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look at my knees. I just hope it’s not too serious. Can I just… go now?
DOCTOR: Yes, you may go. The radiology report will be sent to my office, and my staff will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment once I've reviewed the results. Please remember to bring your medication list. And try to avoid any strenuous activity until we have a clearer understanding of your condition.
