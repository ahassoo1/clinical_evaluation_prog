DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah, good morning. Look, honestly, it’s… it’s a bit fuzzy. Something about not sleeping great and… feeling like I should be, I dunno, better? My wife, God rest her soul, she always said I needed to look after myself more. Something about fitness, I think? It’s all a bit… vague, to be honest. Medicare sent something, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s quite common for things to feel a bit unclear, especially when dealing with… recent loss. And Medicare often prompts check-ups, which is good. So, if we could just try to piece things together… you mentioned not sleeping well and feeling like you should be better. Can you elaborate on the sleep issue?
PATIENT: Yeah, well… I get some sleep. It’s not like I’m up all night, staring at the ceiling. But it’s… restless. I wake up feeling like I haven’t really rested, you know? And I’m… not as spry as I used to be. Used to be able to work on these instruments all day without a second thought. Now… my back aches a bit. It’s probably just getting old, honestly. Though, I'm not that old. Twenty-nine, you know? Still got good years left in me, hopefully.
DOCTOR: Twenty-nine is certainly not old. And it’s good you’re recognizing these changes. Restless sleep and back pain… alright. When did you start noticing these issues, approximately?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's hard to say. It sort of… crept up on me. Probably… after… well, after my wife passed. Everything just sort of blurred together after that, you know? I was… distracted. I suppose it’s been… months? Maybe six, seven? Time really does fly, doesn’t it? I wouldn't put a precise date on it, though. I'm terrible with dates. Always have been.
DOCTOR: I understand. Grief can certainly affect many aspects of one’s life, including sleep and physical well-being. Six to seven months… alright. Besides the restless sleep and back pain, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Hmm… let me think. I get… tired, I suppose. More easily than I used to. And… I don't have the… energy for things. I used to enjoy going out with friends, tinkering with old clocks… now I mostly just… sit. And eat. Probably eat too much, to be honest. My wife always kept me on the straight and narrow with the food, you know? It’s just… easier now. Easier to do nothing. Does that make sense? I’m rambling, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: No, not at all. It makes perfect sense, Mr. Redfern. You're not rambling. It sounds like you’ve been experiencing some fatigue and a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed, alongside the sleep issues and back pain. Has this loss of interest affected your appetite at all, or is it mostly the change in your usual routine leading to overeating?
PATIENT: Nah, appetite’s been fine. Maybe too fine. Like I said, my wife always watched what I ate. Now… well, now there's no one to stop me from having that extra baklava. It’s comfort, I suppose. Stupid comfort. It's not like I'm gaining much weight, but I’m definitely… softer around the edges. Honestly, I’m more bothered by the tiredness and the not being able to focus than anything else. Makes it hard to work on the instruments. And when I do work on them, my back just kills me after an hour. It's… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, fatigue, loss of interest, restless sleep, back pain, and increased appetite. Have you experienced any fever, chills, unexplained weight loss, or any other physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills, no. Weight loss? Definitely not. Like I said, it’s the opposite of weight loss. Everything’s… solid. No other symptoms, really. Just… tired. And achy. It's not like I'm sick sick, you know? Just… rundown. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to feel… normal again. Is that too much to ask? I feel like an old man already, and I’m barely thirty.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all, Mr. Redfern. And I understand your frustration. Before we proceed, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Uh… allergies? Hmm. Not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife always handled the medications. I'd just take what she gave me. I think… she said something about penicillin once, but that was years ago. I don't even remember why. Probably just a precaution, you know? Honestly, I’m not much for pills. I prefer a good cup of tea and a lie-down if I'm feeling poorly.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies, aside from a possible precaution with penicillin. And you're not currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nah, nothing. Not a single pill. Like I said, tea and a lie-down. My wife used to make me this special herbal tea for when I was stressed. I’ve been trying to recreate it, but it’s just not the same. Doesn’t matter, I suppose. Just a silly memory. So, what’s next, Doctor? You going to poke and prod me now? I’m not a fan of doctors, you know. Always poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: A brief physical examination would be helpful, Mr. Redfern, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. It will be quite minimal, I assure you. We’ll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll gently examine your back. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Get it over with. But gently, you said? I bruise easily, you know. Not a lot, but… easily. And don't expect me to jump through any hoops. I haven’t done any physical activity in months. Honestly, this is all very… undignified. Just hurry up, please. The sooner it's over, the better.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Redfern. I will be as gentle as possible. First, let’s take your blood pressure. Just relax your arm, please. 130 over 80. That's within a normal range. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear. Now, could you lie down on the examination table, please?
PATIENT: Fine. But I’m warning you, my back is going to protest. This table isn’t exactly… plush. And be careful, okay? I mean it. Don’t go poking around too much. Just get it over with. Hurry up. This is really not my idea of a good time.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Redfern. Just tell me if anything feels particularly tender. Hmm… there is some muscle tightness here, on the left side, and a bit of tenderness. No palpable abnormalities. And your reflexes are normal. Alright, you can sit up when you're ready. No obvious signs of nerve impingement. The muscle tightness is likely contributing to your pain.
PATIENT: Muscle tightness, huh? No kidding. It feels like someone’s been hammering nails into my spine. So, what does that mean? Am I falling apart, Doctor? Is this a sign of something serious? Honestly, I'm starting to panic now. I just want to be able to work on these instruments again, you know? That's all. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Redfern, it doesn’t necessarily mean you’re falling apart. Muscle tightness is very common, especially with stress and inactivity. Based on what you've told me, and the brief examination, it's likely that your symptoms are related to a combination of factors: grief, fatigue, lack of physical activity, and the resulting muscle tension. I’d like to order some blood work just to rule out any underlying causes, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. It’s a standard precaution.
PATIENT: Blood work? Honestly, Doctor, you’re just adding to my misery. Fine. Do what you have to do. But I’m warning you, I hate needles. Always have. I faint, sometimes. Just… please be quick about it? And tell me what this is all going to cost? My wife always handled the bills, you know. I have no idea how any of this works.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Redfern. We’ll make sure you're comfortable during the blood draw. And don't worry, we have a very experienced phlebotomist. As for the cost, let me check your insurance details. It appears your Medicare should cover the majority of the tests. There may be a small co-pay, depending on your specific plan, which the billing department can explain. We’ll also schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and formulate a plan. Would next week work for you?
PATIENT: Next week, fine. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. Just… get it over with. I just want to feel normal again, you know? I want to be able to work on my instruments, go out with friends… not sit around feeling sorry for myself. It’s just… hard. Everything is just… hard. So, blood work next week. And then what? More poking and prodding? Just tell me what I need to do, Doctor. I'll do whatever it takes.
DOCTOR: We’ll start with the blood work to rule out any underlying medical causes. Then, we can discuss some lifestyle modifications, such as gentle exercise, stress management techniques, and ensuring you’re getting enough rest. I might recommend a physical therapist to help with your back pain. We can also discuss your fatigue and loss of interest and explore options to help improve your mood. For now, I'm going to write a referral for the blood work and schedule the follow-up appointment. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any concerns before then. Here's the lab order and the appointment confirmation. We'll take it one step at a time, Mr. Redfern.
PATIENT: Fine. One step at a time, huh? Sounds exhausting. Well, I guess there's nothing else for it. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. I’ll see you next week, then. If I haven’t fallen apart by then, that is. .
