DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let’s get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It's this tiredness. It’s just… getting worse. And it’s… embarrassing, really. I’ve been eating dirt. Not like, on purpose, but… I just crave it. Clay, mostly. Don't look at me like that, Doctor. It's not a good look, I know.
DOCTOR: Eating… dirt?
PATIENT: Yes, dirt. Earth. Soil. Whatever you want to call it. It started small, a little taste here and there. Now… now I find myself thinking about it all the time. It doesn’t taste good, mind you. It’s just… I need it. And it's making me feel awful, weak. I don't understand it, and frankly, I don't have time for foolishness.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, this is… unusual. Let’s start with the tiredness. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Months, at least. Maybe six? It’s hard to say, really. I’m a busy woman, always have been. I just figured I was getting older, you know? Less energy. But it’s not just that. It’s… deeper. Like something's draining me. And then the dirt started, and I thought, well, that’s just ridiculous. But it hasn’t stopped.
DOCTOR: “Deeper,” you say. And you correlate this… craving with the fatigue?
PATIENT: Of course I do! What else would it be? I'm not a complete idiot, Doctor. It started around the same time. I'm telling you, something is wrong. And I haven’t got all day to sit here and explain the obvious. I need to get back to work, you know. People rely on me.
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s establish a timeline. Six months of fatigue… and approximately how long have you been consuming… soil?
PATIENT: About four months, I’d say. Started after a particularly nasty cold. Just a little bit at first, a tiny pinch. I’d find myself… drawn to it, in the garden. Now, it's… more than a pinch. I try not to, but… it’s like a need. I really don’t understand it, and I’d like to get this sorted out quickly if possible. I have patients waiting.
DOCTOR: A cold… and then this began. Interesting. And where, specifically, are you obtaining this… soil?
PATIENT: From my garden, mostly. I have a small vegetable patch. Rich, dark soil. I know it’s probably full of… things. Worms and whatnot. I try to pick out the bigger bits, but honestly, I’m not going to sift through it like gold. It’s embarrassing enough admitting this to you, let alone detailing the specifics of my dirt-eating habits! Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I assure you, this is not a typical complaint. We need to be thorough. Now, let's move on to other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat when I can. I'm not a fussy eater. Just… not much hunger, I suppose. I've been too tired to bother with proper meals. Mostly just… something quick. A biscuit, a piece of fruit. It's not like I'm losing weight, if that's what you're thinking. Just… lacking the energy to cook. And frankly, the dirt… it fills you up a bit, you know? Doesn’t leave much room for anything else. Look, is this going somewhere or am I wasting my time?
DOCTOR: "Fills you up"... Right. And have you experienced any abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea?
PATIENT: No, not really. A bit of a stomach ache sometimes, but I get that anyway. Old age, you know? And no, nothing… dramatic. No throwing up, no… running to the bathroom. Just a general feeling of… unwellness. And the tiredness, of course. It’s just… draining. And the dirt. Honestly, I’m starting to feel like you’re the one who’s odd, asking all these questions about my… eating habits. Is this relevant, Doctor? I have a schedule to keep.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, I assure you, this is relevant. We need to rule out any underlying medical conditions. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. What haven’t I had? Arthritis, mostly. And high blood pressure, a few years back. It’s managed with pills, though. And a touch of the flu every now and then. Nothing serious. I’m a tough old bird, Doctor. I don’t believe in coddling myself. And honestly, I can’t remember all the specifics. It’s been a long life. Are we getting anywhere with this dirt problem or am I just here to satisfy your curiosity?
DOCTOR: Arthritis, hypertension… and you are currently taking medication?
PATIENT: Yes, for the blood pressure. A small white pill. I take it every morning with my tea. Can’t remember the name of it, though. Honestly, I just take what the doctor tells me. And look, I’m telling you, it’s the dirt! It’s the dirt causing all this. I feel weak, tired, and I have this strange craving. It’s not rocket science, Doctor. I’m a physical therapist aide, for goodness sake. I deal with people’s bodies all day. I know something isn’t right! Now, are you going to do something about it or not?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s conduct a brief physical examination. Please lie back on the examination table. I’ll need to listen to your heart and lungs, and palpate your abdomen. And please, try to refrain from mentioning the…soil…during the exam. It’s hardly conducive to a professional assessment.
PATIENT: Oh, wonderful. Another waste of time. Fine. But don't expect miracles. I'm telling you, it's the dirt. It's the only thing that's changed. And I really haven't got all day. Get on with it, then.
DOCTOR: Heart sounds are regular, though slightly muffled. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, with mild guarding. No rebound tenderness or organomegaly noted. Your spleen feels slightly enlarged. I also note some pallor. Are you experiencing any bruising easily?
PATIENT: Bruising? Not really. I bump into things, of course, being a bit clumsy these days, but nothing unusual. A bit of a mark here and there, but nothing that doesn't fade. Look, what does this all mean? Is it serious? And is it the dirt? Seriously, Doctor, if I'm going to be honest, I'm getting rather anxious.
DOCTOR: Ms. Hardenburgh, your spleen is enlarged, and you are exhibiting signs of pallor. Combined with your reported fatigue and… unusual dietary habits, I suspect you may be suffering from iron deficiency anemia. The soil consumption is likely exacerbating this condition, as it can interfere with iron absorption and potentially contain parasites. We need to run some blood tests to confirm this diagnosis and rule out any underlying causes of the anemia. We will also need a stool sample to check for parasites. I’m going to order a complete blood count, iron studies, and a fecal occult blood test. I'll also have a nurse collect a stool sample. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Iron deficiency? Anemia? Oh, goodness. That sounds… serious. And parasites? From the dirt? Honestly, Doctor, you’re making me feel quite ill. Blood tests and… stool samples? Is this absolutely necessary? I really don’t like the sound of this. And what about the tiredness? Will this fix the tiredness? And what do I need to do? Stop eating the dirt, I suppose? It's hard to explain, but sometimes it's just a craving, you know? But alright, fine. Blood tests and… whatever you said. But please, be quick about it. I have patients waiting, and frankly, I feel dreadful.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hardenburgh, it is necessary. The tests will help us determine the severity of the anemia and identify the underlying cause. You absolutely must cease the consumption of soil immediately. It is likely contributing to your fatigue and could be causing other health problems. I will write you a prescription for an iron supplement. I also recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment in one week to review the results of the tests and adjust the treatment plan accordingly. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now, and provide you with instructions for the stool sample collection. Please follow these instructions carefully. And please, refrain from mentioning the "soil" again. It is unprofessional and unhelpful. Do you have any further questions, or may we conclude this consultation?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. No more dirt. I get it. And yes, I suppose that’s everything. Just… please be quick. I have a schedule to keep, you know. Thank you, Doctor. Though I’m not sure I’m very grateful at the moment. Let's just get this over with. .
DOCTOR: The nurse will be with you shortly. Have a good day, Ms. Hardenburgh. .
