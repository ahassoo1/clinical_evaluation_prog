DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Yadao. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s a bit embarrassing, really. I’m having trouble… going to the bathroom. It’s just… difficult to start, you know? And it takes a long time, even then. It’s been going on for a couple of weeks now, maybe three. Not every day, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Difficulty initiating urination… and a prolonged emptying time, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. It’s not painful, not exactly. Just… weak. Like the stream isn’t very strong. And I have to push a little, sometimes. It feels like I don’t empty everything completely, either. I always feel like there’s a little bit left in there, even after I’ve gone. Is that… normal?
DOCTOR: "Normal" is a… relative term, Ms. Yadao. We need to establish a baseline. Have you noticed any changes in the color of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Color… let me think. It seems… normal, I suppose. Pale yellow, sometimes a little darker if I haven’t had enough to drink. No blood, no foam… nothing like that. I drink a lot of water, usually. At least eight glasses a day. I always have. My mother always said it was good for everything.
DOCTOR: Adequate hydration is… commendable. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, lower abdominal pain, or any back pain accompanying this difficulty?
PATIENT: No, no fever or chills. My back feels fine, thankfully. And no pain in my belly, either. It’s just… the bladder, I guess. It just feels… uncomfortable when I need to go, and then difficult to go. It's mostly just frustrating, really. I don't like feeling like I can't rely on things working the way they should.
DOCTOR: Very well. And are you currently taking any medications, Ms. Yadao?
PATIENT: Just the one. For my blood pressure. Lisinopril, I think it’s called. Ten milligrams, every morning. I’ve been on it for… oh, maybe five years now? The doctor said it was important, and I take it regularly. I keep a little pill organizer, so I don’t forget. Do you need to know anything else about it?
DOCTOR: Lisinopril… an ACE inhibitor. Now. Have you had any changes to your diet recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I eat pretty much the same things I always have. Lots of potatoes, some fish when I can get it, and a lot of vegetables from my garden. I try to eat healthy. I bake my own bread, too. Rye bread, mostly. Lithuanian rye bread. It’s very good, if I do say so myself. Nothing spicy or unusual. Just… normal food. I haven’t been traveling or anything either, so no changes to my routine.
DOCTOR: Right. Now, Ms. Yadao, I am going to need to perform a quick physical examination. We'll need to check your abdomen, and I will also perform a digital rectal exam. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. A… a rectal exam? Well. I hadn't expected that. Is it… necessary? I mean, I understand you’re the doctor, but… is there anything else we could try first? It’s just… a bit embarrassing, you know? And not very comfortable, I imagine. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that right away.
DOCTOR: Ms. Yadao, a digital rectal exam is a standard part of evaluating urinary difficulties in women of your age. It allows me to assess the tone of your anal sphincter and check for any abnormalities in the rectum that might be contributing to your symptoms. I understand your discomfort, but it is important for a thorough assessment. We can proceed with a limited exam, focusing on the abdominal portion, but that will limit my ability to properly evaluate the cause of your difficulties. It is your choice, of course, but I strongly recommend proceeding with the full exam for a more accurate diagnosis.
PATIENT: Well… if it’s really necessary… I suppose I understand. It’s just… I haven’t had one of those before. How… how long will it take? And will it hurt? Please tell me it won’t hurt too much. And… will you explain everything as you go? I just want to know what’s happening.
DOCTOR: It will be relatively quick, Ms. Yadao. A few moments at most. There may be some mild discomfort, a feeling of pressure, but I will explain each step as I go and stop if you experience any significant pain. I will use lubricant to minimize discomfort. We will begin with the abdominal portion, then proceed if you are comfortable. Do you have any allergies to latex or any other lubricants?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Latex is fine. And… alright. If you explain everything… and I can stop you if it gets too bad… then I suppose we can try the abdominal part first. Just… please be gentle. And tell me what you’re looking for. I like to know what’s going on. It makes me feel better. Let’s get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie back on the examination table, Ms. Yadao. I will start by palpating your abdomen. I am assessing for bladder distention, any masses, and tenderness. I'm pressing here… and here… any discomfort with this?
PATIENT: A little… just a little, there. On the lower left side. Not painful, exactly… just… uncomfortable. It feels… full, I suppose. Like there’s something pressing on me. Is that normal? It doesn't hurt when you press, but it's just a bit… tender to the touch normally. Like I've been doing a lot of gardening. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: I note your tenderness in the lower left quadrant. This could indicate bladder distention, but it’s too early to say definitively. And how about here?
PATIENT: Oh, that's a bit more… sensitive. Not awful, but… yes, that’s a little uncomfortable. It feels… like a dull ache, really. It’s not a sharp pain, just… a pressure. Like something is… heavy. It’s probably nothing, honestly. I do a lot of lifting in the garden. Bags of soil, pots of flowers… things like that. Maybe I just pulled something.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, Ms. Yadao, to proceed with a more complete evaluation, I will need to perform a digital rectal exam. As I mentioned before, this allows me to assess the tone of your anal sphincter and check for any abnormalities. I will use lubricant and be as gentle as possible. Please inform me immediately if you experience any discomfort. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Just… how long will it take? And will it… will it feel like something is inside me? I just… I don’t like the idea of… something being inside there. I know you’re the doctor, but it’s still… unnerving. And… is it cold? That would be awful. Please tell me it won’t be cold.
DOCTOR: It will be very brief, Ms. Yadao, only a few moments. I will be using a lubricated, warmed finger. It will not feel like something is inside you, merely a gentle examination of the rectal area. It is a standard procedure to assess the surrounding tissues. I assure you, I will be as quick and gentle as possible. Do you have any other concerns I can address before we begin?
PATIENT: No… no, I think that’s all. Just… please hurry. And… tell me what you’re doing, as you go. Just… keep talking. It will help. I just want it to be over with. Alright… let’s get it over with. But please, be gentle. And… tell me what you're looking for, okay?
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Yadao. Please take a deep breath. I am now going to gently insert a lubricated finger into your rectum. This will allow me to assess the tone of your anal sphincter, check for any masses or tenderness, and evaluate the walls of your rectum. You may feel some pressure, but please inform me immediately if you experience any discomfort. I am now gently inserting my finger… feeling the tone of your sphincter… it feels normal so far… and now evaluating the walls of your rectum… I do not feel any obvious masses… there is some slight tenderness on the left side, but nothing significant… I am now rotating my finger to assess the entire circumference… The rectal walls feel smooth, with no obvious abnormalities… The tone of your sphincter is adequate… The tenderness is mild and localized. That concludes the examination, Ms. Yadao.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Is it over? That wasn’t as bad as I thought, honestly. But… what did you find? Was anything wrong? What does the tenderness mean? Please tell me it’s nothing serious. I just want to know what’s going on and if I need to worry.
DOCTOR: The examination revealed mild tenderness in the left side of your rectum, but no other significant abnormalities. The tone of your anal sphincter was adequate, and the rectal walls felt smooth. The tenderness could be due to a variety of factors, such as mild inflammation, constipation, or muscle spasm. It is unlikely to be anything serious, but to rule out other possibilities, I would like to order a urine analysis and a stool occult blood test. These tests will help me determine if there is any infection or bleeding. Do you have any known history of constipation or hemorrhoids?
PATIENT: Constipation… not really. I usually go to the bathroom every day, like clockwork. Maybe once in a blue moon I'm a little… slow, but nothing major. And hemorrhoids… no, I’ve never had those. My mother always said eating enough fruits and vegetables would prevent them, and I do eat a lot of vegetables from my garden. So, no, I don’t think so. But… the tenderness… could it be from straining? I have been digging a lot lately, planting potatoes. It’s hard work.
DOCTOR: Straining could certainly contribute to some mild tenderness. However, to be thorough, we will proceed with the urine analysis and stool occult blood test. I will also recommend a trial of stool softeners to rule out any underlying constipation. If the tests are negative and the stool softeners provide relief, we can attribute the tenderness to muscle strain. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. I’ve never had any reactions to anything. I can take most things, I think. My mother always kept a well-stocked medicine cabinet, just in case. But I haven’t had to take much over the years. I try to stay healthy. So, no, no allergies. What about the tests? How long will they take? And… will they be painful? I just want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: The urine analysis is a simple test that can be done right here in the office. We will provide you with a collection cup and instructions. It should not be painful at all. The stool occult blood test requires a small sample of stool, which you can collect at home. We will provide you with collection materials and instructions. Again, it should not be painful. The results will take a few days to come back. In the meantime, I will prescribe a mild stool softener, docusate sodium, 100mg twice daily as needed. Do you have any questions about the stool softener or the tests?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand. Simple urine test, stool sample at home, stool softener… it doesn’t sound too bad. Is there anything I should avoid while I’m waiting for the results? Certain foods, or… anything? I just want to make sure I do everything right. And… if it is something serious… what happens then? I’m a bit worried, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: While awaiting the results, maintain your normal diet, Ms. Yadao. There are no specific restrictions. And please, try not to worry. The tenderness is likely due to muscle strain, and the tests are simply a precaution. If the tests reveal anything concerning, we will discuss the appropriate course of action. It may involve further testing, or a referral to a specialist. However, I do not anticipate anything serious. Here is the prescription for the stool softener and the instructions for the stool collection. Please call my office if you have any questions. I will see you in a week to discuss the results. Do you have any further questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very… thorough. And patient, even though I was a bit of a worrywart. I appreciate you explaining everything so carefully. I’ll follow the instructions and call if I have any problems. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Yadao. Have a good day. .
