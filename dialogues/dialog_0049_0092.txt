DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Dr… Nestingen, you say? Hmm. Well, it's this… breathing. Gets harder, you know? And my mouth feels like the desert. Eyes too. Everything's just… dry. Don’t remember when it started, exactly. Just… happened.
DOCTOR: Alright. "Breathing gets harder and dryness..." We'll get to the bottom of this. So, when you say "harder," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Describe? Like… I gotta work at it, you know? Like when you climb stairs real fast. Not that bad, but… close. It’s not a pain, exactly. Just… effort. I used to be able to just… breathe. Now I gotta think about it.
DOCTOR: Right. “Effortful breathing.” And you said your mouth and eyes are dry as well?
PATIENT: Yeah, real dry. Like… cotton. I drink water, but it doesn’t… stay gone long, you know? Feels like a waste of time, honestly. Used to not have this problem. Everything’s just… going wrong with this old body.
DOCTOR: I see. And has this dryness been accompanied by anything else?
PATIENT: Anything else…? Hmm. Let me think… Well, I feel tired, I guess. But who doesn’t feel tired at my age? Maybe a little… lightheaded sometimes when I stand up too fast. But that could be… well, a lot of things, probably.
DOCTOR: Alright. Fatigue and some lightheadedness. Do you have any chest pain, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Chest pain? No, no pain. Lucky, I guess. Never had much luck with anything, but never had chest pain. Just this… everything being dry. It’s annoying, honestly. Makes it hard to enjoy a good cigar, you know?
DOCTOR: A cigar, you say?
PATIENT: Well, yeah. What's wrong with that? Been enjoying a good cigar for… well, a long time. Don't see what that has to do with… this breathing problem, exactly.
DOCTOR: It can be relevant, Mr. Guilds. We need a complete picture. Now, have you had any recent fevers, cough, or any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Fevers? No. Cough? Not really. Maybe a little tickle now and then, but nothing. Appetite… Well, I don't eat as much as I used to. But who does at my age? Everything tastes… bland, I guess. Not that I really care for fancy food anyway. Just… not as hungry.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, minimal cough, decreased appetite... Now, let's go over some of your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor… someone told me a long time ago. Gave me pills, but I stopped taking them. Didn’t feel like I needed them. Never had any trouble with my heart, as far as I know. Diabetes? No, never. I like sweets, but… didn’t get any diabetes.
DOCTOR: Right. And any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm. I had my appendix out when I was a kid, I think. Long time ago. And… maybe some skin tags removed, but that’s not a surgery, is it? Just… little cuts. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendectomy. Now, are you currently taking any medications, besides what you used to take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No. Just… whatever the wife used to give me for my aches and pains. But she's… gone now. Can't remember what they were, exactly. Little white pills, mostly. Don't take anything these days. Don't see the point.
DOCTOR: Very well. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat pretty much anything. Used to eat bugs when I was a kid, back in Cuba! Don't think I'm allergic to anything now. Maybe dust, but who isn't?
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me, please. And again… hmm. Your breathing does sound a little… diminished. And your heart rate is a bit elevated. I'm going to check your blood pressure now.
PATIENT: Diminished? Elevated? What's wrong with me? I just feel… dry. Is it serious? Don’t go telling me I need a fancy hospital visit. I don’t like hospitals.
DOCTOR: Your blood pressure is… elevated, as I suspected. 160 over 90. And your pulse is 98. We're going to need to do some further testing to figure out what's going on. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a basic metabolic panel, and a chest X-ray.
PATIENT: Testing? X-rays? You mean… like with radiation? I don't like radiation! What’s wrong with just… telling me what's wrong? Is it my blood pressure? I told you, I stopped taking those pills. They didn’t feel right. Are you sure I need all this? It sounds expensive.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I understand your concerns, but I need to gather information to make an accurate diagnosis. The X-ray uses a very small amount of radiation, and the benefits of finding out what’s causing your breathing difficulties and dryness far outweigh the risks. As for your blood pressure, yes, it is elevated, and that could be contributing to your symptoms. We need to rule out other possibilities first. The tests will give us a clearer picture. Do you agree to the tests?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, do your tests. But if they tell me I need a hospital, I'm walking out. And if it’s expensive, you’re dealing with my… with the insurance. Medicare, it is. Don’t want to be a burden, you know? Just get it over with. This whole thing is… annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright, I've ordered the tests. The lab and radiology departments are just down the hall. The technician will explain the procedure to you. I'll review the results as soon as they're available. In the meantime, I recommend you drink plenty of fluids. And while we wait for the results, I’m going to prescribe you a low-dose diuretic to help manage your blood pressure. It’s a mild medication, but it should help. Here you go. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Diuretic? What’s that? More pills? What does it do? And how much is all this going to cost me? This insurance… it's always a fight. And you said something about fluids… water? I drink water. Doesn't help much with the dry mouth, you know? This whole thing is… a mess.
DOCTOR: A diuretic helps your body get rid of excess fluid, which can lower your blood pressure. Yes, it’s another pill. As for the cost, I don’t have exact figures, but Medicare should cover a significant portion. You'll need to contact them to determine your out-of-pocket expenses. And while drinking water is important, it may not be enough. The diuretic will help address the underlying issue. For now, let's focus on getting these tests done. Once we have the results, we can discuss a more comprehensive treatment plan. Do you understand?
PATIENT: I guess. Tests, pills, insurance… sounds about right. Is there anywhere comfortable to sit while I wait for this… treatment plan? This chair isn't very good for my back. And could you maybe write down the name of this pill? Just in case. My memory isn’t what it used to be, you know.
DOCTOR: The pill is called hydrochlorothiazide. There’s a waiting area down the hall with more comfortable chairs. Just ask the receptionist. And frankly, Mr. Guilds, improving your blood pressure and fluid balance will likely help your overall health and potentially alleviate some of your symptoms. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have other patients to see. Please let me know if you have any urgent questions.
PATIENT: Hydro… whatever. Fine. Just a waste of time, this whole thing. Thank you… I guess. And if I fall, it's your fault.
DOCTOR: Please be careful. .
