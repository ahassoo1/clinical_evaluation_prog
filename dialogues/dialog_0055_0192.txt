DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I am Dr. Eaddy. So, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Hartness is the name. I’m here for… this exam. For the army. Need to get it done, you know? Don’t have all day.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. An examination for the army. I understand. And is this a routine check-up, or are you experiencing any particular symptoms or concerns that prompted this visit?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Concerns? Look, I work with engines all day. Hands are always dirty, back aches sometimes. It’s… work. I’m a strong guy, though. Always have been. Never been sick much, either. Don’t see what the big fuss is about needing a doctor for this. Just need a paper saying I’m good.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Hartness, these examinations are quite thorough for a reason. Even strong individuals can benefit from a comprehensive assessment. It’s simply a matter of ensuring optimal health and identifying any potential issues before they become problematic. Now, regarding your back pain – could you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Optimal health? Look, I can lift more than most men half my age. Fine, fine… the back. It’s… a dull ache, mostly after a long day bending over engines. Sometimes it’s stiff in the mornings. I just… rub it. Works most of the time. Not a big deal. Really. I don’t need a whole song and dance about it.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Hartness, but dismissing discomfort, even if it seems minor, isn’t advisable. Stiffness in the mornings, coupled with pain after exertion… it could indicate a number of things. To get a clearer picture, let’s proceed with a brief physical examination, shall we?
PATIENT: Examination? Fine. Get it over with. But don't expect any fancy flexibility tricks or anything. I'm a practical man, not a gymnast. Just tell me what you need me to do and let's be quick about it. My wife is expecting me home for dinner.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Hartness. No gymnastics involved, I assure you. We will simply assess your range of motion, check your reflexes, and listen to your heart and lungs. If you would please lie down on the examination table, we can begin. I'll start with your back. Could you point to the area where you experience the most discomfort?
PATIENT: Right here. And here. It’s… all of it, really. It’s not one specific point. It just… aches. And don't go poking around too much, alright? I don't like being fiddled with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. I’m just checking for tenderness or muscle spasms. I do detect some mild tightness in the lumbar region. No acute tenderness to the touch, thankfully. Now, if you could bend forward and try to touch your toes, as comfortably as possible. I understand if it's limited, just let me know when you feel any discomfort.
PATIENT: There. That’s about as far as I can go. Feels… tight. Like something's pulling. Don't need to push it, doctor. I told you, I work with engines, not yoga.
DOCTOR: Very good, Mr. Hartness. I see. That is somewhat limited. And I do note some discomfort with forward flexion. Now, if you would please lie flat on your back. I'm going to assess your reflexes. This will involve a gentle tap with a small hammer. It might be a little startling, but it shouldn’t be painful.
PATIENT: A hammer? Seriously? What is this, a cartoon? Just get it over with. But be careful, alright? I don’t want a concussion over a silly army exam. My wife would kill me.
DOCTOR: I assure you, Mr. Hartness, this is standard procedure. And it is a very gentle tap. I am assessing your neurological function. Your reflexes are… present, but slightly diminished bilaterally. Now, if you could turn your head to the left, and then to the right. I’m going to check your range of motion in your neck.
PATIENT: It’s a bit stiff. Been sleeping on a bad pillow, I reckon. Nothing to worry about. Always cracks a bit when I turn it. See? Perfectly normal. Just an old man creaking, that's all. Can we hurry this up now? Dinner’s getting cold.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Hartness. Now, I would like to listen to your heart and lungs. If you could take a deep breath in… and exhale. Your heart sounds are… regular. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had allergies. I work with grease and oil all day. Pretty sure I'm immune to everything by now. Just a tough Swede, that's all. Don’t need fancy pills or anything. Just want a paper saying I’m fit enough for the army. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Hartness, that is not too much to ask. However, based on my examination – the mild back pain, diminished reflexes, and slightly elevated blood pressure – I would recommend a few further investigations to rule out any underlying issues. Specifically, I suggest a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel. And, I must advise, given your blood pressure reading, a follow-up appointment with your primary care physician would be prudent.
PATIENT: Investigations? Further… what did you say? More tests? Look, I don't have time for all this fancy stuff. And a primary care… I don't have a primary care physician. Never needed one. I just get on with things. Is this going to stop me from joining the army? That's all I care about. Can I get the paper without all this… fuss? I’m a strong, healthy man. You can’t tell me a little backache and a number on a machine is going to disqualify me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your concern, however, I cannot, in good conscience, sign a medical clearance form without addressing these findings appropriately. It would be irresponsible. Your blood pressure, while not critically high, warrants further investigation. The back pain and diminished reflexes, while perhaps attributable to your occupation, require ruling out any neurological concerns. I can provide a preliminary assessment stating that you are currently able to perform physical tasks, pending the results of the blood work and a consultation with a primary care physician. However, a full clearance requires those additional steps. I can provide you with a referral to a primary care physician in the area. Would you like that?
PATIENT: A referral… look, I just… fine. Fine. A referral. But I'm telling you now, they're just going to tell me the same thing. I'm a perfectly healthy man. This is ridiculous. Just give me the paper for the blood work. And the referral. Let’s just get this over with. The sooner I get this done, the sooner I can get into the army and prove everyone wrong. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Hartness. Here is the blood work order and the referral to Dr. Anya Sharma. She is a highly-regarded physician in the area. Please schedule an appointment with her as soon as possible, and bring the results of the blood work with you. Once you have been evaluated by Dr. Sharma, and I have received her report, we can discuss a full medical clearance. I must reiterate, your health is my primary concern. Do you have any questions before you leave?
