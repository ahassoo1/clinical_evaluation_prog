DOCTOR: Right. Mrs. Sadhu, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Nadene Sadhu. Though most folks just call me Nadene. It’s nice to meet you, Doctor… Dechêne, wasn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, Dechêne. And please, just get straight to the point. What brings you in today, Mrs. Sadhu?
PATIENT: Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away. It’s been… oh, goodness, feels like months now. And with my heart, you know, I get worried. It feels… wetter, if that makes sense. Not just a little tickle, but a real cough.
DOCTOR: Months, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, months. Started… let me think… around April, I’d say. Right after that cold snap we had. Everyone was sniffly then. Mine just… lingered. And gotten worse, especially when I lie down flat to sleep. It wakes me up, keeps my husband up… well, it would if he was still here. But still, it’s a bother.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any… other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me see. I get a little breathless when I walk too far, but that’s usual for me, I suppose. And my ankles do swell up some in the evenings. But I've had that for years, too. Nothing new really, except for this cough. I do feel more tired than usual, maybe? But being 89, you get tired easily, you know?
DOCTOR: Tiredness is hardly a symptom, Mrs. Sadhu. Have you had a fever, chills, any chest pain?
PATIENT: Oh! No, no fever. Definitely not. And no chills, no. No chest pain, either. It doesn't hurt to cough, just… makes me feel weak afterwards. It’s more… annoying, truthfully. And worrying, because of my heart. Doctor told me years ago to watch out for anything that makes me breathe harder. I get confused sometimes, remembering everything the doctors told me over the years… it all blends together.
DOCTOR: Right. Let’s have a quick listen to your lungs then, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Whatever you think best, Doctor. I'm ready when you are. Though, be warned, I might shiver a little. My skin gets thin these days.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath… and again. Hmm. There’s some… congestion. And a slight wheeze. It’s not alarming, but it’s there. Do you use any oxygen at home?
PATIENT: Oxygen? No, never. I've never needed oxygen. Doctor Ramirez, back in… oh, goodness, 2018, I think it was, he said my levels were a little low sometimes, but he just told me to take it easy. Didn’t prescribe anything. Just rest. I mostly stay inside these days anyway. It’s hot out, you know. And I like my garden. I can see it from the window. Though I can't get out there as much anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to order a chest X-ray, just to rule out anything serious. And a basic blood test – just to check your overall health. And I’ll prescribe you an inhaler. It’s a mild bronchodilator, should help open up your airways. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… let me think. Not that I know of. Back when I was younger, they gave me penicillin once, and it made me itchy, but that was ages ago. I don’t recall having any trouble with anything else. Just the usual aches and pains, you know? And a little heartburn if I eat too much chocolate. Does chocolate count?
DOCTOR: No, Mrs. Sadhu, chocolate does not count. I'll write the prescriptions, and the nurse will explain the inhaler usage. We’ll get the X-ray results back within a few days. If anything concerning shows up, we’ll discuss further steps. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Well… no, not really. Just… will this inhaler help me sleep? That's what I'm really hoping for. Waking up coughing all night is awful. And I don’t want to bother the nice folks at the pharmacy with too many questions, they’re busy enough as it is. Is it alright if I just try it and see what happens?
DOCTOR: It may help with your breathing, which could improve sleep. But I cannot guarantee it will. Try it as directed, and if you’re not seeing improvement within a week, schedule a follow-up appointment. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. You've been very helpful. I appreciate your time. I'll let the nurse know I'm ready when she is. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Have a good day, Mrs. Sadhu. .
