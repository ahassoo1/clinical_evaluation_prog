DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Redfern. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. Look, to be honest, I barely remember making the appointment. Something about… not sleeping well? And, uh, getting a bit… soft around the edges, I suppose. My wife used to handle all this sort of thing. She had a real knack for knowing what I needed. It’s all a bit blurry, really. Just feeling… not quite right.
DOCTOR: I see. It sounds like you’re feeling a bit out of sorts and having some difficulty with sleep, and perhaps some changes in your body composition. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t recall all the details of the appointment; we can figure things out together. It’s also understandable that things feel different since your wife was handling these matters. To help me get a better understanding, could you tell me a little more about the sleep issue?
PATIENT: Right. “Out of sorts” is a good way to put it. Honestly, it's just… I wake up a lot. Not necessarily feeling tired, just… aware I’m awake. And then I’m thinking. Thinking about… things. Old things. New things. Doesn’t really matter. It’s not like I’m tossing and turning or anything. Just… lying there. For ages, probably. I haven’t really looked at the clock, if that makes sense. It’s not… restful, you know? And then getting up… feels like a chore.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. So, you're experiencing difficulty staying asleep, more than difficulty falling asleep, and it’s accompanied by a lot of thoughts that keep you awake. And it leaves you feeling unrefreshed in the morning. Is this something that’s been happening for a long time, or is it a more recent change?
PATIENT: Recent, I think. Though, honestly, time… it all sort of blurs together now. It started… after. After my wife. It was… rough. Still is, I guess. I used to be able to just… collapse and be done with it. Now… now my brain just seems to switch on. I wouldn’t say it’s every night, but it's enough to make me feel… well, not exactly bad, just… not right. And I’m sure it’s affecting things. I’ve put on weight, haven’t I? It’s… noticeable.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like this began after a very difficult loss, and it’s completely natural for grief to disrupt sleep and other aspects of your life. It's good that you’re recognizing these changes. It’s also very common for stress and grief to affect appetite and activity levels, which can lead to weight gain. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me approximately how long ago your wife passed away?
PATIENT: Ugh. Don’t make me think about that. It was… a year and a half, I think? Maybe a little more. Everything's a bit of a fog. We were married for… forty-two years. Forty-two years. And now… now it's just me. . Sorry. It's just… bringing it up. It’s always a bit of a shock, even now.
DOCTOR: I sincerely apologize for bringing it up if it’s causing you distress. It’s completely understandable that it’s still very painful, and you’re absolutely right to feel that shock. Forty-two years is a lifetime together. There’s no need to apologize for your feelings; I want you to know that I’m here to listen without judgment. So, to clarify, the sleep difficulties and weight gain started roughly a year and a half ago, after your wife passed away?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds about right. Before that… I slept like a log. Ate what I wanted, didn't worry about it. Now… it's all different. . I keep telling myself I should get more exercise, but… what's the point? It just feels… pointless, without her. We used to go for walks every morning. She'd drag me out, even when I didn’t feel like it. Now… I just stay inside. Fix instruments. That’s about it.
DOCTOR: I hear you. It sounds like your routine and motivation have been significantly impacted, and it's natural to feel that loss of purpose. Losing a partner of forty-two years is a monumental change, and it's understandable that it would affect your desire to engage in activities you once enjoyed together. To help me understand the bigger picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history? . Honestly? I can’t really… recall much. Nothing major, I don't think. I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, obviously. And a broken arm once, falling off a bicycle. Other than that… I’ve always been pretty healthy, I suppose. Bit of high blood pressure, the doctor said a few years back. Put me on some pills for it. I think I still take them. I’m not entirely sure, actually. My wife managed all that.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, tonsils out as a child, a broken arm, and high blood pressure managed with medication – though you’re unsure if you’re still taking it. We can definitely clarify that. Do you recall the name of the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Names… dates… numbers… they all just sort of… float around. She had a little chart, you know? In the kitchen. Everything neatly organized. I've tried looking for it, but… it's gone now. I think the kids took most of her things. Not that I blame them. They needed to sort through things. It's just… everything's a bit of a mess now. .
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s completely normal to feel overwhelmed and disorganized after such a significant loss, and it sounds like your wife was a very organized person who took care of many important details. Let’s not worry about the name of the medication right now. We can check your records to see what was prescribed, or we can do a quick blood pressure reading today. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? . No, not that I know of. Never had a problem with anything. My wife always made sure I wasn't taking anything I shouldn't. She was very careful. She’d read all the labels, ask the pharmacist… everything. I just… took what she gave me. Honestly, I'm rubbish with all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay. No known allergies, and you’ve never experienced any adverse reactions to medications. That’s good to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications at all, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Hmm... . I think… I might take something for my knee sometimes. It aches, especially when it's cold. But it's just… a little cream, I think. Rub it on. Can't remember the name of it either. It's in the bathroom cabinet, somewhere. One of those little tubes. My wife bought it for me. Probably years ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, you sometimes use a topical cream for your knee pain, but you don't recall the specific name. We'll make a note of that. Before we proceed, I'd like to ask a few questions about your family history, if you don't mind. Do you know if anyone in your family has a history of heart disease, diabetes, or other serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family history… . That's a tricky one. My parents are both gone now. And I wasn't very close to my siblings, if I’m honest. We didn’t really talk about… health stuff. My mother… she had some problems with her stomach, I think. But I don’t know what kind. And my father… he smoked a lot. But he lived to be eighty, so… I don’t know. It’s all a bit vague. I really don’t remember. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Redfern. It’s common for family medical history to be vague, especially if you weren’t close to your family or didn't discuss those topics. We can proceed without detailed information for now. Let's talk a little bit about your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Never smoked a day in my life. My wife hated it. And I don't drink, either. Never really got the appeal. And drugs? Good heavens, no. I’m a musician, not… that. . I fix instruments, remember? That’s enough excitement for me. Quiet life. That's what I always wanted.
DOCTOR: I see. So, no smoking, alcohol, or recreational drug use. You prefer a quiet life focused on your music. That's wonderful. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It will help me get a better understanding of your overall health. We'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your knee. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Whatever you need to do. . Though, I warn you, my knee's a bit… creaky. It’s been getting worse lately. It doesn’t hurt all the time, but… it’s just not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. We'll take our time. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That's slightly elevated. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. There's some mild swelling around the knee joint, and you do have a limited range of motion. It appears you have some crepitus with movement, indicating some cartilage wear. There's tenderness to palpation on the medial aspect of the joint. It doesn’t seem to be acutely inflamed, but it does suggest some osteoarthritis. Overall, your physical exam is relatively unremarkable, aside from the slightly elevated blood pressure and some findings consistent with osteoarthritis in your knee.
PATIENT: Osteo… what now? . Sounds… serious. Is it bad? Will I need an operation? My wife… she always said I should look after my knees. She was a dancer, you see. Knew all about that sort of thing. . It’s always something, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Osteoarthritis simply means there's some wear and tear on the cartilage in your knee joint. It's a common condition, especially as we get older, and it doesn't necessarily mean you'll need an operation. Many people manage it effectively with conservative treatments. It sounds like your wife was very knowledgeable about this condition. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I believe your sleep difficulties and weight gain are likely related to stress and grief following your wife’s passing, and the osteoarthritis in your knee is a separate issue that we can address with appropriate management. To get a clearer picture of your overall health, I'd like to order some basic blood work, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel to check your kidney and liver function, and a lipid panel to assess your cholesterol levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, alright. Whatever you think is best. Blood work… sounds… sensible. I suppose it's better to know, even if it's not good news. My wife always said prevention is better than cure. . Though, honestly, I don't know what "cure" even looks like anymore. Everything just feels… different now. .
DOCTOR: You’re right, prevention is always best. And you're right to acknowledge that things feel different. It's a major adjustment after such a loss. I'll write up the orders for the blood work, and the receptionist will schedule you for a visit with the lab. It's a simple blood draw that shouldn't take long. In the meantime, while we await the results, I'd like to discuss some strategies to help improve your sleep and overall well-being. Have you considered talking to a therapist or joining a grief support group?
PATIENT: Therapy? . Good heavens, no. I'm not one for… talking about my feelings. Always kept things bottled up. My wife… she was the talker. I was the listener. Besides, what good would it do? It won't bring her back, will it? . Support group… even worse. Surrounded by… sad people. No thank you. I prefer my own company, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s perfectly alright if therapy or a support group aren’t the right fit for you. It takes courage to be open about your feelings, and it’s important to do what feels comfortable. In that case, let's focus on some practical strategies you can implement on your own. Many people find that establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a relaxing bedtime routine, and engaging in gentle exercise can significantly improve their sleep quality. We could also discuss some relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation. Regarding your knee pain, we can start with some over-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or naproxen, and I can recommend some simple exercises to strengthen the muscles around your knee. Would you be open to trying those?
PATIENT: Exercises... . I suppose I could try. But I’m not very motivated, you see. Everything just feels… tiring. Still. If it might help… alright. Exercises and… pills. . Though, don’t expect miracles. I’m an old man, not a… a spring chicken.
DOCTOR: I don’t expect miracles either, Mr. Redfern. Small steps can make a big difference. We'll start slowly and focus on what you're comfortable with. I’ll write out a prescription for a short course of naproxen, and I’ll also provide you with a handout outlining some gentle knee exercises and relaxation techniques. I'd like to see you back in two weeks to review the blood work results and see how you’re doing with the exercises and pain relievers. In the meantime, if you experience any worsening of your symptoms or develop any new concerns, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. . It’s all a bit… overwhelming, really. All these pills and exercises and… talking about feelings. . But… thank you. For listening, I suppose. And for not… judging. That’s more than I expected. . I think I’ll just… go home now.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Redfern. I’m glad I could help. And please, don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Take your time getting home, and remember to be kind to yourself. It's alright to take things one step at a time. Here are the prescription and the exercise guide. .
