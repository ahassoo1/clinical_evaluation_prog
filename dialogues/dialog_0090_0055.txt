DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Ranells. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s about this medical marijuana. My daughter, bless her heart, she keeps going on about it. Says it’s the answer to everything. I just… I need to know if I qualify, I suppose. And frankly, I’d like to hear it from a professional and not her. She gets all her information online, you know. Dreadful place, the internet.
DOCTOR: Right. Medical marijuana. I see. And you’re wondering if it might be appropriate for you, and you’d like my assessment. Understandable. It is important to get information from a reliable source. Before we get into whether you "qualify," as you put it, let’s talk about what’s been going on with your health. What specifically are you hoping medical marijuana would help with?
PATIENT: Well, it's my joints, mostly. They ache something awful, especially when the weather changes. And I've always been a bit… restless at night. Can't seem to get a good, solid eight hours sleep, if you know what I mean. My daughter says it'll help with both. Honestly, I don't see how a plant could help, but she insists. It’s just… inconvenient, this pain. And tiring. Very tiring. I used to be quite the gardener, you see. Now… well, now I mostly sit.
DOCTOR: Joint pain and difficulty sleeping. And you’ve noticed it’s worse with weather changes. I understand. It's good you've identified a connection to the weather; that can be helpful. How long have you been experiencing this joint pain, Ms. Ranells?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Years now. At least ten, I’d say. It started slowly, just a little creakiness after a long day. But it's gotten progressively worse, naturally. Age, I suppose. My mother had it too, though she never did anything about it. Just… suffered. I'm not particularly fond of suffering, if I’m honest. It's not dignified.
DOCTOR: Ten years. And has this pain limited your ability to do things you enjoy?
PATIENT: Limited? Oh, profoundly. As I said, I used to spend hours in my garden. Now, I can manage a few minutes weeding, perhaps, but that's about it. And the stairs! Don’t even mention the stairs. My husband, bless his soul, does most of the heavy lifting these days. I used to be perfectly capable, you know. A very independent woman. It's… humiliating, really. Relying on others. And the sleep… the lack of sleep makes everything so much harder. I just feel… worn out. Constantly.
DOCTOR: I understand. Significant limitation of activities and disruption of sleep. Has a doctor ever given you a diagnosis for this joint pain, Ms. Ranells?
PATIENT: Well, Dr. Hemmings, back in ’18, he said it was arthritis. Something about the joints wearing down. He gave me some pills, little white ones, but they didn’t do much, and frankly, they upset my stomach. I stopped taking them after a few weeks. Didn't see much point, if they weren't helping and were making me feel worse. Honestly, I prefer to just… live with it, rather than take a lot of unnecessary medications. I've never been one for fussing.
DOCTOR: Arthritis diagnosed in 2018, medication poorly tolerated. And you discontinued it due to side effects. I see. Now, have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. A bit of high blood pressure, the doctor said, but it's well-controlled with a little pill each morning. Nothing major. And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, hence these spectacles, but that's just age, again. I'm generally a healthy woman, you see. Always have been. I eat my vegetables, don't smoke, hardly ever drink… I just… ache. And I can’t sleep. That's the sum total of my complaints, really. It's just… inconvenient. A terribly inconvenient situation.
DOCTOR: Alright. High blood pressure, managed with medication. Otherwise generally healthy. Now, Ms. Ranells, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Well, my mother had the arthritis, as I mentioned. And her mother, too, I believe. It was very common on that side of the family. My father's side… they mostly died of old age, if you know what I mean. Heart trouble, a bit, with my uncle, but nothing particularly noteworthy. No one ever mentioned anything about… well, mental illness, or anything like that. A very sensible family, mostly. Practical people. Not prone to… flights of fancy.
DOCTOR: Family history of arthritis. Sensible, practical family. Alright. And finally, before we move on, are you currently taking any other medications, supplements, or vitamins besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Just the little pink pill for my blood pressure. I tried a vitamin D supplement a few years back, my daughter suggested it, but I didn't notice any difference, so I stopped taking it. I don't particularly like swallowing pills, if I'm honest. It’s a rather unpleasant sensation. And I don't believe in wasting money on things that don’t work. A sensible approach, I think.
DOCTOR: Very sensible. Now, Ms. Ranells, I’m going to perform a brief physical exam to assess your joints, range of motion, and overall condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Get on with it, then. I haven't got all day, you know. Although, admittedly, I don't have anywhere terribly important to be. Still, I prefer efficiency. And I'd like to know, sooner rather than later, if this medical marijuana is a viable option. Frankly, I'm rather skeptical, but I’m willing to be proven wrong. If it can alleviate this… inconvenience, I suppose it's worth a try. Just please, be quick about it. My knees aren't what they used to be, and bending them excessively is rather… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just sit here. We'll start with your knees. I'll need you to bend them for me, as comfortably as you can, and I'll assess the range of motion and look for any swelling or tenderness. I understand your discomfort, and we'll go slowly. Now, tell me, on a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what is your pain level right now, just sitting here?
PATIENT: Oh, it fluctuates, naturally. Right now… I’d say a three. A mild ache, mostly. Nothing debilitating, but it’s always there, you know? A constant reminder. And it gets worse with movement, of course. I can feel it building already, just having you poke around. It's not sharp, mind you, just… nagging. An insistent ache. Not a pleasant sensation, I assure you. And it’s worse on damp days, or when it's cold. I can feel a storm coming in my joints, you know. An old woman's ailment, I suppose. But it's real, nonetheless. A three, definitely a three. And likely rising.
DOCTOR: I do notice some crepitus with movement, Ms. Ranells. That’s the grinding sensation you may be feeling. Now, let's have a look at your hips. Can you lie down on the table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, my hips. Another source of misery. Fine. Fine. This isn't terribly comfortable, you know. My bones aren’t as pliable as they used to be. And I haven't got the stamina for much maneuvering. Just be quick, please. I haven’t had a proper nap all week. And this poking and prodding isn’t conducive to relaxation, I assure you. Not at all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ranells. Just a few more movements. I'm noticing some mild discomfort with internal rotation of the hip. And I also notice some tenderness to palpation around the greater trochanter. Now, can you try and stand up slowly for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… strenuous. My knees protested rather loudly, I must say. And my back isn't thanking me, either. Honestly, I feel like I've aged ten years in the last five minutes. I really should be resting. I suspect I’ve overdone it, just coming here. And all this poking and prodding hasn’t helped, naturally. Just a terrible strain on the system. Are we almost finished? I really would like to sit down. Preferably in a comfortable chair, with a cup of tea. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Ranells, just let me get a chair for you. Okay. Now, based on my examination, it appears you have osteoarthritis affecting your knees and hips. This is consistent with your history of chronic joint pain, crepitus, and limited range of motion. The discomfort with internal rotation of the hip also points towards this. It’s a common condition, especially as we age. Now, regarding medical marijuana... it can provide some symptomatic relief for osteoarthritis pain, particularly for pain and stiffness. However, it’s not a cure, and it doesn’t work for everyone. There are also potential side effects and risks, which we need to discuss. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Osteoarthritis. Just what I suspected. Always knew something wasn't quite right. And yes, I suppose I had read something about that. It explains the… creaking. And the stiffness. And the relentless ache. Now, this medical marijuana… side effects, you say? What sort of side effects? I'm not keen on becoming… confused, or anything like that. I have my faculties, thank you very much. And I don’t want to become… dependent on it, either. My daughter mentioned something about… paranoia. Is that common? And what about interactions with my blood pressure pill? I don’t want to add another ailment to the list. Honestly, it all sounds rather… complicated. Perhaps it’s best to just stick with the ache. It's inconvenient, yes, but manageable.
DOCTOR: Those are very valid concerns, Ms. Ranells. Regarding side effects, some of the more common ones include drowsiness, dizziness, dry mouth, and a change in appetite. Confusion is less common, but it can occur, especially in older adults. Paranoia can occur, but it's usually with higher doses, or in individuals with a predisposition to anxiety. Regarding interactions with your blood pressure pill… there is a potential for interaction. Marijuana can sometimes lower blood pressure, which could potentially exacerbate the effects of your medication. This is why it's crucial to monitor your blood pressure closely if you decide to try it. Before we proceed, I would like to discuss other treatment options as well. Physical therapy, weight management , and over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen are all viable options. We can also consider a cortisone injection into your joints for temporary relief. Do you have any questions about those options?
PATIENT: Cortisone injections… I’ve heard mixed reviews about those. My neighbour, Ethel, she had one in her knee, and it was wonderful for a few weeks, but then the pain came back, worse than before. And she ended up needing a knee replacement. Not terribly encouraging. Physical therapy… I suppose that's sensible. But it sounds rather strenuous. My knees aren’t what they used to be, you know. And frankly, I’m not particularly motivated to contort myself into uncomfortable positions. As for these over-the-counter pain relievers… I’ve tried acetaminophen before. Didn’t do much. And ibuprofen… well, it upsets my stomach. Always has. So, it seems we're back to square one. Perhaps this medical marijuana… despite the risks… is worth considering. But I want to be clear. I don’t want to become dependent on it. And I certainly don’t want to become confused. And my blood pressure must be monitored. Closely. Can you guarantee those things?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation and concerns, Ms. Ranells. I can’t guarantee those things, no. Every individual responds differently to medication, and there’s always a degree of risk involved. However, I can take steps to minimize those risks. If you decide to try medical marijuana, we’ll start with a very low dose and gradually increase it as needed. I’ll closely monitor your response for any side effects or changes in your condition. I’ll also recommend regular blood pressure checks and discuss potential interactions with your medication. It’s also important to be aware of the potential for dependence and to use it responsibly. I will also refer you to a physical therapist for a consultation. They can assess your condition and develop a personalized exercise program to help improve your strength and flexibility. Ultimately, the decision is yours. If you’re not comfortable with the risks, we can explore other treatment options. We can also consider a referral to an orthopaedic surgeon for a consultation to discuss potential surgical options. Would you like me to schedule those referrals?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. This is all rather… complicated, isn't it? A physical therapist… alright, schedule a consultation. But I don’t want to be pushed into anything strenuous. And the orthopaedic surgeon… perhaps, but not yet. Let's see how the physical therapy goes. And the medical marijuana… alright. Let’s try it. A low dose, you said? And close monitoring. And blood pressure checks. Yes. That’s what I want. Close monitoring. And you must promise me… if I start to feel confused, or paranoid, or anything like that… we stop immediately. Is that understood? Absolutely no tolerance for confusion. Or paranoia. I have my faculties, thank you very much. Alright. Let’s get this process started. But slowly. Very slowly. And with a lot of monitoring. And absolutely no confusion.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No confusion. We'll proceed very slowly, with close monitoring. I’ll write you a referral for a medical marijuana card and also schedule a follow-up appointment for two weeks from today to assess your response. At that appointment, we'll discuss the appropriate dosage and potential side effects, and address any concerns you may have. I’ll also give you a list of resources about medical marijuana, including information about responsible use and potential risks. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. Just… try to make the process as painless as possible, if you don't mind. I’m not terribly fond of medical procedures, you see. And please, remind me to check my blood pressure regularly. I have a tendency to forget things these days. Alright then. Let's get this over with. And thank you, Doctor. For your patience. I know I’ve been a bit… demanding. But I just want to feel better. That's all. Just… better.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Ranells. It's my job to help you feel better, and I’ll do everything I can. I understand your concerns, and I’ll make sure the process is as smooth and comfortable as possible. I’ll remind you about the blood pressure checks at your next appointment, and feel free to call the office if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. Now, let's get these referrals processed, and we'll schedule your follow-up appointment.
