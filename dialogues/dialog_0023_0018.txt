DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verbos. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… rather embarrassing, actually. I seem to be going to the restroom quite a lot. More than usual, you understand. It’s been going on for a bit now, and I thought it best to have it checked. I don’t recall exactly when it started, to be honest. It just… gradually became more frequent.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. There’s no need to be embarrassed; it’s quite common, and we'll get to the bottom of it. “Increased urinary frequency” – that’s what you're experiencing. You said “more than usual.” Can you quantify that for me?
PATIENT: Quantify… oh dear. That’s a precise word, isn’t it? Let me see… usually, I’d go perhaps… three, maybe four times a day? Now… it feels like every couple of hours. Perhaps six, seven times? It’s difficult to be certain. I don’t really keep track of these things, you see. It’s just… noticeable. And disruptive, if I’m being frank.
DOCTOR: Six to seven times a day is certainly a change from three or four. And you've noticed this happening gradually. Are you experiencing any pain or burning sensation when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain… no, not exactly pain. There’s no sharp discomfort, thankfully. Sometimes, a little bit of… a sort of urgency, perhaps? A strong need to go, quite suddenly. But not a burning sensation, no. It’s more… an inconvenience, really. Though I suppose if one had to describe it, I'd say it feels… incomplete, sometimes. Like I haven’t quite emptied everything. Does that make sense? I apologize if I’m being vague.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Verbos. “Urgency” and “incomplete emptying” – noted. Have you noticed any change in the color or odor of your urine?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Color and odor… I haven’t paid particular attention, I’m afraid. I simply… go. I suppose it looks… normal? Pale yellow, as urine usually does? I certainly haven’t noticed anything unusual. And no, no strong odors that I’m aware of. I’m really not one for scrutinizing such things, Doctor. I apologize for my lack of… detail. I’m not a very observant man, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever… no, I haven’t felt feverish. No chills either. And my abdomen… well, no pain that I’ve noticed. Occasionally a little… discomfort, perhaps, but nothing significant. I do get a bit of indigestion sometimes, but I attribute that to my rather… haphazard diet. I travel quite a bit for work, you see, and it’s difficult to maintain a proper schedule. It's likely just that, I assure you. I wouldn't want to trouble you with my digestive issues.
DOCTOR: Mr. Verbos, while your diet may be a factor, we need to rule out other possibilities. Let’s move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes, prostate problems, or any urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Oh, my… Now you're asking about things I haven't thought about in years! Diabetes… I don’t believe so. My family history isn't particularly strong for it, as far as I recall. Prostate… I had a check-up some years ago, but nothing specific was ever mentioned. And urinary tract infections… I had one as a young man, perhaps? A very unpleasant experience, but that was… decades ago. I’m afraid my memory isn't what it used to be. I apologize for being so… unhelpful. I truly don’t recall much detail about any of these things. Is there a way to… check these records, perhaps? Would that be possible?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Verbos, we can certainly review your records. Just give me a moment… It appears you had a general physical exam in 2018 with your previous physician, Dr. Anya Petrova. The notes indicate a normal prostate exam at that time, no mention of diabetes, and no history of recurrent UTIs. However, this was several years ago. Do you currently take any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good to know about Dr. Petrova's exam. A relief, certainly. Medications… let me see. I take a daily multivitamin, I suppose that counts? And occasionally, an antacid for my indigestion. Just when it flares up, you understand. Nothing regular. And no, nothing else. I try to avoid medication whenever possible. I prefer a more… natural approach, if you will. I don't believe in filling my body with unnecessary chemicals. Does that answer your question, Doctor? I hope I’m not being too difficult.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly fine, Mr. Verbos. Now, before we proceed, let’s talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Absolutely not. Never have. Never will. My father was a smoker, you see, and it was… a rather unpleasant experience for the whole family. A terrible habit. I’ve always steered clear of it. I consider myself quite health-conscious, despite my… haphazard diet. I do enjoy a good glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, but that’s hardly a vice, is it? I assure you, Doctor, I take good care of myself, all things considered.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. Given your symptoms—increased urinary frequency with urgency and incomplete emptying—and considering your medical history and lifestyle, a few possibilities come to mind. It could be an overactive bladder, a urinary tract infection, or, less likely given your history, an issue with your prostate. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to perform a brief physical exam, including abdominal palpation and a digital rectal exam. We’ll also need a urinalysis to check for infection. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds… sensible. I trust your judgment. A physical exam and a urinalysis… of course. I suppose it’s the only way to be certain. The digital rectal exam… is unavoidable, I presume? It’s not a particularly pleasant thought, but I understand it’s necessary. Yes, please. Let’s proceed. I'm ready when you are. Though, if you wouldn't mind explaining the process beforehand, I'd be grateful. I confess, I get a bit… anxious about these things.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Verbos. I understand your apprehension. The abdominal palpation is quite straightforward; I'll simply be pressing gently on your abdomen to check for any tenderness or enlargement. The digital rectal exam, as you mentioned, involves a gloved, lubricated finger inserted into your rectum to assess the size and consistency of your prostate gland and check for any abnormalities. It's a quick procedure, usually takes less than a minute, and while it can be slightly uncomfortable, it shouldn’t be painful. I’ll explain everything as I go. First, if you could lie down on the exam table, face up. We'll start with the abdominal palpation.
PATIENT: Very well, Doctor. I’m ready, as I can be, I suppose. Please, do explain as you go. I find it… reassuring to know what to expect. And perhaps, a distraction would be helpful? If you don’t mind my asking. Something to take my mind off… the process. Though, I understand if that’s not possible. Just… please be gentle. And quick, if you would. I apologize for being such a… worry.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. I'm just going to press gently here and here. Let me know if you feel any tenderness or discomfort. I’m not feeling any obvious masses or tenderness at this time. Your abdomen is soft, which is good. Now, we'll move on to the digital rectal exam. I'm going to ask you to bend your knees and lean forward slightly. It may feel a bit of pressure, but it shouldn't be painful. Just try to relax.
PATIENT: Right… I'm ready, I think. Just… be quick, please. And… explain as you go, as you promised. It’s… rather unpleasant, this whole experience. I’m trying to relax, truly, but it’s… difficult. My apologies for my… apprehension. I’ve never been particularly fond of medical examinations. I feel… vulnerable, I suppose. Just… get it over with quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos. I'm feeling your prostate gland now. It's slightly enlarged, but smooth and symmetrical. There are no obvious nodules or areas of tenderness. That’s… moderately reassuring. Okay, we’re finished with the exam. Please sit up when you’re ready. Now, we'll need a urine sample. I’ll give you a cup and instructions. It will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Finished… thank goodness. Slightly enlarged, you say? Is that… concerning? And no nodules… that’s good, I presume? A urine sample… yes, of course. I’ll… just go and take care of that now. Please… let it be nothing serious. It’s likely just… my age, isn’t it? A simple matter of getting older.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Verbos, I have your urinalysis results back. It shows a slight elevation in white blood cells, which could indicate some inflammation, but no sign of a bacterial infection. The prostate exam revealed a mildly enlarged prostate, which is common for men your age, but thankfully, no nodules or areas of tenderness. Given your symptoms—increased urinary frequency, urgency, incomplete emptying—and the mild inflammation, I suspect you may be experiencing benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. It’s not cancer, and it’s not an infection, which is good. However, it can cause these frustrating urinary symptoms. We can discuss treatment options, which range from lifestyle modifications to medication. Would you like me to explain those options to you now?
PATIENT: Not cancer… that’s… profoundly reassuring. Truly. And not an infection… good, good. BPH… benign prostatic hyperplasia… I’ve… heard of it, I think. Something to do with the prostate growing larger with age? Treatment options… yes, please. I would very much appreciate it if you would explain those options to me. Lifestyle modifications… medication… what does that entail? Are there any… side effects? I’m rather cautious about taking medication, as you know. I just want to be able to… function normally again. It’s becoming rather… disruptive, this whole situation.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Verbos. As you mentioned, BPH means the prostate gland enlarges with age. As it grows, it can press on the urethra—the tube that carries urine out of the bladder—causing these urinary symptoms. Lifestyle modifications include limiting fluid intake, especially before bedtime, avoiding caffeine and alcohol, and practicing pelvic floor exercises—also known as Kegel exercises—to strengthen the muscles that support the bladder and urethra. Medication options include alpha-blockers, which relax the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, improving urine flow. These typically work quickly but can cause dizziness or lightheadedness as a side effect. Another option is 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, which shrink the prostate gland over time. These take longer to work but have fewer immediate side effects, though they can sometimes affect sexual function. We can start with lifestyle modifications and see if that provides relief. If not, we can discuss medication options in more detail, weighing the potential benefits and risks. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Lifestyle modifications… limiting fluids… avoiding caffeine… I suppose that’s… reasonable. I can try that. Pelvic floor exercises… Kegel exercises… I’ve heard of those too. A bit… embarrassing, perhaps, but if it helps… I can certainly attempt them. Medication… I’m rather hesitant about that. Dizziness… lightheadedness… affecting sexual function… those sound… unpleasant. Perhaps we should start with the lifestyle modifications, as you suggested. See if that provides some relief. I’d prefer to avoid medication for as long as possible. And… what if those don’t work? What happens then? Is surgery an option? I confess, I’m rather anxious about all of this.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Verbos. Starting with lifestyle modifications is a sensible approach. It’s often the first line of defense, and many men experience significant improvement with these changes alone. If those don’t provide adequate relief, we can discuss medication options in more detail. As for surgery, it’s generally reserved for more severe cases that don’t respond to other treatments. There are several surgical options available, including transurethral resection of the prostate, or TURP, which involves removing excess prostate tissue through the urethra. There are also less invasive procedures, such as laser therapy or prostate artery embolization. However, surgery carries its own risks and potential complications, so it’s not something we’d consider lightly. For now, let’s focus on the lifestyle modifications. I’ll provide you with a handout outlining these changes in detail. I also recommend keeping a bladder diary—tracking your fluid intake and urination frequency—to help us monitor your progress. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in a month to see how you’re doing. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: A month… yes, that sounds… reasonable. A follow-up appointment. A bladder diary… tracking my intake and frequency… I can certainly do that. It feels… proactive, at least. Taking control of the situation. A handout outlining the changes… yes, please. I appreciate your thoroughness, Doctor. It’s… reassuring to know that there are options. And that surgery is a last resort. I’ll do my best to follow your recommendations. Limit fluids… avoid caffeine… and the… exercises. Thank you, Doctor Versace. For your time… and your patience. I feel… less anxious now. Perhaps I can finally get a good night’s sleep. I believe that will be all for today. .
