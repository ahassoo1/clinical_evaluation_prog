DOCTOR: Right, Odell Tayar. 22, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah... that's... right. Twenty-two. Look, I just need... something for travel. Going back home, you know? Nepal. It’s… far.
DOCTOR: Nepal. Right. And what exactly is “something for travel”?
PATIENT: Ugh. It’s… hard to explain. My wife… she wanted to go. We planned it. Now… I just need to go. Get… the shots, I guess? What people get before going to… places. She always took care of these things. I don’t… remember the names. Things for… sickness, yeah? Before you get sick. Is that enough?
DOCTOR: “Things for sickness”?
PATIENT: Look, it’s important, okay? Nepal isn’t… clean. Lots of bugs. And… well, things. My wife always got everything. Yellow… something? And… another one. She had a card. A little yellow card. I think you need to know these things. It was very… official looking. Now it’s… gone. Just tell me what I need, alright? Don’t need a lecture.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Let’s see… you’re looking at travel vaccinations. I'm seeing no record of previous vaccinations on file. Height and weight are… concerning, frankly. 155cm, 104lbs?
PATIENT: Hey! What’s that supposed to mean? I’m… fine. Small, yeah, but I work! I build airplane parts. It's hard work, okay? Don’t need you pointing things out. Just… the shots. That's all. Is it many? My wife... she didn't like needles.
DOCTOR: Well, “fine” and healthy are two different things. Being underweight can impact your immune system. Anyway... Nepal. Depending on where in Nepal, and what you'll be doing, the recommended vaccinations include Typhoid, Hepatitis A, and… potentially Yellow Fever. You said airplane parts?
PATIENT: Yellow... yes! That’s the one my wife got. And… Typhoid? Sounds… bad. I’m just going to Kathmandu. To… her family. Not going hiking or anything. Just Kathmandu. How many of these do I need? And will they make me sick? I have to go… I don't have much time.
DOCTOR: Kathmandu… alright. Yellow Fever isn’t generally required for Kathmandu, unless you’re traveling from a country with risk of Yellow Fever transmission. But considering your… lack of records, and the possibility you’ll be moving around, it's safest to get it. Typhoid is recommended. Hepatitis A, definitely. We'll do a quick physical exam to ensure you're fit for vaccination. And no, they won't give you the illness, but you may experience some mild side effects. Let’s start with your temperature and blood pressure.
PATIENT: Ugh… fine. Temperature and blood pressure, whatever. But quick, alright? I really don’t have time for… all this. Just tell me when I can get the… the things. And how much it will cost. My wife… she always handled all this. I just want to go home. Is this private insurance okay? I have a card somewhere...
DOCTOR: Insurance is fine. Let’s get this over with. Blood pressure cuff, please. And please, try to relax. It makes everything easier.
PATIENT: Easy for you to say. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time. And I don’t like being touched. Just...get it over with. Quickly. It’s just… a lot. And it reminds me… Nevermind. Just… the blood pressure thing.
DOCTOR: Right. Blood pressure. 110 over 70. Not terrible. Pulse is… 72. A bit fast, probably due to anxiety. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out. Lungs are clear. Now, open your mouth… say “ah.” No obvious signs of illness. Alright. You're physically fit for the vaccinations. Let's get this scheduled.
PATIENT: Okay...good. So… I get them all today? All three? And how long will it take? I have to arrange… things. Plane tickets, getting to the airport… It’s all very complicated. Will I feel sick afterward? I really can't be sick.
DOCTOR: Yes, all three today. It’s best to get them done at once, to be protected as quickly as possible. It will take about 30 minutes, including observation time. You may experience some mild fever, fatigue, or soreness at the injection site, but it shouldn't be debilitating. And if you develop anything more severe, you’ll need to seek medical attention. Now, let’s see… the cost for all three vaccinations will be… $450. Do you have a method of payment?
PATIENT: Four...$450?! That's...a lot. My wife...she always got a discount. Is there no discount? Look, I don’t… I didn’t expect it to be so much. Can I pay with… card? Is credit card okay? I really need to get these shots. But that's a lot of money. I might have to… call someone.
DOCTOR: A discount?
PATIENT: Look, it’s… complicated, alright? She had connections. Friends. People who… helped. I don’t have connections! I just build airplane parts. I don’t understand all this… health stuff. Is there anything… cheaper? Any options? I really need to go home. Is it possible to pay in… installments? Please.
DOCTOR: Installments?
PATIENT: Ugh! Look, can we just skip all this? I need the shots. I have the money… somewhere. I can call someone… right now. To… transfer it. But I need to know, will I be protected? Will I be okay? Is it safe? My wife... she never worried about all this. She just… took care of it. Please, just tell me I’ll be safe. And how long do I have to stay here? I have a flight to catch, eventually.
DOCTOR: Look, I understand you're stressed, but I need you to calm down. The vaccinations are safe, and effective, but they aren't a magic shield. There’s always a small risk of side effects. It will take about 30 minutes, during which time we will monitor you. I'm not responsible if you develop a reaction after you leave. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Ugh! Fine! Okay, yes, that’s clear. Thirty minutes. No magic shield. I get it. Just… get them done. Please. Don't need a lecture, don't need details. Just… do it. And… don't touch me too much. It's... a problem. Is that so hard? Just… the needles. Please hurry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Nurse, prepare the vaccinations. And please, be quick about it. He seems… anxious. And try to relax. The longer you tense up, the more it will hurt. Now, roll up your sleeve. .
