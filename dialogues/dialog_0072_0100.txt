DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hembrey, was it? It’s nice to meet you as well. Land sakes, what did bring me in… now let me think. Something about a test, I believe? A screening… for something. My memory ain’t what it used to be, you see. It’s the… the insurance, I think. Medicare wanted me to get it done. Something about making sure I’m… okay.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hughston, I see here that Medicare recommended a routine screening. It appears it’s for colorectal cancer. It’s a very important test, even if it is a bit unpleasant. But before we discuss that specifically, could you tell me a little bit about why you felt you needed to come in today?
PATIENT: Colorectal… oh dear. Sounds serious. Honestly, Doctor, I don’t feel like I needed to come in. Not really. I mostly just do what they tell me to do, you know? Medicare sends a letter, the nice lady at the office makes an appointment… and here I am. I feel fine, mostly. A little tired sometimes, but who doesn’t? I haven’t noticed anything… unusual, if that makes sense. Is this test something they just do for people my age?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hughston, it is a test often recommended for individuals over the age of 50 as a preventative measure. However, simply because you “feel fine” doesn’t necessarily mean everything is as it should be. Colorectal cancer often presents with very few noticeable symptoms in its early stages. That's precisely why screening is so crucial. Before we proceed with discussing the test options, let’s just go through a brief medical history, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. That makes sense, I suppose. It's good to be careful. A preventative thing... right. Let me think... medical conditions… Hmm. Well, my hips bother me somethin’ awful, especially when it’s cold. The doctor gave me some pills for that a few years back, but I don’t take ‘em much anymore, they didn’t really help. And I had a bad bout of pneumonia when my husband was sick… oh, that was awful. Aside from that… nothin’ major that I can recall. I've always been a pretty healthy person, really. Worked hard all my life, out in the sun, you know? Paving roads, mostly. Is that important?
DOCTOR: The hip pain and history of pneumonia are noted, Ms. Hughston. And yes, your work history is relevant. Prolonged sun exposure can, unfortunately, increase your risk for certain conditions. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Oh, let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a little girl, I remember that bein’ scary. And… oh yes! When I broke my wrist a long time ago, fallin’ off a ladder. They put a cast on it for weeks. Aside from those two… I don’t think so. No, I’m pretty sure that’s it. I’ve been lucky, I guess. I always figured hard work kept me healthy enough to avoid most of that.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Hughston. That's helpful. Now, could you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… Land sakes, that’s a tough one. My mama… she passed away when I was young, from somethin’ with her heart, I think. My daddy lived a long life, but he smoked like a chimney. He had… lung trouble towards the end. And my brother, bless his soul, he had diabetes. Aside from that… nothin’ real serious that I can recall. We weren’t a family that talked a lot about illnesses, you know? Just kinda dealt with things as they came. Does that help? Is there somethin’ specific you’re lookin’ for?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hughston, that is helpful. Heart trouble, lung issues, and diabetes are all relevant. Now, just a few more questions, then we can discuss the colorectal cancer screening. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Let me think. No, I don’t think so. I mean, I’ve never had a bad reaction to anythin’ the doctor’s given me. I get a little itchy sometimes with bee stings, but that’s just a normal reaction, right? Not a real allergy. Aside from that… no, I don’t think I’m allergic to anythin’. I can eat just about anything, which is probably why I’m a little… wider around the middle these days!
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no. I don't like takin' pills if I can help it. Just a little bit of ibuprofen now and then for my hips when they’re really botherin’ me, but that’s it. And sometimes a little vitamin D in the winter, ‘cause I don’t get out in the sun much then. But that’s it, truly. I try to stay natural, you know? Don’t believe in loadin’ up on a bunch of chemicals.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Hughston. Now, regarding the colorectal cancer screening… there are a few options available. The most common is a colonoscopy, which involves inserting a flexible tube with a camera into the rectum to visualize the colon. It requires bowel preparation beforehand, which can be… unpleasant. There's also a stool-based test, which you can do at home, but if that test comes back positive, you'll still need a colonoscopy. Do you have any questions about these options before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh dear. A tube with a camera… that doesn’t sound very nice at all. And bowel preparation? That definitely doesn’t sound nice. The stool test sounds a lot better, to be honest. Less… invasive. But you said if that one’s positive, I still have to do the other one? What does “positive” even mean? Is that bad? I’m gettin’ a little nervous now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hughston, it’s understandable to be nervous. A “positive” stool test means that blood was detected in your stool, which could indicate the presence of polyps or, less commonly, cancer. It doesn’t automatically mean you have cancer, but it does warrant further investigation with a colonoscopy. The stool test, while less invasive, is also less sensitive than a colonoscopy. It may not detect all polyps. A colonoscopy is the gold standard for detection and removal of polyps, which can prevent cancer from developing. Given your history and age, I recommend a colonoscopy. However, I understand your reluctance. We can discuss the stool test as an initial screening, but I must emphasize that it may require follow-up with a colonoscopy regardless. Which option would you prefer at this time?
PATIENT: Land sakes… this is all a bit much, Doctor. Polyps… cancer… it’s a scary thought. Honestly, I don’t know what to do. I really don’t want to have a tube put… there. But you’re right, I don’t want to ignore somethin’ serious either. If I have to do one eventually, maybe it’s best to just get it over with and do the colonoscopy now? But… could you explain what it’s like? I need to know what I’m gettin’ myself into. And what kind of preparation are we talkin’ about? The less I know, the more anxious I get, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Hughston, I understand your anxiety. It’s perfectly reasonable to be apprehensive. The colonoscopy itself is typically painless, as you will be sedated. You will lie on your side, and a flexible tube with a camera is gently inserted into your rectum and advanced through your colon. The procedure usually takes about 30-60 minutes. The bowel preparation is the least pleasant part. It involves drinking a large volume of a special liquid to completely clear your colon. This is necessary to ensure the doctor can see the colon lining clearly. There are different preparation options available, and we can discuss which one might be most tolerable for you. It will cause frequent bowel movements, and it’s important to stay hydrated. We have a detailed information packet with everything you need to know about the procedure and preparation. I can also have a nurse go over it with you in detail. Before we proceed, however, I need to confirm your medical history again. Have you ever had any issues with bleeding or blood clots?
PATIENT: Bleeding… Let me think. No, not really. I bruise easily, but that’s just part of gettin’ older, I reckon. And when I had my tonsils out, there was some bleedin’ afterwards, but the doctor stopped it pretty quick. Aside from that… no, no major bleedin’ problems. And blood clots… no, I don’t think so. I’ve never been told I had anythin’ like that. My legs swell a little sometimes, but that’s just from standin’ on my feet all day. Honestly, Doctor, all this talk is makin’ my head spin. But… I guess if you think it’s best to do the colonoscopy, I’m willin’ to try. Just… please explain everything real slow, and make sure I know what to expect. And maybe that nurse… yeah, that would be real helpful.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Hughston. I will have the nurse, Sarah, come in and discuss the procedure and preparation with you in detail. She can answer any questions you have and provide you with written instructions. We will schedule the colonoscopy for a date that works best for you. In the meantime, I want to reiterate that this is a preventative measure. Early detection is key in treating colorectal cancer, and we are taking the necessary steps to ensure your health and well-being. Do you have any questions for me before Sarah arrives?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Will they tell me if they find somethin’ right away? Or do I have to wait for results? And… will it hurt afterwards? I’ve heard stories… And one last thing… will it affect my Medicare coverage? I don’t want to get a big bill for somethin’ I can’t afford.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Ms. Hughston. We will discuss the initial findings with you immediately after the procedure. However, a definitive diagnosis typically requires a biopsy, which takes a few days to process. We will contact you with the results as soon as they are available. As for discomfort afterwards, you may experience some bloating and gas, and possibly mild cramping. This is usually temporary and can be managed with over-the-counter remedies. Rarely, there can be more significant discomfort, but that is uncommon. Regarding your Medicare coverage, this procedure is covered as a preventative screening. You may have a small copay or deductible, depending on your specific plan, but we will verify your coverage beforehand and provide you with an estimate of your out-of-pocket costs. Our billing department is happy to answer any questions you have. Sarah should be here shortly. In the meantime, try to relax. We will take good care of you.
PATIENT: Alright… thank you, Doctor. You’ve eased my mind a little, I reckon. I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything so slow. I still don’t like the sound of it, but… I guess it’s better to know, right? I’ll just try to take a deep breath and get through it. I’ll be waitin’ for Sarah.
