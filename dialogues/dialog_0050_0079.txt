DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. I am Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It says here you're 47 years old. Thank you for coming in today. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Yeah, that’s right, 47. Um, it’s my bruising. It’s just…worse lately. I’m on a blood thinner, and I keep getting these big bruises, even from little bumps. It's kinda worrying me, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I see. Bruising, and you attribute it to being on a blood thinner. And you've noticed it's worsening recently, even with minimal trauma. How long have you been on the blood thinner, Ms. Hainley?
PATIENT: About… almost two years now, I think. It was right after my… well, after the blood clot in my leg. They put me on it to prevent another one. I can get you the exact date if you need it, I remember when it was, it was right before my niece's wedding.
DOCTOR: No, no, that’s quite alright. We can certainly verify the start date through your records. But for now, two years is a good starting point. And are you experiencing any other symptoms in addition to the bruising?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but I figured that was just… life, you know? No pain, no bleeding that isn't from the bruises, nothing like that. I haven’t noticed any swelling either.
DOCTOR: Alright. No other bleeding, no swelling, just increased bruising and some fatigue. And you haven’t experienced any unusual bleeding from your gums, nosebleeds, or blood in your stool or urine?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. Everything else seems… normal. It's just the bruises are getting bigger and showing up easier. I bumped my arm on the table yesterday, and already there’s a purple spot starting. It's a little scary.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Hainley. It is important to investigate unexplained bruising, particularly while on anticoagulation. Now, let’s discuss your medical history a bit more thoroughly. Have you been diagnosed with any other conditions besides the blood clot?
PATIENT: Just high blood pressure, for a long time. I take medication for that, been on it for… oh, maybe ten years now? And, um, I had my gallbladder out a few years back. But that's about it, I think. I don’t really go to the doctor much, unless I have to.
DOCTOR: High blood pressure, managed with medication, and a cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – several years ago. And, if you don’t mind me asking, is your family history significant for any bleeding disorders, or any unusual bruising or clotting problems?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, no. My mom had arthritis, and my dad had diabetes, but nothing with blood or anything like that. I haven't really talked to anyone about bruising, honestly. It just… never came up. We weren't really a “medical history” kind of family, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I see. Alright. And what about your social history, Ms. Hainley?
PATIENT: Um… not much to say, really. I work as an Information Security Analyst, so I’m mostly at a computer all day. I don't drink or smoke. I live alone. I try to eat okay, mostly just… regular food. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Information Security Analyst, non-smoker, no alcohol use, lives alone. And, are you currently taking any other medications besides the medication for your blood pressure and the blood thinner?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor told me my levels were low last year. And sometimes I take ibuprofen for headaches, but not very often. Maybe once or twice a month, if that. Definitely not every day.
DOCTOR: Vitamin D supplement and occasional ibuprofen use. Now, Ms. Hainley, I'm going to need to perform a physical examination. We'll start with some basic vital signs, then I'll need to visually assess the bruising and check for any other abnormalities. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… try not to poke too much, okay? I bruise easily, remember?
DOCTOR: Of course. We will be as gentle as possible. If you'll please have a seat here. I’ll begin by checking your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Your blood pressure is 142 over 88. Slightly elevated, but not unexpected given your history. Pulse is 72 and regular. Temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, if you'll allow me to examine the areas of bruising. Please point out the most recent or concerning areas.
PATIENT: Okay. That one just happened yesterday, like I said. I bumped it on the table at work. And then… This one’s been there for about a week. I don't even remember how I got it. It just showed up one morning. It's kinda scary how easily they appear now.
DOCTOR: Hmm. The bruising on your forearm is tender to the touch, as you'd expect. There’s some warmth as well. The bruising on your thigh is more diffuse, and a bit… deeper. It does appear more significant than would be expected from minor trauma. I'm also noting some petechiae on your lower legs. These are tiny blood vessels that have broken. They can be a sign of a number of things, but in your case, given your medication and the bruising, we need to investigate further. Now, Ms. Hainley, I'm going to order some blood work. It will include a complete blood count, a coagulation panel to assess your blood’s ability to clot, and a metabolic panel to evaluate your overall health. We may also need to consider other tests depending on the results. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That… sounds like a lot, but if you think it’s necessary. Blood work is fine. I just want to know why this is happening. I don’t want to end up with bruises all over. And… will I have to come back often? I really don’t have a lot of free time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Hainley. It is important to determine the cause of the increased bruising. The blood work will give us a clearer picture. As for follow-up appointments, that will depend on the results. We may need to repeat some tests, or we may need to consult with a hematologist – a specialist in blood disorders – if the results are concerning. I will contact you as soon as the results are available, typically within 2-3 business days. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding any activities that could lead to injury, and if you do experience any new bleeding or concerning symptoms – such as blood in your urine or stool, or any significant headache – please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just… try to call me as soon as you can, okay? I don’t like being in the dark about things. And… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time. I guess I’ll see you when the results are back. .
DOCTOR: Very well. I will ensure you are contacted promptly with the results. And you are welcome, Ms. Hainley. We will do our best to determine the cause of your bruising. Do be sure to follow the recommendations I provided. Goodbye.
