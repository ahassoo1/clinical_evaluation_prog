DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… something about a letter. For a pet, you see. Honestly, I can’t quite recall all the details. My ex-husband… he’s the one who usually handles these things. Something about proving I can have a pet? It’s all a bit silly, if you ask me.
DOCTOR: A letter… regarding pet ownership?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly. A pet ownership letter. It's for… well, a dog. A lovely little thing, really. Though, to be frank, I don’t understand why I need a letter. I’ve always been perfectly capable of looking after animals. It's just… a requirement, apparently. Honestly, the whole thing seems quite unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Right. And this letter is required for… legal reasons?
PATIENT: Legal reasons… I think so? Something about the lease on my apartment. The landlord… he’s very particular. My ex-husband said something about needing proof I'm responsible enough. Honestly, he makes everything so complicated. It's just a small poodle! I don't even know what they need me to prove, exactly. Do I need to show them I buy dog food? It's absurd.
DOCTOR: So, the landlord requires documentation of your ability to care for a pet as part of your lease agreement. And your ex-husband initiated this request. Let's clarify a few things. First, do you currently have this poodle in your apartment?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, absolutely. Sweet little Coco is right there with me. A fluffy white thing, she is. A bit yappy, but mostly well-behaved. She's… well, she's my dog now, properly. Though, he did get her initially, so I suppose he thinks he needs to control everything. But she lives with me, and I take care of her! Always have. He just… likes paperwork, you see. It gives him a sense of control, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you're seeking a letter from me stating your… ability to provide adequate care for Coco?
PATIENT: Yes, that's exactly it. A letter saying I'm a responsible dog owner. It sounds ridiculous when you put it like that, doesn't it? I've had pets my whole life! Though… what exactly does it need to say? I mean, I don't know what "adequate care" even means to them. Do I need to list all the toys I buy her? It’s… honestly, I’m a bit lost.
DOCTOR: It is a rather unusual request. To be clear, the landlord isn't specifying what constitutes “adequate care,” they simply require a letter from a medical professional?
PATIENT: No, no specifications at all! Just a letter. From a doctor, apparently. My ex-husband said it carries more weight that way. Honestly, I think he just wants to annoy me. He knows I dislike coming to doctors. It's all very… unnecessary. But, I suppose if it gets him off my back and lets me keep Coco… a letter is a small price to pay. But truly, I can’t imagine what a doctor would even write about my ability to care for a dog!
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Wrye, while I understand your frustration, and I agree this is an atypical request, I can certainly write a letter stating you are a responsible adult capable of providing care for a pet. However, to do so properly, and for documentation purposes, I need to ask a few standard questions. This isn't about Coco specifically, but about ensuring you have the capacity to handle the responsibilities. It's a basic assessment, if you will. Are you currently under the care of any specialists for any chronic medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specialists? No, no specialists. I'm perfectly healthy, thank you very much. A little tired sometimes, but who isn't? I just… don’t bother with doctors unless absolutely necessary. My mother always said they just try to scare you into taking pills. No, no chronic conditions. Perfectly capable, I assure you. More capable than my ex-husband, probably. Honestly, I feel like I'm being interrogated!
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Wrye. These are standard questions, simply to establish a baseline. Do you have any history of significant mental health concerns – depression, anxiety, anything that might affect your ability to consistently provide care?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, now we’re getting personal, aren’t we? Look, everyone gets a little down sometimes. A divorce will do that to a person, you know? But significant mental health concerns? No. I’m perfectly stable. I have my friends, I have Coco… I manage perfectly well. Honestly, it’s quite insulting that you’re even asking. I'm perfectly capable of looking after a little dog, I assure you. More capable than he thinks, probably.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand your frustration, however, I am obligated to ask these questions to ensure I am providing responsible medical documentation. It is not my intention to insult you. Do you currently take any medications, prescription or over-the-counter, regularly?
PATIENT: Oh, for heaven's sake! Now you’re just trying to be difficult. Look, I take a multivitamin sometimes, if that counts. And maybe some ibuprofen when my joints ache, but that’s it. Nothing regular. Nothing that would affect my ability to… to walk a poodle! Honestly, this is ridiculous. I came here for a letter, not a life story interrogation. Is this what doctors always do? It's simply… unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I am documenting your responses. As I stated, these questions are standard. However, given your expressed aversion to medical assessment and your insistence on your perfectly capable state, and frankly, your clear annoyance with this entire process… I am hesitant to provide a letter. It places me in a potentially compromising position to attest to something without a proper assessment, and your responses do not inspire confidence in my ability to do so responsibly. I would recommend seeking legal counsel to address this issue directly with your ex-husband and the landlord. I will not be writing this letter. I can, however, document that you declined a medical assessment and that you self-reported being in good health. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Are you serious? You're refusing to write a simple letter because I don't want to be interrogated about my perfectly normal life? This is… unbelievable! He sent me here to jump through hoops, didn't he? He knew you'd do this. I bet he's laughing right now. No, I do not want you to document that I declined your… your ridiculous assessment. Just forget the whole thing. It’s a waste of my time, and clearly, you’re just trying to cause trouble. I'll find someone else. Someone who doesn’t treat their patients like… like criminals! .
