DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I am Dr. Blim. Now, let's not waste any time. Please tell me, in as concise a manner as possible, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Yes, right. Well, it's... something about a check-up, isn't it? For… acting, I think? They said I needed to be cleared for something. Honestly, it’s all a bit of a blur. It’s just… a formality, I assume? I’d really like to get this over with quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: “Cleared for acting”?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s it. A performance physical, I believe they called it. I do a bit of ushering, sometimes ticket taking… lobby work. Not exactly leading man material, you understand. Mostly just… standing. But they need this clearance thing. It was… the theatre manager, I think. A young woman. Very efficient. I don't recall the name, though. Sorry.
DOCTOR: Right. A performance physical. Well, I suppose even…lobby work requires some level of assessment. Let’s begin with a basic history. Have you been experiencing any specific symptoms – pain, dizziness, shortness of breath, anything at all – that prompted this… request?
PATIENT: Hmm… symptoms. Let me think. No, not really. Nothing… specific. I get a little tired, standing for long periods, naturally. Old age, you know? But nothing that would stop me from… standing. Or taking tickets. I don’t think so. My knees sometimes ache, but that’s been happening for years. Is that what you mean by symptoms?
DOCTOR: “Symptoms” encompasses a wide range of physical manifestations, Mr. Krahn. We are attempting to establish a baseline of your current health. Let’s proceed systematically. Do you have any history of heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, or any other significant medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Significant medical conditions… Well, I had a bout of the flu a few years back. A nasty one. And my divorce… that was pretty painful, if you consider that a condition. But physically? No, I don’t think so. The doctor I used to see… a Dr. Lee, very good man… he always said I was remarkably healthy for my age. Though, that was… a long time ago. I don’t think I have any of those things you mentioned. High blood… what was it? Pressure? No, never been told that. Honestly, I can't really remember all the details. It’s been years.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any surgical history?
PATIENT: Surgical history… let me see. Oh! Yes, actually. A long time ago, when I was quite young, I had my tonsils taken out. And… I think I had my appendix removed once. Or maybe it was a friend who had his appendix removed. It’s all rather fuzzy, to be honest. It was… before my wife, I think. Yes, definitely before. Small procedures, really. Nothing major. It was… a long time ago, as I said. Do you need specific dates? Because I certainly don’t have those.
DOCTOR: Dates are helpful, Mr. Krahn. But, fine. We'll proceed. Family history – any significant illnesses in your immediate family?
PATIENT: Family history… Oh dear. My parents… they both lived to a good age, actually. My mother… she died peacefully in her sleep, I think. My father… he had something with his… lungs, perhaps? He smoked a lot, you see. And my sister… she had children. Lots of children. I don’t recall any… serious illnesses in the family, no. Just… old age, mostly. They all seemed remarkably robust, actually. Is this important? I mean, they’re all… gone now. It’s hard to remember details from so long ago.
DOCTOR: It is always important, Mr. Krahn. Now, briefly, do you have any allergies – to medications, foods, anything at all?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. Perhaps a slight sniffle sometimes during pollen season, but that’s just… normal, isn’t it? No, I don’t have any significant allergies. I can eat anything, take any medication, as far as I know. I’m quite… adaptable, you see. Though, I don’t take much medication these days. I prefer to rely on… good health. Is that sufficient? Can we move on?
DOCTOR: Very well. Let’s proceed with a brief physical examination. Please step onto the scale. And please remove your shoes. I trust you haven’t consumed anything recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. The scale. Right. Shoes off… . Just a little unsteady on my feet today. And no, I haven’t eaten anything since… breakfast, I think. Toast and tea. Simple fare. Is that alright? I hope I’m not disrupting your schedule. I really do appreciate you seeing me so quickly.
DOCTOR: Your weight is… noted. Please stand still. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. …Respirations are slightly diminished, but within acceptable limits for your age. Blood pressure is 148 over 89. … slightly elevated. … Now, let's check your reflexes. Extend your arms.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Arms extended. … Is that alright? I used to be quite strong, you know. Did a bit of… gardening, mostly. Heavy lifting. But that was years ago. … Are you tapping something? I can't feel anything. Is this normal? I hope I’m not making this difficult. I’m trying my best.
DOCTOR: Reflexes are… diminished, but present. … Now, if you’ll just follow my finger with your eyes… … Are you experiencing any double vision or blurriness?
PATIENT: … No, no double vision. Not that I can detect. A little… blurry, perhaps? But that’s just my eyesight, you see. It’s not what it used to be. I should probably get a new prescription. But… I haven’t gotten around to it. It’s just… one of those things. Is that alright? I’m trying to focus. This is… a bit tiring, to be honest. Can we… hurry this along? …
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. That is sufficient for a cursory examination. Based on your limited history and this brief physical, your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and your reflexes are diminished – not unexpected given your age. … However, given your lack of significant complaints and the fact that this examination appears to be for performance clearance purposes, I will document this as within acceptable limits, with a recommendation for routine monitoring of your blood pressure. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Routine… monitoring? Oh. Yes, I think so. So, I’m… cleared? For the acting, I mean? Or the… theatre work? Is that what this all means? I just need a piece of paper, or something, to show the manager? I’m really not one for complications, you see. Just a simple clearance. Is that possible? I do appreciate your time, Doctor. Truly. …
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Krahn. This form indicates you are cleared for moderate physical activity, contingent upon maintaining routine blood pressure checks with your primary care physician. … I strongly advise you to schedule an appointment with a physician to establish ongoing care. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. … .
PATIENT: Oh! Wonderful. Thank you so much, Doctor. Truly. Routine checks… yes, I’ll try to remember that. … A bit of paperwork, but that’s alright. … Thank you again. And… have a good day. … Blood pressure… routine checks… must remember… .
