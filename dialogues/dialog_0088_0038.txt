DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Buoniconti. I'm Dr. Piet. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure to meet you. I believe I scheduled an appointment to discuss… some paperwork? Advance planning, I was told. It’s rather difficult for me to recall the specifics, I confess. It has to do with… making sure my wishes are known, should something happen. Is that… correct?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. You scheduled an appointment to discuss advance care planning. It's perfectly alright to feel a bit awkward – it is a difficult topic. We'll go through everything at your pace. Before we dive into that, I just want to confirm a few things from your chart. You’re Evann Buoniconti, 35 years old, and your insurance is through a private plan, correct?
PATIENT: Yes, that is all correct. Evann Buoniconti, 35 years old… and yes, private insurance. I apologize if I seem… hesitant. My memory isn't what it once was. I’m divorced, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: No apology necessary, Ms. Buoniconti. It's good you mentioned the divorce; that can be relevant for legal aspects of advance care planning. We'll get to that later if needed. Right now, let’s focus on understanding what's important to you regarding your future care. Have you given any thought to who you would want to make medical decisions for you if you were unable to do so yourself?
PATIENT: That… is a good question. I believe… I may have spoken with a solicitor about it, briefly, some time ago. But I don’t recall naming anyone specifically. Oh dear. I… I’m not sure I have a designated person, no. It’s all rather disorganized, I’m afraid. Do you… recommend I do that first? Before we discuss the forms? Perhaps I should consider who would be… most capable?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Identifying a healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf – is the most important first step. It’s okay if you haven’t done that yet. We can take our time. To help you think through it, who are the people in your life you trust most?
PATIENT: That’s… difficult. I don’t have… close family, locally. My parents are overseas. And… friends, well, I’ve moved around a bit, so… There was a colleague, perhaps? Elias Vance. He’s… reliable. And intelligent. I’ve known him for several years. But… I haven't spoken to him recently. Would that be… suitable? I worry about placing such a burden on someone I haven’t seen in some time.
DOCTOR: Elias Vance sounds like a good starting point. It's thoughtful of you to consider the burden, but as long as he's someone you trust to understand and respect your wishes, that’s what matters most. It's also good to have a backup proxy in mind, in case Elias isn’t available. Do you have any strong feelings about the types of medical treatments you would or wouldn’t want in certain situations?
PATIENT: That… is a very direct question. I… I haven’t thought about specific treatments. I suppose… I wouldn’t want to be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of recovery. But beyond that… I truly haven't considered it. I’m generally healthy. I don't dwell on… unpleasant possibilities. Would it be helpful if you… outlined some common scenarios? Perhaps that would prompt some thoughts? I feel rather… unprepared for this conversation.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Buoniconti. Many people feel unprepared when discussing these topics. It's my job to guide you through it. Outlining some common scenarios is an excellent idea. Let's start with cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR. If your heart stopped beating or you stopped breathing, would you want us to attempt to revive you, even if the chances of a full recovery were slim?
PATIENT: CPR… That sounds… rather aggressive. And potentially… traumatic. If there were truly no hope of recovery, no… I don't believe I would want that. Prolonging the inevitable… that doesn’t appeal to me. It seems… undignified. But… what constitutes “no hope”? Is that a… clear definition?
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Ms. Buoniconti. “No hope” is a difficult thing to define, and it's precisely why having this conversation is so crucial. It typically means a condition where recovery is highly unlikely, even with aggressive medical intervention. We would, of course, discuss this with you and your proxy if you were ever in that situation. So, for CPR, we've noted that you would likely decline it if recovery was unlikely. Now, let’s move on to mechanical ventilation. This involves using a machine to help you breathe. Would you want to be placed on a ventilator if you were unable to breathe on your own, even if it meant a prolonged stay in the hospital?
PATIENT: A prolonged stay… that doesn’t sound pleasant. I… I think I would prefer not to be placed on a ventilator in that situation. I value my independence… and quality of life. If I were unable to breathe on my own… I would rather… not have life artificially extended. But… what if it was a temporary situation? If there was a possibility of recovery? It's all so… nuanced.
DOCTOR: You're right, it is nuanced, Ms. Buoniconti. And it's good that you're thinking through these specific scenarios. We can definitely add a note that you would likely decline mechanical ventilation, but with the caveat that it’s contingent on the likelihood of recovery. If there was a reasonable chance of you regaining the ability to breathe on your own, we would revisit the decision with you and your proxy. Now, let's talk about feeding tubes. If you were unable to eat or drink on your own, would you want to be fed through a tube?
PATIENT: A feeding tube… That sounds… rather unpleasant. No. I don't believe I would want that. I… I think I would prefer to allow nature to take its course. If I were unable to eat or drink… that would be a sign, wouldn’t it? I don’t want to be kept alive artificially, just to… exist. But… would that be considered… neglecting my health? I feel so… unsure of myself. This is all very overwhelming.
DOCTOR: You're not unsure of yourself, Ms. Buoniconti, you're thoughtfully considering difficult questions. It's perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed. Your wishes are valid, and we'll document everything carefully. So, to summarize: you would likely decline CPR, mechanical ventilation, and feeding tubes if there was no reasonable hope of recovery. We've noted the importance of considering the likelihood of recovery in each situation. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Not at the moment. It’s… a lot to process. Perhaps… could we discuss the paperwork itself? The actual forms? I confess, I’m a little worried about… getting it wrong. Or… making a decision I’ll regret. And… about who would even receive these forms? Elias Vance, I suppose? But… how do we ensure he understands my wishes? This feels… very important, and I’m afraid I’m not very good at… legal matters.
DOCTOR: You're right to be concerned about getting it right, Ms. Buoniconti. It is very important. And you’re absolutely not alone in feeling overwhelmed by the legal aspects. We have several forms here, but the most crucial is the Healthcare Proxy form, which designates Elias Vance as your decision-maker. I will go through each section with you, explaining everything in plain language. We can take as much time as you need. And regarding ensuring Elias understands your wishes, we will include a section on the form where you can specifically outline your preferences. We can also discuss having a separate conversation with Elias, with me present, to ensure he's comfortable with his role and understands your values. Would that be helpful?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be… immensely helpful. A conversation with Elias, with you present… that sounds perfect. I… I just want to be sure my wishes are respected. And that he feels… equipped to make the right decisions, if necessary. So, the Healthcare Proxy form first? Perhaps you could… walk me through it section by section? I confess, I’m a little anxious about signing anything… until I’m absolutely certain I understand everything.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconti. We'll take it slowly, section by section. No pressure to sign anything until you're completely comfortable. This first section is just basic information – your name, address, date of birth, that sort of thing. Do you see any issues with this information?
PATIENT: No… that all looks correct. Evann Buoniconti… August 12th, 1990… Address is… 14 Elm Street, Apartment 2B… Yes, that's right. Everything seems accurate. Although… is there a place to note my… preferred language? I speak English fluently, but… I just want to be certain that’s documented. Sometimes… there are misunderstandings.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good point, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s always best to be thorough. You're right, it doesn't explicitly ask for preferred language. We can add a note in the “Additional Information” section at the bottom of the form, stating "Patient speaks English fluently." How does that sound?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. “Patient speaks English fluently”… That's concise and accurate. Perhaps we should also add… “Divorced. No immediate family locally.” Just… for clarity. I understand it may seem… unnecessary, but… I want to avoid any potential complications. It’s better to be overly thorough than to leave room for misunderstandings, wouldn’t you agree?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconti. You are right to be thorough, and it’s always best to anticipate potential complications. We’ll definitely add those notes to the form. Okay, so now we have "Patient speaks English fluently" and "Divorced. No immediate family locally" added to the additional information section. The next section is where you officially designate your healthcare proxy – Elias Vance. It asks for his full name, address, and phone number. Do you have that information readily available?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe so. Let me see… Elias Vance… Ah, here we are. Full name is Elias Theodore Vance. Address is 7 Oak Avenue, Apartment 10C. Phone number… 555-123-4567. Yes, that should be correct. He hasn't changed his number in… quite some time. I hope I haven’t made any errors. My… attention tends to wander, sometimes.
DOCTOR: No errors at all, Ms. Buoniconti. Everything looks perfect. This section is a bit more sensitive. It asks you to describe the specific powers you’re granting to Elias. It allows you to decide whether he can make decisions about all of your medical care, or only certain aspects of it. It also asks you to indicate whether he should follow your advance directives, if you have any. Do you understand what this section is asking?
PATIENT: I… I’m not entirely sure, no. “Specific powers”? “Advance directives”? It’s all rather… legalistic. I suppose I want him to have… full authority to make decisions on my behalf, if I’m unable to do so myself. But… what does “full authority” actually mean? And what are “advance directives”? Are those… the things we’ve been discussing? The wishes about CPR and feeding tubes? This is… overwhelming. Perhaps you could explain it in… simpler terms? I feel as though I’m drowning in legal jargon.
DOCTOR: You're not drowning, Ms. Buoniconti, and it's perfectly alright to ask for clarification. That's what I'm here for. "Specific powers" simply means what areas of medical decision-making you want Elias to be responsible for. It could be everything – from choosing a doctor to agreeing to surgery to deciding whether to continue life support. If you choose "all powers," he'll have the authority to make any medical decision on your behalf. And yes, "advance directives" are the wishes we've been discussing – your preferences about CPR, mechanical ventilation, and feeding tubes. We can include a section on the form that outlines those wishes, ensuring Elias is aware of them. Does that make more sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that clarifies things considerably. So, if I choose “all powers”, it means he’s responsible for everything? Even… decisions I haven’t specifically articulated? That sounds… a bit daunting. Perhaps… perhaps it would be safer to specify certain areas? But… what areas are most important to specify? I confess, I’m not sure. This is… a difficult decision. Perhaps we should leave it as “all powers” for now, and… add a separate document outlining my wishes in detail? Would that be acceptable? That way, he has a clear understanding of my preferences, even if the form itself is… broad.
DOCTOR: That’s an excellent idea, Ms. Buoniconti. We can definitely leave it as “all powers” on the form, and create a separate document outlining your wishes in detail. That provides the most comprehensive protection and ensures Elias has a clear understanding of your preferences. We'll call that document a "Statement of Healthcare Wishes." It can include everything we've discussed – your preferences about CPR, mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes, and any other concerns you may have. We can also add a section where you describe your values and beliefs, so Elias can make decisions that are consistent with your overall wishes. Does that sound like a good plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. A “Statement of Healthcare Wishes”… that’s a much more manageable approach. And including my values and beliefs… that’s a thoughtful addition. I believe I’m quite clear about my values. I value… independence, quality of life, and… dignity. I don’t want to be kept alive artificially if there’s no hope of recovery. And I want to be treated with respect, regardless of my condition. Perhaps we can start drafting that statement now? I’m eager to get it finalized, so I can… feel a little more at peace.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start drafting the Statement of Healthcare Wishes. I have a template here that we can use as a starting point. Let's start with your values. You mentioned independence, quality of life, and dignity. We can phrase that something like: "The patient values independence, quality of life, and dignity above all else. She wishes to maintain as much autonomy as possible and to be treated with respect at all times." Does that accurately reflect your wishes?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… accurate. “Autonomy”… that’s a good word. And “respect at all times” is… important. Perhaps we could add something about… avoiding prolonged suffering? I don’t want to be kept alive if I’m in constant pain and there’s no hope of improvement. It’s… a difficult topic, but it’s important to be honest about my wishes. Perhaps something like: “The patient wishes to avoid prolonged suffering and prioritizes a peaceful and dignified end of life, if appropriate.” Does that sound… too morbid?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn’t sound morbid at all, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s very thoughtful and responsible to express your wishes so clearly. Okay, so now it reads: “The patient values independence, quality of life, and dignity above all else. She wishes to maintain as much autonomy as possible and to be treated with respect at all times. She also wishes to avoid prolonged suffering and prioritizes a peaceful and dignified end of life, if appropriate.” Now, let’s move on to your specific wishes regarding medical treatment. You mentioned you would likely decline CPR, mechanical ventilation, and feeding tubes if there was no reasonable hope of recovery. We can phrase that something like: “The patient would likely decline cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, and feeding tubes if her condition is deemed irreversible and there is no reasonable hope of recovery.” Does that accurately reflect your wishes?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… accurate. “Irreversible”… that’s a good word. And “reasonable hope”… that’s important. Perhaps we should also add something about… consulting with specialists? If possible, I’d like my wishes to be considered in consultation with medical professionals. And… I’d like Elias to have the final say, but… only after carefully considering the advice of doctors. It’s important to balance my wishes with… professional expertise, wouldn’t you agree? Perhaps something like: “The patient would like her healthcare proxy to consult with medical specialists before making any decisions regarding life-sustaining treatment.” Does that sound… reasonable?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Ms. Buoniconti. That’s a very sensible addition. It’s important to balance your wishes with professional expertise. Okay, so now it reads: "The patient values independence, quality of life, and dignity above all else. She wishes to maintain as much autonomy as possible and to be treated with respect at all times. She also wishes to avoid prolonged suffering and prioritizes a peaceful and dignified end of life, if appropriate. The patient would like her healthcare proxy to consult with medical specialists before making any decisions regarding life-sustaining treatment." Shall we add anything else to the statement, Ms. Buoniconti?
PATIENT: Hmm… Yes. Perhaps something about… my aversion to… being a burden. I don’t want to cause undue stress or hardship for Elias. I’d like him to know that… I understand that making these decisions won’t be easy. And I want him to feel… free to prioritize his own well-being, if necessary. It’s… difficult to articulate. Perhaps something like: “The patient understands that making these decisions may be difficult for her healthcare proxy and wishes to minimize any undue burden on him. She encourages him to prioritize his own well-being, if necessary.” Does that sound… reasonable?
DOCTOR: That’s a very thoughtful and considerate addition, Ms. Buoniconti. It’s important for Elias to know your wishes and to feel comfortable making these decisions. Okay, so now the statement reads: “The patient values independence, quality of life, and dignity above all else. She wishes to maintain as much autonomy as possible and to be treated with respect at all times. She also wishes to avoid prolonged suffering and prioritizes a peaceful and dignified end of life, if appropriate. The patient would like her healthcare proxy to consult with medical specialists before making any decisions regarding life-sustaining treatment. The patient understands that making these decisions may be difficult for her healthcare proxy and wishes to minimize any undue burden on him. She encourages him to prioritize his own well-being, if necessary.” Would you like to review the entire statement one more time, or are you satisfied with it as is?
PATIENT: Yes… let me see. “Values independence… quality of life… dignity…” Yes, that’s right. “Avoid prolonged suffering…” Yes. “Consult with specialists…” Yes. “Minimize any undue burden…” Yes. Yes. I believe… I believe that’s it. That captures my wishes… quite accurately. I’m… satisfied with it as is. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been… incredibly helpful. This… alleviated a great deal of anxiety.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Buoniconti. I’m glad I could help. Now, we just need to print out the Statement of Healthcare Wishes and the Healthcare Proxy form. You'll need to sign and date both documents in the presence of a witness – someone who isn’t your healthcare proxy or a direct beneficiary of your will. Do you have someone in mind who can serve as a witness?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s a good question. I don’t have many… close acquaintances locally. Perhaps… the receptionist? Would she be acceptable? She seems… reliable and discreet. I don't believe she’s a beneficiary of my will, and she’s certainly not Elias. Would that be acceptable, Doctor? Or do I need to find someone else? This is… surprisingly complicated.
DOCTOR: Yes, the receptionist would be perfectly acceptable, Ms. Buoniconti, as long as she isn’t a beneficiary of your will. I’ll print out the forms now. Once you've signed and dated them, I'll make copies for your records, Elias’ records, and my own. And I recommend that you give a copy to any other healthcare providers you see regularly. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I believe that’s all, Doctor. Thank you again for your patience and guidance. You’ve… alleviated a great deal of worry. I feel much more at peace now. And please, thank the receptionist for me. I truly appreciate her willingness to serve as a witness. I believe that will be all. Have a good day, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Buoniconti. I'm glad I could help. And I will certainly thank the receptionist. You have a good day as well, and please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.
