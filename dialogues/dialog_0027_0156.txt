DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. Welcome. I’m Dr. Fazzina. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doctor. Um… well, it's my stomach, I think. It's been… not good, lately. Really loose stools, for a while now. I keep having to run to the bathroom, you know? It's just… persistent. I don't really remember when it started, exactly. Sorry, I'm not very good with dates.
DOCTOR: Okay, loose stools…persistent. That is disruptive. You mentioned not remembering when it started…roughly, can you give me a timeframe?
PATIENT: Hmm… Gosh, it feels like… a few weeks, maybe? Longer? It’s hard. I've had stomach problems on and off for ages, I think, so this just feels…worse than usual. I was diagnosed with something years ago… something with how I digest things? But I forget the name. And my husband usually handles all the doctor stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, a few weeks, perhaps longer. And a previous digestive diagnosis…do you recall anything about it?
PATIENT: No, not really. Something about not being able to eat certain foods? And something about my…intestines? It was a long time ago, and honestly, I was mostly just glad they figured out something was wrong. I just try to avoid the foods that bother me, mostly. It’s… manageable usually. But this diarrhea is just… not stopping. I feel really tired all the time now, too.
DOCTOR: Okay. Tiredness alongside the diarrhea…that's good to know. Let's try to get a clearer picture. Have you noticed any blood in your stool, or black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Oh… um… I think so? Maybe? It's hard to tell, honestly. Sometimes it's just…red tinged? And sometimes it's…darker. It's never a lot, but it's definitely not normal. I usually just… try not to look too closely. It’s… unpleasant. Sorry. Is that…bad?
DOCTOR: Okay. Red tinged or darker stools… that is something we need to investigate further. And no, don’t apologize – it’s important to be honest, even if it's unpleasant. We're going to need to do a physical exam, and I'd like to order a stool sample to check for infection or bleeding. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, okay. That sounds…good, I guess. Anything to figure out what’s going on. A stool sample… Is it… complicated? I’m not very good with… things like that. And a physical exam… will it be… uncomfortable? Sorry, I just… get a little anxious about doctors sometimes.
DOCTOR: No, the stool sample isn't complicated. The nurse will give you a container and instructions. It's a bit awkward, but quick. As for the exam, I’ll just be listening to your abdomen and feeling it gently. It shouldn’t be painful, but please let me know if anything is uncomfortable. We'll take things slowly. Would you like to change into a gown first?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Not too complicated is good. And… okay, listening and feeling… yeah, that sounds… okay. A gown? Um… yes, please. That would probably be best. I just… I’m not sure why my stomach’s been so bad lately. It’s really worrying me. And I keep having to cancel plans with my friends.
DOCTOR: Alright. Why don't you go ahead and change, and I'll step out for a moment to give you some privacy. The nurse will be in shortly to explain the stool sample collection. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Jase. It’s good you're coming in to get checked out. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Okay, thank you. I'll just… go change. Allergies… hmm. I don't think so. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I know. But… my husband usually keeps track of all that stuff. He's really good with details. Maybe he knows better? I'm really sorry, I'm just not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: No worries at all. We can always confirm with your husband later. Just focus on getting changed, and we'll take it one step at a time. I’ll be right here when you’re ready. .
PATIENT: .
