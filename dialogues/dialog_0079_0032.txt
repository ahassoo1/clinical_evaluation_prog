DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. I’m Dr. Gonzalezperez. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Honestly, it’s… well, it’s a rather delicate matter. I don't quite recall all the details, but my wife insisted I come. Something about… a bit of discharge. It's most unpleasant, and frankly, a bit embarrassing for a man of my age. I’ve always taken care of myself, you understand. A sturdy, reliable piece of equipment, I’ve been.
DOCTOR: A discharge, you say. And you're experiencing some difficulty recalling the specifics… I understand it can be unsettling to discuss these matters. Perhaps we can start with when you first noticed this discharge, to the best of your recollection?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's the tricky part, isn’t it? It feels like… a week or so, perhaps? Maybe longer. Time does rather blur when one reaches a certain age. It wasn’t sudden, you see. More… a gradual appearance. And no, it wasn't after any… incident, if that’s what you’re thinking. I assure you, my life has been quite… regulated.
DOCTOR: A gradual onset over approximately a week. And no recent injury or… alteration in routine that might explain it. Very good. Could you describe the discharge for me, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: Alteration in routine? I should hope not! A man has standards, Doctor. As for describing it… well, it’s… fluid. Yes, fluid. And… not particularly pleasant smelling, I’ll admit. A bit… yellowish, I believe. Not a vibrant yellow, mind you, more of a… faded ochre. Is that the correct term? I was always better with engines than with… bodily descriptions.
DOCTOR: Faded ochre, alright. And yellowish in color. I appreciate you attempting to be precise, Mr. Krok. Has the amount of discharge changed since you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Changed? Goodness, everything changes with time, doesn’t it? But specifically… I believe it has… increased, slightly. Not dramatically, mind you. A gradual increase, to be precise. It's certainly enough to warrant… concern, my wife assures me. She has a very… sensitive nose. Honestly, the things one has to discuss these days…
DOCTOR: Gradual increase in amount. Right. And has there been any associated pain, burning, or itching?
PATIENT: Pain? Doctor, I’ve endured a broken wrist fixing a Massey Ferguson. A little discharge isn't painful. It's… irritating, perhaps. A slight discomfort. And a bit of… sensitivity, shall we say. Especially when… cleaning up. But painful? No. And as for burning… no, I haven’t set myself alight, if that's what you mean.
DOCTOR: No burning, just some irritation and sensitivity. Very well. Now, Mr. Krok, I’m going to ask some more general questions. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches recently?
PATIENT: Fever? Doctor, I keep a perfectly regulated temperature! I’m a man of routine, remember? Body aches… well, my knees creak a bit in the mornings, but that’s to be expected at my age. No, no fever, no chills, just the usual… wear and tear. I’m starting to feel quite foolish discussing all of this.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly normal to feel uncomfortable, Mr. Krok. These questions are simply to ensure a thorough assessment. Now, have you experienced any changes in your urinary habits – increased frequency, urgency, or difficulty urinating?
PATIENT: Changes in urinary habits? Doctor, I have a bladder of steel! I've spent decades on farms with limited facilities, I assure you. Perhaps… a slight increase in frequency, now that you mention it. But nothing dramatic. A gentleman doesn’t dwell on such matters, you understand. And certainly no difficulty. I maintain full operational capacity.
DOCTOR: Slight increase in urinary frequency. Alright. Now, I'm going to need to perform a physical exam. Would that be alright with you, Mr. Krok?
PATIENT: A… a physical exam? Doctor, are you suggesting you need to… examine the area? With your own hands? Honestly! I assure you, I am perfectly capable of self-diagnosis. I’ve fixed tractors with far more complicated mechanisms than… this. I find the suggestion… rather impertinent. No, thank you. Absolutely not.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, with all due respect, a proper examination is crucial for an accurate assessment. I understand your discomfort, but without it, I’m operating with incomplete information. I assure you, this is standard medical procedure. We can discuss it further, but I strongly advise against foregoing it. Without it, I cannot reliably rule out more serious conditions. Are you willing to reconsider?
PATIENT: Serious conditions? Doctor, I've lived a long and productive life, tending to machinery and weathering storms. A bit of discharge isn't going to derail me now. My wife… she’s quite insistent on my following your advice, of course. Very well. But I must insist on a chaperone. And a detailed explanation of every step. And I expect a full report afterwards. This is… highly undignified. The indignity of it all…
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Krok. We can certainly arrange a chaperone and I will explain each step thoroughly. Nurse, could you please come in here for a moment?
PATIENT: I trust she’s… discreet. And capable. I don’t want any… clumsy handling. This is a delicate situation, after all.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. Nurse Davies is very experienced. Before we begin, just to reiterate, I’ll be performing a genital examination to assess the source of the discharge. This will involve visual inspection and possibly a gentle palpation of the area. We may also need to collect a sample for laboratory testing, if appropriate. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: Laboratory testing? What precisely does that entail? Are you suggesting I’ll be… prodded and poked and… dissected? And what will you do with the… sample? Will it be returned to me? I have certain… standards, you understand. This is becoming increasingly unsettling.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, let me assure you, it will not be anything like "dissected." The laboratory testing involves collecting a small sample of the discharge – a swab, essentially – to identify any potential infection. We send it to a certified laboratory for analysis. The sample will be processed according to strict confidentiality protocols, and no, it will not be returned to you. The results will be reviewed and discussed with you in detail. It is standard practice to determine the cause of the discharge and ensure appropriate treatment. It is not about judging or scrutinizing, it’s about providing you with the best possible care. Do you consent to the sample collection?
PATIENT: Very well. But I insist on knowing exactly what they’re looking for. And I want a written report outlining the process. And if it involves anything… invasive, I want to be informed beforehand. This is… highly irregular. I’ve never had to consent to such things before. Just get it over with quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Krok. I will explain each step before I proceed, and you are welcome to ask questions at any time. We'll start with a visual inspection, and then I’ll gently palpate the area to assess for any abnormalities. If necessary, I'll collect a swab sample for laboratory testing. You will receive a written report outlining the process and the results. Nurse Davies, if you could please assist?
PATIENT: Abnormalities… Honestly, the things they come up with. Fine. Just… be gentle. And explain everything. Thoroughly. I'm an engineer, you know. I appreciate precision. And I don't appreciate surprises.
DOCTOR: Nurse Davies, could you please ensure Mr. Krok is comfortable and explain the procedure to him one more time while I prepare the necessary materials?
PATIENT: I require no comforting. I simply require a swift and dignified resolution to this… unfortunate situation. Explaination is acceptable, but do not patronize me. I understand the mechanics of things, I assure you. The indignity of it all… a man reduced to this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krok, I understand your discomfort and I assure you, my intention is not to patronize you in any way. Nurse Davies is simply here to assist and ensure you are comfortable throughout the examination. The examination itself is straightforward. I will gently examine the area to identify the source of the discharge and assess for any signs of infection or abnormality. It may involve some light palpation, but it shouldn’t be painful. I will explain each step before I proceed, and you are welcome to stop me at any time. Now, if you would like to lie down on the examination table, we can begin.
PATIENT: Lie down? On that? Absolutely not. I will remain fully clothed, thank you very much. And you may proceed, but gently. And quickly. I have better things to do than spend the afternoon being… prodded.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Krok. We can proceed with you remaining fully clothed. However, please understand that a thorough examination may be slightly more difficult. I'm going to start with a visual inspection. I’ll need to gently pull down your trousers slightly to allow me to observe the area. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Pull down my trousers? Now you've gone too far. Absolutely not. I will assist you with the observation, thank you very much. But be quick. And discreet. And no unnecessary touching. This is… deeply unsettling.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Krok. I appreciate your cooperation. I'm observing a slight redness and some minor swelling around the urethral opening. Do you notice any pain or discomfort when I examine this area?
PATIENT: A little sensitivity, yes. A slight tingling sensation. It's… not excruciating, but it's certainly not comfortable. Are you quite finished? I'm starting to feel… exposed.
DOCTOR: A slight sensitivity noted. Alright. I'm going to gently palpate the area now to assess for any abnormalities. I will let you know before I touch you, and you can tell me to stop at any time. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Must you? Very well. But be exceedingly gentle. And no sudden movements. I’ve endured broken bones with less discomfort, I assure you. Just… get it over with.
DOCTOR: I’m just checking for any tenderness or swelling. Do you feel any pain or discomfort in this area?
PATIENT: Ow! Yes! That's… exceedingly uncomfortable. Stop! Just stop. What did you expect? I’m not made of iron, you know! This is… utterly ridiculous.
DOCTOR: My apologies, Mr. Krok. I did not intend to cause you any discomfort. It appears there is some significant tenderness in this area. Based on my limited examination, I suspect you may be experiencing urethritis, which is inflammation of the urethra. However, a definitive diagnosis requires a urine sample and possibly further testing. Nurse, could you please prepare a sterile collection cup?
PATIENT: Urethritis? Inflammation? You mean to tell me I subjected myself to this indignity for… inflammation? Fine. A urine sample. But I require detailed instructions. And a sanitary environment. I will not compromise my dignity further for… a bit of inflammation.
DOCTOR: Nurse Davies, please provide Mr. Krok with a private room and detailed instructions on how to collect a clean-catch urine sample. Ensure he has all the necessary supplies and feels comfortable. Once you've collected the sample, please bring it back to me, and I will send it to the laboratory for analysis. We'll discuss the results as soon as they are available. In the meantime, I recommend drinking plenty of fluids and avoiding any irritants that may worsen your discomfort. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Questions? Just get me out of here. This has been… a most unpleasant experience. I trust the results will be conclusive. And that the treatment will be swift. I have a farm to run, you know. I do not have time for… inflammation.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I understand. Nurse Davies will escort you to the restroom to collect the sample, and we will proceed from there. I will review the results as soon as they become available and contact you with a treatment plan. Thank you for your patience. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns.
