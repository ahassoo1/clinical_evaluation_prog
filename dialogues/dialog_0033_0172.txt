DOCTOR: Right. Candice Engelhaupt, 79 years old. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, it’s simply because… my husband insisted. New to the area, you see. He’s terribly concerned about… things. Social visit, I believe he called it. Honestly, I feel perfectly fine. Just a routine check, I suppose? I haven't the foggiest why we bothered coming all this way.
DOCTOR: Routine, alright. Though, husbands do worry. Still, we should at least go through the motions. And don’t dismiss things just because you feel fine. Things can develop subtly. Now, tell me, are you experiencing any changes, however small?
PATIENT: Changes? Heavens. At my age? What isn't changing? Honestly, young lady, I haven’t the energy to list every ache and creak. My memory isn't what it used to be, either. Is this truly necessary? I have a luncheon planned with my friends, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course. But those “aches and creaks,” as you call them, could be… indicative of something. And memory loss at 79 is something we need to assess. It's part of a standard evaluation. Let's start with your current medications. Could you list everything you're taking, even over-the-counter things, and their dosages if you know them?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Medications… That’s Bernard’s department, entirely. He handles all of that. I take a little pill for my… water retention, I think. A small white one. And something for my… blood pressure, perhaps? He’s very organized, you see. I really couldn’t tell you the names, or how much, or… anything, really. Honestly, I just take what he gives me. It’s probably best to ask him.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll need to get that information from your husband, then. It’s rather crucial, you see. We can't properly assess your health without knowing what you’re ingesting. Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… Let me see. I think I was rather sensitive to penicillin as a child, but that was ages ago. Honestly, I can't quite recall. My skin gets a bit itchy sometimes, but that’s likely just the dry air. It's terribly bothersome, you know. And dust... Oh, don’t even get me started on dust. It’s everywhere. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: We're almost finished with the initial questions, Mrs. Engelhaupt. Just a few more, and then we can decide if a physical exam is necessary. Now, do you have any family history of… significant illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… Well, my mother lived to be a very respectable age. Ninety-two, I believe. She had… a touch of arthritis, as she got older. And my father… he had a weak heart, I think. He always complained about palpitations. Honestly, it was all rather boring. A lot of aches and pains, as one expects. They weren’t terribly… dramatic people, you see. Is this truly important?
DOCTOR: It provides context, Mrs. Engelhaupt. Now, regarding your social history... Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Smoke? Heavens, no! Absolutely not! I find the habit utterly distasteful. My mother always said it was terribly uncouth. And dangerous, of course. Never touched a cigarette in my life. Honestly, the very idea. It's dreadful for your complexion, you know.
DOCTOR: Alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, a little wine with dinner sometimes. A very small glass, of course. Bernard enjoys a sherry before bed. We’re quite moderate people, you see. Not at all… excessive. It’s good for the digestion, I believe. A small indulgence. Honestly, it’s hardly worth mentioning.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you have any current symptoms that are bothering you?
PATIENT: Bothering me? Well… my knees ache, as I said. And my vision isn’t what it used to be. I get a bit… breathless when I climb stairs. And my memory, naturally. But honestly, that’s just… old age. I don’t consider any of it terribly bothersome. It’s just… life, you see. Is that sufficient? Can we be done now?
DOCTOR: Alright. Considering your age and reported symptoms, a brief physical examination would be prudent. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your reflexes. It won’t be extensive, but it will give me a better overview. Do you consent to a physical exam?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Must we? Honestly, I was hoping to avoid all this… poking and prodding. But… Bernard would be terribly upset if I refused. He's so concerned about my health, you see. Very well. I suppose I consent. But please be gentle. And make it quick. I have a luncheon, you know.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit back, and I’ll begin with your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, 142/88. A bit high, but not alarming. Heart sounds are regular, but there is a slight murmur. Lungs are clear, but you have a diminished breath sound on the lower right lobe. Reflexes are diminished, as expected for your age. Now, can you tell me about the breathlessness you mentioned?
PATIENT: Oh, it's nothing much, really. Just a bit winded after a flight of stairs. Or a brisk walk. It’s been happening for… well, for as long as I can remember, honestly. I’ve always been a bit… delicate, you see. It's probably just my age. And the stairs in our new home are terribly steep. Honestly, I should have known better than to buy a two-story house. It was Bernard's idea, naturally.
DOCTOR: Right. And how about the memory issues?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It’s just… names, mostly. And dates. And where I put things. It’s terribly frustrating, you see. I used to have a remarkably sharp mind. Bernard keeps reminding me of things. He’s very patient. Honestly, it’s just a bit embarrassing. I’m sure it’s nothing serious. Probably just… old age, again.
DOCTOR: Given your symptoms and age, and the slightly diminished breath sounds, I recommend a chest X-ray to rule out any underlying pulmonary issues. Additionally, I'll order a basic metabolic panel to assess kidney function and electrolyte balance, and a complete blood count to check for any signs of infection or anemia. Do you agree to these tests?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. More tests? Honestly, young lady, you’re determined to poke and prod every inch of me, aren’t you? It’s all so… intrusive. But… Bernard would insist. He’s terribly worried about my… everything. Very well. I suppose I agree. But please, make it quick. I really must get home. I have a luncheon, you know. And I’m sure it’s all perfectly unnecessary.
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab technician will draw blood before you leave. I’ll send the order for the chest X-ray to the radiology department. They will contact you to schedule an appointment. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding strenuous activity and maintaining a healthy diet. If your breathlessness worsens, or you develop any chest pain, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Questions? Heavens, no. I've had quite enough questions from you, thank you very much. Honestly, I'm just eager to be done with this entire ordeal. I think that’s all. I need to go now. Where is the lab technician? And is there a parking validation? I absolutely detest paying for parking.
DOCTOR: The lab technician is just down the hall, second door on the left. As for parking validation, I’m afraid we do not offer that at this time. Here’s the lab requisition form. Please take it with you. And if your husband has any questions, he can reach my office directly. I believe that’s everything. Have a pleasant day, Mrs. Engelhaupt.
PATIENT: .
