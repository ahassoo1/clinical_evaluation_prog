DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Goodstein. I'm Dr. Overgaard. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is… a little embarrassing to talk about, honestly. But I have been… passing gas. A lot of gas. More than usual, and it is… disruptive. It started, I think, maybe a week ago? I do not know exactly. It is just… a lot.
DOCTOR: Disruptive, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Disruptive to… my life. And potentially… others. It happens throughout the day. After eating, mostly, but not always. It is… loud, sometimes. And… it smells. I apologize for sharing such details, but you asked. It is very bothersome. I do not know what I have eaten differently. I eat mostly the same things.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, it’s something, certainly. Have you noticed any associated abdominal pain, bloating, or changes in your bowel habits – constipation, diarrhea, anything like that?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. When the gas is… building up, I get a little stomach pain. Not very bad, but uncomfortable. And yes, I have been… going to the bathroom more. Not diarrhea, exactly, but… softer stools. And sometimes I feel… bloated, like my stomach is very full, even if I have not eaten much. It is… a lot of things happening all at once, I think. Is this… serious, Doctor?
DOCTOR: “Serious” is a strong word, Mr. Goodstein. It sounds like you're describing symptoms consistent with… well, a number of possibilities. Let’s get a bit more detail. You said “mostly the same things” – can you describe a typical day of eating for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. For breakfast, I usually have a roll with… some spread, like jam. Sometimes I have a little coffee. For lunch, I work at the fast food place, so… I eat what we serve. Burgers, fries, sometimes a soda. Dinner… it varies. Sometimes soup, sometimes a sandwich. I like potatoes. And I have… a sweet treat sometimes. A small cake, or… cookies. I drink water, mostly. But sometimes soda. I do not eat a lot of vegetables, I must admit. I try, but… I do not enjoy them very much. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Helpful, yes, though not particularly encouraging. Fast food and sweets, limited vegetables… it paints a picture. Now, have you noticed any specific foods that seem to worsen the gas, or anything that seems to improve it?
PATIENT: Hmm… that is a good question, Doctor. I think… the burgers make it worse. Definitely. And the soda, perhaps. When I do not drink the soda, it is… a little better. But it is hard to say for sure. I have not been paying very close attention. And… when I eat quickly, it seems worse. If I eat slowly, it is… not as bad. But that is difficult at work, because it is very busy. I do not know if that makes sense. I am trying to recall, but… it is hard to pinpoint exactly what is causing it.
DOCTOR: Mr. Goodstein, with all due respect, it sounds like your diet is… suboptimal. While I don’t want to dismiss your discomfort, these symptoms are often related to dietary choices. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything more concerning. Then we can discuss some… adjustments you might need to make. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I do not have any allergies to medications. That is good, yes? I have never had a reaction to anything before. A physical exam sounds… alright. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just want this… gas to stop. It is very embarrassing, and it is affecting my life. I am willing to try anything, if it helps. I hope it is not something serious.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your abdomen. Please lie down on the examination table. I’m going to listen to your bowel sounds, and then I’ll palpate your abdomen to check for any tenderness or masses. Just relax, and let me know if anything feels painful. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: A little, Doctor, when you press… there. On the left side. Not very bad, but… a little sensitive. It feels… a little bloated, in that area. Like there is… something there. But it is not a sharp pain, just… uncomfortable. Is that normal? I am trying to relax, but it is difficult when I am being… poked. I apologize if I am not very cooperative. I do not like being touched.
DOCTOR: Noted. Tenderness on the left side, with reported bloating. Bowel sounds are… active, perhaps a bit hyperactive. No palpable masses. Overall, it doesn't suggest anything acutely alarming, but it’s consistent with increased gas and some intestinal discomfort. I suspect a degree of irritable bowel syndrome, exacerbated by your dietary habits. We’ll need to rule out other possibilities, of course. I’m going to order a stool sample to check for any infections or parasites.
PATIENT: A stool sample? Oh… that sounds… unpleasant, Doctor. But if it helps, I will do it. I just… I do not enjoy talking about these things, or… providing samples. But I understand it is necessary. What exactly are we looking for? And how long will it take to get the results? And… will I need to change anything about my diet while we are waiting? I eat the same things every day, you see. It is difficult to change.
DOCTOR: Mr. Goodstein, medical investigations often involve…unpleasantries. The stool sample will check for bacteria, parasites, and signs of inflammation. It’s a routine procedure. As for your diet… I strongly advise you to reduce your intake of fast food, sugary drinks, and processed foods. Increase your fiber intake – fruits, vegetables, whole grains. Eat smaller, more frequent meals. And slow down when you eat. These are not suggestions, Mr. Goodstein, they are essential steps to improving your condition. Results will take approximately three to five business days. In the meantime, I also recommend an over-the-counter simethicone to help with the gas. I’ll print out the lab requisition and some dietary guidelines for you.
PATIENT: Alright, Doctor. I will try. It sounds… like a lot of work. But I understand. I just… I have been eating this way for so long. It is hard to change habits. And the vegetables… I do not enjoy them. But I will try. Simethicone… is that a pill? I hope it does not have… side effects. Thank you, Doctor. For your help. I appreciate it. I will get the sample done as soon as possible. And I will try to eat slower. And more vegetables. Perhaps. .
DOCTOR: Very well. Follow those guidelines, and we’ll see where we stand in a week. Schedule a follow-up appointment with the receptionist. And Mr. Goodstein?
