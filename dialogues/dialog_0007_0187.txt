DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Sobkowicz, good to see you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Good to see you? I don’t know. My chest… it feels funny. And my heart… bang-bang. Too fast. Blood pressure, the nurse said it was high. I no like. Just want fix quick. I busy man.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Funny” in your chest and a fast heartbeat… and the nurse mentioned your blood pressure was elevated. We'll definitely get to the bottom of this and figure out what's going on. “Busy man” is fine – we’ll try to be efficient. First, let’s talk a little more about this “funny” feeling. Can you describe it?
PATIENT: Describe? Like…fluttering. Sometimes tight. Like someone squeezing. Not bad bad, but… annoying. It happen when I… walk upstairs. Or when wife yell at me. She yell a lot. Not important. Just… when I stressed.
DOCTOR: Okay, fluttering, sometimes tight, like squeezing… and it seems to happen when you're exerting yourself, like walking upstairs, or when you're feeling stressed. That's helpful. And yes, even things like stress can definitely play a role. Do you ever feel any pain in your chest, or does it just feel uncomfortable?
PATIENT: Pain? No. Not real pain. More… heavy. Like I gotta sit down. Like I can’t… breathe good. But no sharp pain. You know? I old man. Things ache all the time. This different. More… heart thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so heavy, makes you want to sit, and feels different than your usual aches. And you feel it specifically in your chest, related to your heart. That’s good information. Have you noticed if anything makes it better?
PATIENT: Better? Hmm. When I stop. When I sit. When wife stop yelling. Mostly just… stopping. Quiet. Rest. That help. But then I gotta move again. It come back. Is annoying. Very annoying. I no want to be old.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like rest helps, but it comes back with activity. Okay. Now, have you ever had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: Before? Maybe. Long time ago. When I younger. Work too hard. Lots of stress. Doctor give me… pills. Small white pills. I stop taking them. Too many side effects. Made me sleepy. I need to work. No time for sleepy. This time… feel different. Worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, you've had something similar before, with pills that made you sleepy, so you stopped taking them. And you feel like this time it's worse. That’s important to know. Let's talk about your medical history a little bit. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of, like diabetes, high cholesterol, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Diabetes? No. Cholesterol… maybe. Doctor say something about it. Long time ago. I forget. Kidney? No. I drink lots of water. Wife make me. She worry too much. I strong man. Never sick. Except this heart thing. Mostly just… old. Old man problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, so maybe high cholesterol in the past, but you’re generally healthy. And you drink plenty of water because your wife worries about you – that’s good! Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries? No. Never. Too much risk. Hospital? Once. When I was young. Car accident. Not serious. Just… broke arm. Long time ago. Everything okay now. Strong man. No need for hospital. No need for doctor. This heart thing… different. Annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, a broken arm a long time ago, and otherwise healthy. Let’s talk about your family. Has anyone in your family had heart problems, like a heart attack, stroke, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Family? My father… he had high blood pressure. Very high. Always yelling. Like my wife. He died… old. Heart… something. I forget. My mother… she healthy. Very strong woman. No problems. Family… not important. This is my heart.
DOCTOR: Okay, your father had high blood pressure and died of a heart condition, and your mother was healthy. That's helpful. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones like vitamins or pain relievers?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I told you. No pills. I no like pills. Vitamins? Sometimes. Wife give me. But I forget to take them. Pain relievers? Only when I fall. And I no fall much anymore. No need for medications. Just… fix this heart thing. Quick. I busy man. Very busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you occasionally take vitamins your wife gives you, and pain relievers if you fall, but generally you don’t take any medications. Alright, Mr. Sobkowicz, I think I have a pretty good idea of your history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure again, and feel your pulse. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Exam? Hmph. Fine. But quick. I no have all day. My wife… she make dinner. I like dinner. And she get angry if I late. Just… quick. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is 160 over 95. That is elevated. Now I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Your heart rate is a little fast, around 90 beats per minute, and I can hear a slight murmur. Your lungs sound clear, but a little diminished breath sounds bilaterally. Your pulse is regular but a little weak. No edema noted in extremities. Alright, everything seems normal except for the elevated blood pressure, fast heart rate, and the murmur. This murmur requires further evaluation. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. I eat everything. I strong man. Maybe… itchy when I touch poison ivy. But that no allergy. That just… itchy. No medications. I told you. No pills. This murmur… what is that? Sounds bad. Fix it. Quick.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies except for maybe a little itchiness with poison ivy, and definitely no medications. A murmur is just an extra sound your heart makes when blood flows through it. It doesn't always mean there's something seriously wrong, but it's something we need to investigate further. Given your history of a fast heartbeat, the elevated blood pressure, and this murmur, I want to order a few tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. I'd like to get an EKG to look at your heart's electrical activity, and a blood test to check your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and rule out any other potential problems. I'm also going to order an echocardiogram, which is an ultrasound of your heart, to get a better look at the structure and function of your heart. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Tests? More tests? Hmph. Fine. But I busy man. When I can do these tests? And how long it take? My wife… she make plans. I need to know. And what if these tests… bad? Just tell me quick. No time for long explanations.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand your concern. We can schedule the EKG and blood test for tomorrow morning at the clinic. They usually take about 30-45 minutes total. The echocardiogram will take a little longer, about an hour, and we can schedule that for later in the week, say Thursday?
PATIENT: Thursday? Hmph. Fine. But I need to know result quick. Very quick. My wife… she worry. And I no want to worry her. And I no want to be sick. Just… fix it. And tell me if I need to change my diet. She make me eat lots of vegetables. I no like vegetables. Just tell me what I need to do. Quick.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will arrange for the results to be expedited. We should have them back by early next week. In the meantime, to be on the safe side, let's focus on a few things. It's good that your wife encourages you to eat vegetables - a heart-healthy diet is important. Try to limit your salt intake as much as possible, and avoid processed foods. Also, I'm going to prescribe you a low-dose blood pressure medication to help get things under control. It's a small dose, and we'll monitor you closely to see how you respond. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Pills? I no like pills. You keep giving me pills. Is this necessary? I told you, I no want side effects. What if I sleepy? What if I get dizzy? My wife… she need me to fix things. I need to be strong. Is there… anything else I can do? Without pills? Just tell me. Quick.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about the pills, Mr. Sobkowicz. You’re right to be cautious. We’re starting with a very low dose, and we’ll closely monitor you for any side effects. If you experience any dizziness or excessive sleepiness, we can adjust the dose or try a different medication. Before we jump to a different medication, let's see if we can manage it with lifestyle changes first. I recommend starting a walking program, if you're able. Even 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week can make a big difference. We can also discuss stress management techniques to help lower your blood pressure. But given your current blood pressure and the murmur, I still believe starting a low-dose medication is the safest option. If you are not comfortable with that right now, we can delay it, but it will require more frequent monitoring of your blood pressure and closer attention to your symptoms. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Walking? Hmph. I walk. I fix things. That is exercise. And stress? My wife is the stress. But fine. I try walking more. And I no yell at her. Maybe. But no pills. Not yet. If walking not work… then we talk pills. But not now. And tell me… what is this murmur really? Is bad? You keep saying safe. I want truth. Quick.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Sobkowicz, I appreciate your willingness to try the walking and stress management first. We can definitely do that. The murmur… it’s a sound your heart makes, and it can be caused by a number of things. Sometimes it's harmless, a normal variation. But it can also be a sign of a valve problem or other structural issue. The echocardiogram will give us a clear picture of what's causing it. I want to be honest with you: It's possible it’s something serious, but it's equally possible it's not. That’s why we need the echocardiogram. "Safe" means I want to err on the side of caution given your age and family history. Starting a low-dose medication now can help protect your heart while we figure out the cause of the murmur. But I respect your wishes and we will go with the lifestyle changes first. I will order the echocardiogram for Thursday, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for next week to discuss the results. In the meantime, please try to increase your walking and manage your stress levels. If you experience any chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: No. No more questions. Just… fix it. And no pills. Not yet. I go now. Wife waiting. And she make dinner. Don’t want to make her angry. Thank you. Maybe. .
