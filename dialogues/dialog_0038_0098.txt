DOCTOR: Good morning, Demondre. I'm Neeraj Auelua, but you can call me Neeraj. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Neeraj. Thanks for havin' me. Just… curiosity, really. Never been to a doctor much 'fore, wanted to see what it was like. Been workin' on the boats a long time, feelin' okay, just thought I should get checked out, ya know? Preventative stuff.
DOCTOR: Right, that’s a very sensible approach, Demondre. Preventative care is excellent. It’s good you’re thinking about this now. Just to get a baseline, I'll ask you some questions about your health history and do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds good. Whatever you need to do is fine with me. Quick exam is good, don't wanna be away from the boats too long, but I understand. Ask away.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Let's start with the basics then. You said you've been working on boats for a long time – roughly how long?
PATIENT: Uh, lemme think… started when I was 18, so… about seven years now. Mostly oilin' the engines and keepin' things runnin' smooth. It's good work, keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: Seven years, alright. And where abouts are you usually working?
PATIENT: Mostly around the Gulf Coast. Sometimes we head out into the deep water, but mostly stickin' close to shore. Louisiana, Texas, that kinda area. It gets hot, but you get used to it. Lots of sun, lots of salt water.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. That exposure to sun and saltwater can be relevant. Now, have you had any significant illnesses or injuries while working or otherwise in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm... nothin' major. A few bad sunburns, of course, and I twisted my ankle once fallin' down some stairs on a ship. Healed up okay. Had the flu a couple of times, like anyone. But nothin' that kept me outta work for long. I'm pretty sturdy, I think.
DOCTOR: Good, good. It's helpful to know you consider yourself generally healthy. Any surgeries or hospital stays, ever?
PATIENT: Nope, never had surgery. Never been in the hospital, 'cept for when I was born, I guess! I've been lucky, I think. Just try to take care of myself, eat decent, get enough sleep when I can. Boat life makes sleep kinda tricky sometimes, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to hear. Now, thinking about your family – do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My… my mom had some trouble with her blood pressure when she got older, I think. And my grandpa, on my dad’s side, he had somethin' with his heart, I remember hearin'. But I don’t really know much about it, to be honest. We weren’t a real close family, ya know? Didn’t talk about stuff like that much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It's good you remembered what you did. High blood pressure and heart conditions are worth noting. Now, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothin' at all. Just water, usually. Sometimes coffee, when I need a boost. I try to eat a good breakfast, but boat food ain’t always the healthiest, ya know? Mostly just stickin' to the basics.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else like that?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything. I've been around different foods on the boats, and never had a problem. I'm pretty easy-goin' when it comes to food, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. So, no known allergies, no medications… that’s a good start. Now, just to get a better picture, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Uh… lifestyle? I work a lot, mostly. Long hours on the boats. When I'm not workin', I usually just try to relax. See friends when I can, watch some TV. I used to play basketball, but I haven't had much time for that lately. Mostly just… chillin', ya know? Tryin' to recover from work. Not much excitement, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good idea. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Nope, never touched 'em. My dad smoked, and he had a real rough time with it, so I always stayed away. Bad for ya, ya know? I prefer fresh air, especially out on the water.
DOCTOR: Good. And how much alcohol do you drink, if any?
PATIENT: Not a lot. A beer sometimes with dinner, maybe on a weekend. But nothin' heavy. I gotta be on the boats, gotta be clear-headed. So, I don't really drink much anymore. A social drink now and then, but that's about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. That’s helpful to know. Last question for this part, do you have any concerns about your health at all?
PATIENT: Hmm... not really concerns, but sometimes I get a little tired, after a long shift. Just normal tiredness, I think. And my back gets a little sore from bendin' and liftin', but that's part of the job, ya know? Just wanted to make sure everything was okay, that's all. Preventative stuff, like I said. No real worries, just checkin' in.
DOCTOR: Okay, Demondre, that's all very helpful. It sounds like you're generally healthy, but we can definitely look at that tiredness and back soreness. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's fine. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable or somethin'. I'm ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Excellent. If you wouldn't mind stepping onto the table, we’ll start with your height and weight. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and take a look in your ears and throat. It shouldn’t take long. Let's start with your height.
PATIENT: Alright. You just tell me what to do. Never done this before, ya know? I'm six foot, give or take. I always figured I was pretty tall.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, you’re exactly six foot, and weigh 91 kilograms. That puts your BMI at… We'll discuss that in a bit. Now, if you could just loosen your shirt, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope. Just breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright, loosen my shirt… got it. Just breathe normally, you said? Okay. I can hear that thing tickin', kinda weird. Is everything okay so far?
DOCTOR: Yes, everything is perfectly fine so far. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Now, could you take a deep breath and hold it while I listen again?
PATIENT: Like this? Is it okay? I'm not very good at holdin' my breath for long. Boat air ain't always the cleanest, ya know?
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Both lungs sound clear and equal. Now I'm going to check your reflexes. This might be a little surprising, but it shouldn’t hurt. Just relax your arm. I'm going to gently tap this on your tendon here.
PATIENT: Tap it… okay. Just tell me if somethin' feels wrong. I get kinda jumpy sometimes. Boat life keeps ya on edge, ya know?
DOCTOR: Good reflexes. Both are present and equal. Now, let's take a quick look at your ears and throat. This might be a little cold, but it won't hurt. Just open your mouth and say "Ah".
PATIENT: Ahhh… is it cold? I always get a chill when somethin' goes in my ears. Used to swim a lot as a kid, got ear infections all the time.
DOCTOR: Ears look clear, no signs of infection. Throat looks normal, no redness or swelling. Everything looks good so far, Demondre. Your vitals are all within normal limits. Now, let's talk about that tiredness and back soreness…
PATIENT: That’s good to hear, ya know? Been worryin' a little. Tiredness and back soreness… yeah, that’s mostly just from the work, I think. Long hours, heavy liftin’. But sometimes it lingers, even when I'm off the boat. It's not terrible, just… annoying. Makes it hard to relax sometimes. What do you think it could be?
DOCTOR: Okay, it's good you've noticed it lingering, that's useful information. Given your work, the back soreness is likely musculoskeletal – meaning related to your muscles, ligaments, and joints. Prolonged heavy lifting and repetitive movements can definitely strain those areas. The tiredness could be related to that, or it could be a number of other things, like sleep quality, hydration, or even just general stress. To get a better understanding, I'd like to ask a few more specific questions about your tiredness. When does it usually happen?
PATIENT: Hmm... usually it hits me in the evenings, after a long shift. Like a heavy weight just pressin' down on me. And sometimes it lingers into the next day, even after I've gotten some sleep. It ain’t like I'm fallin' asleep on my feet or nothin', just… sluggish, ya know? Not much energy. And it gets worse when I'm not gettin' enough sleep, which happens a lot on the boat. The engine noise, the waves… it's hard to get a good eight hours.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds consistent with fatigue. Is it a constant tiredness, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s more of a come and go thing, I guess. Some days I feel alright, especially if I get a decent night's sleep. But other days, it just hits me like a wall. After a particularly hard shift, or if I haven't slept well for a couple of nights. It's kinda unpredictable, ya know? Makes it hard to plan anything when I'm off the boat, 'cause I don't know if I'm gonna have the energy to do anything.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. And with the back soreness, where exactly do you feel it?
PATIENT: Mostly in my lower back, kinda towards the middle. Sometimes it radiates down my legs a little, but not too bad. It gets worse when I bend over, or lift somethin' heavy, obviously. And if I sit for too long, it gets stiff and achy. When I lay down, it usually feels a little better, but it’s never completely gone, ya know? It’s just… always there, kinda naggin' at me.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back with some radiating pain – that suggests possible muscle strain or even some nerve irritation. To rule out anything more serious, I'd like to order some bloodwork. It will check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and look for any signs of inflammation. We can also do a urine test to rule out any infection. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds fine. Bloodwork and urine test, okay. Whatever you need to do to figure it out. I just want to make sure everything's alright. Don't wanna let it get too bad, ya know? When can we do that? And… is it gonna be expensive? Medicare cover that kinda stuff?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, we want to get this sorted. The bloodwork and urine test are both standard tests, and Medicare should cover most of the cost, though there may be a small co-pay depending on your specific plan. We can do them right here in the clinic today. It’ll just take a few minutes to draw the blood and collect a urine sample. I'll give you the necessary paperwork for Medicare, and our billing department can help with any questions you have about coverage. Do you have any issues with needles, or any allergies to latex?
PATIENT: No, I'm alright with needles, never had a problem. And no allergies to latex, as far as I know. Never had a reaction to anything like that. I just… don't like bein' stuck, ya know? But I'll manage. If you gotta stick me, you gotta stick me. Just let me know when you're ready. I appreciate you explainin' everything, makes me feel a lot better.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. We'll get you in and out quickly. Let's head over to the lab, and we’ll get the samples collected. I’ll have the results sent to me within a few days, and we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, I recommend avoiding heavy lifting when possible, and using good body mechanics when you do lift something. Also, make sure you're staying well-hydrated and getting as much rest as you can. Do you have any questions for me before we head back?
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Avoid heavy lifting, stay hydrated, rest… got it. No, I don’t think I have any questions right now. You explained everything pretty clear. Just… appreciate you takin’ the time to listen, ya know? A lot of doctors don't really listen. I’m ready when you are. Let's go get this over with.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The technician will draw a small amount of blood and collect a urine sample. It shouldn’t take long. Once they’re finished, they’ll give you some instructions on how to care for the area. I’ll see you back here in a few days to discuss the results. If you experience any excessive bleeding or pain after the blood draw, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic. .
PATIENT: .
