DOCTOR: Hi Lucia, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. It’s August 2nd. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Chriselda. It's nice to meet you too. Um… I keep belching. A lot. It’s… embarrassing, really. I just wanted to see if it was something bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It can be embarrassing, but we’ll figure it out. "A lot" is pretty vague, though. Could you tell me a little more about when it started, how often it happens, and if anything seems to trigger it, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… when did it start? Maybe a couple weeks ago? It happens… a lot after I eat, usually. And if I drink something fizzy, definitely more. Not always, but… mostly. I don’t think anything else makes it worse. Just food and bubbles, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a couple of weeks, triggered by eating and carbonated beverages. That’s helpful. Are you experiencing any other symptoms along with the belching?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like… other things wrong? No, not really. Maybe… sometimes my stomach feels a little full, even when I haven’t eaten much. But that doesn't always happen. I don't have pain or anything. Just… the burps.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, just fullness sometimes and the belching. And you said it started a couple weeks ago?
PATIENT: Yes, about two weeks ago. I don't remember anything special happening right before it started. Just… one day I started burping more than usual, and it hasn't really stopped. It’s just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: Changes in my diet? Not really. I eat pretty much the same things all the time. Rice and beans a lot, sometimes chicken. I like to have a soda with lunch sometimes, but I’ve always done that. No, I don’t think so. Nothing different.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you taking any medications currently, or do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: No medications. And no allergies that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, at least not that I remember. I'm pretty healthy, usually. Just… this burping thing.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your stomach and rule out anything obvious. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best. I want to figure out what’s going on.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Please lie back on the examination table. I'm going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Just relax and breathe normally. Okay… I’m hearing normal bowel sounds. No unusual gurgling or anything concerning. I'm going to gently press on your abdomen now. Let me know if you feel any pain or discomfort. No tenderness to palpation. Everything feels… normal. Okay, that’s good. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing excessive gas, possibly related to diet or swallowing air. It’s usually not serious.
PATIENT: Excessive gas? So it’s not… something really bad? I was worried it was my stomach or something. What can I do about it? Is there something I should eat or not eat?
DOCTOR: No, it doesn’t sound like anything serious at all, thankfully. Excessive gas is very common. A lot of times, it's just a matter of identifying triggers. You mentioned soda, which is a big one – the carbonation releases gas. Certain foods, like beans, broccoli, cabbage, and onions, can also contribute. We can try a few things. First, try to avoid carbonated beverages for a while and see if that helps. Eating smaller meals, eating slowly, and chewing your food thoroughly can also reduce the amount of air you swallow. You can also try over-the-counter simethicone which helps break up gas bubbles. Do you think you could try making some of those changes and see if it improves?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… doable. No soda, smaller meals, chew better. I can try that. And I’ll look for that… simethicone. Gas-X? Is there anything else? Should I be worried if it doesn’t get better?
DOCTOR: Yes, Gas-X is the brand name, simethicone is the medication. Try those changes for a week or two, and if it doesn't improve, or if you develop any other symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or weight loss, then definitely come back and see me. Also, if you notice any blood in your stool, that's something to get checked out right away. But for now, let's see if these simple changes help. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. No soda, smaller meals, and watch for bad stuff. I appreciate you explaining it to me. Thank you, Chriselda.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lucia. I'm glad I could help. If it doesn't improve, or if you develop any of those other symptoms, don’t hesitate to come back. And remember, I'm here if you have any other concerns. Have a good day!
