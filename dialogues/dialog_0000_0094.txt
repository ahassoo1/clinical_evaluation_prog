DOCTOR: Well, Ms. Fontanazza, it says here you're 33. Good. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Um... the lady on the phone said something about... learning? I don't really remember. My husband, he made the appointment. He worries too much. It's just... stuff. Work stuff, maybe.
DOCTOR: "Stuff," right. And your husband felt this "stuff" warranted a doctor's visit. I see. Well, let's try to be a little more specific then, shall we?
PATIENT: Specific? Honestly, I don't do specific. I work with metal all day, big sheets of it. It's... physical. Not a lot of thinking. Maybe my hands are sore? Sometimes. I don't know. What kind of learning are we talking about here? Is this about my back? It aches a bit when it rains.
DOCTOR: Right. Metal work. And aches with the rain. It appears your husband mentioned some… difficulty remembering things when he made the appointment. Something about “cognitive concerns.” Is that what he meant by “learning”?
PATIENT: Cognitive... what now? He said what? He’s making me sound like… like an old lady! I remember plenty! I remember he left his socks on the floor again this morning. And that the noodles were too salty last night. See? Plenty. He just… worries. It's annoying, really.
DOCTOR: Well, remembering socks and noodles is… good. But cognitive concerns generally refer to difficulties with memory, thinking, problem-solving… things beyond everyday recollections. It's not necessarily about being "old." It can happen for many reasons. Let’s try a few simple questions, if you don’t mind. Just to get a baseline. Do you find yourself getting lost in familiar places?
PATIENT: Lost? No! Of course not. I take the same route to work every day. Though… last month, there was that new building going up, and I did take a wrong turn. It looked different. Everything looks different with construction. But that’s not… getting lost. That's just… change. Are you trying to tell me something is wrong with me? Because honestly, I feel fine. Just a little tired. Work is hard, you know?
DOCTOR: I’m not trying to tell you anything is “wrong,” Ms. Fontanazza. I’m simply gathering information. Construction does change things, that's a fair point. Fatigue can certainly affect memory as well. Let’s move on. Do you have any difficulty with names?
PATIENT: Names? Sometimes. There's… Old Man Hemlock down the street. I always forget if his name is Hemlock or… something else. And that new girl at the hardware store, the one with the… curly hair. I know I’ve met her three times, but I always have to ask her name again. But everyone forgets names! It's normal. It doesn't mean my brain is… failing. Does it?
DOCTOR: It doesn't mean your brain is failing, Ms. Fontanazza. However, repeatedly forgetting names can be a sign of something that requires attention. Let's try a different tack. Have you noticed any changes in your ability to manage tasks at work?
PATIENT: Tasks? Well… the new metal they're using is… trickier. It's thinner, harder to bend without creasing. I had to redo a whole sheet last week. That young apprentice, Kevin, he keeps messing up the angles too. It's probably his fault, honestly. He doesn't pay attention. Everything’s harder now. More complicated. Not because I'm doing anything wrong. It's everything else!
DOCTOR: Alright. So, newer metal, apprentice issues…Let's talk about your physical health for a moment. You mentioned fatigue, and aches. Any other physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Not really. I get headaches sometimes. Mostly when it’s hot and dusty at work. And my hands… they’re always sore. From bending the metal, you know? It’s hard work. I take some… pills. The red ones. My husband gives them to me. For the aches. I don’t really pay attention to what they are. Just… sore. Always.
DOCTOR: "Red pills," you say. Do you know the dosage or what they're for, specifically?
PATIENT: Honestly, no! He just says "take these." I don't ask questions. He's the one who worries about all that stuff. I just… take them. They help the aches, that's all that matters. He’s always telling me what to do. Take pills, eat this, don't work too hard… It’s exhausting, honestly. I don't remember what's on the bottle. I don’t even look at the bottle.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fontanazza, it's important for you to know what medications you are taking. Taking pills without knowing what they are, or the dosage, can be dangerous. We need to find out what those "red pills" are. Do you have the bottle with you?
PATIENT: Dangerous? He's a very careful man! He wouldn’t give me something dangerous. …Let me see… keys, wallet, lipstick… Ah! Here. But I still think he knows what he's doing. He's the worrier, remember?
DOCTOR: Hmm. It’s… Ibuprofen, 800mg. Three times a day. And… Ms. Fontanazza, this is a very high dosage of Ibuprofen. Long-term use at this level can cause serious side effects, including stomach ulcers, kidney damage, and even heart problems. Did your husband tell you why he's having you take this amount?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen? 800mg? That much? No… No, he never said anything. He just said it was for the aches. He just… gives me the pills. I thought… I thought it was just a stronger painkiller. Oh dear… He didn't say anything about… ulcers or… the heart. He just wants me to be able to work. He worries about my job. He says I need the money. What should I do?
DOCTOR: Okay. First, we need to stop taking the Ibuprofen at this dosage immediately. It's likely causing some of the fatigue and other issues you've described. We'll need to run some blood tests to check your kidney function and look for any signs of stomach bleeding. I'm also going to recommend a consultation with a gastroenterologist to evaluate your stomach. As for your husband… I understand he’s concerned, but it’s essential for you to be fully informed about your medications. We'll also need to talk about your memory concerns, which could be related to a number of factors, including the Ibuprofen. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Blood tests? A… a what-now-ologist? Oh dear. Allergies… I don't think so. I ate some shrimp once, and my lips got a little tingly, but that was years ago. Not really an allergy, I think. Mostly, I just get… heartburn. Especially after spicy food. This is… a lot. Is something really wrong with me? Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It’s okay to be worried, Ms. Fontanazza. We’re going to figure this out. The blood tests and the consultation with the gastroenterologist are just to get a clearer picture of what's going on. The heartburn could be related to the Ibuprofen, or it could be something else entirely. It's too early to say definitively. It's good that you don’t have any known allergies. We'll order the blood tests right away. The lab is just down the hall. And I’ll get a referral sent to Dr. Lee, a very good gastroenterologist. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks to discuss the results and explore potential causes for your memory concerns. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Two weeks… That sounds… okay. As long as it helps. I just… I don't want to lose my job. And I don’t want to worry my husband. He gets so stressed. Maybe… maybe I should talk to him about this. Tell him I need to know what I’m taking. But he gets so defensive… He thinks I don’t understand. So, the blood tests… and the stomach doctor… and then talk to my husband. Is that right? I can do that. Just… please, make sure it's not serious.
DOCTOR: That's exactly right. Blood tests, consultation with Dr. Lee, and a conversation with your husband. It's good you're willing to talk to him; open communication is important. We'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. I'll write up a referral for Dr. Lee and a lab order for the blood tests. The nurse will be in shortly to take your blood pressure and go over some instructions for the bloodwork. And I’m scheduling you for a follow-up appointment with me in two weeks, on August 16th, at 10:00 AM. In the meantime, please stop taking the Ibuprofen at this dosage. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s everything. You explained it all very clearly. August 16th… I’ll remember that. And stop the pills… Thank you, Dr. Batara. You’ve been very kind. I hope it’s nothing too bad.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Fontanazza. I'm glad I could help. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. “Patient presents with vague symptoms and potential medication overuse… High Ibuprofen dosage, needs immediate attention… Husband involved, possible communication barriers… Cognitive assessment needed… Follow-up scheduled.” .
