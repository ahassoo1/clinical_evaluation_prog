DOCTOR: Hi Manuel, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Yoshino. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Is… Yoshino, you say? Yes. Good to meet you too. My wife… she wants a baby. We… we have been trying. Not… not easy, you know? We want to… make sure everything is okay. That is why we are here. I think. Maybe? I forget sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, Manuel. That’s perfectly alright, and it's very common to feel a little unsure when talking about this. It's great that you and your wife are thinking proactively. So, you've been trying to conceive, and you'd like to check to make sure everything is alright on your end. That's a good first step. To help me understand things better, could you tell me a little bit more about how long you’ve been trying?
PATIENT: Hmm… how long? A while. Maybe… six months? Seven? Time… it goes fast now, you know. Not like when I was young, building the little… the models. Metal ones. We didn't worry about time then. Is that helpful? I don't keep good track. My wife, she remembers things better.
DOCTOR: That is helpful, Manuel. Six or seven months is good to know. It's alright if you don't have exact dates, we can work with an estimate. And it's very common to lose track of time! So, about six to seven months of trying. Have you and your wife been trying consistently during that time?
PATIENT: Consistently… You mean… every month? Yes. I think so. My wife… she has a calendar. She reminds me. I sometimes forget. She is very good at keeping things… on track. We try, yes. Every month. When… when the time is right. She knows about these things. I build the models, she… she makes babies.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, you're timing things with your wife's cycle, and you’re being consistent with that. That's excellent. Now, Manuel, have either of you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions that might affect fertility?
PATIENT: Medical conditions…? Hmm… I had a bad knee once. From the metal work. But that is fixed now. A long time ago. My wife… she had something when she was young. A… a fever, maybe? But she got better. She is strong. She doesn’t talk much about… sickness. She likes to be healthy. I don't think so, no. Nothing… serious, I think. Is that what you mean? I forget the words the doctors use sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a previous knee injury for you, and your wife had a fever when she was younger. That's helpful information, thank you. Now, I'd like to ask a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any current medical problems like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart issues?
PATIENT: Diabetes… high blood pressure… No. No, I don’t think so. I feel… okay. A little tired sometimes, from the work. But old age, you know? I eat good food. My wife cooks. She makes everything healthy. No special… problems. I go to the doctor sometimes for check-ups. They say I am… okay for my age. They give me the… the needle. Every year. Is that what you mean? Like… sickness? I don't have sickness. Just old.
DOCTOR: Okay, so no known diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart issues. And you get an annual check-up and a vaccination – that's excellent! It sounds like you’re generally healthy, and that’s great. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – your parents, siblings, or grandparents – had any trouble having children?
PATIENT: Trouble having children… Hmm… That is a hard question. My family… we didn’t talk much about these things. When I was young, we didn’t talk about… bodies. My mother… she had many children. I have brothers and sisters. They all… had children. I think so. But my wife’s family… I don’t know. I haven’t met many of them. She doesn’t talk much about her past. Sorry… I wish I could tell you more. It is… a long time ago. And I forget so much.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Manuel. It's very common for families not to discuss these things openly, and it's not something you should feel bad about not knowing. Okay, let's move on to your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never. Bad for the lungs, you know? Alcohol… sometimes. A little wine with dinner. My wife likes a little wine too. Not much. Maybe one glass. Sometimes. Drugs? No. Never. I build the models. Metal and plastic. That is enough for me. A quiet life. That is what I like. No… bad things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you don't smoke, and you only drink a little wine occasionally. That's good to know. Now, I'd like to ask about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements.
PATIENT: Medications… Hmm… let me see. The doctor gives me a pill. Every day. For my… for my oldness, I think. To keep me… strong. Is that what you mean? And sometimes, when my knee hurts, I take a little pill for that too. But not often. Otherwise… no. I don’t take much. My wife gives me vitamins sometimes. For my health. Little pills. But I don’t remember the names. She keeps them in the kitchen. That is where she keeps everything. I am not very good with these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take a daily pill for general health and occasionally take something for your knee. Your wife also gives you vitamins. We’ll try to get a list of those from your pharmacy and her if possible. Now, Manuel, before we move on, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm… I don’t think so. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. When I was a little boy, I got stung by a bee once. But that was a long time ago. My wife is careful about what she cooks. She always checks the labels. So, no. No allergies. I don’t think so. I am a simple man. I don’t eat strange foods. Just good, healthy things. From the market. That is all.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good to know. Alright, Manuel, that gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a brief physical exam, if that’s alright with you. We’ll just check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your general health. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Physical exam… Yes. Yes, that is fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. I am an old man. I need to make sure everything is… working. I hope it doesn’t take too long. My wife is waiting. She makes a very good tea. But do what you need to do. I am ready.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. It won't take long, Manuel. First, let's check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but nothing to be overly concerned about at this point. We can keep an eye on it. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Your abdomen is soft, and I don't feel any abnormalities. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is common for someone your age. Okay, Manuel, everything seems to be within normal limits, for a man of your age. But to be thorough, I’d like to order a semen analysis to assess your sperm count and motility. This will help us understand if there are any potential issues on your end. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Semen analysis…? You want… what? What does that involve? I don’t… I don’t understand. Is that painful? My wife… she will want to know. I don’t like… strange tests. Is there another way? I just want to make sure… everything is okay. For the baby.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Manuel. It's a perfectly normal question to ask. A semen analysis is a simple test where you'll provide a sample of semen. It's collected in a private setting, and it's not painful at all. It just helps us look at the number and movement of sperm, which are important for getting pregnant. We'll give you very clear instructions on how to collect the sample. You’ll be provided with a private room and all the necessary materials. It's a very common test, and it gives us a lot of information to help determine if there are any issues. We can discuss the results with you and your wife afterward and decide on the best course of action. It's not something to be embarrassed about; it’s simply part of the process of trying to conceive. Would you like me to explain the process in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Okay… explain it. Slowly. My wife… she will want to know everything. I don’t want to have to explain it again. I am an old man. I don't understand these things. But… if it helps make a baby… then I will do it. Just… slowly. And gently. Like you said. Explain everything. And tell me… is it very embarrassing? I don't want to feel… silly.
DOCTOR: Of course, Manuel. I completely understand your concerns. It’s perfectly normal to feel a little uneasy about this. Okay, so here’s how it works. You’ll be given a sterile container – a small, plastic cup – and a private room. You'll be asked to abstain from sexual activity for two to three days before the test. This helps ensure the sample is accurate. When you’re ready, you’ll simply collect a sample of semen in the container. It’s a private process, and you’ll have complete privacy. Once you’ve collected the sample, you’ll bring it to the lab, and we’ll take it from there. The lab will analyze the sample for things like sperm count, motility – that means how well the sperm move – and morphology, which is the shape of the sperm. As for whether it’s embarrassing… not at all. Our staff is very professional and discreet, and they understand this can be a sensitive topic. It's a routine test, and they deal with it every day. You won’t be judged or made to feel uncomfortable in any way. We’ll explain all the results to you and your wife in detail, and we can discuss any concerns you may have. It's a step towards understanding what's going on and making sure you have the best chance of having a baby. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Two to three days… no… activity. Yes. I can remember that. My wife will be happy to know that part. A plastic cup… and then… I bring it to the lab. Yes. I think I understand. But… what if… what if there aren't many? What if they don't move well? Will that mean… I can't have a baby? That is what I am worried about. I just want to make my wife happy. She wants a baby so much.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Manuel, and it's good that you're asking. It’s important to remember that a semen analysis is just one piece of the puzzle. If the results are not ideal, it doesn't necessarily mean you can't have a baby. There are many things we can do to help. For example, sometimes lifestyle changes – like improving diet or reducing stress – can improve sperm quality. There are also medications and other treatments available that can help increase sperm count and motility. In some cases, we might recommend further testing for you or your wife to identify any underlying issues. And if necessary, there are assisted reproductive technologies – like in vitro fertilization – that can help you conceive. We wouldn’t jump to those right away. We’d explore all other options first. The important thing is to get the information we need so we can develop a plan that's right for you and your wife. Don’t worry about the “what ifs” just yet. Let’s get the analysis done, and then we can talk about the results and explore all the possibilities. We’ll be with you every step of the way. Do you want me to write down the instructions for the analysis?
PATIENT: Yes… please. Write down the instructions. My wife… she is very organized. She will want to see it written down. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. I feel… a little better now. Less worried. It is good to know there are… other options. If things aren't good. I just want to make my wife happy. That is all. And… thank you again. For being… gentle. And understanding. It is not easy, talking about these things. Especially for an old man like me.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Manuel. It’s my job to be gentle and understanding. There’s absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. It takes courage to talk about these things, and I’m glad you came to me. Here you are. It includes everything you need to know – the preparation instructions, where to collect the sample, and the contact information for the lab. If you or your wife have any questions at all, please don’t hesitate to call. We’re here to support you both. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Manuel?
PATIENT: No… I think that is all. Thank you, Doctor Yoshino. You have been very kind. And patient. I will… talk to my wife. And we will… get the test done. Thank you again. For everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Manuel. I’m glad I could help. Please give my best to your wife, and remember, we’re here if you need anything. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions at all. Have a good day, and I wish you and your wife all the best.
