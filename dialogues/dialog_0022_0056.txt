DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schlatterer. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Schlatterer will do. Honestly, I haven’t much time for… pleasantries. I was told this was the quickest route to getting a note. A note to excuse me from… well, from things. From the university. It’s all rather… bothersome.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. We’ll certainly try to be efficient. A note for the university… Is there a specific reason you need this note?
PATIENT: Specific? Honestly, Doctor, does it matter? It’s… the students, mostly. And the… paperwork. An endless sea of paperwork. They expect originality, you see? Originality! After decades of grading, it’s all the same. Simply… draining. It’s affecting my… concentration. Yes, my concentration. I find myself… forgetting things. Small things, of course. Though, I suspect it’s more than small these days.
DOCTOR: I see. So, it sounds like the stress related to your work at the university—the grading, the expectations, the paperwork—is contributing to some difficulty with concentration and memory. Is that a fair assessment?
PATIENT: A fair assessment. Yes, I suppose. Though, I wouldn't use such… pedestrian language. It's not merely “difficulty,” Doctor. It's a… degradation. A slow erosion of one’s faculties. Honestly, the youth of today have no respect for… rigor. They submit… substandard work, and expect praise. It's simply… demoralizing. Are we going to discuss this endlessly, or are you going to write the note?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you’re experiencing a significant amount of stress and burnout related to your work, and that’s understandably affecting you. Before I write a note, I’d like to gather a bit more information, if you’re willing. Just to ensure I’m documenting everything accurately and to rule out anything else that might be contributing to these changes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: “Rule out anything else”? Doctor, with all due respect, I am a highly educated man. I assure you, there is nothing “else”. It’s the university. The students. The endless, pointless… administration. Very well. Ask your questions. But be swift about it. I have a great deal to accomplish today.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Schlatterer. I completely respect your experience and intellect. I simply want to be thorough. Let’s start with your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions? Doctor, I assure you, my health is… adequate. I haven't bothered with doctors for… decades. A slight cold, perhaps, now and then. Nothing of consequence. I do take a daily multivitamin, if that’s what you’re angling for. My father had… something with his heart, I believe. But that was a long time ago, and I'm nothing like him. Are we making progress, or shall I simply request the administrator’s direct number?
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Mr. Schlatterer. It’s helpful. Just to clarify, when you say something with your father’s heart, do you recall any specific details – like what he was diagnosed with, or the approximate age he was diagnosed?
PATIENT: Details? Doctor, I was a child! Do you expect me to recall medical specifics from seventy years ago? It was… a heart ailment. He grew tired easily, I suppose. He retired early. That’s all I remember. Honestly, this is… tedious. Is a simple note truly so difficult? I’ve far more important matters to attend to. I’m attempting to catalog a rare collection of Bulgarian folklore. That is important work.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. No need to strain yourself with details. Let's move on to medications. Besides the multivitamin, are you currently taking any other medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Doctor, are you implying I'm… frail? I assure you, I maintain a robust constitution. I take the occasional aspirin for a headache, perhaps. And a digestive biscuit with my tea, if that counts. But medications? Absolutely not. I prefer natural remedies. And a strong sense of discipline. Honestly, the youth of today rely far too heavily on pills. It’s a societal ill.
DOCTOR: Thank you. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms lately, besides the difficulty with concentration and memory?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Doctor, I’m not ill. I'm… fatigued. Naturally. Given the circumstances. The endless grading, the impertinence of the students… It’s exhausting! And sometimes, I find myself… irritable. Yes, quite irritable. Especially when confronted with… substandard work. But these are not symptoms! These are the natural reactions of a cultivated mind subjected to… indignity. Honestly, I fail to see the relevance of these questions.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of stress and frustration, which is understandably leading to fatigue and irritability. To ensure I have a complete picture, I'd like to ask a few more questions, if you don't mind. It’s just to rule out any underlying factors that might be contributing to these feelings. Have you noticed any changes in your sleep patterns recently?
PATIENT: Sleep? Doctor, my sleep is… adequate. Though, admittedly, I find myself waking up earlier than usual. And sometimes, I have… unsettling dreams. About grading. Endless stacks of papers, all filled with… nonsense. It’s quite unpleasant. But I assure you, this is merely a result of the… intellectual strain. It's not a medical condition! Honestly, I’m beginning to regret this entire exercise.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Schlatterer. Dreams can be very telling. And it’s not uncommon to experience vivid dreams during times of stress. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite lately?
PATIENT: Appetite? Doctor, I have always had a… discerning palate. I enjoy a light breakfast, a sensible lunch, and a modest dinner. Though, admittedly, I haven't been as enthusiastic about my evening tea and biscuits lately. The… aroma seems less appealing. It's probably the stress. Everything tastes… bland. As if all the joy has been leached from the world. Honestly, I'm starting to feel quite agitated. Are we nearly finished?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. Just a quick check. I'm going to take your blood pressure and pulse. It’s just a routine part of the assessment. Please extend your arm. Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your pulse is a bit irregular. Just noting that for now. Let's listen to your heart and lungs quickly. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Elevated? Irregular? Doctor, I assure you, my heart is perfectly sound! It has endured decades of… intellectual exertion. I fail to see the relevance of these… measurements. Honestly, I'm beginning to suspect you’re attempting to diagnose me with some… fabricated ailment. Very well, if you must. But be swift about it. I have important work to attend to.
DOCTOR: Alright, just listening now. Okay, I’m hearing some slight crackles in your lungs, and a faint murmur in your heart. Nothing alarming, but worth noting. And just a quick check of your reflexes... Okay, reflexes are a bit diminished. Mr. Schlatterer, based on what you've told me, and the findings of this brief examination, I think it would be prudent to order some further tests – a blood test to check your overall health, and an EKG to assess your heart rhythm. It's just to rule out anything that might be contributing to your fatigue, irritability, and memory concerns. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Tests? Further tests? Doctor, are you suggesting I'm… infirm? I assure you, I'm perfectly capable of continuing my work. I’ve dedicated my life to scholarship! I find your insinuations… insulting. I came here for a note, a simple note to excuse me from the university's… bureaucracy. Not a battery of medical examinations. No. Absolutely not. I will not be subjected to further… probing. I want the note, Doctor. A simple note stating that I am experiencing workplace stress and require a period of respite. And then, I wish to be left in peace. I find this entire encounter… deeply unsatisfactory.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schlatterer. I understand your frustration. I apologize if I’ve caused any offense. I was simply trying to be thorough, and ensure your health is being adequately addressed. Here you are. This note states that you are experiencing significant workplace stress and would benefit from a period of respite. It also mentions the fatigue and difficulty with concentration you've described. However, I strongly encourage you to reconsider the further testing. It’s just to rule out anything that might be contributing to your symptoms. And if you change your mind, please don’t hesitate to schedule another appointment. I wish you all the best, Mr. Schlatterer. .
