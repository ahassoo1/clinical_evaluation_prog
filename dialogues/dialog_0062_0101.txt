DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Decosta. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Pleasure’s all mine. Well, it’s this headache I been havin’. Right at the back of mi head, y’see? Been botherin’ me for… oh, let me think… maybe a week now? Not constant, but it comes and goes.
DOCTOR: Okay, a headache at the back of your head for about a week, coming and going. That gives us a starting point. Can you describe the headache a little more for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… how to describe it… It’s not a throbbing headache, not like a migraine, y’know? More of a… a dull ache, a pressure. Like somethin’ tight around mi head. Sometimes it feels like it’s spreadin’ down mi neck a little bit, too. Not sharp, just… uncomfortable. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. A dull ache and pressure, possibly spreading to your neck. Not sharp, just uncomfortable. And it’s been going on for about a week now. Now, are there any things that seem to make it worse?
PATIENT: Let me think… Well, bein’ in the sun for too long definitely doesn’t help. I does a lot of gardenin’, y’see? Love mi flowers. And if I bend over for too long – trimmin’ bushes or such – it gets worse then too. But just sittin’ quiet, it’s usually alright. Not too bad, anyways. Oh! And when I'm stressed, that makes it worse for sure. Little things can set me off, y'know?
DOCTOR: Right, so sun exposure, bending over, and stress seem to aggravate it. That's helpful. And what about things that make it better?
PATIENT: Hmm… a cool cloth on mi forehead helps a bit. And a nice cup o' tea, chamomile, that usually calms me down and takes the edge off. Sittin' quiet in a dark room helps too, but I don't like bein' in the dark for too long, makes me feel… uneasy. Mostly, it just goes away on its own after a while. But it's been comin' back more often lately, that's what worries me.
DOCTOR: Okay, a cool cloth, chamomile tea, and quiet relaxation offer some relief. It’s good it responds to those things. And you’re right, the increasing frequency is a good reason to take a closer look. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Well, now that you mention it… mi vision gets a little blurry sometimes, but only for a few seconds. Happens maybe once or twice a day. And I been feelin' a little tired lately, more than usual. I thought it was just mi age, to be honest. But… no, that’s about it, really. No nausea, no fever, nothin’ like that. Just the blurry vision and the tiredness.
DOCTOR: Okay, blurry vision occurring intermittently, and increased fatigue. Thank you for sharing that. I'm going to do a quick physical exam now, just to get a better picture of things. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. Go ahead. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I’m just hopin’ it’s not somethin’ too serious, y’know? Old age catchin’ up to me, maybe. But best to be sure.
DOCTOR: Certainly. We'll get to the bottom of it. Okay, Mr. Popova, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 150/90, but that’s not uncommon with stress. Your pulse is regular. Lung sounds are clear. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which can be normal for someone your age, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Strength and sensation seem normal. And when I looked in your eyes, I did notice a little bit of mild swelling of the optic disc, but it’s very subtle. I'm going to note that in your chart. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. The headache, blurry vision, and fatigue, combined with the mild swelling of the optic disc, could be a sign of several things. It could be related to high blood pressure, or even something pressing on the nerves in your head. It's also possible it's just a tension headache, but we need to rule out anything more serious. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies… let me think. No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I take a little somethin’ for mi arthritis, naproxen, but that's it. And I don't take any other pills or nothin’. Arthritis in mi hands, that’s all. Somethin’ pressin’ on the nerves, you say? That sounds… worryin’, Doctor. What would you do to find out what's goin’ on? I’m ready to do whatever you think is best, just tell me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Popova. It’s good you’re willing to work with me. “Something pressing on the nerves” was just one possibility – we aren’t jumping to conclusions. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a couple of tests. First, a complete blood count to check for any underlying infection or anemia. Second, I’d like to get an MRI of your brain, which will give us a detailed look at the structures inside your head and rule out any tumors or other abnormalities. It’s a very safe procedure, just involves lying in a scanner for a little while. And finally, I’d like to check your blood pressure over the next few days, just to see how it fluctuates. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Alright, that sounds… thorough, Doctor. Yes, I suppose so. A scan, you say? I hope it’s not too uncomfortable. I never been in one of them scanners before. And checkin' mi blood pressure, that's no problem. I can do that. So, what happens after you get the results? How long will that take? And… will I be able to drive meself after the scan? I don’t want to bother mi wife too much. She's got enough on her plate.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent questions, Mr. Popova. The MRI usually takes about 30-45 minutes. You’ll lie on a table and a strong magnet creates images of your brain. It can be a little noisy, but we’ll give you earplugs. It’s generally very well-tolerated. As for driving, you can drive yourself home afterwards, as long as you feel completely normal. There are no restrictions, but it’s always a good idea to have someone with you if you feel anxious about it. The results usually come back within 2-3 business days. Once I have them, I’ll call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Alright, 2-3 days… I can manage that. Yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Earplugs, good. I do have sensitive ears. And I’ll drive meself home, I think. I’m a good driver, usually. So, where do I go to get the scan done? And is there anything I need to bring with me? Any special instructions, like not eatin’ anything beforehand? I always forget these things. Wife tells me I’m gettin’ too old!
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to forget things, Mr. Popova, don’t worry about it! You’ll go to Lakeside Imaging, it’s just a few minutes from here. Here’s a referral form and the address. They’ll call you to schedule an appointment time. For the MRI, they’ll ask you to remove any metal jewelry or piercings. They’ll also ask about any implants you might have. You don’t need to fast or do anything special beforehand. Just relax and try not to move during the scan. Do you have any questions about any of that?
PATIENT: Alright, Lakeside Imaging… got it. No need to fast, good. And no metal, I can handle that. I don’t wear much jewelry these days, anyway. I think that’s everything, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, I appreciate it. I'm still a little worried, but I feel better knowin’ we’re gettin’ it checked out. Thank you for takin’ the time to listen to me. Is there anythin’ I need to do now, besides schedule the scan? Like, should I be writin' down when mi headache is worst?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Popova. It’s my pleasure. It's good to know you feel a little more reassured. And yes, that’s an excellent idea. Keeping a headache diary would be very helpful. Just jot down the date, time, how severe the headache is , what you were doing when it started, and anything that made it better or worse. That information will give me a better understanding of your headaches and help me interpret the results of the MRI. Otherwise, just schedule the scan at your convenience, and we’ll talk again once the results are in. Here’s a little handout with tips for managing headaches while you wait for the scan. Do you have any other questions for me today, before you go?
PATIENT: Hmm… no, I think that’s everything, Doctor. Thank you for the handouts. I’ll definitely keep a diary, and I’ll get the scan scheduled as soon as possible. I appreciate your patience and kindness. It’s nice to have a doctor who actually listens. Alright then, I suppose I’ll be on mi way. Thank you again, Doctor Decosta. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Popova. It was a pleasure meeting you too. Don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns before your appointment. Take care, and have a good day as well. We’ll see you soon. .
