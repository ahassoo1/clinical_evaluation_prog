DOCTOR: Hi Albino, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Good to meet you too. My back… it hurts. Lower back, mostly. It's been bothering me for a while now. Not a new thing, you understand, but… worse lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain. And you said it's been worse lately – can you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it used to be just a little ache, you know? After I been sitting for too long, maybe. Or lifting something. I could usually walk it off, or just rest a bit. Now… it’s more constant. And it hurts to bend over, even for small things. Makes getting dressed a little tricky sometimes. It just feels… weak, back there. And old.
DOCTOR: Alright, constant pain and difficulty bending – that gives me a better idea. When you say "lately," how long has it been this worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started getting really bad maybe… three weeks ago? Yes, three weeks. It was a gradual thing, not sudden. I thought it would just go away like before, but it hasn’t.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks of progressively worsening pain. Have you noticed anything specific that makes it better?
PATIENT: Not much, to be honest. Laying down flat helps a little. But I can’t stay in bed all day! And warm baths… they feel good for a little while, but the pain comes back pretty quick. Nothing really stops it, just takes the edge off for a short time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: No, no numbness or tingling. My legs feel… normal. Strong enough, I suppose. I walk okay, although I don't get around like I used to. It's more the pain holding me back, not any weakness.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. Have you ever had back problems diagnosed before – like a herniated disc or sciatica?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Many years ago, when I was still living in Beirut, a doctor told me it was something about the… the discs, yes? Something slipped. I had some treatments, some exercises… it got better then, like I said. Not this bad though. And then… I didn’t really see a doctor for my back again until now. Things were okay for a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, a previous diagnosis of a disc issue. Do you remember what kind of treatment you received back then?
PATIENT: It was a long time ago, Doctor. I remember… physical therapy. Lots of stretching and exercises. And some… injections, maybe? In my back. They didn't feel very good, but they helped for a while. I think the physical therapy was the most useful part, honestly. It was different times then, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you had any other significant medical problems – like heart trouble, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: No, no heart trouble. My blood pressure is usually a little high, the doctor at the pharmacy told me once, but I try to watch my salt. No diabetes, and no arthritis, not that I know of. I've just always been… a little achy, getting old you understand. But this back pain is different.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my blood pressure, sometimes. A small blue pill. And… sometimes I take something for pain, if it gets really bad. Just ibuprofen, you know? The kind you can buy at the store. Nothing else. I don't like taking too many pills.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I’ve been lucky so far, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam of your back. I'll just have you lie down on your stomach on the examination table, if that's alright. I'll check your range of motion, feel for tenderness, and do a few simple neurological tests. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Just let me know if I need to do anything special. My back's a little stiff, so don't be surprised if I groan a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, no problem at all. Just relax as much as you can. Alright, if you could lie down on your stomach, please. I'm going to start by gently feeling along your spine. Let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes. Right there. That’s… that’s where it hurts the most. Not a sharp pain, more like a deep ache. Like a bruise, almost.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And what about when I bend your back like this?
PATIENT: Ooh… that’s… uncomfortable. Not terrible, but I can feel it. It feels tight. Like something is stuck. It’s worse than it usually is.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about if you try to lift your leg straight up while lying on your stomach?
PATIENT: Ooh! No, no… that’s… that’s not good. It hurts too much. I can’t do that. Something… something feels wrong. Like a pulling sensation.
DOCTOR: Okay, okay, don't force it. Alright, Albino, based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it sounds like you're experiencing a lumbar strain, possibly with some nerve involvement given the pain you feel when lifting your leg. However, given your history and the pain with that movement, I’m concerned about possible disc involvement as well. I’m going to order some X-rays of your lower back to get a better look at the bones. I also want to consider an MRI, which can show us the discs and nerves. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: X-rays and… an MRI? Is something… seriously wrong, Doctor? Is it like before, with the slipped disc? And… an MRI sounds expensive. I don’t have insurance, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Albino. It's good we’re being thorough. The X-rays will help rule out any fractures or other bone problems. The MRI will give us a clearer picture of the discs and nerves in your lower back, which will help us determine the exact cause of your pain and the best course of treatment. You're right to be concerned about the cost of the MRI. Let's talk about that. I'll have my staff check with the radiology department to see if they offer any financial assistance programs or discounted rates for uninsured patients. We can also explore other imaging options if the cost is prohibitive, but an MRI would give us the most accurate information. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a mild muscle relaxant and an anti-inflammatory medication to help manage your pain and inflammation. I'll also give you some instructions for home care, including gentle stretching exercises and avoiding activities that worsen your pain. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… better. Checking for help with the cost… that’s good. I appreciate that, Doctor. A muscle relaxant and anti-inflammatory… yes, that might help. Stretching… I can try that, as long as it doesn’t hurt too much. What kind of stretching? And what should I avoid doing? I don’t want to make it worse. I'm a bit scared of doing something wrong.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Albino. We want to be very careful. I'll have my staff print out a handout with some gentle lower back stretches. Focus on stretches that gently move your back and legs, but stop immediately if you feel any sharp pain. Avoid bending over, lifting heavy objects, twisting motions, and prolonged sitting. The handout will also explain proper body mechanics for everyday activities, like getting out of bed or lifting something light. For now, I'm going to write you the prescription for the muscle relaxant and anti-inflammatory. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in one week to review the X-ray results and discuss the possibility of an MRI. If your pain gets significantly worse before then, or if you experience any numbness or weakness in your legs, please call the office immediately. Do you have any other questions before I finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything for now, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And for looking into the cost of the MRI. I will try the stretches and be careful. And I will call if anything changes. One week… alright.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. My staff will help you schedule that follow-up appointment before you leave. They’ll also give you the handout with the stretches and instructions, and the prescription for your medications. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And remember, we're here to help you get better. I think that's all for today, Albino. Get some rest and be kind to your back.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too.
