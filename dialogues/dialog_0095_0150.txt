DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Shteynberg. I’m Dr. Vanochten. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't have all day. I’m here because… well, it's rather obvious, isn’t it? I want to get pregnant. And I want it to be easy. No problems, no fuss. I’m not getting any younger, you know.
DOCTOR: Right, yes. Fertility concerns. I understand wanting to be efficient with your time, Ms. Shteynberg. We’ll try to be as straightforward as possible. To start, can you tell me a little bit about how long you and your partner have been trying to conceive?
PATIENT: Partner? Oh. There isn't a partner. It's... complicated. I'm divorced. And I would like to pursue this alone. Is that even possible? Honestly, I assumed that part would be handled with a simple… arrangement. I don’t need a lengthy explanation of couples’ therapy.
DOCTOR: Okay, single motherhood by choice. That clarifies things. Yes, it is possible to pursue pregnancy alone using assisted reproductive technology. It’s becoming increasingly common. We’ll need to discuss the options available, and whether you meet the criteria for each one. First, let's talk about your medical history. Have you had any previous pregnancies?
PATIENT: No. Never. And frankly, I don’t see what that has to do with anything now. I’m perfectly healthy. I cycle, I eat well – mostly. And as I said, I don't want this to be a drawn-out process. Are we getting anywhere, or are we just going to list off my entire life story?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Shteynberg. We are getting somewhere. A full medical history is still important, even if you feel perfectly healthy, just to rule out any underlying factors that could affect your chances of success. It’s standard procedure. Quickly, do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I'm not one of those people. I take what I need to when I need to. Though, I did have a reaction to a penicillin once, decades ago. It just gave me a rash. Nothing dramatic. Is that what you need to know? Because I really don’t have time for a lengthy review of every medication I’ve ever touched.
DOCTOR: Penicillin allergy noted. Okay. And are you currently taking any medications on a regular basis?
PATIENT: Just a multivitamin. And sometimes ibuprofen for… well, nothing important. Look, is this going to involve a lot of blood tests? Because I hate needles. And I don't want to be poked and prodded endlessly. I just want to know what the quickest, easiest path to getting pregnant is.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I appreciate your directness. Some blood work is necessary to assess your ovarian reserve, hormone levels, and general health. It’s crucial for determining the best course of action and minimizing risks. We can discuss options to make it as comfortable as possible, but it’s a non-negotiable part of the process. Before we get to that, let's briefly cover your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Fine. My mother had…high blood pressure. And my grandmother, on my father’s side, had something with her…stomach. Honestly, I barely knew her. Is that what you need? Are we building a genealogical chart now? I’m starting to think I should have just gone to a…different doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure and a vague stomach condition. We'll note that. Now, briefly, could you give me an idea of your lifestyle habits?
PATIENT: Lifestyle habits? What exactly are you implying? I work. I eat. I sleep. I’m a perfectly functional adult. I cycle, as I mentioned. Is that not healthy enough for you? I don’t sit around and smoke or drink excessively, if that’s what you’re fishing for.
DOCTOR: Right. No smoking, minimal alcohol. That’s good. Do you exercise regularly, aside from cycling?
PATIENT: Occasionally. I go for a brisk walk when the weather is good. Honestly, I don’t spend my life at the gym. I have better things to do. Is this going to change the outcome? Are you trying to tell me I'm not fit enough to have a baby?
DOCTOR: No, Ms. Shteynberg, I’m not suggesting that. I'm simply gathering information. Okay, to move things forward, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. It’s standard procedure to assess your overall health. Can we proceed with that?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Now you want to poke and prod? Honestly, this is ridiculous. I’m perfectly capable of assessing my own health, thank you very much. Is there anyway we can skip this step? I’m wasting valuable time here.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, I understand your frustration, but a physical exam is a necessary part of evaluating your suitability for fertility treatment. It's for your safety, and to ensure we're making the best possible decisions. It allows me to check your vital signs, perform a pelvic exam to assess your reproductive organs, and look for any potential issues that might affect your chances of success. It won't take long. However, if you absolutely refuse, we can proceed without it, but it will limit the options available to you and increase the risk of complications. Please understand that I strongly advise against it. What do you say?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But make it quick. And be gentle. I haven’t been… examined… in a very long time. And don’t expect a cheerful conversation, understand? Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please lie down on the table, and we'll begin. I’ll try to be as efficient as possible. First, let's check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 128/76, pulse is 72 and regular. Respiration is normal. Now, I’ll listen to your heart and lungs. Sounds normal. Now, I’ll need to perform a pelvic exam. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort. Uterus is normal size and position. Ovaries are… slightly enlarged, but no palpable masses. Cervix appears normal. No signs of infection. Alright, that’s all I need for now. We’ll send these findings to the lab, along with the blood work we discussed.
PATIENT: That was… unpleasant. Honestly. So, what does all that mean? Are my ovaries “slightly enlarged” a problem? Or are we just wasting time and money with these endless tests? I want answers, Doctor. Not vague descriptions of my internal organs.
DOCTOR: Ms. Shteynberg, “slightly enlarged” ovaries are not necessarily a problem, but they do warrant further investigation. It could be due to several factors, including normal hormonal fluctuations, polycystic ovary syndrome , or even a benign cyst. We need to look at your blood work to get a clearer picture. While we wait for the results, I recommend a transvaginal ultrasound to visualize your ovaries and uterus more closely. It will help us determine the cause of the enlargement and assess the health of your reproductive organs. Would you be willing to schedule that?
PATIENT: Another test? Seriously? Is this never going to end? Fine. Schedule it. Whatever it takes. But I expect it to be quick, efficient, and not involve any more…uncomfortable probing. And tell me, realistically, what are my chances of this actually working? Don't sugarcoat it. I want a straight answer.
DOCTOR: Alright, I’ve scheduled a transvaginal ultrasound for you on August 9th at 10:00 AM. As for your chances of success… that’s difficult to say without the results of the blood work and ultrasound. However, given your age and the fact that you have no known fertility issues, your chances are reasonably good. But the “slightly enlarged” ovaries do need to be investigated. PCOS, if present, can affect ovulation and require medication to regulate your cycle. If it's a cyst, we'll need to monitor it. We won’t know until we have the results. We'll review everything together and discuss the best course of action. In the meantime, I recommend taking a daily multivitamin with folic acid. It’s important for fetal development. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. Just get me the results as quickly as possible. And I expect a clear explanation, not medical jargon. I’ve wasted enough time here today. Thank you, Doctor. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Shteynberg. We’ll contact you as soon as the results are available. Have a good day. .
