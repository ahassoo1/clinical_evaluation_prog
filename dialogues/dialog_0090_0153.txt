DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Um… something about a check-up? For… work. I think it has to do with a performance, a physical… clearance, maybe? Honestly, it's all a bit fuzzy. I get asked to do these things now and then. It's… for the theater, I believe. Is that right? I don't really keep track of these things.
DOCTOR: Right. A “performance clearance.” Well, that’s… unusual. But we can certainly get this done. So, to clarify, your employer – the theater, you said – requires a physical exam for you to continue working?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds right. The theater… or maybe a production company working with the theater. It changes. I just… show up and do what they ask. Ushering, mostly. Sometimes tickets. I don’t ask too many questions. Honestly, it’s just a job. A way to… keep busy. Is this going to take long? I have… things.
DOCTOR: “Things.” Of course. Well, it shouldn’t be excessively long, but a proper exam takes time. To start, let’s go over your medical history. Have you been seeing a regular doctor?
PATIENT: A regular doctor? Not… really. Not for years. I used to, back when… well, a long time ago. Things were different then. Mostly, I just… if something really bothered me, I’d go to urgent care. Patches things up, you know? I don't really have a doctor. My ex-wife… she handled all that.
DOCTOR: Right. So, no consistent medical care. That’s… less than ideal. Alright. Do you have any known allergies – to medications, foods, anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of. I eat… mostly everything. I like dumplings, if that matters. And tea. Used to be able to eat shellfish, but it's been a long time. Maybe I reacted once? I can’t recall. It wasn't… serious, if I did. Honestly, I’m pretty good with food. It's just getting old that's the problem, you know?
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll proceed cautiously. Are you currently taking any medications, prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. Never been much of a pill-taker. Just… tea. Lots of tea. Helps with… things. I used to take something for my back, years ago, when it really acted up, but that was… a long time ago. Stopped taking it. Didn't seem to do much good anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any significant medical problems – heart trouble, diabetes, high blood pressure, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Let me think. My back, definitely. It bothers me. Gets stiff. I try to stretch. And… my knees. They ache sometimes, especially when it rains. Other than that… Honestly, I'm pretty lucky, I think. Old, but still functioning. My ex-wife always said I was stubborn. Maybe that's it. Don’t recall anything serious ever diagnosed, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, we’ll need to do a physical exam to get a better idea of what’s going on. Do you have any family history of significant medical problems – heart disease, cancer, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. That's a tough one. My parents… they were both… gone a long time ago. From China, originally. I don't really know much about their health, to be honest. We didn't talk about things like that much. Lots of… tradition, not a lot of sharing. My sister… she’s still around, somewhere. I think she had… high blood pressure, maybe? But it was a long time ago, and we don't keep in touch.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, limited family history. That makes things… less clear. Let’s move on to social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no, none of that. Never been much of a drinker. Makes me sleepy. And smoking… bad for you, right? Never appealed to me. And… other things? Heavens, no. Just… tea. Lots and lots of tea. Keeps me calm. It's a good life, mostly. Quiet. I prefer it that way.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, that’s… good. So, let's get this exam started. Please, step onto the scale for me. We'll start with your weight and height. Then we'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that sounds fine. Scale is fine. Whatever you need, Doctor. Just… please be quick, if you can? I have… appointments. And things. The quicker, the better, honestly.
DOCTOR: Alright. 118 pounds. And your height is… 199 centimeters. That’s… quite thin, Mr. Krahn. Blood pressure is a bit low – 110/70. Pulse is 68, regular. Lungs are clear, heart sounds… a little distant, but no murmurs. Now, if you could just extend your arms, please. We'll check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes? Oh. Alright. Distant? Is that… bad? My ex-wife always said I was too skinny. Maybe this is what she meant. Honestly, I mostly just try to stay out of trouble.
DOCTOR: No, not necessarily bad. Just… something to note. Reflexes are a bit diminished, but not alarming. Some stiffness in your knees and back, as you mentioned. Range of motion is limited. Gait is slightly unsteady. Alright. Based on this quick examination, you’re understandably quite thin with some age-related stiffness and reduced reflexes. Your blood pressure is a bit low, which could contribute to the unsteadiness. We'll need some blood work to rule out any underlying issues. Do you have insurance coverage?
PATIENT: Insurance? Oh, dear. No. No, I don’t have insurance. Haven’t for… a long time. It's expensive, and I mostly just… avoid the doctor. Blood work… will that be costly? I’m on a fixed income, you see. This performance clearance… I didn't expect it to be so complicated. Is it essential?
DOCTOR: Yes, blood work will be costly. Unfortunately, without insurance, you’ll be responsible for the full amount. And, while a performance clearance isn't life-threatening, we need to ensure you're physically capable of performing the required duties without risk to your health. Without a baseline assessment, it’s irresponsible to simply sign off. Given your limited income and lack of insurance, we can focus on a limited set of essential tests – a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and a thyroid function test. This will give us a general idea of your overall health and rule out some of the more common issues. Alternatively, you could consult with a specialist at a local free clinic. Would you prefer that option?
PATIENT: A free clinic… hmm. That might be best. I don’t want to cause trouble. A limited set of tests… that sounds… manageable. But will they accept the results for the clearance? The theater will need something official, you see. They are… particular. What if… what if I just… tried to do the job and saw how it went? It’s mostly ushering, you know. Not exactly strenuous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, I strongly advise against that. Attempting physical work without a medical assessment, even if it seems minor, is irresponsible and potentially dangerous. You could exacerbate an underlying condition, leading to serious complications. And, no, the theater likely won't accept "seeing how it goes" as an official clearance. They are requesting an assessment for a reason – to ensure your safety and limit their liability. Alright. I will write a requisition for the essential blood tests, and provide you with a list of local labs. You will need to pay out of pocket. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine if you are fit for the performance clearance. If the results are concerning, I can also provide you with referrals for further evaluation. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, that sounds acceptable. As long as it doesn’t get too expensive. I can barely afford tea as it is. A list of labs… and a price estimate, if possible? That would be very helpful. And… how long will it take to get the results? The theater… they are starting next week.
DOCTOR: Here's the requisition for the blood tests, along with a list of local labs and their contact information. Unfortunately, I cannot provide an exact price estimate, as it varies between labs. However, I've included a note on the requisition requesting a discounted rate due to your financial situation. You will need to inquire about pricing when you schedule the appointment. Results typically take 2-3 business days, but it’s best to confirm with the lab. Scheduling the appointment first thing tomorrow should give you ample time. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. For… everything. You’ve been very patient. I suppose I should go schedule the tests then. Is there… anything else I need to know? Before I leave?
DOCTOR: No, I believe that covers everything for now. Please, bring the results back to me as soon as they're available. And, Mr. Krahn, I strongly encourage you to prioritize your health, even if it means making difficult financial decisions. Ignoring potential issues will only lead to more serious problems down the line. Here’s my card. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Yes… thank you, Doctor. You too. I will schedule the tests tomorrow. And… I’ll try to be more careful. Good day to you as well. .
