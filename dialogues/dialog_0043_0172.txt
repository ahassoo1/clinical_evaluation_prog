DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Engelhaupt. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Kalinski, and it’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, honestly, I don’t quite recall why I’m here. My husband insisted, you see. Said I should “get checked out” now that we’ve moved. Honestly, all these new doctors… it’s just… a bother. Is this going to take long? I have a luncheon.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Engelhaupt. New doctors can be unsettling, and I assure you, we'll try to be as efficient as possible. It’s perfectly alright that you don’t recall the specific reason for the appointment. We can certainly figure that out together. Perhaps your husband could offer some insight?
PATIENT: Oh, he would have, if he hadn’t forgotten already. Men! Always forgetting things. He just said something about… a social visit? Because of this Medicare, I believe. Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. Is this about my bones? I felt a little… creaky this morning, but that’s to be expected at my age, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It sounds like this may be a general wellness check, part of your Medicare benefits, to ensure everything is functioning as it should. And yes, a little creakiness is quite common with age, but it’s always good to investigate, just to be certain. To help me get a clearer picture, Ms. Engelhaupt, let's start with a brief review of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Have you been seeing a primary care physician regularly?
PATIENT: A “primary care physician?” Goodness, no. Not for… well, I couldn’t tell you how long. Doctors always fussing over things. I’ve always been perfectly healthy. A little indigestion now and then, but nothing a bicarbonate of soda couldn’t fix. My mother always said fresh air and a good constitution were all one needed. Are you going to ask me a lot of questions? Because, truly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. I’d rather just get this over with.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your reluctance, Ms. Engelhaupt, and I will certainly try to keep things brief. We’ll go at your pace. Just a few basic questions to start, then perhaps a quick physical exam. If you don't recall something, that’s perfectly alright. We can skip it. First, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… let me think. I believe I once had a slight reaction to a shellfish… decades ago. But honestly, I eat everything. I’m not a picky eater, never have been. My husband is the fussy one. He’s terribly sensitive to… something in tomatoes, I think. Is this really necessary? I feel perfectly fine. Though, now that you mention it, my eyesight has been a bit blurry lately… but I blame the lighting in this office. It’s awfully bright.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Engelhaupt. That’s helpful. A past reaction to shellfish is good to know. And I understand your concern about the lighting; we can adjust it if needed. Now, regarding your blurry vision, that's certainly something we should discuss. Has this been a gradual change, or did it come on suddenly?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s been… gradual, I suppose. Years, really. I’ve just gotten used to squinting. It's nothing alarming. My mother’s eyesight was terrible too, always reading with a magnifying glass. It’s hereditary, I’m sure. Honestly, I think a new pair of spectacles is all that’s needed. Are we going to be doing any poking and prodding? I really dislike being poked and prodded. It’s… undignified.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Engelhaupt. We will do a brief physical exam, and I’ll certainly be mindful of your comfort. It’s not extensive, just a general assessment to get a baseline of your health. I promise to be as gentle as possible. Before we proceed, could you tell me if you’re currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I take a little something for my indigestion, when it flares up. A little pink pill… can’t recall the name. And sometimes, a vitamin. A multivitamin, I believe. My daughter sends them. She worries terribly. Honestly, I don’t keep track of these things. It all just gets mixed up. Is this going to be much longer? I have a luncheon, you know. With the garden club. And I promised to bring my famous cucumber sandwiches.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Engelhaupt. We are getting close to finishing, I assure you. Just a few more questions, then we can do a quick exam. Now, thinking about your past medical history, have you ever been hospitalized for any serious illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? Oh dear, let me think… I believe I had my tonsils out when I was a child. That was a very long time ago. And… perhaps a bout of pneumonia once? It was a very mild case. I recovered quickly. Honestly, I’ve always been quite resilient. My mother always said fresh air and a good constitution were the key. Are you writing all of this down? It seems awfully thorough. I’m starting to feel rather… overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: Yes, I am documenting everything, Ms. Engelhaupt. It's standard procedure to ensure I have a complete understanding of your health history. It helps me provide the best possible care. Now, do you have any family history of serious illnesses, such as heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family history… My mother lived to be 98, a very healthy woman. But she didn’t believe in doctors, so she never had anything properly diagnosed. My father… he had a weak heart, I believe. Always complaining of palpitations. And my aunt Mildred… she had something… awful. Cancer, I think. Very sad. But that was decades ago. Honestly, all this talk of illness is rather depressing. Are we nearly finished yet? I really must get going. Those cucumber sandwiches won’t make themselves.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Engelhaupt, we’re nearly finished with the questions. Just a quick physical exam now, and then we can discuss everything. To start, could you please tell me your height and weight, if you know them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a difficult one. I haven’t been weighed or measured in… decades. I used to be quite tall, you know. Almost six feet. But I've shrunk a bit with age, I suspect. And as for my weight… I’m… average. Perfectly average. Perhaps 145 pounds? Something like that. It fluctuates, you see. It depends on the cucumber sandwiches. Are you going to make me stand on one of those scales? I really dislike scales. They’re so… judgmental.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Engelhaupt. We can estimate, if you prefer. But it's helpful to have a general idea. Would you mind stepping on the scale briefly?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But please be quick about it. And don't tell me the number! I'd rather not know. Honestly, all this fuss… It’s simply too much. There. Is that enough? Can we please get on with it? I have a luncheon, you know. And I promised Beatrice my famous cucumber sandwiches. .
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Engelhaupt. Now, if you’ll just allow me to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your reflexes, we can finish the exam. It won’t take long. Heart sounds are regular, rate approximately 72 beats per minute. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Reflexes are 2+ throughout. Slight diminished range of motion in both shoulders. Now, based on what we've discussed, and the brief examination, it appears you're generally in good health for your age. The diminished range of motion in your shoulders could be related to arthritis or simply age-related changes. Do you have any pain in your shoulders currently?
