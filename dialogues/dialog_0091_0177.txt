DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To begin, could you tell me what brings you into the clinic?
PATIENT: Eh, good mornin'. Doctor, right? Talen. Listen, it's… somethin' down there. Not good. Been… drippin'. That’s why I’m here. It’s messy, you know? I don't like messy.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Genard. It takes courage to discuss these things, and I appreciate your openness. When you say “down there,” are you referring to your vaginal area?
PATIENT: Vaginal? No, no, not there. Down there. You know… a man thing. My… friend’s thing. It's his. Been drippin' from his thing. It's embarrassing, really. I don't know why I'm here, honestly. He couldn't come.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Genard. You're here on behalf of your partner, and you’ve noticed a discharge from his penis. That's perfectly alright; we can certainly address this. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me how long he’s been experiencing this discharge?
PATIENT: Oh… a long time, I think. Maybe a couple weeks? Hard to say. He doesn't tell me things. Just… noticed it more lately. It’s… smelly. And a little… greenish, maybe? I don’t pay much attention, honestly. He keeps things… private.
DOCTOR: I see. A couple of weeks, and you’ve noticed a greenish discharge with an odor. Thank you for providing that detail, despite it being a sensitive topic. Has he experienced any pain or burning during urination, or noticed any sores or bumps in the area?
PATIENT: Burning? No, he yells sometimes when he goes, but he always yells. That’s just… him. Sores… I don’t look at it. Really! I just… smell it. And then I tell him he needs a doctor. He grumbles. A lot of grumbling. He says it’s nothin’. Men, you know? Always think they know best.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds as though obtaining a thorough history is proving challenging. To clarify, he hasn’t mentioned any discomfort or pain, but he does experience some yelling during urination – is that a recent change, or has this been ongoing?
PATIENT: Ongoing. Always been that way. Loud fella. A very loud fella. It’s… part of his charm, I guess. Though, it is gettin' louder maybe? Now that you mention it. Everything's gettin' louder these days. Him, the TV… my neighbors. Ugh. But the yellin’… always been there.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that clarification, Ms. Genard. A longstanding history of yelling during urination. Given the discharge, the odor, and the potential increase in the intensity of his discomfort, I believe it would be prudent for him to be evaluated. While it could be a number of things, including a simple infection, we need to rule out anything more serious. Would you be comfortable with me performing a focused physical exam to assess the area?
PATIENT: Physical exam? On him? Oh no, no, no. Absolutely not. I didn't come here for that. I just wanted to tell someone… make sure it wasn’t somethin’ bad. You’re gonna… look at his… parts? No. I’m not comfortable with that at all. He’d kill me.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Genard. Your comfort is my priority, and I would never proceed with an exam without your full consent, or his consent if he were present. Given his reluctance to seek medical attention and your discomfort with a physical exam at this time, the best course of action would be for him to schedule an appointment with a healthcare provider. I can provide you with a list of urologists in the area, specialists who focus on the health of the male reproductive system. They would be best equipped to assess his symptoms and provide appropriate treatment. Would you like me to provide that list for you?
PATIENT: Urologists… that sounds expensive. He'll just complain. But… maybe. Maybe if I have a list he can't argue. Write it down, yes. Just the names and numbers. And… make sure they don’t yell. I can’t stand yellin’.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Genard. Here is a list of urologists in the suburban area. I’ve included their contact information. I've also made a note on the sheet to encourage a calm and quiet visit, given your preference. I also want to emphasize the importance of seeking timely medical attention. Untreated infections or other conditions can sometimes lead to more serious complications. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that's all. Thank you for… writin' it down. And for not makin' me talk about… everything. It's embarrassing, you know? Just tellin’ you was hard enough. He's gonna be mad I came. But better safe than… whatever. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Genard. It took courage to come in today, and I commend you for advocating for his health. Please encourage him to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. If you have any concerns in the meantime, or if his symptoms worsen, please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic. I wish you both the best of health.
PATIENT: Okay. I will. Probably grumble a lot, too. But… okay. Thank you again, Doctor. Bye bye to you too.
