DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Putney. Or… is it Waleed?
PATIENT: Yeah, Waleed’s fine. Just… trying to get this over with, if you don't mind. Got a lot on my plate today.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. I understand completely. Let's get straight to it then. So, what brings you in today, Waleed?
PATIENT: Life insurance thing. They sent me here for a check-up before they… you know, actually give me the insurance. Medicare covered the visit, thankfully. Don’t really like doctors much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Ah, a life insurance exam. Perfectly reasonable. We’ll just do a standard check-up, make sure everything's looking good. Don't worry, I'll keep it as quick and painless as possible. And no judgement here – plenty of folks feel that way about doctors. So, are you currently experiencing any health problems?
PATIENT: Not really. Just… tired a lot, I guess. Being a lodging manager, it’s long hours. And, uh, my knees bother me sometimes. Old sports injury. Nothing major. I get by.
DOCTOR: Okay, tiredness and knee pain. Long hours at the lodging manager position – that certainly can take a toll. And the old sports injury... can you tell me a little more about that knee pain?
PATIENT: It's mostly when I'm walking a lot, or going up and down stairs. It kinda… aches. Sometimes it feels a little stiff in the mornings. I usually just ignore it, or take some ibuprofen. It’s been years, though, since I really hurt it bad. Basketball injury, back in high school. I don’t play anymore, obviously.
DOCTOR: Right, basketball injury. Aches with walking and stairs, stiffness in the mornings… and ibuprofen helps. Good to know. Have you noticed any swelling, locking, or giving way of the knee at all?
PATIENT: No, no swelling. It doesn’t lock up or anything like that, either. Just… a dull ache. Honestly, I try not to pay too much attention to it. Like I said, I’m mostly just here because the insurance company wants me checked out. I don't usually go to doctors unless I have to.
DOCTOR: Understandable. Alright, well, let's do a quick physical exam just to get a baseline. Just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at those knees. Nothing to worry about, just standard procedure. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yeah, fine. Just… hurry it up, if you could? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Let’s get right to it then. If you could just lie back on the exam table, please. Alright, let’s take a look at these knees. Can you bend them for me?
PATIENT: Here. There. Don't poke around too much, okay? It’s not that bad. Just need this insurance thing done.
DOCTOR: Okay, just feeling around… I'm noting some mild tenderness on the inner side of both knees. Range of motion seems mostly intact, although slightly limited. No significant swelling that I can see right now. Reflexes are normal. Alright, that’s a quick look. Now, just to be thorough, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Uh… not really. I mean, I get a little short of breath sometimes when I'm carrying stuff upstairs at the hotel. But that's probably just being out of shape. And, uh… I snore. My ex-wife used to complain about it all the time. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Everything counts, Waleed. Shortness of breath with exertion and snoring… good to know. The shortness of breath is worth mentioning. Could you tell me a bit more about that?
PATIENT: It’s just… when I’m carrying luggage up the stairs, or a lot of supplies, I get winded pretty easy. It doesn’t happen all the time, just when I’m really pushing myself. And it goes away pretty quickly after I stop. I’m not a young man anymore, you know? Probably just getting old.
DOCTOR: Right, exertion-related shortness of breath. I understand. And you mentioned snoring… has anyone ever told you that you stop breathing for a moment while you’re asleep?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My ex-wife just said I snored loudly. Didn't mention anything about stopping breathing. She complained about a lot of things, to be honest. Is this… is this going to take much longer? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Almost done, Waleed. I just want to get a good baseline. Given the shortness of breath and snoring, it might be worth just doing a quick EKG to check things out, and possibly some blood work. It’s just a precaution, to rule out anything serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: An EKG and blood work? Seriously? Look, I just need a form signed so I can get this insurance. I don’t have time for all this… extra stuff. Is the insurance company even requiring this?
DOCTOR: You are right to ask. It seems the insurance company is requesting a basic health screening, which includes a limited EKG and blood work - specifically a CBC and a basic metabolic panel. They’re just covering their bases, standard procedure. It shouldn't take too long, and we can get it done here at the clinic. It would give us a better overall picture of your health, and ensure you’re a good candidate for the insurance policy. Would you prefer I recommend another clinic that might be quicker?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, do the tests. But hurry, okay? And don't find anything wrong with me. I really don't need this right now. Let’s just get it over with. And can I get a copy of whatever you find? For my records.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We’ll get it done as quickly as possible, and you’ll receive a copy of the results. Let me just get a nurse to come in and draw some blood and get you hooked up to the EKG machine. It shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes. Nurse, could you please come to exam room three for a blood draw and EKG?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… let me know when it’s done. .
