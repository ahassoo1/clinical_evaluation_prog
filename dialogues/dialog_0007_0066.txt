DOCTOR: Hi Jamill, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor Hernandez. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here because I’ve been experiencing a… well, it's difficult to describe. A popping or clicking sensation in my back. It’s been occurring for a little while now, and I thought it best to have it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a popping or clicking sensation in your back. That's good you're getting it checked out. To get a better understanding, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It seems to happen most when I’m… well, when I’m bending or twisting. It's not constant, thankfully. More intermittent. I work as an electrical and electronics installer, so I'm often in awkward positions, working on transportation equipment—buses, trains, that sort of thing. I suspect it might be related to that, but I wouldn’t claim to be an expert, of course. It doesn’t usually cause pain, just the… pop. Though sometimes, if I really twist, there’s a bit of discomfort afterward. It’s not sharp, just… noticeable.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s related to bending and twisting, happens intermittently, and is more noticeable when you really push it – a bit of discomfort afterward, not sharp pain. Electrical and electronics installer…lots of awkward positions, that makes sense. And just to clarify, where exactly in your back are you feeling this popping and clicking?
PATIENT: It’s primarily in my lower back, Doctor. Right around the lumbar region, I believe. Sometimes it feels like it's on one side more than the other, though it’s difficult to pinpoint definitively. And it doesn’t radiate—it stays localized to that lower back area. I don't feel it in my legs or anywhere else. I hope that’s clear enough? I’m trying my best to be precise.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very clear, thank you. Lower lumbar region, sometimes more on one side, doesn’t radiate to the legs. Good. Have you ever experienced any injury to your back – a specific fall, lifting something heavy incorrectly, anything like that?
PATIENT: That's a good question. To the best of my recollection, no, not a specific injury, no. However, as I mentioned, my profession requires a lot of… less-than-ideal posture and movement. I’ve certainly strained muscles over the years, lifting equipment, contorting myself into tight spaces. Nothing that required a visit to the doctor, mind you, just typical aches and pains that resolved on their own with rest. But I suppose repeated strain could be a factor. I haven’t had any falls or sudden traumas, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, no specific trauma, but repeated strain from work is possible. And have you noticed anything that makes it worse besides bending and twisting?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Prolonged sitting seems to aggravate it a little. Not immediately, but if I’m sitting for a long stretch, like during travel, it feels stiffer afterward and the popping is more frequent. And, honestly, colder weather. It’s rather silly, I know, but I’ve noticed it's worse when it’s cold outside. I don’t know if that’s related, of course. Perhaps just my imagination. I suppose it could also be that I'm less active during colder weather, which could contribute to the stiffness.
DOCTOR: No, that’s helpful information, not silly at all. Cold weather can affect joint stiffness. Okay, so prolonged sitting and cold weather seem to worsen it. And you mentioned stiffness—is that stiffness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It’s definitely not constant, Doctor. It comes and goes. In the mornings, sometimes, I wake up feeling a bit stiff, particularly if I haven't been very active the previous day. But usually, it loosens up after I get moving. And like I said, prolonged sitting will make it stiff, but it generally subsides after I stand up and walk around for a bit. It's not a debilitating stiffness, just… noticeable discomfort. It doesn't keep me from doing anything, mind you.
DOCTOR: Okay, morning stiffness that improves with movement, and stiffness after sitting that improves with walking. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed at your own pace. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Okay, I’m just going to check your range of motion and feel along your spine. Let me know if anything feels painful or uncomfortable. … Alright, bending forward… good range of motion. Bending backward… a little hesitation there, some mild discomfort, right around L4-L5. Side bending… slight limitation on the right side. Palpation… some muscle tenderness along the right side of your lower back, but no acute areas of pain. No signs of neurological deficits. Your reflexes are normal, and strength is intact. So, physically, it appears you have some muscle tenderness and limited range of motion on the right side of your lower back. This aligns with what you’ve described.
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Yes, I do believe I feel that slight hesitation when bending backward, and I’ve definitely noticed the limited range of motion on my right side. It doesn't cause intense pain, just… a restriction. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me so thoroughly. Is this indicative of something serious, in your opinion? I confess, I’m a little anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Jamill. Based on the exam and your history, it doesn't appear to be anything immediately serious. It's most likely a musculoskeletal issue—a strain or mild facet joint dysfunction, potentially aggravated by your work and prolonged sitting. There are no red flags—no fever, no weight loss, no bowel or bladder problems, no neurological deficits—that would suggest a more serious underlying condition. However, to rule out other possibilities and get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some basic X-rays of your lumbar spine. It's just to be thorough. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: That… sounds prudent, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness and the explanation. X-rays sound perfectly reasonable to me, yes. I’d rather be safe than sorry. It’s reassuring to hear that you don’t suspect anything immediately serious, but it’s good to be certain. Please proceed with the X-rays. What’s the next step? Do I need a referral?
DOCTOR: Good. I'll write you a referral for the X-rays. The order will be sent electronically to [Clinic Name], the imaging center just down the street. They usually have same-day appointments, and you can call them to schedule. Once they’ve taken the images, the results will be sent back to me, and we can discuss them. In the meantime, I’d recommend some conservative treatment: over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen, if you can tolerate them, and gentle stretching exercises. Avoid any activities that significantly aggravate your pain. I also want to mention that if your pain worsens, or if you develop any new symptoms like numbness, weakness, or bowel/bladder problems, please contact me immediately. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very good, Doctor. Thank you for the clear explanation and the recommendations. I will schedule the X-rays at [Clinic Name] as soon as possible, and I’ll certainly adhere to your advice regarding pain relievers and stretching. I will also keep a close watch for any worsening of symptoms or new developments and contact you immediately if necessary. I appreciate your time and expertise. Is there anything else I should be aware of at this time? Perhaps specific stretches you might recommend, or any positions I should avoid?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jamill. I’m glad I could help. Regarding stretches, gentle lumbar stretches like knee-to-chest stretches and pelvic tilts are good starting points. Avoid any twisting motions or heavy lifting until we have the X-ray results. Also, try to maintain good posture when sitting and standing, and take frequent breaks to stretch and walk around. I can provide you with a handout detailing some specific exercises if you’d like. For now, let’s focus on the X-rays, and we’ll reassess once we have the results. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: That would be wonderful, Doctor, if you could provide me with the handout detailing the exercises. It would be most helpful to have a visual reference. And no, I believe that answers all of my questions for now. Thank you again for your thoroughness, your patience, and your clear explanations. I feel much more reassured and have a clear plan of action. I will schedule the X-rays right away. .
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll print that out for you now. Great. Just call [Clinic Name] and tell them Dr. Hernandez sent you for lumbar X-rays. I’m glad I could reassure you, Jamill. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns. Take care, and I’ll see you back once the results are in.
