DOCTOR: Right then. Annelle Durig, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, that is correct. Though… honestly, I don’t recall much about appointments these days. Is something… the matter? I do hope it won't take too long.
DOCTOR: Well, that’s… understandable at your age. Though a bit concerning you don't remember coming to an appointment. We'll try to be brief, but a proper assessment takes time. Now, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. It’s… my skin, I believe. It’s quite yellow. My niece, she insisted I come. Said something about my liver… and a disease? Honestly, I get so confused. It’s just… everything feels a bit blurry, you see. And the yellow… it’s rather alarming. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: "Liver disease," you say. Your niece is… perceptive, I suppose. Yellowing of the skin – that's jaundice, medically speaking. It can be serious, yes. It indicates a problem with the liver, or sometimes the gallbladder, or even the blood. "Blurry" you say?
PATIENT: Yes, blurry. Not just my vision, though that too. My thoughts, mostly. It’s difficult to explain. Everything feels… distant. And I've been terribly tired, you see. Just… exhausted all the time. I haven't been eating much either. Everything seems to… lack appeal. Is the jaundice… connected to all of that? And… what will you do about it? I truly do hope it isn't anything dreadful.
DOCTOR: Right. Fatigue, loss of appetite, cognitive… fuzziness, and jaundice. Not a pleasant combination. It could be related to the liver, certainly. Though, at your age, there are other possibilities. We'll need to run some tests. Now, have you noticed any changes in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Tests? I… I don’t particularly like tests. And my stool? Honestly, I haven’t paid much attention. Is it… important? I mostly just try to avoid thinking about such things. It’s all rather… unpleasant, you see. I’m not sure I understand why that matters. Is it connected to the yellow?
DOCTOR: Yes, it is connected, potentially. Changes in stool color—pale or clay-colored, for example—can indicate problems with bile flow, which is what causes the jaundice. Bile flow problems are often associated with liver or gallbladder issues. Now, I need you to be honest with me. Have you noticed any changes?
PATIENT: Oh… clay-colored? I… I suppose so. Now that you mention it, it hasn't been its usual… shade. More… light, perhaps? Like a pale sand? I truly am sorry, doctor, I don’t make a good patient. My memory is so unreliable. Is this… bad? Should I be worried? I haven't been drinking, if that matters. Not a drop.
DOCTOR: Pale stools, jaundice, fatigue, loss of appetite, cognitive changes… No alcohol use. That’s… helpful, but not reassuring. It sounds like a possible obstruction of the bile duct. Could be a gallstone, could be something more serious. We need to get a blood workup done immediately, and I'm going to order an abdominal ultrasound. We need to see what's going on in there. Do you understand?
PATIENT: An ultrasound? Oh, dear. Is it… painful? And blood work? I always bruise so easily. Is this going to take long? Honestly, doctor, I feel rather overwhelmed. Could it be… just a temporary thing? Perhaps I’ve simply been under stress? I truly wish I understood what’s happening. Is it… is it something that can be fixed?
DOCTOR: Stress?
PATIENT: Well, I… my niece has been quite insistent on me taking better care of myself, and she is… a very strong personality. She worries, you see. Perhaps that's all it is? I don't want to put you to too much trouble, doctor. I just… I'd like to go home, if possible. Is there anything else you need to know? Truly, I'm not a very good patient, and I’m afraid I'm forgetting things already.
DOCTOR: Look, Mrs. Durig, with all due respect, minimizing this is… unwise. I understand you’re not keen on tests, but your symptoms are concerning. I am going to order the blood work and the ultrasound. It’s necessary. We need to rule out serious conditions. To be clear, ignoring this could have… consequences. Now, do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh… let me think. I… I don’t believe so. Not to anything, not that I recall. Though… I had a rather unpleasant reaction to a shellfish once, many years ago. But that was decades ago! And it was just… a bit of a rash. Nothing serious. I truly do hope this won't take too long, doctor. I have… a small garden, you see, and the tomatoes need tending. Is it alright if I schedule the tests for tomorrow? Perhaps first thing? I do apologize for being so… difficult.
DOCTOR: A rash from shellfish. Fine. But, we’ll document that. Now, this is important: have you noticed any itching, Mrs. Durig?
PATIENT: Itching? Oh… now that you mention it… yes, a little. Mostly on my arms, and my back. It’s not constant, though. Just… now and then, a bit of an irritation. I assumed it was just the dry air, honestly. I use lotion, you see. Is that… significant? I truly do apologize for not mentioning it sooner. My memory is simply dreadful these days. Is it… a bad sign?
DOCTOR: Itching with jaundice, pale stools, fatigue, loss of appetite, cognitive changes… and now, a history of shellfish allergy… Mrs. Durig, this is suggestive of cholestasis, potentially caused by a blockage in the bile ducts. It could be a gallstone, as I said before, but it requires immediate investigation. I am going to write a referral to a gastroenterologist. I want you to see Dr. Alistair Khan within 48 hours. This is not something we can simply wait and see about. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A… gastroenterologist? Oh, dear. Another doctor? Honestly, doctor, I… I don't know if I can handle this. So many tests, so many appointments… It all feels rather overwhelming. Is it… is it very serious? I truly wish my niece were here; she is much better at understanding these things. Could it… could it be something less serious? Perhaps a vitamin deficiency? Is there anything else I can do? I truly do feel rather faint.
DOCTOR: "Faint," you say. Look, I am documenting all of this. At this point, Mrs. Durig, I cannot rule out a more serious underlying cause. I need you to understand the urgency of this situation. I am ordering the blood work now. A nurse will come in to take samples. I am also arranging for the ultrasound, and I’m sending the referral to Dr. Khan, who is the specialist. The nurse will give you instructions for scheduling. Until you have seen Dr. Khan, I advise you to avoid any strenuous activity and to call the office immediately if you experience any worsening of your symptoms, especially abdominal pain, fever, or significant changes in your stool or urine color. Do you understand those instructions?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, I understand. Abdominal pain, fever, changes in stool… It all sounds very frightening, doctor. Honestly, I… I feel rather helpless. And alone. My niece… she means well, but she is very… assertive. And I always forget what the doctors tell me. Could you… could you perhaps write all of this down for me? A simple list of symptoms and instructions? Something I can take home with me? I truly do appreciate your help, doctor, even if it is… overwhelming. Perhaps a little water would help? I feel rather parched. Is it alright if I just… sit here for a moment?
DOCTOR: Very well. I will write a summary for you. "Symptoms: Jaundice , pale stools, fatigue, loss of appetite, cognitive changes, itching, shellfish allergy." "Instructions: 1. Blood work today. 2. Ultrasound ASAP. 3. See Dr. Alistair Khan within 48 hours. 4. Call office if you experience abdominal pain, fever, or changes in stool or urine color." Here. And yes, you may sit for a moment. A nurse will be in shortly. Now, is there anything else you want to tell me before she arrives?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you, doctor. This is… very helpful. Let me see… Oh, dear, the writing is rather small. Well… no, I don’t think so. Though… there was a strange dream I had last night. About a garden, but all the flowers were… grey. And a voice, whispering something I couldn't understand. But it probably doesn't matter, does it? Just a silly dream. And… perhaps you could remind me of Dr. Khan’s number? I’m afraid I won't remember it, even if you told me. I truly do apologize for being such a bother. Is it alright if I just… close my eyes for a moment? I feel rather tired. .
DOCTOR: Right. A dream. Look, Mrs. Durig, the nurse is on her way. I will write down Dr. Khan’s number for you. Here. Now, please try to rest. And remember, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, call the office immediately. .
