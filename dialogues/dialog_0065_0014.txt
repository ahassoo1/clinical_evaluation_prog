DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Limtiaco. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, my wife, she said I need to get some… papers. For… time off, maybe? Something about work and… needing a break. Honestly, it’s a bit fuzzy. She handles most of that sort of thing. It has to do with my job, I think… religious activities. And education. Yes, that’s right.
DOCTOR: Religious activities and education… right. So, you’re seeking documentation for time off related to those?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds about right. Time off… or maybe something more permanent? She mentioned paperwork… FMLA, was it? I don’t really know what any of it means, to be honest. Is that something I need? My wife… she’s very good at these things, but she’s traveling right now. Something about a conference. It’s all a bit of a blur, sorry.
DOCTOR: FMLA… Family and Medical Leave Act. Yes, I see a note from your wife regarding potential leave. And it does appear she’s been proactive. Let’s start with this. What specifically are you needing time off for?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a good question. Well, I’ve been… feeling a bit run down, I suppose. Not sick, exactly. Just… tired. A lot. And… things haven’t been as easy to remember lately. Like I said before, fuzzy. It’s making my work… a little harder. The religious activities, you know, they require a lot of focus. It’s hard to explain. I just… need to take a step back, I think.
DOCTOR: So, fatigue and… cognitive difficulties. When did you first start noticing these symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… That’s… tricky. It wasn't sudden, you see. It’s been creeping up on me, little by little. Maybe… six months ago? Possibly longer. It’s hard to pinpoint. My wife noticed it before I did, I think. She said I was repeating myself more. And forgetting where I put things. It’s been… gradual. I still manage, mostly. But it takes… more effort now.
DOCTOR: And has this impacted your religious activities at all?
PATIENT: Yes, it has. I lead a lot of the services, you see. And… remembering the scripture, the readings… it’s becoming harder. I have to prepare more. And even then, sometimes… sometimes I stumble. It’s… embarrassing, to be honest. I don’t want to disappoint anyone. It used to come so naturally. Now… it feels like a struggle. It’s starting to affect my confidence.
DOCTOR: And are you experiencing any changes in your appetite, sleep patterns, or mood?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. My appetite is… normal, I think. Maybe a little less than usual, but nothing dramatic. Sleep… well, I sleep okay, but I wake up a lot. Not necessarily feeling tired, just… restless. And my mood… I wouldn't say I'm unhappy, exactly. Just… a little more easily frustrated, maybe? Things bother me more than they used to. And I get a little… anxious, sometimes, about forgetting things. Especially when I have a service coming up. It's all connected, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other physical symptoms?
PATIENT: Physical symptoms… Let me think. Not really. I mean, I'm getting older, you know? A few aches and pains here and there, but nothing… unusual for someone my age. My wife keeps telling me to watch my blood pressure, but I haven't felt any different. No headaches, no dizziness… nothing like that. Just… tired. And forgetful. Is that… typical? For whatever this is?
DOCTOR: Well, “typical” is a broad term. Fatigue and cognitive changes can be caused by many things. Before we jump to conclusions, let's do a quick physical exam. Just to rule out any obvious issues. Blood pressure is a good place to start, as your wife mentioned. Then, I'd like to check your reflexes and do a brief neurological assessment. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. Not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. A physical exam sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just… I’m hoping it’s nothing too serious. My wife would be… very worried.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's begin. Please lie back on the exam table. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first. Take a deep breath… and exhale. Good. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. This may be a little uncomfortable. Please relax your arm. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Plantar reflexes are downgoing bilaterally. Now, I'm going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes… Look left… Look right… Look up… Look down. Good. Now, can you smile for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can smile. And… looking left, right, up, down… yes, I can do that. It’s a little… strange, being poked and prodded, if I’m honest. I haven’t had a proper exam in… well, I can’t remember how long. Is everything alright so far? It's not the most comfortable, but I'm trying to cooperate.
DOCTOR: Everything appears grossly intact, but I'm noticing some mild difficulty with rapid alternating movements. Please tap your hands together as quickly as you can. And now I'm going to perform a brief cognitive assessment. I'm going to ask you a few simple questions to test your memory. What is today's date?
PATIENT: It's… harder than it looks. Today’s date… hmm. August… the second? Yes, August second. 2025. Is that right? My wife always keeps track of these things. I’m not always the best with dates… or remembering what day it is, to be honest. Am I doing something wrong?
DOCTOR: Not “wrong,” per se. But your performance is… suggestive. Based on the physical exam and your reported symptoms, I suspect mild cognitive impairment. It's not necessarily Alzheimer's, but further investigation is warranted. I’m going to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. I'd also like to schedule a brain MRI to get a clearer picture of what's going on.
PATIENT: Mild… cognitive impairment? That sounds… serious. An MRI? My wife… she’ll be very worried. What does this mean, Doctor? Is there… something I can do? Will I… get worse? I feel… a little overwhelmed, to be honest. Is there anything I should be telling my wife specifically?
DOCTOR: It’s best not to catastrophize, Mr. Limtiaco. “Mild cognitive impairment” simply means that your cognitive function is slightly below what’s expected for someone your age. It can be caused by a variety of factors, some of which are reversible. The blood work and MRI will help us determine the underlying cause. As for what to tell your wife… inform her of the preliminary findings and my recommendations for further testing. It’s important she understand we're taking a proactive approach to investigate the cause of your symptoms. I will also order a referral to a neurologist for a comprehensive evaluation. They are the specialists in this area. Until then, continue with your normal activities, but be mindful of your limitations. I'm going to print out the lab orders and the neurology referral now. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once we have them.
PATIENT: Okay… blood work… neurology referral… proactive approach… My wife will be relieved to hear we're doing something, I suppose. She’s always the one who takes charge. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. I should probably… go and tell her. It won’t be easy, but… she needs to know. I hope it’s nothing too serious.
