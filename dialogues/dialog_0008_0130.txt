DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schwer. I’m Dr. Cumper. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Uh… well, my sister, she… she got sick. Real sick. Cancer. And my mother, she… she had something bad too, a long time ago. I just… I want to make sure I’m okay. You know? I don’t feel bad now, but… it’s in the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's smart to be proactive, especially with a family history of illness. We can certainly do some things to assess your current health and give you some peace of mind. Just to clarify, you’re feeling generally well right now, but you’re concerned about potentially developing similar conditions to your sister and mother?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. No pain, no… nothing. Just worried. My sister, she’s… she’s fighting it, but it’s scary. And my mother… she didn't make it. So, yeah. Just want to be sure I’m not… you know… going to be like them.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll take a thorough look. To start, let’s go over your medical history. Have you had any significant illnesses or surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not much, really. When I was a boy, I had the measles, like everyone else. And… oh! I broke my arm once, falling off a fence. That’s about it. No surgeries. I go to the doctor when I need to, but… mostly I’m okay. I try to eat right.
DOCTOR: Okay, measles as a child and a broken arm, good to know. And you said you generally feel well and try to maintain a healthy diet. Any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, sometimes. The doctor gave it to me a few years ago. But that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And what's the name of that blood pressure medication, if you recall?
PATIENT: Uh… geez. I always forget. It's a little white pill… I think it starts with an “A”? My wife used to fill it, she always knew. Now… I just tell the pharmacy. I don't remember the name. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, we can look that up in your records. Let’s move on. Do you have any family history of other medical conditions besides your sister and mother’s illnesses?
PATIENT: My father… he had a bad heart. He had to… you know… get a thing put in his chest. A long time ago. And… my uncle, on my mother’s side, he had… diabetes, I think? He had to watch his sugar. That’s all I really know. My family doesn’t talk much about these things.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a father with heart disease, requiring a procedure, and an uncle with diabetes. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no smoking. Never liked it. I drink a little beer sometimes, with dinner. Maybe a couple of beers a week. And no… definitely no drugs. I’m an old man, Doctor! I just want to live a long life.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of beers a week. That's good to know. And you're active, trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little about your typical diet?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat good. I like… rice, and fish. Chicken too. Lots of vegetables. My wife, she used to cook really good food. Now… I mostly eat simple things. Not much fast food. I like soup.
DOCTOR: Okay, a generally healthy diet of rice, fish, chicken, and vegetables. We'll note that. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your general appearance. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you, Doctor. Just… tell me if you see anything bad, okay?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schwer. Deep breath in… and out… again… Good. Your heart sounds regular, though a little bit of a murmur, which is common at your age. Lungs are clear. Blood pressure is 130/80, which is a bit elevated, but not alarming. Pulse is 72, regular. I’m going to palpate your abdomen now. Any tenderness when I press here?
PATIENT: No, that doesn’t hurt. Just… a little pressure. I’ve got a bit of a belly, you know? From the beer, maybe. But no pain.
DOCTOR: Okay, a bit of abdominal fullness, likely related to lifestyle factors. Now, let's check your reflexes. Extend your leg… good. And the other one… okay. Reflexes are normal. Everything seems within normal limits for your age, but your blood pressure is slightly elevated and the murmur warrants monitoring. Let's get some blood work done to get a clearer picture of your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and overall health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Blood work is fine. Whatever you think is best. I just want to be sure I’m not… you know… getting sick like my sister and mother.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schwer. We'll draw some blood and send it to the lab. It will take a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend some lifestyle modifications to help lower your blood pressure. Try to reduce your sodium intake, increase your physical activity, and limit your alcohol consumption. We can discuss this further once we have your lab results. I'll also schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to review everything. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… okay. Less salt, more walking, less beer. I can try. It's hard, but… I want to live a long life, Doctor. Two weeks is good. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schwer. I understand. We’ll work together on this. I’m also going to write you a prescription for a low-dose blood pressure medication to help get things under control, alongside the lifestyle changes. Here's a referral to a cardiologist for a baseline EKG and echocardiogram, just to get a more detailed look at your heart given the murmur. And here are some handouts about healthy eating and exercise. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Cardiologist… that sounds serious. Is my heart… bad? And what does “echo-cardio-gram” even mean? I’m getting a little worried now, Doctor.
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Mr. Schwer. A referral to a cardiologist doesn't automatically mean your heart is bad. An echocardiogram is just an ultrasound of your heart – it's a non-invasive test that allows us to see the structure and function of your heart in more detail. We’re just being thorough, especially given the murmur I detected during the exam and your family history. It’s a preventative measure to ensure everything is functioning as it should. We want to rule out any potential issues early on, and an echocardiogram is the best way to do that. The cardiologist will explain the results to you in detail. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Okay… an ultrasound. Not cutting. Good. That’s… better. Still worried, but… better. So, just to be sure. Right. And the medicine… what does that do? Will it make me feel bad?
DOCTOR: The medication is a low-dose blood pressure medication, an ACE inhibitor. It works by relaxing your blood vessels, which helps lower your blood pressure and makes it easier for your heart to pump. Some people experience mild side effects like a dry cough or dizziness, but these are usually temporary and can be managed. We'll start with a low dose and monitor your response carefully. If you experience any significant side effects, let me know immediately. We can adjust the dose or switch to a different medication if needed. It's all about finding what works best for you. Do you have any other questions before we wrap things up, Mr. Schwer?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… try not to give me anything too strong, okay? And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. I still worry, but… I feel a little better now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schwer. Absolutely. We'll start with the lowest effective dose and monitor you closely. My priority is to ensure you feel comfortable and safe. Here are the written instructions and the referral information. Please schedule the echocardiogram as soon as possible. And don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’ll review the results together in two weeks. Do you have any work or school notes you would like me to fill out?
PATIENT: No, no notes. Just… getting old, Doctor. That’s all. Thank you again. I think I’m ready to go now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schwer. It was a pleasure meeting you. Take care of yourself, and remember to prioritize your health. We’ll see you in two weeks. Here’s the number for the clinic, should you need it before then.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.
