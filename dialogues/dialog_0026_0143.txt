DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Verrall. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Finco. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Um... well, it's a bit hard to explain, to be honest. I think... I think it has something to do with... starting a family. Or, planning to. My... a friend and I, we are thinking about it. But I'm... older now, and I want to make sure everything is okay first, you know? I don’t remember all the things I should be thinking about.
DOCTOR: I see. That's perfectly reasonable, Mr. Verrall. It’s very wise to get things checked out before starting a family, especially with any concerns about age or overall health. It’s good you’re thinking ahead. So, to clarify, you and a friend are considering having a child, and you’d like a general health assessment to make sure you're both in good shape?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. A health assessment… that sounds good. I… I don’t have insurance, though. Is that going to be a problem? And… is this a long process? I work, you see, sales engineering... it keeps me busy.
DOCTOR: We’ll certainly work with you regarding the lack of insurance, Mr. Verrall. We have options, and we can discuss those after the assessment. As for how long it will take… a basic assessment shouldn't be too lengthy. We’ll start with a thorough medical history and a physical exam. Depending on what we find, we might need some bloodwork, just to get a clearer picture. But let's start with talking through your medical background first. To begin, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds… manageable. My medical history… hmm. Well, I’ve broken a few bones, working. Sales engineering...lots of travel, sometimes rough places. Nothing major, I don’t think. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps… that sort of thing. I had a bad flu a couple of years ago, but I recovered. I don’t… I don’t really go to the doctor much. Is there something specific you want to know? I'm bad at remembering dates.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Verrall, don't worry about dates. Just the general idea is helpful. So, broken bones from work… do you have any lasting pain or limitations from those injuries?
PATIENT: No, not really. My back aches a little sometimes, after long trips, but nothing a good rest doesn't fix. And… I have this little twinge in my shoulder, when it’s cold. But I’ve had it for years. It’s just… old age, I think. I don't think it's anything to worry about.
DOCTOR: Okay, back and shoulder issues, noted. And those sound more like typical wear and tear. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t think so. No one has ever told me I had those… things. I eat fairly healthy, I think. Lots of fruit, when I can get it. And I try to walk when I travel, instead of taking taxis, you know? I did have a bad scare a few years back… my heart was racing, really fast. But the doctor said it was just stress.
DOCTOR: Okay, palpitations, possibly stress-related. It's good you sought medical attention for that at the time. We may want to revisit that briefly during the exam. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything other than the palpitations?
PATIENT: No, not that I can remember. Nothing… major, like. I had my tonsils out when I was a boy, I think. That’s all. And… I broke my arm once, badly, when I was little, but they just put it in a cast. No surgery, I don’t think. It healed fine.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and a broken arm, both healed without complications. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing regular. Sometimes I take something for a headache, if it’s really bad, but that’s it. And… sometimes I take a vitamin C tablet, when I’m traveling, to keep the colds away. But that’s not every day. Oh, and sometimes I use a cream for my skin, when it gets dry. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Okay, very good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat all sorts of things, and… I’ve never had to worry about bee stings or anything like that. I’m pretty lucky, I think.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Verrall. Alright, we’ve covered a lot of ground with your medical history. Now, let’s shift gears slightly and talk about your family history. Are your parents still living?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. They both passed away a long time ago. My father… he had a heart problem, I think. He died when I was still young. And my mother… she had something with her stomach, I think. I don't remember exactly. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very involved in their… doctor things.
DOCTOR: I see. It's understandable that you wouldn't recall specifics. Do you know if either of your parents had any other significant health issues, like diabetes, cancer, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother… she was always tired. The doctor said something about her blood, but I don't remember what. And… I think my father's brother had something with his lungs. He smoked a lot. I don’t really know much about their medical problems, Doctor. We weren’t very close, and… they didn’t talk much about it.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Mr. Verrall. Any information at all is helpful. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you currently smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. I don't like the smell of it. Always been that way. My father smoked, and I saw what it did to him.
DOCTOR: Good. That’s excellent. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I… sometimes I have a glass of wine with dinner, if I’m not traveling. But not every day. Maybe a couple of times a week. It helps me relax. I don’t drink to excess, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay, a couple of glasses of wine a week, noted. And finally, can you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Yes, well, I’m a Sales Engineer. I travel a lot, visiting clients, showing them… complicated machines. It keeps me busy. Lots of airports, lots of hotels. Sometimes it’s stressful, but I like the work. It keeps my mind active. It's tiring, though. And I don’t get much exercise, when I’m on the road.
DOCTOR: I see. A demanding job with a lot of travel. That explains a lot. Okay, Mr. Verrall, we’ve covered a good amount of ground with your medical history and lifestyle. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. It will just be a basic check of your heart, lungs, blood pressure, and a look in your ears and throat. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… fine. Go ahead. I haven't had a proper check-up in… a long time.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, if you could just sit back and relax. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. Please take deep breaths for me. Your heart rate is a little elevated, 88 beats per minute, but that could be due to the travel and the conversation. Lungs sound clear bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles noted. Blood pressure is 142 over 90. A little on the higher side, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Ears appear normal. Throat is clear. Abdomen is soft, non-tender. Reflexes are normal. Okay, everything seems relatively normal, Mr. Verrall, but your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and your heart rate is a bit fast. Given your age and desire to start a family, I would like to order some bloodwork to get a better picture of your overall health. It will include a complete blood count, a chemistry panel, a lipid profile, and a thyroid panel. Do you have any objections to that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That sounds… sensible. Bloodwork, go ahead. I trust your judgement. As long as it doesn’t take too long, you know? I have to get back to work eventually.
DOCTOR: Of course. We’ll get the order processed quickly, and the lab should be able to accommodate you right away. It shouldn’t take more than an hour or so. In the meantime, I'm going to write up a summary of our conversation and the plan for the bloodwork. So, to recap, you and a friend are considering starting a family, and you want to ensure you are both in good health. You have a history of a fast heartbeat, slightly elevated blood pressure, and a family history of heart disease and possible anemia. We’re ordering bloodwork to assess your overall health, including kidney function, thyroid function, cholesterol levels, and a complete blood count. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. Do you have any questions at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That… that all sounds right. I think you’ve covered everything. Just… what if the results aren’t good? What if something is wrong? It’s… a bit scary, thinking about it.
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Verrall. It is a bit scary to think about, but it’s also good to be proactive. If something is off, it doesn’t necessarily mean you can't start a family. It just means we need to address it. We have options for managing most health conditions, and there are specialists we can refer you to if needed. For example, if your blood pressure is consistently high, we might discuss lifestyle changes or medication. If your cholesterol is elevated, we can explore dietary modifications and exercise. Whatever the results are, we’ll discuss them thoroughly and create a plan that’s right for you. We’ll take things one step at a time. I'm also going to write you a referral to a cardiologist, just as a precaution. It's always good to have a specialist's opinion, especially given your concerns about your heart rate and family history. You don't need to see them right away, but it's good to have the referral in case you need it. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all. You’ve been very helpful. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen, and not… rushing me.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Verrall. I'm glad I could help. Remember, we'll get the bloodwork results back as quickly as possible, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Here are the orders for your bloodwork and the referral to the cardiologist. If you have any questions or concerns before your appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Best of luck, Mr. Verrall. I hope everything goes well.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. Bye bye.
