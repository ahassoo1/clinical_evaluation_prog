DOCTOR: Hi Adyn, welcome. I’m Dr. Roseburroagh. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, to be honest, I've been having a bit of trouble with my speech lately. It feels…slurred, sometimes. It’s hard to explain, and I don’t really remember when it started, exactly. It just…is.
DOCTOR: Okay, slurred speech… that’s good information to start with. And you said you’re not sure when it began?
PATIENT: No, I'm afraid not. It’s very frustrating, actually. Things feel…fuzzy, you know? Like trying to recall a dream. I just know it’s been happening, and people have mentioned it. My husband, mostly.
DOCTOR: Right, “fuzzy” is a helpful way to describe it. And it’s good your husband has noticed, that’s useful. Has the slurring been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Hmm… I think it comes and goes. It's not…every single word, all the time. But more often now than it used to be, I suppose. Especially when I’m tired. Or…stressed? It’s hard to say for certain. I don’t really…keep track, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense. Stress and fatigue can definitely play a role. Okay, and aside from the slurred speech and the feeling of fogginess, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: Let me think… Now that you mention it, maybe…a little bit of clumsiness? I dropped a hammer at work yesterday, which isn't like me. And I’ve been bumping into things a bit more around the house, but I figured I was just being distracted.
DOCTOR: Okay, clumsiness and the speech changes. I want to get a good picture of everything. Have you experienced any weakness in your arms or legs?
PATIENT: Weakness… Not that I've noticed, no. I do physical work, you see - construction management, so I’m on my feet a lot, lifting and moving things. Everything feels…normal there, if that makes sense. I haven’t had any trouble with balance, or anything like that, either.
DOCTOR: Good. And just to be thorough, have you had any headaches, vision changes, or difficulty swallowing recently?
PATIENT: Headaches… sometimes. Nothing terrible, just the usual kind, I think. And my vision is…well, I wear glasses, as you can see. It hasn’t gotten worse, if that’s what you mean. Difficulty swallowing… no, I don't think so. No, everything goes down alright.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any pre-existing conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: To be honest, Doctor, I’m not entirely sure. I have Medicare, and I see a general practitioner, of course. But I haven’t really been…ill, not seriously, in a long time. I suppose I’ve had the usual things – colds, the flu – but nothing chronic. My husband usually handles all the medical paperwork and appointments, so I don't always remember everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. I can certainly take a look at your records – we have access to them here. But just to confirm, have you ever been diagnosed with anything like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Not that I know of, Doctor. I really don’t think so. My husband would definitely have mentioned it, wouldn't he? He's very careful about those things. I’m married, you see, so I’m not always the one dealing with everything.
DOCTOR: Okay. And have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. I had my tonsils out when I was a child, I think. And…that’s about it. I haven’t had any major surgeries or been in the hospital as an adult. Just the usual check-ups, nothing more.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Family… Well, my mother, she passed away a few years ago. She had… arthritis, I believe. And my father, he’s still living, but he's quite old now. He’s always been healthy, though, very active. I don't really recall any serious illnesses on either side of the family. It's a bit fuzzy, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay. And do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I haven’t had any reactions to anything, not ever. My husband usually asks when they prescribe something new, and he’s very careful. I’m really sorry I can’t be more helpful, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Adyn. We're getting there. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Let me think… I take a multivitamin, sometimes. And when I have a headache, I take…paracetamol, I think? Just the usual over-the-counter stuff, nothing prescribed. That's about it, I’m quite healthy otherwise, so I don't take much at all.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if that’s okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I’m happy to help in any way I can.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, let’s check your ears. Good reflexes there. Now, I’m going to check your balance. Could you stand up for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. I’m a bit clumsy today, as I mentioned, so please excuse me if I wobble a bit.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just follow my finger with your eyes, don’t move your head. Good. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Squeeze my hands as hard as you can. And now, push against my hands, like you're trying to resist me. Now, let's check your reflexes. A little diminished there, but still present. Lastly, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Okay. Thank you, Adyn. You can sit back down now. Everything seems relatively normal, but I did notice a little bit of unsteadiness, and some mild weakness in your arms and legs, and slightly diminished reflexes. This, combined with your speech difficulties, is what I want to investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh, really? I hadn’t realized. I just thought I was a bit clumsy today. What…what could it be, Doctor? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: It's good that we're investigating it now. It's too early to say definitively, Adyn. There are a number of things it could be. We need to rule some things out. It could be something simple like a vitamin deficiency, but it's important to consider other possibilities, like neurological issues. To get a better picture, I'd like to order some blood work to check your vitamin levels, thyroid function, and overall health. I also think an MRI of your brain would be a good idea to get a closer look at the neurological aspect of things. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An MRI…? That sounds… a little frightening, Doctor. Is it really necessary? I mean, I just thought I was a bit tired and clumsy, as I said. But if you think it’s best… then yes, I suppose so. Will it be a long procedure? And…will it hurt? I'm not very good with… medical things.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Adyn. It does sound a bit daunting, and it’s perfectly normal to feel anxious. An MRI is a very safe procedure – it uses strong magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of your brain. It doesn't involve any radiation, and it’s painless. You will lie on a table inside a large machine, and it will be quite noisy – we'll provide you with earplugs. It usually takes about 30-60 minutes, and you will need to stay very still during the scan. While the MRI will give us a lot of information, I also want to rule out other possibilities. So, I’ll also order the blood work to check for any deficiencies or underlying medical conditions. We’ll start with those two things, and then we can discuss the results and decide on the next steps. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Yes, I suppose so. Blood work sounds…less scary, at least. Thirty to sixty minutes, you said? And no radiation… that's good. I'm just… worried about what it might show, if you understand. But if it’s necessary to find out what’s going on… then I trust your judgement, Doctor. When would I be able to schedule the MRI and the blood work? And…will they explain the results to me?
DOCTOR: I absolutely understand your concerns, Adyn, and it's good you're asking these questions. We'll take things one step at a time. The blood work can be done here at the clinic – we have a lab on-site. I’ll write you a requisition now, and you can go whenever it's convenient for you. We can get those results back fairly quickly, usually within a few days. As for the MRI, I’ll give you a referral to the imaging center nearby. They'll contact you to schedule an appointment. They usually have good availability, but it's best to call sooner rather than later. And yes, absolutely, we will thoroughly explain all the results to you. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss everything in detail once we have the results back. We’ll go through everything together, and I’ll answer any questions you have. How does that sound?
PATIENT: That sounds…much better, Doctor. Knowing we have a plan makes me feel a bit calmer. A follow-up appointment… yes, that's good. And you’ll explain everything to me, so I don't have to worry about understanding complicated medical terms. Thank you. Here's my husband’s phone number, just in case you need to reach me. He usually handles these things, as you know.
DOCTOR: Excellent. We’ll definitely keep your husband in the loop, and he’s welcome to join us for the follow-up appointment if he wishes. It’s good to have support. So, to summarise: I’ve written a requisition for blood work to be done here at the clinic, and a referral for an MRI at the imaging center. Once we have those results, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Do you have any other questions for me at this point, Adyn?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Just… thank you for being so patient and understanding. I'm a bit of a worrier, and I don't always remember things very well, as you've noticed. But I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. And for not dismissing my concerns. I'll get the blood work done right away.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Adyn. It’s my job to listen and to help you get the answers you need. And please, don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We’re here to support you. Okay. Well, I think we’re all set for now. Please schedule those tests when you have a chance. I look forward to seeing you at our follow-up appointment. Take care of yourself, and try not to worry too much. It was a pleasure meeting you.
PATIENT: The pleasure was all mine, Doctor. And thank you again. I will schedule the tests right away. Have a good day. .
DOCTOR: You too, Adyn. Take care. .
