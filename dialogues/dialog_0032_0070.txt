DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Szmyd. My name is Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you're with Medicare. Thank you for choosing our clinic. Now, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning… Doctor… Pipkorn, yes? Clinic is… nice. Very… clean. I… uh… just moved here. From… far away. Social thing, I think? For the… old people with the… papers. Medicare, yes. Not much wrong. Just… checking, I guess. Old age, you know? Everything gets… loose.
DOCTOR: Right, of course. A general check-up is always wise, especially with a change in environment. It’s good you’re being proactive. “Loose,” you say?
PATIENT: Oh, you know. Things. Back… aches. Knees. Not big things. Used to work… with the faces. Make pretty for the… stage. A long time ago. Now… just sit. Watch TV. Everything slows down. Not complaining. Just… old. You understand?
DOCTOR: I do understand, Mr. Szmyd. It's quite common for things to…shift as we age. However, "shifts" can sometimes indicate underlying issues that are best addressed. Let’s try to be a bit more specific. When you say your back aches, can you describe the pain?
PATIENT: Specific…? Uh… it’s… dull. Like… everything is heavy. All the time. Not sharp. Not… stabbing. Just… there. Especially when I… get up. Or sit too long. Like now, maybe. Old chair, maybe? Everything hurts a little, you know? It's… normal. For people my age. I don’t… need anything done about it. Just… checking.
DOCTOR: While it may be "normal" for some discomfort with age, Mr. Szmyd, it's my job to determine why you’re experiencing this discomfort and if there's anything we can do to improve your quality of life. A little discomfort is one thing; constant pain is another. Let's move on. You mentioned your knees as well?
PATIENT: Knees… They… click. A lot. And… stiff. Especially in the mornings. Getting out of bed is… a process. Not bad bad. Just… slow. Like a rusty door. I used to… dance, you know? A long, long time ago. But that was… before. Now… just walking to the… fridge. Is a big adventure. It’s… the weather, probably. Everything aches when the weather changes.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand. While weather can certainly play a role, it’s important to rule out other causes. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Symptoms… Hmm… Let me think. I… forget things sometimes. Not… important things. Like… what I had for breakfast. Or the name of that actor… you know, the one with the… hair. But… important things, I remember. Mostly. And… tired. Always a little tired. Old… tired. Is that a symptom? Everyone gets tired, no? It's… life. I sleep… okay, I think. Sometimes. It’s… hard to tell anymore. Too much thinking. Too much TV. That’s it, probably.
DOCTOR: “Excessive TV viewing” can certainly contribute to fatigue, Mr. Szmyd. However, we need to consider other possibilities. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite… I eat… enough. Not much excitement in the food these days. Everything tastes the same. Bland. I used to… cook, you know? Russian food. Very… flavorful. But now… just… whatever is easy. Weight…? I think I’m… the same. Maybe a little… bigger. But who isn’t? Old age… expands things. It’s… natural. Not worried about it. More worried about the… chair. Hurts my back. You got a good chair here, though. Much better than mine.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, just to complete a thorough assessment, let’s briefly discuss your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Medical history…? Not that I remember. Doctors… in Russia… very different. Everything was… simple. You got sick, they gave you a pill. No… fancy tests. No… talking. Just… pills. I think I had… something with my stomach once. A long time ago. But it went away. And… maybe high blood pressure? The doctor said something about… salt. But I like salt! Everything tastes better with salt. I don't remember much else. Very… long ago. Too much vodka, maybe. Who knows? It was… a different life.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… Hmm… Let me see. I think… maybe my tonsils? When I was a child. Very… long ago. And… maybe a broken arm? Falling from a tree. It was… a long time ago. Everything is… blurry. So many years. I don’t… remember details. Hospital…? Maybe. For the tonsils, perhaps. Very… brief. They gave me… ice cream. I liked the ice cream. Not much else I remember. It's all… very old. Things… fade, you know? Like… old photographs.
DOCTOR: Very well. Now, just one more section. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… My… mother… she… was always cold. Sickly. I think. But she died… very young. Pneumonia, maybe? It was… a long time ago. My father… strong. Very strong. Worked hard. Lived a long life. He… fell, I think. Broke his hip. That’s… all I remember. Not much talk about… sickness in my family. You just… kept going. Strong vodka, you know? Cured everything. Or so they said. It's… different now, I guess. Everything is… fancy. Too many questions.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Thank you for sharing that information with me. Now, I’d like to conduct a brief physical exam to get a better understanding of your current condition. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Physical…? If you must. I’m… an old man. Not much to see. But… alright. If you need to… poke and prod. Go ahead. Just… be gentle. Everything is… fragile these days. And… don't take too long. I have… TV to watch.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd. Your blood pressure is 148/92, which is slightly elevated. Your pulse is 78 and regular. Your respiration rate is 16, and your temperature is 98.6. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds are regular, with a slight murmur. Not immediately concerning, but we’ll want to monitor that. Your lungs are clear. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Your reflexes are a little diminished, which is not uncommon with age. And finally, I’m going to check your joints for any tenderness or swelling. Your knees have some crepitus, which is consistent with osteoarthritis. You also have some tenderness in your lower back. Alright, that’s all for the physical exam. Based on the information you’ve provided and the findings from the physical exam, it appears you have some mild osteoarthritis in your knees and lower back, slightly elevated blood pressure, and a heart murmur. Your forgetfulness and fatigue could be related to age, but we’ll want to investigate further to rule out any underlying medical conditions.
PATIENT: Murmur…? Sounds… bad? I… feel fine. Mostly. Old, but fine. What does this… investigate… mean? More poking and prodding? I just wanted to… check. Make sure I'm not… falling apart. Not… looking for trouble. Just… old age. Is that all? You’re sure it’s not just… old age? I really just want to… watch my TV. And maybe have some… salt. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, a murmur doesn’t necessarily mean something is severely wrong. It simply indicates an abnormal sound during your heartbeat. It could be benign, but we need to rule out any potential underlying cardiac issues. "Investigate" means we'll need to perform some additional tests, such as an EKG – an electrocardiogram – to assess your heart's electrical activity, and possibly a chest X-ray to examine your lungs and heart size. These tests aren't about “looking for trouble,” as you say, but about ensuring your health and well-being. They will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. I understand you’re primarily concerned with maintaining your quality of life, and that includes being able to enjoy your television and yes, even a little salt in your diet. However, ignoring potential health concerns won't make them disappear. Would you be willing to proceed with these tests?
PATIENT: Tests… More tests. Is this what doctors do now? Just… test and poke? Chest X-ray…? Sounds… scary. And… electrocardiogram… Is that… painful? I just want a simple answer. Am I dying? Or not? Is that too much to ask? I don't want… machines. I want… peace. And TV. And salt. Is it really necessary? This is… too much for an old man. Maybe… maybe I’ll just go home. Watch TV. And… eat some salt. Forget about… murmurs. Is that allowed?
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, I understand your frustration and your reluctance to undergo further testing. I assure you, these tests are not meant to alarm you, but to provide us with the information we need to make informed decisions about your health. The EKG is completely painless – it simply involves placing small electrodes on your chest to measure your heart’s electrical activity. I wouldn't recommend these tests if I didn't believe they were important. A murmur could indicate a range of issues, some minor, some more serious. The X-ray is a quick and relatively simple procedure. To answer your question directly, no, based on my initial assessment, you do not appear to be dying. However, I cannot definitively say whether your murmur is harmless without further investigation. Ultimately, the decision is yours. If you prefer to forgo the tests, that is your right. However, I strongly advise against it. Ignoring potential health concerns could lead to more serious complications down the line. If you do decide to proceed, I’ll ensure the process is as comfortable and stress-free as possible. What are your thoughts?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine, tests. But… quick. And gentle. And no… scary machines. Just… get it over with. And tell me… after… if I can still watch TV. And eat salt. That’s… important. Very important. I don't want… bad news. Just… tell me everything is… okay. Or… manageable. That's all I ask. Get it over with. Please. I’m… tired. Old and tired. Just… make it quick.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Szmyd. I assure you, we’ll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. I'll order the EKG and chest X-ray right away. The EKG can be performed here in the clinic. The X-ray will require a visit to the radiology department, which is located just across the street. I will personally review the results as soon as they are available and discuss them with you in detail. And yes, I will certainly let you know if you can continue enjoying your television and your salt. The nurse will come in shortly to prepare you for the EKG. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: No… questions. Just… get it over with. And… make sure they turn up the volume on the TV in the waiting room. I might… need a distraction. And… tell the nurse to be gentle. Very gentle. Old skin, you know. Fragile. That’s all. Just… gentle. And… TV.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Szmyd. I will personally inform the nurse to be as gentle as possible, and I will ensure the TV volume is increased in the waiting room. Please, just relax. We’ll take care of everything. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly.
PATIENT: .
