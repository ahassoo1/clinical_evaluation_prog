DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Julie. I'm Dr. Bombara. It's nice to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Honestly, I haven't the slightest idea why I'm here. My… assistant, I suppose, scheduled this. Something about not being able to see or hear properly. It’s terribly inconvenient, really. I have important things to attend to.
DOCTOR: Right. That is inconvenient. So, you're experiencing some difficulty with your vision and hearing?
PATIENT: Yes, that's what the… girl said. It came on quite suddenly, I believe. Though, truthfully, everything feels rather… blurry these days. Not just my sight, if you understand. Everything is a bit of a muddle. I don't recall when it started, specifically. Perhaps yesterday? Or the day before? It hardly matters, does it? I just want it fixed.
DOCTOR: It does matter, Ms. Julie, as the timing can help us understand what might be going on. Let’s try to narrow it down. When you say “everything feels blurry,” is that mostly with your vision, or are you having trouble with other things too?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, Doctor, must we dissect every little detail? It’s… unsettling. But, if you insist. Mostly my vision, I suppose. Things aren't as sharp as they used to be. And people seem to mumble. I find myself asking them to repeat themselves constantly, which is… beneath me, frankly. It’s not a comfortable situation. I’ve always had excellent hearing, you know. I used to be able to pick up the faintest whisper.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Julie. It’s good you’re noticing these changes. Let's start with your vision. Has it been a gradual decline, or did it happen all at once?
PATIENT: All at once, I believe. Or… very suddenly. I was reading – a rather important document, naturally – and then… everything just seemed… washed out. Like looking through a dirty window, perhaps? It wasn’t a slow fading; it was rather abrupt. And quite disturbing, I assure you. I haven't been able to concentrate properly since. It’s most unprofessional.
DOCTOR: Okay, sudden onset. And you mentioned difficulty hearing – is that also a recent change?
PATIENT: Yes, quite recent. Along with the… visual impairment. People's voices just seem… muffled. As if they’re speaking from another room. It’s extremely irritating. I had a perfectly clear understanding of everything said to me before this… episode. It’s quite unsettling, Doctor. And I have a very important gala next week; I need to be at my best.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do you recall anything happening before these changes started?
PATIENT: Before? Goodness, Doctor, that's a rather broad question. Let me think… I was rather stressed, I suppose. Preparing for the gala, naturally. Numerous arrangements, endless details. A quite exhausting undertaking. And I had a disagreement with my… former husband, regarding the seating arrangements. It was quite a heated exchange, if I'm being honest. But I doubt that would have anything to do with my… condition. It’s simply a coincidence, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: I understand. Stress can certainly exacerbate things. Now, have you experienced any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… I do feel a bit… fatigued, I suppose. More tired than usual. And a slight headache, perhaps? Nothing terribly debilitating, mind you. I’ve always been rather resilient. But it’s… different. A dull ache, mostly behind my eyes. And I find myself rather… irritable. Though that’s hardly surprising, given the circumstances.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, headache behind the eyes, irritability… alright. Ms. Julie, I'd like to do a quick physical examination, if that's alright with you. I'll check your vision, hearing, and a few other things. It will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on.
PATIENT: Oh, must we? I detest being poked and prodded. It’s terribly undignified. But… I suppose if it’s absolutely necessary. The sooner this is resolved, the better. Just… please be gentle. And efficient. I have a very busy schedule, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Julie. I'll be as gentle and efficient as possible. Let's start with your vision. Could you please follow the light with your eyes?
PATIENT: Very well. But do hurry, Doctor. This is… rather inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie. Your eye movements are a little… unsteady. Now, I’m going to check your pupils. This will just take a moment. Pupils are sluggish to react to light. Slightly unequal in size as well. And now, let’s listen to your ears with this otoscope. Ear drums appear normal. No signs of infection. Finally, let’s check your balance. Could you please stand with your feet together and close your eyes?
PATIENT: Close my eyes? Are you quite sure that’s wise? I might fall. Honestly, Doctor, this is becoming increasingly… undignified. Oh! There. See? I told you I’d fall. It’s quite alarming, really. And I’ve undoubtedly ruined my stockings. This whole examination is a disaster. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Julie, please open your eyes. It's alright. And please don't worry about your stockings. Based on this brief examination – the unsteady gait, sluggish pupil reaction, unequal pupil size and the unsteady eye movements – I am concerned. It could be a neurological issue. I'm going to order a CT scan of your brain, and I'd also like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. It's important to rule out anything serious. Would you be able to schedule those appointments?
