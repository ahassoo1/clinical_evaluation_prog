DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Szmyd, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ah, yes. Sit. Good. This… this new doctor, yes? I just moved here. From… somewhere. Not important now. Medicare told me to come. Social visit, they said. Just to… check things. Old man things, I guess. I do makeup, you know. For… plays. And things. Not sick, exactly. Just… new.
DOCTOR: "Social visit," huh?
PATIENT: Yes! That's what the lady on the phone said. Something about… settling in? I don't remember all the details. Women talk fast, you know? Always talking. It’s… a process. Like putting on foundation, many layers. Is this… a long visit? I have a client… maybe. Later.
DOCTOR: Well, it shouldn’t be, Mr. Szmyd. But to make sure everything’s alright – and because you’re new to the area, like Medicare suggested – I need to ask you some questions. Just routine. We’ll cover your medical history, any medications you’re taking, things like that. Then I’ll do a quick physical exam. That sound alright?
PATIENT: Physical… exam? Like… poking and prodding? I don’t like being poked. Is it necessary? I’m a very healthy man, you know. I work with… faces. I make healthy faces. But… okay. If you must. Just… be gentle. And fast. I have… commitments. What kind of questions? About my… history? I forget things. A lot of things.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Szmyd. Just to get a baseline. We’ll start with your past medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical… conditions? Hmm. Let me think. I had… a bad back, once. Years ago. From lifting… heavy things. For a play. A very dramatic play. But it went away. Mostly. And… I think I had the flu, maybe? A long time ago. Very common. Everyone gets the flu. Nothing serious. Do I need to remember something… specific? Names? Dates? I’m not good with those.
DOCTOR: Okay. Back pain, resolved. Flu, unspecified. Any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… oh. Yes! I had… something on my eye. A little thing. Very small. A… growth, maybe? The doctor took it off. Years ago. I needed good vision for my work, you see. Faces, very important. It didn’t hurt much. Local… something. They put… drops in my eye. Before. It’s… all a blur now. I don’t remember the doctor’s name. Or where it happened.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Now you ask a good question. Let me see… I take… a little blue pill. For… something. My wife… my ex-wife… she gave it to me. For my… heart? Or my blood pressure? I don’t remember. It’s a small one. I take it every day. Or… sometimes. When I remember. It’s blue. Very small. Is that important? I also take… vitamins. For… energy. Old man things, you know?
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, do you know the name of this blue pill?
PATIENT: Name? No. No, I don’t. I just… take it. She said it was good for me. She was always telling me what was good for me. A very… particular woman. I don't… keep track of those things. Names, dates, pills… it all blurs together. It's a little blue, that's all I know. And small!
DOCTOR: Okay. Let’s move on to allergies. Are you allergic to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm. Let me think. I don’t think so. I eat everything. I have to eat. For energy! But… sometimes my skin gets… red. When I use cheap makeup. Very cheap makeup. It's terrible stuff. Makes the faces look awful. Is that an allergy? Or just… bad product? I prefer the expensive kind. Very gentle on the skin.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, with all due respect, you’re making this very difficult. I need accurate information to properly assess your health. Do you have any family history of medical conditions?
PATIENT: Difficult? I'm difficult? I’m trying my best! It’s not my fault I don’t remember everything! My family… oh. My mother… she was… sick. A long time ago. Very weak. But I don’t know what she had. She died. A long time ago. My father… he was strong. A very strong man. He worked with… wood. That’s all I remember. No… no one else was sick. A healthy family, mostly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's just do a quick physical exam then. It'll be faster. Please lie down on the table.
PATIENT: Exam… right. Poking and prodding. Just… be gentle, please. And quick. I have… appointments. Very important appointments. Is it cold in here? I always get cold easily. Very old man thing.
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath for me, Mr. Szmyd. And another… Alright. Your heart rate is a little elevated… and breathing sounds slightly wheezy. Any history of asthma or COPD?
PATIENT: Elevated? Wheezy? What does that mean? Asthma… COPD… no. No, I don’t think so. I get… out of breath sometimes. When I’m doing… dramatic things. For the play. Lots of running and shouting. Very physically demanding. It's just… acting. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: Alright. Any abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Oof! Well… now that you mention it… a little. Here. Sometimes. After I eat. Too much… rich food. Or maybe it's just… old age. Everything hurts a little when you get old. It's a fact of life.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your reflexes are a little diminished… and your pupils are slightly unequal in size. Have you experienced any vision changes lately?
PATIENT: Vision… changes? Hmm. Now that you mention it… things are a little blurry sometimes. Especially at night. I have trouble reading the scripts. It's very frustrating. I keep having to ask the actors to speak up. Maybe it's the lighting? Theatre lighting is terrible. Harsh and unforgiving.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Szmyd. Based on this exam, and given your difficulty recalling your medical history, I’m concerned about several things. Your slightly elevated heart rate, wheezing, diminished reflexes, unequal pupils, and reported vision changes warrant further investigation. I recommend a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an EKG, and a referral to an ophthalmologist. Also, a CT scan of the head would be prudent.
PATIENT: Complete… what? Metabolic… panel? EKG? CT… scan? Goodness gracious. That sounds… serious. And expensive. Is that really necessary? I just wanted a quick check-up. To satisfy Medicare. Are you sure it's that bad? Maybe it's just old age. A lot of things happen when you get old.
DOCTOR: Mr. Szmyd, I understand your concerns, but these tests are necessary to rule out potentially serious conditions. Given your vague medical history and these findings, it’s my professional responsibility to investigate further. We need to determine the cause of your symptoms and ensure you receive the appropriate treatment. We can discuss payment options with the billing department, but delaying these tests could have serious consequences. I’ll write the orders now, and the nurse will schedule you for them. We'll also need to get in touch with your primary care physician, if you have one.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Fine. Do whatever you think is necessary. But I don’t like it. I really don’t like it. A primary… physician? I don’t even know what that is. All this… testing. And numbers. And bills. I just wanted to live in peace. And do my makeup. This is a disaster. A complete and utter disaster.
DOCTOR: Alright. Here are the orders for the tests. The nurse will explain everything to you. I'm also going to put in a referral to a neurologist, given the diminished reflexes and unequal pupils. It’s best to be thorough. I’ll also have my staff reach out to Medicare to ensure coverage for these tests. Do you have any questions before I leave?
PATIENT: Neurologist? Now you’re just piling it on. Piling it on! I don’t know what any of this means. I just… I just want to go home. And maybe take a nap. It’s all so confusing. No, I don't have any questions. Just… please, just let me go home. I'll let the nurse… do whatever she needs to do. .
DOCTOR: Very well. The nurse will be in shortly. Have a good day, Mr. Szmyd.
