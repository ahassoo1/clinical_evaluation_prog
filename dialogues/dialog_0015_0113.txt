DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s this blasted bladder of mine. Going to the bathroom far too often, you know? It’s a nuisance, really. Wakes me up at night, too. Not a good way to live, let me tell you. I used to have… well, never mind what I used to have. It's just… frequent. That’s the word. Frequent.
DOCTOR: Frequent urination. Alright. And how long has this been going on, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. How long… that’s a tricky one. Seems like… a while now. Not just started, certainly. Months, I suppose. Maybe longer. Time… it slips away, you know? I don’t pay it much mind. It’s just been getting worse, that's all. More trips at night, more trips during the day. It’s… irritating.
DOCTOR: Months, getting progressively worse. And are you experiencing any pain or burning when you urinate?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really pain. A little discomfort, maybe. But not pain. Burning… hmm. I don’t think so. No, definitely no burning. Just… the need to go. Constantly. It’s like a leaky faucet, that’s what it feels like. Always dripping, always needing attention. More annoying than anything, honestly.
DOCTOR: No pain or burning, just frequent urge. Have you noticed any changes in the color or smell of your urine, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Color? Smell? Oh, now you're asking things. I don't spend much time looking at my… well, you know. It looks like pee, Doctor. It smells like… pee. What do you want me to do, analyze it? I’m a farmer, not a chemist! Honestly, these questions… are you sure this is important?
DOCTOR: It is, Mr. Segretto. Changes in urine can be indicative of several things. But let’s not dwell on that right now. Do you find yourself having difficulty starting the stream of urine, or a weak stream when you do go?
PATIENT: Difficulty… hmm. Well, sometimes it takes a moment. Not a long moment, mind you. Just a little hesitation. And the stream… it’s not as powerful as it used to be, I suppose. When I was younger… well, that’s neither here nor there. It's not a gush, if that's what you're asking. More of a… trickle. A respectable trickle, mind you, but not like when I was a young man.
DOCTOR: Hesitation starting, weaker stream. Alright. Have you had any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain recently?
PATIENT: Fever? No. Chills? No. Lower abdominal pain… not really. A little ache now and then, but nothing to write home about. Just the usual aches and pains of getting old, Doctor. I’ve lived a long life, you know. Farming isn't easy on the body. I've pulled my fair share of weeds and heavy things. It’s just…old age, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Well, my wife, bless her heart, she keeps track of those things. I take a little something for my blood pressure, I believe. A small white pill. And sometimes, when my joints act up, I take something for that too, but I forget what it's called. She buys them at the… at the general store. That’s about it, I think. Nothing fancy.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure medication, occasional joint pain medication. Do you have any allergies to medications, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Allergies? Now that's a good question. Hmm… not that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I recall. Maybe a little sniffle from the pollen in the spring, but that's just nature, isn’t it? Nothing serious. No, I don't think I’m allergic to any medications. My wife would certainly have told me if I was. She's very careful about those things.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, Mr. Segretto. I’ll need to check your abdomen and, with your permission, do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. It’s standard procedure for evaluating frequent urination in men your age. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A…a what now? A digital…exam? Goodness gracious. Look, Doctor, I appreciate you wanting to be thorough, but that sounds… unpleasant. And frankly, a little unnecessary. I’ve lived seventy-four years perfectly well without anyone poking around… down there. Is it really necessary? Couldn't we just… try a pill or something?
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, I understand your discomfort, but a digital rectal exam is a crucial part of ruling out several potential causes for your symptoms, including an enlarged prostate, which is common in men your age. It allows me to assess the size and consistency of your prostate and check for any abnormalities. Skipping this step could lead to a missed diagnosis. It's a quick exam, and I will be as gentle as possible. However, without it, I cannot provide you with an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan. We need to do this to determine what's causing your frequent urination. Are you willing to proceed?
PATIENT: Well, I suppose if you insist. But I’m telling you, Doctor, it’s a waste of time. I feel perfectly fine, aside from needing to visit the privy a few extra times. A few extra times! It's not the end of the world. Still… if it will get you off my back, and get me out of here… alright. Go ahead. But be quick about it, and be gentle, you hear? And don’t tell me anything I don’t need to know.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please lie down on your left side with your knees bent. I’ll explain each step as I go. First, I’m going to listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Sounds are normal. Now, I’ll need to gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. This will allow me to feel your prostate. It may be slightly uncomfortable, but should not be painful. Please let me know if you experience any significant discomfort. … Alright. I do feel some enlargement, and it feels slightly firm. No obvious nodules detected, but the prostate is definitely larger than expected for your age. Alright, that’s all. Now, let's discuss the possible causes and what we can do next. "Prostate exam: Enlarged, firm. No nodules palpated."
PATIENT: Well, that wasn’t pleasant. I told you it was a waste of time. Enlarged, you say? I suppose that explains why I have to get up three times a night. Honestly, Doctor, what does this mean? Do I need…surgery? Is this serious? Don't tell me I’m going to be spending the rest of my days… well, you know.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, an enlarged prostate, also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, is very common as men age. It doesn’t necessarily mean you need surgery. However, it can cause symptoms like frequent urination, difficulty starting the stream, and a weak stream, as you’ve described. It's rarely cancer, but we need to rule that out. The next step is a PSA blood test to check for elevated prostate-specific antigen levels, which can be indicative of prostate cancer or other prostate problems. I’ll also order a urinalysis to check for infection. Depending on the results of those tests, we may also consider an ultrasound. We’re going to gather more information before we discuss any specific treatment options, which could range from medication to lifestyle changes, and potentially surgery if necessary. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Blood tests… more tests… it never ends, does it? So, you’re saying it's probably not serious, but you need to be sure. And there are… pills? I don’t like the idea of pills. I’m a farmer, Doctor, not a…a laboratory experiment. But… alright. Do what you have to do. Just… try not to poke around too much, alright? And tell me straight if it's anything… bad. No sugarcoating. I’m an old man, I can handle the truth.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Segretto. I understand your concerns. I’ll order the PSA blood test and a urinalysis. The lab results usually take a few days. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available, and we’ll discuss them in detail. In the meantime, try to limit your fluid intake before bedtime and avoid caffeine and alcohol. These can exacerbate your symptoms. If you experience any fever, chills, or severe pain, please contact the clinic immediately. I'm also going to print out a handout with more information about BPH. Here you go. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Caffeine and alcohol… well, that's going to be difficult. But alright. No, I don’t think so. Just… when will I hear back? I don’t want to be waiting around for weeks. A few days, you said? And if it is something serious… what then? I suppose I'll have to trust your judgment, Doctor. But I’m not promising I’ll be happy about it. Thank you, I think.
DOCTOR: The lab usually returns results within 3-5 business days. I will personally call you as soon as I have them, Mr. Segretto. If it is something more serious, we will discuss all of your treatment options in detail, and you’ll have plenty of time to make an informed decision. Alright. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s all. Just… try to remember my name, alright? It’s Segretto. A-R-L-A-N Segretto. It’s an Italian name. Probably not something you see around here very often. Well, thank you again. I’ll be waiting for your call. And try not to keep me waiting too long. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Segretto. I will. Segretto… yes, I have it written down. .
