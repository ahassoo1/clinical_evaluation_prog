DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. My name is Dr. Soodeen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you're 41 years old. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Yes, 41, precisely. I… well, I’ve been gaining weight, and I haven’t changed anything in my diet or exercise routine. It’s quite perplexing, and frankly, a little concerning. I’d like to understand why, if that’s possible. I don’t want to waste your time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Selbitschka. Weight gain without changes to diet or exercise is worth investigating. We certainly won't dismiss it. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me about how long you've been noticing this weight gain?
PATIENT: Approximately… six months, I would say. It began gradually, but it’s become more noticeable in the last three. My clothes feel tighter, and… well, the scale doesn’t lie. I try to weigh myself weekly, just to keep track, and it’s been consistently going up. It’s not a drastic change each week, but it is consistent.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months, with a more noticeable change in the last three. That gives us a good starting point. And you said it’s been a consistent increase, not a sudden jump?
PATIENT: Precisely. Not a sudden jump, no. A slow, steady… accumulation. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest. I’ve always been fairly… stable, weight-wise. Perhaps half a pound a week, on average? It fluctuates, of course, but that’s a reasonable estimate, I believe.
DOCTOR: Half a pound a week, consistently, over the last six months. Alright. Now, besides the weight gain, have you noticed any other changes in your body or how you feel?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I’ve been… more tired, perhaps. Not debilitatingly so, but I find myself needing naps more often. And I seem to be a little colder than usual, even when the temperature is quite comfortable. My husband has noticed it, too. He says I’m always wrapped in a shawl now, which isn’t like me. And… my skin feels drier, I suppose. Is that relevant? I really don’t know what is relevant, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Those are all helpful things to know, Ms. Selbitschka, thank you. Increased fatigue, feeling colder than usual, and drier skin – those can definitely be connected. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: No, not really. I’ve been quite fortunate, health-wise. A few childhood illnesses, the usual things, but nothing… chronic. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, and I broke my wrist once, but that’s about it. No ongoing conditions, no major surgeries. I don’t take any regular medications either. Just a daily multivitamin, if that counts.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. No chronic conditions, no surgeries, just a daily multivitamin. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My mother had… high blood pressure, I believe, in her later years. And my father had some trouble with his heart, but he lived to be 85, so it wasn’t too severe. My sister is healthy, as far as I know. No history of… thyroid problems, diabetes, or anything like that. Not that I’m aware of, at least. My family isn’t very forthcoming with medical details, unfortunately.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, even with the limited information. Family history of hypertension is good to note. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Certainly. I work as an orderly at the local hospital, so I’m on my feet quite a bit. It’s physically demanding work, though not exceptionally strenuous. I’m married, as you know, and we live in a quiet suburban neighborhood. I enjoy gardening when the weather permits, and I like to read. I wouldn’t say I’m a particularly active person, but I’m not sedentary either. We eat home-cooked meals most nights, mostly traditional Lithuanian dishes… which are rather hearty, admittedly. Lots of potatoes.
DOCTOR: Hearty Lithuanian dishes with lots of potatoes… I understand. Alright. And do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. Never have, never will. I don’t have any vices, Doctor. My husband enjoys a glass of wine with dinner occasionally, but I abstain entirely. I find it rather… unpleasant, to be honest. And no, no recreational drugs. I’m a very… straightforward person. I believe in a clean, simple life.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Selbitschka. Now, just one more question regarding your history, and then we can move on to a physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I am aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I’ve eaten all sorts of things throughout my life, and I’ve never experienced any discomfort or irritation. No skin allergies, no food sensitivities, no reactions to medications… I truly believe I’m quite fortunate in that regard. Yes, no allergies at all. I think I’ve answered everything, Doctor. You may proceed with the examination when you are ready.
DOCTOR: Very well. Thank you for providing me with such a thorough history, Ms. Selbitschka. It’s very helpful. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your thyroid gland. I'll also take a look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, perfectly alright. Please proceed. I understand that’s necessary. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Selbitschka. Based on the physical exam, your thyroid gland does feel a bit enlarged and firm. Given your symptoms—weight gain, fatigue, feeling colder than usual, drier skin—and the findings on the physical exam, I suspect we should investigate the possibility of hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland isn't producing enough thyroid hormone.
PATIENT: Hypothyroidism… That sounds… serious. Is it common? And what does that entail? Will I need… surgery? I must admit, Doctor, I’m rather anxious now. I just want to understand what’s happening and how to fix it.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be anxious, Ms. Selbitschka. Hypothyroidism is relatively common, especially in women. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it does need to be addressed. It’s rarely an emergency, thankfully. The good news is that it’s often very treatable with medication. Surgery is not usually required, unless there’s a large goiter or a suspicious nodule, which doesn't seem to be the case here. To confirm the diagnosis, I’d like to order some blood tests. Specifically, we’ll check your TSH and T4 levels. These tests will tell us exactly how your thyroid gland is functioning. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, blood tests are perfectly alright. Anything to find out what’s going on. TSH and T4, you said? Yes, please. I’d like to get this sorted out as quickly as possible. Will I need to fast beforehand? And how long will it take to get the results? I have a doctor's appointment scheduled with my regular physician next month, and I'd like to have some answers before then, if possible.
DOCTOR: Yes, you'll need to fast for at least eight hours before the blood draw. No food or sugary drinks, but you can drink water. I'll give you a requisition form to take to the lab. The results usually take about 3-5 business days to come back. I’ll have my nurse call you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. We're just gathering information at this point. Once we have the results, we can discuss treatment options—which, as I mentioned, usually involve a daily thyroid hormone replacement medication. Is there anything else I can answer for you right now?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything. Fast for eight hours, water is okay, results in 3-5 business days, and a phone call when they are available. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and patient with my questions. I appreciate your kindness. I suppose I’ll just… wait for the phone call now. Is there anything else I need to do before I leave? A form to sign, perhaps?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. I'm glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Just sign this consent form, and then my nurse will escort you to the lab. She’s just finishing up with another patient at the moment. I will also print out a summary of our visit for your records, and a list of instructions regarding the fasting requirements for the blood tests. If you experience any concerning symptoms before the results are back – such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or a very rapid heartbeat – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Otherwise, we’ll speak once the results are available.
PATIENT: Very well. Difficulty breathing, chest pain, rapid heartbeat… I’ve made a note of that. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness and your clear explanations. I feel much better prepared now, and I’m grateful for your care. I believe that’s all. I’ll wait for the nurse, then.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m glad I could help. My nurse, Sarah, will be with you momentarily. She'll be happy to answer any further questions you may have. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if anything changes before we speak. .
