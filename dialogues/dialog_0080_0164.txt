DOCTOR: Hi Mande, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Rosanova. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: It’s very nice to meet you too, Doctor Rosanova. Well, it’s a bit… strange, to be honest. I’ve been feeling really tired and yellow – my skin, you know? And it seems to happen after I eat fava beans. I don’t know if that makes any sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, tired and yellow skin… and it seems to be connected to eating fava beans. That does give me a starting point, actually. It definitely makes sense to explore that connection. First, let’s talk about this tiredness. How long have you been feeling tired?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. It's been getting worse for maybe a month or so now, but I'd say I've just felt generally run down for… well, a few months, honestly. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. It's not like a sudden thing. Just… gradually more and more exhausted. Even getting out of bed feels like a huge effort some days.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradually worsening over a few months. That's helpful. And you said it's gotten noticeably worse in the last month. Is there anything specific that makes it better or worse, besides the fava beans?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, I don’t think so. Resting helps a little, of course, but it doesn’t fix it. And it doesn't seem to be tied to anything else I've noticed. I've been trying to drink more water, thinking maybe I was dehydrated, but that didn't seem to make a difference either. It just… is. Which is frustrating.
DOCTOR: I understand. Frustrating is a good word for it. Now, about this yellowing of your skin – where are you noticing it most?
PATIENT: It’s… well, my eyes are definitely yellow. And my skin, too, especially on my face. I noticed it when my daughter pointed it out, she said I looked… unwell. It’s not a bright yellow, more of a… jaundiced colour, I guess? I'm not very good at describing colours. But it's definitely noticeable. And it seems to fade a bit when I haven't eaten fava beans for a few days, but then it comes back when I do.
DOCTOR: Okay, eyes and face, more noticeable when you eat fava beans, and improves when you don't. That’s very specific, and points us in a certain direction. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the tiredness and yellowing?
PATIENT: Let me think… sometimes I feel a bit short of breath, especially when I'm walking up stairs. And my pee… it’s been darker than usual. Like, a dark tea colour. I thought it might be from not drinking enough water, but I've been trying to drink more, and it's still dark. Oh, and I’ve been feeling a bit… achy, generally, like a mild flu. But no fever or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath, dark urine, and mild aches. That’s good information, Mande. Let's get a bit more background. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I've been generally healthy my whole life, thankfully. I haven't really needed to see a doctor much. I had the usual childhood things, measles and chickenpox, but nothing serious. I've never been diagnosed with anything chronic. I do have… well, I get a little anxious sometimes, but nothing a cup of tea can’t fix! And my mother had high blood pressure, but that was when she was much older.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy, no chronic conditions, childhood illnesses, mother with high blood pressure. And you experience some anxiety. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgeries. I'm not a fan of hospitals, if I'm honest! I’ve broken a bone or two as a kid – a wrist and an arm – but they just put them in casts. Nothing major. I've always been pretty careful, I think. I don't really take any medications regularly, either. Just over-the-counter pain relievers for headaches sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries, no regular medications, just occasional pain relievers. And any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've eaten all sorts of things throughout my life and never had a reaction. I have a bit of a sensitive stomach sometimes, but that's not an allergy, just… indigestion. I can eat pretty much anything without any problems, except maybe too many fava beans, apparently!
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies. That's good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Besides your mother’s high blood pressure, are there any other medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My father had diabetes, but he got it when he was older, too. And my grandmother on my mother’s side… she had some kind of problems with her blood, I think? Something about needing transfusions sometimes. But I don’t know much about it, it was a long time ago and no one really talked about it much. My brother is healthy, as far as I know. He doesn’t really share much with me.
DOCTOR: Okay, father with diabetes, grandmother with blood issues requiring transfusions, brother healthy. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, I don’t smoke. Never have. I don’t like it, and my husband didn’t either. He passed away a few years ago, and he was a very strong advocate for healthy living. I try to follow his example. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, but not every night. Just a small glass, to relax.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, occasional glass of wine. Do you drink alcohol frequently?
PATIENT: Not really, no. Maybe two or three times a week, and it's always just one glass with dinner. It helps me unwind after a long day, but I don't rely on it. I don’t go out drinking or anything like that. And I don’t drink to excess, ever.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, what about your work or daily activities?
PATIENT: I work as a receptionist at a small doctor's office, actually. It’s mostly sitting at a desk, answering phones, and scheduling appointments. It's not very physically demanding, which is good. I like helping people, and it keeps me busy. Outside of work, I enjoy gardening. I have a small vegetable garden in my backyard. And I like to read. Mostly mysteries and thrillers. Just quiet things, really. Nothing too strenuous.
DOCTOR: Okay, receptionist, gardening, reading. Sounds relaxing. Alright, Mande, based on what you’ve told me – the tiredness, the yellowing of your skin, especially after eating fava beans, the dark urine, and the family history – I'm starting to suspect a condition called G6PD deficiency. It's a genetic condition where your body doesn't have enough of an enzyme called G6PD. Fava beans can trigger a reaction in people with this deficiency, causing those symptoms. However, we need to confirm this with some tests. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a reticulocyte count, and a G6PD enzyme level test. We'll also check your liver function. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh… that sounds… complicated. G6PD deficiency? I’ve never heard of that. So, the fava beans are actually doing something to me? I always just thought I was sensitive to them! And tests… yes, that’s fine. What kind of tests are they, exactly? Will they hurt? And how long will it take to get the results? I’m a bit nervous, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: It is a bit complicated, and you’re right to be asking questions. The fava beans contain a substance that can damage red blood cells in people with G6PD deficiency. It’s not an allergy, it’s a genetic issue, meaning you were born with it. The tests are just blood draws, like you’d get at your annual check-up. A nurse will clean the inside of your elbow and insert a needle to collect a small sample of blood. It’s a quick pinch, and it doesn’t usually hurt much. You might feel a little discomfort afterward, but it shouldn’t last long. The results usually take 2-3 business days to come back. I’ll call you as soon as I have them. We'll discuss what they mean and what the next steps are. We will also check your iron levels. In the meantime, it's best to avoid fava beans and anything that contains them, just to be safe. Do you have any other questions right now?
PATIENT: Okay, that doesn’t sound too bad. Just a pinch… and avoiding fava beans. I can definitely do that. So, if it is G6PD deficiency, what does that mean, exactly? Is it serious? Is there a cure? I’m sorry, I’m just asking a lot of questions, but it’s all new to me. And will I need… treatment if I have it?
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to ask questions, and I'm happy to answer them. It's good you're thinking ahead. G6PD deficiency itself isn't usually serious in most people. Many people with it don't even know they have it because they don't experience symptoms. However, it can cause problems if you're exposed to triggers like fava beans, certain medications, or infections, which can lead to hemolytic anemia – meaning your red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be made. There isn't a cure for G6PD deficiency, but it's usually manageable. The main thing is to avoid triggers. We'd create a list of medications to avoid, and make sure you’re aware of potential food sources. If you do have a reaction, treatment usually involves supportive care, like blood transfusions if necessary. We would monitor you closely. I'm going to have the nurse draw those blood samples now. Once we have the results, we'll have a better idea of what's going on and create a plan together. Do you have any other questions before we get started?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers most of it, thank you. Avoiding fava beans and certain medications… and getting the tests. I’m a little nervous, but I feel better knowing what to expect. Thank you, Doctor Rosanova, for explaining everything so clearly. I really appreciate it. Let’s get those tests done, then.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have the nurse come in shortly. She’ll explain the process and answer any last-minute questions. In the meantime, is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for today. Just the tests, and waiting for the results. Thank you again for everything, Doctor Rosanova. You've been very helpful and reassuring. I’ll just wait here, then.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. I'll let the nurse know you're ready. And please don't hesitate to let me know if you think of any other questions while you're waiting.
