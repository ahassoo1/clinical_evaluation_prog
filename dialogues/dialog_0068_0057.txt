DOCTOR: Good morning, Chellsea. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Well, it's... about the cancer. I was told to come speak with you. It's been a little hard to think straight, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Yes, yes. I… understand. It is a lot to process. Just take your time. Can you tell me a little more about what you were told?
PATIENT: Well, my husband... he passed a few months ago. And before that, he was sick. Really sick. The doctors said... it was cancer. And then, after... they told me I needed to come in, because of it. I don't... I don't really know what kind, or what it means for me. It's all been so fast.
DOCTOR: I see. I’m very sorry for your loss, Chellsea. That must be incredibly difficult. And it’s perfectly understandable that things are unclear right now. Just to be certain I have everything correct… the doctors who spoke with your husband… were they at this clinic, or another facility?
PATIENT: Another facility, Doctor. It was… the big hospital in Phoenix. About a three-hour drive. He was getting special treatment there. I mostly just drove him and… waited. I didn't really talk to the doctors myself, not much. My husband did all that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And did they mention what kind of cancer your husband had, even generally?
PATIENT: He… they said it was in his blood. Something about leukemia? I think that's right. He had a lot of tests, and then… a lot of appointments. He was very tired all the time. I'm sorry, I'm not very good at remembering the details. It was a scary time.
DOCTOR: That’s quite alright, Chellsea. You don’t need to apologize at all. It’s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed and not remember everything. Knowing it was leukemia is helpful. Do you know if any other family members – parents, siblings, grandparents – have had any kind of cancer, or blood disorders?
PATIENT: Let me see… My mother, she passed when I was young. From… something with her heart, I think. My father… he's still alive, but he lives far away, in Oklahoma. I haven’t seen him in years. And I don’t think anyone else… not that I know of. We didn't talk about things like that much, in my family.
DOCTOR: Alright. Thank you. And just to clarify – when you were told you needed to come in, what exactly did they say prompted the referral?
PATIENT: They just said… because of the leukemia, and that I should be checked. Something about it sometimes… running in families? And maybe… tests to see if I have it too. I don't know. It was a nurse who called, mostly. She didn't explain much. She just said it was important.
DOCTOR: Okay. That's… not terribly specific, unfortunately. Well, we’ll certainly get to the bottom of it. To start, I’d like to ask you about your own health. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing, really. I've always been pretty healthy. I mean, I get colds sometimes, like everyone. But never anything serious. I work as an occupational therapist, so I'm on my feet a lot. I try to stay active. That’s why all this is so… surprising.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. Staying active is very important. And have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, sir. Never. Nothing like that. I broke my wrist when I was a little girl, climbing a tree. But it healed up fine. That's about it, I think. Really. I've been lucky, health-wise. Until now, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, vitamins, supplements – anything at all?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I try to eat healthy, mostly. And get enough sleep when I can. I don’t like taking pills, if I can avoid it. That’s why I haven’t even taken an aspirin for a headache in years. I just… try to rest.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, before we move on, are you allergic to anything?
PATIENT: No, sir. Not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything. I've eaten all sorts of things, been around all sorts of animals… nothing bothers me. I think I'm pretty lucky, really. Though, maybe not so much anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, that’s good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: What do you mean, Doctor? Like... what I do for fun? I don't have much time for fun these days, to be honest. I work a lot. I like to hike when I can, and I try to see my friends when I have the chance. But mostly, I just... work. Is that what you want to know?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s helpful. But I was also wondering about things like smoking, alcohol use, or any other habits that might be relevant. And… do you have any family?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, I used to… I used to smoke a little, when I was in college. But I quit a long time ago. And I don’t drink. Never really liked it. As for family… My husband… he was my family. And… I have a father, but we don't talk much anymore. That's about it, really. I was married for ten years, and he was everything to me.
DOCTOR: I see. I’m very sorry for your loss, Chellsea. It sounds like you’ve been through a great deal. Alright. Well, to move forward, I'd like to do a brief physical exam, if that's alright with you. It will just be a basic check-up to get a better understanding of your overall health. We’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your lymph nodes. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… fine. Whatever you need to do. I just… I want to know what’s going on. And if there’s anything I can do. I just want to be prepared. So, yes. Let’s do the exam.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you'll just have a seat on the examination table, we can get started. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs first. Please take a deep breath in… and exhale.
PATIENT: Okay. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I’m going to palpate your lymph nodes, just to check for any swelling. I'll start with your neck. Do you feel any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I know of. That's a little… sensitive, maybe? But I don't know if that's normal. I haven't really felt them before. It's just… a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Alright. That's good to know. It's possible it's just a little muscle tension, but we'll keep an eye on it. Now I’m going to check your abdomen. Just lie back comfortably. This might be a little uncomfortable, just let me know if you feel any pain.
PATIENT: Okay. That’s… a little tender there, on the right side. Not a lot of pain, but… I can feel it. It’s just… a dull ache, really. Like a bruise, maybe? I don’t know. I haven't bumped it or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And now I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is 128/80, pulse is 72 and regular. Now, to get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some routine blood work, including a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. This will help us assess your overall health and rule out any underlying issues. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. Blood work sounds… fine. If it will help, then yes. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright. We will also include a CBC with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel. These tests will give us a good baseline. The nurse will draw the blood shortly. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I’m going to write up a referral for you to see a hematologist. They are specialists in blood disorders, and they will be able to provide a more thorough evaluation and determine if any further testing is needed. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… good. A specialist. That’s… reassuring. If you think it’s necessary, then yes. I trust your judgment. Thank you. For everything. I appreciate it. It's just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: I understand, Chellsea. It is a lot. We'll take it one step at a time. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and explain the next steps. I'll review the results as soon as they are available and will contact you to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, or unexplained bleeding, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think… I think that’s all, for now. I just need to… process everything. Thank you again. For being so kind. I guess I'll just… wait for the nurse. I hope… I hope everything will be alright.
DOCTOR: We'll do everything we can to find out, Chellsea. And I understand. Take your time. The nurse will be in shortly. .
