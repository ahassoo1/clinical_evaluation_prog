DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Bilstein. I'm Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my legs, dear. They bother me something awful at night. Cramping, mostly. It wakes me up, you see. Happens most nights now, I believe. It’s been… a while since it started, truthfully. I don’t keep good track of time anymore.
DOCTOR: “A while,” is not terribly helpful, Ms. Bilstein. But we'll try to get to the bottom of it. Can you describe the cramping?
PATIENT: Oh, you are right, dear. My apologies. It’s just… things blur. Let me see… It’s a tightening, a squeezing, mostly in the calf, I think. Both legs, usually. It’s a sharp pain, and then it eases off… eventually. Not a pleasant feeling at all. I used to just stretch them out, and it would help, but it doesn’t seem to work as well anymore. Do you… understand what I mean?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Bilstein, I understand. Sharp cramping in both calves, primarily at night, and stretching isn’t providing the same relief. Has anything changed recently?
PATIENT: Changed…? Goodness. Let me think. Well, my grandson, Thomas, he moved away for school. That was… last autumn, I suppose. And… oh, dear. I did start taking a new vitamin, I think. A friend recommended it for… for keeping your bones strong. But I can’t recall the name of it. It came in a blue bottle, I believe. Is that helpful? I take so many things these days, it’s hard to remember.
DOCTOR: A new vitamin in a blue bottle… that’s… something. And Thomas moving away – that’s a significant change. Do you find the cramping is worse when you’re more stressed, perhaps?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I hadn’t thought of that. Thomas… he was always a good boy. Very thoughtful. And missing him does bother me, yes. I worry about him, being so far away. Maybe… maybe the legs are worse when I think about him too much. I just… I wish he wasn’t so far. Could that really cause it, Doctor? My legs cramping, I mean. It seems… silly.
DOCTOR: While emotional distress can manifest physically, Ms. Bilstein, it’s unlikely to be the sole cause of nocturnal leg cramps. We need to rule out other possibilities. Do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that's a lot of big words, Doctor. Medical… what? Well, let me see. I had my gallbladder out, a long time ago. And the doctor said I had a touch of arthritis in my hands, but it doesn't bother me much. I also get a little dizzy sometimes, when I stand up too quickly, but I mostly just take my time getting up. Is that what you mean by "conditions"? I don't recall anything else, honestly. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, arthritis, and occasional dizziness… noted. And you said "occasional dizziness." How often is "occasional," Ms. Bilstein?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Not very often, I assure you. Maybe… once a month? Sometimes not even that. It’s just when I rush, you see. Or if I stand up too fast from a chair. It doesn’t last long, just a little wooziness, and then it passes. It’s never bothered me enough to call the doctor before. Honestly, I don’t like bothering people. It all just seems… unimportant, compared to other things.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Bilstein, to get a better understanding of what's going on, I'm going to need to do a quick physical exam. Could you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Oh, certainly, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. My legs aren’t very strong these days, though. Would you… would you mind helping me up onto it? It’s a bit high, you see. I don’t want to fall.
DOCTOR: Of course. Let me assist you. Alright, Ms. Bilstein, if you could just relax. I’m going to check your pulses in both legs and feet. Then I’ll take a look at your calves.
PATIENT: Oh, very kind of you, Doctor. It’s a bit cold, isn’t it? But I’m trying to relax. My legs are always a little bit… twitchy, you know. I hope that doesn’t bother you. Do you need me to do anything special? Just tell me. I want to be helpful.
DOCTOR: Pulses are present, though somewhat diminished in the feet bilaterally. Calves are firm to the touch, with no obvious swelling or redness. No acute findings on examination. Reflexes are diminished but symmetrical. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs now.
PATIENT: Oh, that’s good to hear, isn’t it? No… acute findings. That sounds promising. My heart… well, it skips a beat sometimes, but the doctor never said anything about it being serious. Just old age, I suppose. I’m trying to breathe nice and deep for you, Doctor. Is that right? I always try to do as I’m told.
DOCTOR: Heart rate is regular, but there is a faint murmur. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. You mentioned a murmur… has a cardiologist ever evaluated this?
PATIENT: Oh my… a murmur? Goodness. I don't think so. Not that I recall, anyway. It's been a long time since I've seen a doctor about my heart. They just said I was getting old, and things wear out. I don't recall anyone ever specifically saying "murmur," no. Is that… is that bad, Doctor? You're starting to worry me now. I don’t understand all these big words.
DOCTOR: A murmur requires further investigation, Ms. Bilstein. It doesn't necessarily indicate a serious problem, but we need to rule out any underlying cardiac issues. I’m going to order some bloodwork to check your electrolytes and kidney function, and I’d like you to schedule an electrocardiogram, or EKG, to assess your heart rhythm. Additionally, I'm going to refer you to a cardiologist for a formal evaluation. We need to get a clearer picture of what’s going on.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds like… a lot. Bloodwork, and… electrocardiogram? And a heart doctor? I don't know, Doctor. That seems… rather extreme, doesn't it? Just for some leg cramps? I don’t want to be a bother, and all these tests… they cost money, you know. I don’t have a lot of money. I just wanted something for my legs, to help me sleep. Is there… is there anything else we can try first? Perhaps a different vitamin? Or some stretches?
DOCTOR: Ms. Bilstein, while your leg cramps are the presenting symptom, the murmur and diminished reflexes are concerning. Ignoring them would be irresponsible. I understand your financial concerns, and we can discuss resources to help with the cost of these tests. However, I cannot in good conscience simply ignore these findings. As for stretches and vitamins, they may provide some temporary relief, but they will not address the underlying potential cause. I’m ordering the tests. I will have the lab draw the blood now, and the scheduler will set up the EKG and cardiology appointment for you. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we proceed?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Well, when you put it like that… I suppose you’re right. I just… it’s a lot to take in. Allergies… let me see. I used to be allergic to bee stings, when I was a little girl, but that was a very long time ago. I haven’t been stung in years. And… sometimes my skin gets a little itchy when I use certain soaps, but it’s not a serious allergy. Mostly just a nuisance. I don’t think… I don’t think I have any serious allergies. Just a bit… sensitive, sometimes. Is that okay? I just want to do what’s best. I trust your judgement, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No known serious allergies, noted. Very well. I’ll have the nurse draw your blood now, and the scheduler will contact you to arrange the EKG and cardiology appointment. In the meantime, I'm prescribing a low-dose calcium supplement, which may help with muscle cramps, although it’s unlikely to be a complete solution. I’ll also provide a list of local resources for financial assistance with medical expenses. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh, calcium… that sounds sensible. My daughter always told me to drink more milk. And a list of resources… that would be very kind, thank you. No… I don’t think I have any more questions right now. I’m just a little… overwhelmed, I suppose. You’ve given me a lot to think about. Thank you, Doctor, for your time and patience. I appreciate it very much. I suppose I should go find the nurse now?
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will be with you shortly. She’ll explain the bloodwork process. Please let me know if you have any further questions after you’ve spoken with the nurse. .
PATIENT: Oh… alright then. Thank you again, Doctor.
