DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Queener. I'm Dr. Chora. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. It’s… the swelling. After the cancer treatment, you see. It’s mostly in my legs and… feet, I think. It’s not painful, exactly, just… puffy. It's been getting a little worse, that’s why I came.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Swelling in the legs and feet after cancer treatment. That’s certainly something we want to take a look at. Just to clarify, what kind of cancer treatment did you receive, and when did it end?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It was… radiation, I believe. And some pills. It finished, oh… maybe six months ago? It was last winter, definitely. Before it got warm. I’m not very good with dates, sorry. It feels like a long time ago now. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Okay, six months ago, radiation and pills… that gives us a starting point. And you said it’s been getting worse recently – can you tell me how much worse?
PATIENT: Oh… well, I used to be able to fit my shoes okay. Now… sometimes I have to really force them on. And I notice it more at the end of the day. Like, after I've been on my feet a little. Not all day, mind you, I don’t do that much. But… if I’m doing things around the house, you know? It’s not terrible, but it’s… noticeable. I also think my ankles feel a bit… stiff sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, shoes feeling tighter, more noticeable at the end of the day with activity, and some stiffness in the ankles. Thank you. Now, let’s talk a little more broadly. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, my appetite… it’s been okay. Not as big as it used to be, but I eat. And I think… maybe I’ve lost a little weight? Not much, but my clothes feel a little looser. It’s hard to say for sure, I don’t weigh myself every day. Honestly, I don’t even own a scale. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Okay, appetite is okay, but potentially some slight weight loss. That is important. And have you noticed any shortness of breath, or any chest pain at all?
PATIENT: No, no chest pain. And I haven’t been… breathless, no. I get a little winded if I climb the stairs, but I always have! I'm not a young woman anymore, you know? But nothing new. It's just… normal old lady stuff. I hope that makes sense. Do you need me to tell you about anything else? I’m not sure what you’re looking for.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No new shortness of breath or chest pain. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Aside from the cancer treatment, do you have any other medical conditions – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. The doctor told me I had high blood pressure, years ago. I was taking pills for that, but I stopped a long time ago. He said it was okay, that it had come down. And… no, I don't think so. No diabetes, no heart problems. Just… the high blood pressure, a long time ago. Is that important? I'm trying to remember everything. It's been a lot of doctor visits lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, history of high blood pressure, but currently off medication. And you mentioned pills with the cancer treatment - can you recall what those pills were called?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's a hard one. There were so many! Little white ones, I think. And some yellow ones. I really don’t remember the names, I just… took them when I was supposed to. The hospital sent them to me. Maybe they have a record? I’m so sorry, I really wish I could be more helpful. I’m just not good with remembering names.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Queener. We can certainly look at your records. Before we do that, let’s quickly go over allergies and medications. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. I eat everything. And like I said, I’m not taking any pills right now. Except for… sometimes I take something for my arthritis, if it’s really bothering me. It’s just over-the-counter stuff, though. Ibuprofen, I think? Nothing fancy. I hope I’m not forgetting anything. It’s all a bit of a blur.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, currently off regular medications except for occasional ibuprofen for arthritis. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and then take a look at your legs and feet. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. Just… be gentle, okay? My legs are a bit… sensitive. And try not to take too long, if you don't mind. I have to… well, never mind. Just do what you need to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Queener. I’ll be as gentle as possible. Please have a seat here, and we'll get started. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Alright, let’s take a look at your legs and feet. I see some moderate swelling in both legs, more pronounced around the ankles. The skin feels warm to the touch. I'm also noting some slight discoloration, a bit of redness around your lower legs. Do you feel any pain when I touch here?
PATIENT: Yes… a little. Not painful painful, but… tender. Especially on the inside of my ankles. It’s been like that for a few days, I think. Not new, but maybe a little worse today. It’s not constantly sore, just when you press on it. And sometimes… a bit itchy. Is that a bad sign? I'm worrying now.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness to palpation on the medial aspects of both ankles, and some reported itching. Now, I'm going to check your pulses in your feet. Your pulses are present, but a little weaker than I would expect. That, combined with the swelling and tenderness, makes me think we need to investigate this further. I’m going to order some blood work to check your kidney function, liver function, and rule out any infection. I'd also like to get a D-dimer to check for any blood clots. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Blood work? And a… what was it? A dee-dimer? That sounds… serious. Is it something bad? I was hoping it was just… old lady swelling. Are you sure I need all that? I don’t like needles, you know. And I get so nervous. Is there… another way?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Queener. It's good you're asking questions. The blood work and D-dimer are just to get a better understanding of what's causing the swelling, and to rule out anything serious. The D-dimer, specifically, helps us determine if there's a chance of a blood clot in your leg. It doesn't necessarily mean you have a clot, but it’s a precaution. While we can't definitively diagnose the cause of the swelling without these tests, given your history of cancer treatment, it’s important to be thorough. I want to rule out anything potentially dangerous. The blood draw will only take a few minutes, and the results will help guide our treatment plan. Would you prefer I have a nurse come in and explain the procedure to you, and perhaps offer some support during the blood draw?
PATIENT: Oh… well, if you think it’s necessary. I don’t like the sound of it, but I don’t want anything dangerous, either. A nurse? Yes, please. That would be… very kind. Maybe she can hold my hand? I get so faint sometimes. And… how long will it take to get the results? I have a… a lunch date on Friday, and I don’t want to cancel it. Is that silly?
DOCTOR: Not silly at all, Ms. Queener. It’s perfectly reasonable to be concerned about your commitments. I'll have the nurse come in and explain everything, and she’s very good at making patients comfortable. The lab results usually take about 24 to 48 hours. I should have them by Thursday, which gives us plenty of time to discuss them before your lunch date. If anything urgent comes up, we’ll call you immediately. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your legs whenever possible, and avoiding prolonged standing. We’ll discuss further steps once we have the lab results. Let me just call for the nurse now.
PATIENT: Okay… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you being so… patient with me. I’m just a worrier, I suppose. Elevate my legs… yes, I can do that. And I'll try not to stand too much. Just please… please let it not be anything serious. I have a lunch date.
DOCTOR: We’ll do everything we can to figure out what’s going on, Ms. Queener. Try to relax, and let’s focus on getting you comfortable. I’ll be right back with the nurse.
