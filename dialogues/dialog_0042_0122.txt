DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Alvara. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. VODZAK. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you, Doctor. It is… a pleasure, I suppose. My name is Venus Alvara. I am here because… well, recently, things have been… slipping, you could say. My memory. It is concerning, and my blood pressure has been… not good. I want to find out what is happening, quickly if possible.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Alvara. Memory issues and blood pressure concerns are definitely things we want to address promptly. “Slipping,” you say – can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… difficult to explain. Small things, mostly. I will go to put the kettle on, and forget why I went to the kitchen. Or I will speak with a neighbor, and then… the name escapes me immediately. It is not… everything, thankfully. I remember details, very clearly, from many years ago. Dates, places… but recent events… they are… fragile. It is unsettling. And my doctor… he said it could be related to my blood pressure.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know, Ms. Alvara. It’s good you’ve noticed a distinction between remembering distant events and more recent ones. And your previous doctor's thought about the blood pressure is a good starting point. To get a clearer picture, let's talk a bit more about both of these concerns. First, regarding your memory – has this been a sudden change, or has it been gradual?
PATIENT: Gradual, I think. It began… perhaps six months ago? Small lapses, easily dismissed. But it has… worsened slowly, steadily. Now… now it is difficult to ignore. I find myself writing things down constantly, just to be sure. It is… embarrassing, to be honest. I always prided myself on my excellent memory. I managed many properties, many people… I needed to remember everything. Now… it feels as if I am losing control.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Alvara. It’s completely understandable to feel frustrated and embarrassed when experiencing memory changes, especially when you’ve always relied on a strong memory. It’s good that you're being proactive about it. Now, let’s talk about your blood pressure. Do you know what your readings have been recently?
PATIENT: Yes. My doctor… he told me. It is… usually quite high. Last time, it was… 160 over 95, I believe. He said it was dangerous. He wanted me to… take pills, but I… I do not like pills. I tried them once, and they made me feel so unwell. So, I stopped. I thought… perhaps I could manage it with diet and exercise, but it has not improved much. And now, with this memory… I worry it is connected.
DOCTOR: 160 over 95 is elevated, yes. And you're right to be concerned about it. It's good you're aware of the numbers. Stopping medication without speaking to a doctor isn't ideal, but I understand your reluctance if you had unpleasant side effects. We can certainly explore other options. You suspect a connection between the blood pressure and the memory issues, which is reasonable. High blood pressure can affect cognitive function. Now, to get a better overall picture, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I… I had pneumonia, perhaps ten years ago? It was quite bad, but I recovered fully. And I broke my wrist, a few years before that, but that is all. Nothing serious. I do not take any regular medication, except… sometimes, a pain reliever for my arthritis. It is not frequent. I also had… a surgery, many years ago, on my gallbladder. But that was before I moved here. I am otherwise… quite healthy, usually. I walk every day, and I eat a good diet. Although… lately, I have not been sleeping very well. Perhaps that is contributing?
DOCTOR: Okay, so pneumonia about ten years ago, a broken wrist before that, gallbladder surgery some time ago, arthritis treated with occasional pain relief, and some trouble with sleep lately. That's helpful. And do you have any family history of things like high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or memory problems like Alzheimer’s or dementia?
PATIENT: Yes. My mother… she had very high blood pressure, towards the end of her life. She had a stroke, I think. It was many years ago. And my aunt… she had something with her memory. She was… confused, and forgetful. She ended up in a home. I do not remember the exact name of what she had. The doctors said it was… something that runs in the family. It was… frightening. That is why I am so worried now. I do not want to… end up like her.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Alvara. Knowing that family history is very important information. It does raise the possibility that there could be a genetic component to your concerns. It’s good you are being proactive in addressing this. Now, just a few more questions. Could you tell me about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? I… I live alone now. My husband… he passed away five years ago. I keep busy. I manage several properties, as I said. It keeps my mind active, and I enjoy it. I walk every day, usually for about an hour. I cook my own meals, healthy meals. I do not smoke, and I drink very little alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes. I do not have many visitors. My children… they live far away. It is… quiet. And lately… I have been feeling very… anxious. I worry constantly about… everything. Perhaps that is making things worse?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Alvara. That gives me a much clearer picture. It sounds like you've been very independent and active, which is wonderful. The loss of your husband and the anxiety you're experiencing are both important factors to consider. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a brief neurological assessment, just to get a baseline. It will help me narrow down the possible causes of your symptoms. Is that acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That is… perfectly acceptable. I want to know what is happening. Quickly, if possible. The waiting… it is the worst part. I am ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Alvara. Let's begin then. Please have a seat on the examination table. I’ll start by checking your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is currently 158 over 92. Still elevated, but not significantly higher than what you've reported. Your heart sounds are regular, but a little rapid. Lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and do a quick memory test. Can you repeat these three words for me?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Tell me the words. Quickly, please. I have… an appointment later.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The words are: apple, table, and penny. Please remember those. Now, I’m going to ask you a few simple questions. What is today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… …August 2nd. 2025. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I… I am sure of that.
DOCTOR: Good. And what city are we in?
PATIENT: This is… …I believe it is… Urban. Yes, Urban. I know I came to the clinic here.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are a little brisk, and your coordination seems normal. Now, can you tell me the three words I asked you to remember earlier?
PATIENT: …Three words… I… I am trying. Apple… something with a table… and… and… Oh, dear. I cannot… I simply cannot remember them. It is gone. Completely gone. I knew them just moments ago. This is… frightening.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Alvara. Please don’t be frightened. It’s not uncommon to have difficulty with immediate recall, especially when under stress. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. Based on what you’ve told me, your family history, and the results of this brief exam, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. Your blood pressure is definitely a concern, and it could be contributing to your cognitive symptoms. We also need to consider the possibility of early cognitive decline, although it’s too early to make any definitive conclusions. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests to check your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also recommend an MRI of the brain to look for any structural abnormalities. Finally, I would like to refer you to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes. That… that is acceptable. Anything. Just… please, find out what is happening. Quickly, if possible. I do not want to… forget everything. The MRI… will it be painful? And the neurologist… is he… good? I have had bad experiences with doctors before.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Alvara. We will certainly work as quickly as possible. The MRI is not painful. You will lie inside a large machine, and it will make some loud noises. It’s important to remain still during the scan, but it’s not uncomfortable. It’s like a very detailed X-ray. And yes, the neurologist I recommend, Dr. Emil Petrov, is excellent. He has a very good reputation and is very thorough. I wouldn't recommend him if I didn't have confidence in his abilities. I will provide you with his contact information and arrange for the referral. Now, let’s discuss the blood tests. I’ll order a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a thyroid test, and a vitamin B12 level. I also want to check your cholesterol and lipids. This will give us a good baseline of your overall health. I’ll also give you a printed list of instructions on how to prepare for the blood tests. Do you have any allergies to any medications or contrast dyes?
PATIENT: No. No allergies. I… I can take the tests. I just want to… know what is happening. Quickly, please. I have an appointment later. And… thank you. For being… patient. I know I am not easy.
DOCTOR: You are not difficult at all, Ms. Alvara. I understand your anxiety, and I am happy to help in any way I can. We will get these tests ordered right away, and I will schedule a follow-up appointment for you to discuss the results as soon as they are available. Here is the lab requisition form and the referral information for Dr. Petrov. The lab is located at 123 Main Street. You can call to schedule an appointment at 555-1234. I also have a nurse who will call you tomorrow to confirm the appointments and answer any questions you may have. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms, such as weakness, difficulty speaking, or severe headache, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No. No questions. I… I think I have everything. Thank you… again. For everything. I will… I will call the lab and schedule the tests. And I will call Dr. Petrov’s office. I just… want to know. That is all. Perhaps… perhaps you could call me tomorrow, just to remind me? I am… forgetful, you see. .
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Alvara. My nurse will definitely give you a call tomorrow to check in and confirm your appointments. Please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you all the best. We will get to the bottom of this together. Have a good day, Ms. Alvara.
