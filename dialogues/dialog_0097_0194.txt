DOCTOR: Hi Terasa, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my hearing, mostly. Comes and goes, it does. And makes me feel quite dizzy sometimes. My daughter, Lani, she booked the appointment, actually. She worries. I… I can’t quite remember everything about it, to be honest. It’s been happening for a little while now.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright, Terasa. We'll take it slow. Hearing changes and dizziness can definitely be concerning, and it’s good Lani is looking out for you. "Comes and goes" is helpful information. About how long has this been happening – roughly?
PATIENT: Oh dear… roughly… hmm. It feels like… a few months, maybe? Longer? It’s hard to say. It started… after my husband passed, I think. Or maybe before? I get so muddled sometimes. It’s not constant, you see. Just… episodes. Brief ones. And then it’s fine for a while. It's just unsettling when it does happen.
DOCTOR: I understand, Terasa. Grief can certainly affect things, and it's completely normal to feel muddled when you're processing a loss. A few months is a good starting point. And it’s helpful to know it’s not constant, just episodes. Can you describe what the hearing changes feel like during one of those episodes?
PATIENT: Oh… well, it’s like… everything gets muffled. Like someone turned the volume way down, or put cotton in my ears. And then… sometimes it’s just in one ear, sometimes both. It doesn’t hurt, exactly. Just… quiet. And then the room starts to spin. Not always, but often. It doesn’t last long, thankfully. Usually just a few minutes. Enough to make me grab onto something!
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled hearing in one or both ears, sometimes with dizziness – that’s very useful information. And it lasts just a few minutes each time. Do you notice anything before an episode starts?
PATIENT: Before? Hmm… No, not really. It just… comes on. Sometimes I’m standing up, sometimes I’m sitting. I don’t think there’s anything I do that causes it. Lani thinks it’s the stress, maybe? But I don’t feel particularly stressed, you see. Just… old, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you don't feel overly stressed, though stress can certainly contribute to these things. And feeling "old" is perfectly normal, Terasa. Let's talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I have Medicare, of course. And… the doctor always checks my blood pressure, it’s a little high sometimes, but nothing drastic. I had a hip replacement a few years back, but that’s healed nicely. And… I don’t really get sick much, thankfully. I try to eat well. My daughter worries about that too! I’m probably forgetting something… but I can’t quite put my finger on it.
DOCTOR: That's all helpful, Terasa. High blood pressure is good to know, and a hip replacement is important to note. It sounds like you generally stay quite healthy, which is wonderful. Don’t worry about forgetting things, we can always come back to it. Now, are you currently taking any medications, and do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… Just a little pill for my blood pressure, losartan, I think it’s called. And… no allergies, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Lani always asks me that, too, but I always say no. I used to take something for my arthritis, but the doctor said it wasn't helping and to stop taking it, ages ago now.
DOCTOR: Okay, losartan for blood pressure and no known allergies, that's good. And you stopped the arthritis medication a while back. Now, just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh dear… family history. That’s a tricky one. My mother, she had… something with her ears. Not like me, though. More like… ringing? And my father, he had a bad heart. He passed away when I was young. And… Lani’s father, my husband, he was perfectly healthy, as far as I know. He did have a bit of trouble with his balance in his old age, though. Maybe that’s something? I’m not very good at remembering these things, you see.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Terasa. Ringing in your mother's ears and your husband's balance issues are good to know. And your father's heart condition is important as well. Okay, let’s do a quick physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’d like to take a look in your ears and check your balance. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. My ears have always been a bit sensitive. Please be gentle.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. Okay, Terasa, your heart and lungs sound good, a little fast, but that could be from being a bit anxious. Your ears have some wax buildup, which can sometimes cause muffled hearing, but no sign of anything serious. And I did notice a little bit of unsteadiness with your balance, which could be contributing to the dizziness. I'd also like to do a quick Romberg test, if you're comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A Romberg… what does that involve? Is it painful? I don’t like anything that makes me feel… off balance.
DOCTOR: No, it's not painful at all, Terasa. It's very simple. I just ask you to stand with your feet together and close your eyes for about 30 seconds. I’ll be right here to steady you if you need it. It helps me assess your balance. We can skip it if you’re really uncomfortable, but it gives me some useful information.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you say it’s not painful… and you’ll be there to catch me… yes, alright. But just for 30 seconds, right?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, just 30 seconds. I’ll be right here. Okay, Terasa, you can open your eyes now. That was good. You showed a little bit of unsteadiness, which is consistent with what I observed earlier. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it sounds like you may be experiencing something called vestibular neuritis, which is inflammation of the inner ear. The wax buildup could be contributing to the hearing changes, and the dizziness and unsteadiness likely stem from the inner ear issue. However, we need to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a hearing test and possibly an MRI to get a clearer picture. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Vestibular… neuritis? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. And an MRI? Is that… safe? I've heard things… Is there anything else we can do? Perhaps just… clean the wax out? Would that help? I don’t really like the sound of tests and machines… and MRIs sound… frightening.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Terasa. Vestibular neuritis can sound complicated, but it's often manageable. It's essentially an inflammation that affects your balance and hearing. And you’re right to ask about the MRI. It's very safe, and we take all precautions to ensure your comfort. You lie very still inside a large machine that uses magnetic fields to create images of your inner ear. It doesn’t involve any radiation. Cleaning the wax out is a good first step, and we can certainly do that today. It might improve your hearing, but it won’t address the possible inner ear inflammation causing the dizziness. The MRI helps us rule out other, more serious causes for your symptoms, like a tumor or a stroke, which are thankfully rare. If the MRI shows nothing concerning, we can likely treat the vestibular neuritis with medication and balance therapy . It's all about getting you back on your feet and feeling stable again. Would you like me to schedule the hearing test for you, and we can discuss the MRI further?
PATIENT: Oh… medication and therapy… that sounds… better than nothing, I suppose. And if the MRI shows nothing… alright. Yes, schedule the hearing test. And… perhaps let me think about the MRI overnight? I need to talk to Lani about it. She’s very good with these things. Just the hearing test for now, please. And can you… clean out the wax today? I’d like to get that done, at least. It's just… a lot to take in.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Terasa. That’s perfectly reasonable. We'll start with the hearing test and wax removal, and you can take the time to discuss the MRI with Lani. No pressure at all. I'll get the nurse to schedule the hearing test for you, and I’ll go ahead and remove the wax from your ears now. It might feel a little strange, but it shouldn't be painful. Okay, Terasa, I've removed the wax from both ears. Hopefully, you'll notice a slight improvement in your hearing already. The nurse will be in shortly to schedule the hearing test and answer any questions you might have. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: Oh… that feels… better, actually. A little clearer, yes. Thank you, Doctor. No, I don’t think so. Just… please tell the nurse to be patient with me. I’m not very good with appointments and schedules. And… thank you again. I think I’m ready to go now. It's been a long morning. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Terasa. I’ll make sure the nurse knows to be patient with you. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your hearing test. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
