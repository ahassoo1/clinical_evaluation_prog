DOCTOR: Hi Janeth, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Ranjan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, nice to meet you too. It’s…well, it’s a bit silly, really. I just wanted to ask if you could write me one of those…you know, get well cards? Or maybe just a nice encouragement one. My daughter-in-law thinks it’ll help with my… spirits. Honestly, I think she worries too much. But she’s the one paying for everything these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s not silly at all to want a little encouragement, and it's very kind of your daughter-in-law to think of that. While I don’t usually write get-well cards as part of my practice, I'm happy to document a note about your overall wellbeing and address any concerns you have that might be affecting your spirits. That way, we can make sure everything is addressed medically, and perhaps that will reassure your daughter-in-law too. Before we do that, though, could you tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Oh, medically… well, that’s what she said. Always with the “medically.” I feel…old, mostly. And a bit tired. Not like sick tired, just…worn out. Everything feels like a lot of effort. My knees ache when it rains, which is often, you know? And I don't sleep as well as I used to. But who does sleep well when they get to my age? It’s just…life, I suppose. I don’t want you fussing over me for nothing. I just want a card! Is that so hard?
DOCTOR: No, a card isn’t hard at all! And I definitely don’t want to fuss over you unnecessarily. But you’re right, feeling “old” and tired, achy knees, and trouble sleeping… those can sometimes be signs of things we should look into, even if it’s just to rule things out. It sounds like you're experiencing some common issues with aging, but it’s good to be thorough. So, let’s talk a little more about this tiredness. Is it a new thing, or has it been building up gradually?
PATIENT: Gradually, definitely gradually. It didn’t just happen overnight. It's been…oh, I don’t know…maybe a year? A year and a half? Since my grandson was born, I think. He’s a lovely boy, very energetic. Keeping up with him is…draining, to be honest. And my son, he wants me to babysit all the time, which is nice, I suppose, but… it’s a lot. I used to have so much more energy for things. Gardening, mostly. I can't really do much of that anymore. My back isn’t what it used to be either. Although, that’s probably just age. I keep telling my daughter-in-law this. She worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gradual increase in tiredness over the last year or so, coinciding with more time spent with your grandson. And some back discomfort as well, making gardening difficult. It sounds like you've been very busy, and it's understandable to feel worn down. Now, when you say "tired," is it more of a physical fatigue, like your muscles ache and you feel weak?
PATIENT: Oh, no, not weak. I still do everything I need to do. I just…get tired of doing things. It's hard to explain. It's like… the effort it takes to get started is much bigger now. And then I just don't feel like doing things, even things I used to enjoy. It’s mostly mental, I think. Like a… a heaviness. Does that make sense? My daughter-in-law keeps asking if I'm depressed, but honestly, I'm just…old. Everything’s harder when you get old. I really just want a nice card. Is that so much to ask?
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Janeth. It sounds like you're describing a loss of motivation and enjoyment, and feeling overwhelmed by the effort required for everyday tasks. And it’s completely valid to feel that way. It's important to remember that these feelings can have many causes, and dismissing them as “just getting old” isn’t always the best approach. Sometimes, there are things we can address to help improve your energy levels and overall wellbeing. Before we talk about a card, could you tell me a little about your sleep?
PATIENT: Oh, sleep. Well, I go to bed at the usual time, around ten, eleven. But I don't always fall asleep right away. I toss and turn a bit. And then I wake up a few times during the night. Not every night, but often. Usually just to go to the bathroom. Sometimes I'll wake up and just…lie there. Thinking. Worrying about my son and his wife. And the grandson, of course. Always worrying. I used to sleep like a log, you know? Straight through until morning. But now… it's just… fragmented. It’s not bad sleep, exactly. Just…not restful. I get up and make tea sometimes, just to calm down. And then I try to go back to sleep. Honestly, I'm probably keeping you up with all this talk! I should just ask for the card and be done with it.
DOCTOR: You’re not keeping me up at all, Janeth. It's helpful for me to understand what’s going on, and you’re providing me with a lot of good information. It sounds like you're experiencing some difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep, and waking up feeling less refreshed than you'd like. Waking up to use the bathroom is common as we age, but waking up feeling worried and having trouble falling back asleep can definitely contribute to that feeling of tiredness. Now, let's quickly go over your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. I had a bit of trouble with my blood pressure a few years back, but the doctor said it was fine after I started taking those little pills. And my knees, of course. They've always bothered me, especially in the cold weather. The doctor said it was arthritis, but there isn't much they can do about that, really. Just painkillers if it gets really bad. And I had a cataract in my left eye a few years ago, but they fixed it with surgery. Other than that… nothing much. I've always been quite healthy, really. I eat my vegetables and I don’t smoke. My daughter-in-law worries about everything, though. She’s always telling me to go to more doctors. Honestly, I think she just likes the attention. Can we please just talk about the card? I'm starting to feel silly repeating myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you’ve had some history of high blood pressure, which is currently managed with medication, and arthritis in your knees. You also had a cataract surgery in your left eye a few years ago. That's helpful to know. Before we get to the card, just one more quick question. Are you currently taking any medications, aside from the blood pressure pills?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. The blood pressure pills, of course. One every morning. And sometimes I take those painkillers for my knees, but only when they’re really bothering me. Like I said, not every day. And… oh! Sometimes I take those little herbal tablets for my digestion. My daughter-in-law bought them for me. She said they’re good for my gut health. They don’t seem to do much, really, but she insists I take them. Honestly, I think she just likes me to take something. Can we please talk about the card now? I'm starting to feel quite tired just thinking about all these pills! It’s ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Janeth. We can definitely talk about the card. And I understand your frustration with going over all of this. It sounds like you're taking a blood pressure medication daily, painkillers as needed for your knees, and herbal tablets for digestion. And it seems like your daughter-in-law is very attentive to your health, which is sweet, but can also be a bit overwhelming. Before I write you a note, though, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better overall picture. It’s just a routine check—listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your knees. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you must. Honestly, I don’t see what good it will do. I’ve been feeling old for years, and a stethoscope isn’t going to change that. But… fine. Get it over with. But please be quick. I have things to do, you know? Mostly just…sitting. But still. Things. And then, then can we please talk about the card? A nice, encouraging card. That’s all I want. Is that so much to ask? Really.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Janeth. It won't take long, and it will help me make sure we're addressing everything appropriately. Okay, let's start with your blood pressure. 140/88. A little elevated, but not unexpected given your history and a bit of anxiety about the exam. Pulse is 72, regular. Now, let's listen to your lungs. Lungs sound clear, no wheezing or crackles. And finally, let's take a quick look at your knees. There's some tenderness on the inner side of both knees, and a slight limitation in range of motion. No significant swelling or redness. Everything seems generally stable, but the elevated blood pressure and some knee discomfort are things we can discuss. Now, about that card… what kind of encouragement would you like me to write?
PATIENT: Oh, finally! See? Everything is fine. I told you so. As for the card… just something nice. Something about… not giving up. And maybe something about… enjoying life. I don’t know. Something cheerful. My daughter-in-law likes all those positive affirmations, so maybe something along those lines. “You are strong!” or “Every day is a blessing!” or… something. Honestly, I don’t really care, as long as it’s not too… saccharine. And could you maybe write “Get Well Soon” on it too? Just in case. And please write your name. She likes seeing the doctor’s name on things. Honestly, she makes such a fuss. But… yes. That would be lovely. Thank you, Doctor. Finally.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Janeth. I’m happy to do that for you. "Dear Janeth, It was lovely meeting you today. Remember, you are strong, and every day is a blessing. Don't let anything steal your joy. Take things one day at a time, and be kind to yourself. Get Well Soon! Sincerely, Jessieca Ranjan, MD” Here you go. I hope this brings a smile to your daughter-in-law’s face. Now, I do want to quickly address a couple of things we discussed. Your blood pressure is a little elevated. We can monitor it at home and possibly adjust your medication if needed. And while your knee discomfort is likely due to arthritis, we can explore some strategies for managing the pain, like gentle exercise or over-the-counter pain relievers. Would you be open to discussing those options?
PATIENT: Oh, that's…very nice. Yes, she will like that. Thank you, Doctor. And…well, exercise? Oh, goodness. I don’t think so. I’m quite happy just sitting, thank you very much. And pain relievers… well, I suppose I can take those if it gets really bad. But I don’t want to become dependent on them, you know? It’s just old age, Doctor. I’m not expecting any miracles. Honestly, I just want to go home and have a cup of tea. Is there anything else? Because if not… I think I'm done. Really.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right, Janeth. There’s no need for miracles. We can certainly manage things without aggressive interventions. And I completely respect your decision about exercise and pain relievers. Just to recap, we’ve discussed your slightly elevated blood pressure, which we’ll monitor, and your knee discomfort, which you’ll manage as needed. And I’ve written you a nice encouraging card, as requested. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you, Doctor Ranjan. You were…very patient with me. And the card is lovely. Really. I suppose I should get going. My son will be wondering where I am. And I need to make tea, you know. It’s very soothing. Oh, and…tell your staff thank you for being so nice too. They were all very helpful. Goodbye, Doctor. And… thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Janeth. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. And I will certainly pass along your thanks to the staff. Take care of yourself, and enjoy your tea! Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. .
