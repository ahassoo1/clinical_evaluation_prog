DOCTOR: Good morning, Christen. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… a pleasure, I suppose. I’ve been feeling rather… off, lately. I’m excessively thirsty, and hungry, all the time. It’s quite bothersome, to be frank. I just want to understand what’s going on, if that makes sense. I’d like to get this sorted as quickly as possible, if we could.
DOCTOR: Yes, that absolutely makes sense, Christen. It's good you're seeking answers. Excessive thirst and hunger can certainly be disruptive. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about when these symptoms started?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. It’s been… perhaps a month, maybe six weeks? It started gradually, I didn’t notice it at first. Just a little more thirsty than usual, a little more peckish. Now, it’s… constant. I find myself reaching for water and snacks all day long. It’s become quite a habit, which is… worrying, I suppose. I don’t recall anything specific that caused it to start, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a gradual onset over the past month or so. That’s helpful. And you haven’t noticed any particular trigger or event that seemed to coincide with the start of these symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not that I can recall. Nothing changed in my diet, no new medications, no stressful life events… at least, nothing more stressful than usual, being divorced and all. I genuinely can’t pinpoint anything specific. It just… began.
DOCTOR: I understand. Divorce is a significant life event, and it's perfectly valid that could be contributing to changes in your body as well. We'll keep that in mind. Now, besides the increased thirst and hunger, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me see. I’ve been going to the bathroom… more frequently, I suppose. Urinating, that is. And… I’ve felt a bit more tired than usual, though I’ve always been a bit sluggish, to be honest. No weight loss or gain, as far as I’m aware. I haven’t been keeping particularly close track, if that makes sense. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? I just want to make sure I give you everything you need to… diagnose this.
DOCTOR: No, you're doing wonderfully. Just trying to get a complete picture. Increased urination and fatigue are good things to note. You mentioned not tracking your weight, but have you noticed any changes in your clothes fitting differently?
PATIENT: No, my clothes feel… the same, I suppose. Nothing tighter, nothing looser. I haven’t had to adjust my belt or anything. I wear the same size as always. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to know if this is something serious. Is it… diabetes? My uncle had it, and I recall him being constantly thirsty. Is that what this is? I'd rather know straight away, if possible.
DOCTOR: It's understandable you're thinking about diabetes, given your uncle's history, and the symptoms you're describing certainly can be indicative of it. However, there are other possibilities as well, so it's important not to jump to conclusions. To get a better understanding, I'd like to ask about your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've always been relatively healthy, to be frank. A few colds, a touch of the flu now and then, but nothing serious. I had my appendix out when I was a boy, but that was decades ago. I see the dentist regularly, get a yearly checkup… standard things, really. I don’t take any regular medications. Except for the occasional paracetamol for headaches, but that's it.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. No significant medical history, just the appendectomy as a child and occasional paracetamol. And no family history of anything other than your uncle's diabetes?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. My mother had high blood pressure, I believe, but she managed it with diet and exercise. My father… he was a healthy man, lived to a good age. No other significant illnesses on either side of the family, as far as I know. I'm really trying to recall everything, Doctor, but my memory isn't what it used to be. I hope this is helpful. Can we… move on to tests now? I’d like to get this sorted as quickly as possible.
DOCTOR: You're doing great, Christen, and providing as much information as you can is exactly what I need. It's perfectly normal not to remember every detail. Yes, let's move on to a physical exam and some tests. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'd like to order some blood work, including a glucose test, to check your blood sugar levels. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Please, go ahead. The sooner we get this figured out, the better. I’d prefer to get this over with as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind. What do you need me to do?
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you could please sit up on the examination table, I will start by checking your blood pressure and pulse. Then I'll listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope. It will just be a quick listen. Just relax your arm for me, and breathe normally.
PATIENT: Alright. Just… let me know if I need to do anything. I’m not particularly fond of doctors, to be honest, but I understand it’s necessary. Get on with it, if you would. The sooner this is done, the better.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is 140/90. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, non-tender, no masses palpated. Alright, Christen. Everything seems normal on initial examination, but the blood work will give us a much clearer picture. I’ll have my nurse draw some blood now. She will explain the process to you. Do you have any allergies to latex or any difficulty with blood draws?
PATIENT: No allergies, no difficulties with blood draws, as far as I’m aware. I’ve had blood taken before, it's never been a problem. Just… do it quickly, please. I don't enjoy sitting here. The nurse is perfectly capable, I presume? I trust she knows what she’s doing. I'd just like to get this over with. How long will the results take? I have commitments later today.
DOCTOR: Yes, our nurse, Sarah, is excellent. She's been with the clinic for many years and is very experienced. The blood work should take approximately 15-20 minutes to process. I’ll review the results as soon as they're available and come back to discuss them with you. I’ll also have Sarah schedule a follow-up appointment, just in case we need to discuss further testing or treatment. Sarah will be in shortly. In the meantime, do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You’ve covered everything, I suppose. Just… please be quick. I appreciate you taking the time, Doctor, even though I’m not particularly enjoying this. I'd rather just get a straight answer. Is it diabetes? Or is it something else? That’s all I really want to know. .
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Christen, and I assure you I will do my best to provide you with a clear answer as quickly as possible. We need to wait for the results before we can say anything definitively. But rest assured, we'll get to the bottom of this. Sarah should be with you momentarily.
