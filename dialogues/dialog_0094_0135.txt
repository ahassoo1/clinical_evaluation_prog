DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Radillo. I'm Dr. Gegan. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is good to meet you also. I am here because of… how you say… something is coming from my ear. A little water, maybe? It is not good. It started, let me think… about three days ago, I believe.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little discharge from your ear that started about three days ago. I understand. Could you describe the discharge a bit more for me?
PATIENT: Yes. It is… clear, mostly. Not much blood, thankfully. And… not too smelly. Just… wet. It makes my ear feel… full. Like something is inside. It does not hurt, but it is… annoying. I try to clean it, but it keeps coming back.
DOCTOR: Alright, clear discharge, not bloody or foul-smelling, just a feeling of fullness and it keeps recurring despite cleaning. That's helpful. Have you noticed any hearing changes – any muffled hearing, ringing in your ear, or dizziness along with this?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. Now that you mention it… my hearing is a little quiet in that ear. Not much different, but… if someone speaks softly, I need to ask them to repeat. And… sometimes, when I move my head quickly, I feel a little… spin. Not falling down spin, just… a wobble. It does not last long. Maybe only a few seconds.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some muffled hearing and occasional brief dizziness with head movement. Have you had any ear pain, fever, or any recent colds, sinus infections, or other illnesses?
PATIENT: No, no pain at all. And no fever. I did have a small cold, perhaps two weeks ago? Not bad, just a little sniffle and cough for a few days. It is gone now, completely. I think. I do not remember being sick before that for a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright, no recent illness besides a mild cold a couple of weeks ago. And no ear pain or fever. Have you ever had any problems with your ears before—ear infections as a child, or any injuries to your ear?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Never. My ears were always… good. I had some problems with my eyes when I was young, but not my ears. I played soccer as a boy, maybe bumped my ear sometimes, but nothing serious. Nothing that I remember causing trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Now, let's take a look at your ear. Could you please sit up and face me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. I am ready when you are. Is there anything I need to do?
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Radillo, I’m just going to take a look in your ear. It might be a little chilly for a moment. Alright, I see some fluid in the ear canal, and the eardrum appears slightly inflamed. It doesn’t look like there’s a perforation, which is good. There’s also a little bit of debris in there. It could be a simple ear infection, or it could be fluid buildup from the recent cold. We'll need to consider both possibilities. Do you have any allergies that you know of?
PATIENT: Allergies? Let me think… No, I do not believe so. I have never been told I have any. I eat many things. Sometimes my skin gets itchy, but that is from the sun, I think. Not from food. I have lived in many places, and I eat many different foods. Never any problems, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing. I do not like taking pills if I can avoid it. Only when absolutely necessary. I prefer… natural remedies, if possible. But this ear… it is not getting better on its own. I try warm cloths, but it does not help much.
DOCTOR: Alright, no medications. Now, just a few more questions about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I am healthy, mostly. I walk every day, and I try to eat good food. I have a little trouble with my knees sometimes, old age, I suppose. But no doctor has ever told me I have anything serious. My blood pressure… I had it checked at the pharmacy once, and the lady said it was okay. That was last year, I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to hear you're generally healthy. And do you have a family history of any medical conditions, such as hearing loss or frequent ear infections?
PATIENT: That is a good question. My mother… she had some trouble hearing when she was very old, but I do not think it was from ear infections. She lived a long life, very long. My father… he was strong and healthy, never sick. I do not know of anyone else in my family with ear problems, no. We did not talk much about such things. It was not common to share health problems.
DOCTOR: Okay, no significant family history of ear problems. Finally, do you smoke, or are you exposed to secondhand smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not smoke. Never have. And I avoid being around smokers. It makes me cough. Bad for the lungs, you know. My wife… she used to smoke, but she stopped many years ago. We are divorced now, so no problem. I prefer fresh air.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo, thank you for that thorough history. Based on what you've told me and my examination, it sounds like you likely have an outer ear infection, also known as otitis externa, possibly complicated by some fluid buildup from your recent cold. However, to be certain and rule out a middle ear infection, I’d like to get a sample of the fluid from your ear canal. It’s a quick and painless procedure. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: A sample? Yes, I suppose so. If it will help you know what is wrong. Is it… uncomfortable? You said painless, but… I worry about pain. Will it hurt my ear?
DOCTOR: It’s very minimally uncomfortable, Mr. Radillo. I’ll use a small swab to gently collect a sample from your ear canal. It might feel a little cool or slightly strange, but it shouldn’t be painful. Think of it like a quick cleaning. We'll send it to the lab, and the results will tell us exactly what's going on and what the best treatment will be. If it turns out to be an infection, we can use ear drops, and you might need a short course of oral antibiotics if it’s severe. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Ear drops… yes, that sounds good. Better than pills, I think. And a sample… if it is quick, then yes, do it. I want to feel better. My hearing is important to me. Let us get it done, then. Quickly, please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Radillo, all done. That was quick, wasn’t it?
PATIENT: Yes, very quick. Thank you, Doctor. It was not painful at all, thankfully. Now we wait for the results? How long will that take? Will you call me? I do not have a mobile phone.
DOCTOR: Yes, we'll wait for the results. It usually takes about 24-48 hours for the lab to give us the results. I’ll have my nurse call you here at the clinic with the results as soon as they come in. I’ll need your best contact number for the clinic, if you could remind me. In the meantime, I recommend keeping your ear dry. Avoid swimming or getting water in your ear, and try to avoid using cotton swabs inside your ear canal, as they can sometimes push debris further in and worsen the infection. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Yes, my number is 555-1234. The nurse knows? Good. And… can I still walk? I walk every day, it is good for me. Will that make it worse? Also, what if it is not an infection? What else could it be?
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse has your number. And yes, you can absolutely continue walking. That won't make it worse – in fact, it’s good to stay active. Just avoid getting water in your ear while you're out. If it's not an infection, there are a few possibilities. It could be a buildup of earwax, which is common. It could also be fluid from a mild Eustachian tube dysfunction, meaning the tube connecting your middle ear to the back of your throat isn’t draining properly. And, less commonly, it could be something else, but we'll cross that bridge when we have the lab results. For now, let’s focus on getting those results and figuring out the best course of action. Do you have any other questions before we finish for today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is all. You have answered everything I have asked. I will wait for the phone call. Thank you for your help. You are very kind. I hope it is not too serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Radillo. I understand your concern, and we'll get to the bottom of it. I'll have my nurse call you as soon as the results are available. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any new or worsening symptoms.
