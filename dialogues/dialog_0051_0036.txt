DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Barban. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon to you, Doctor. Yes, well. I have… this appointment. For the insurance. Medicare, you understand? They require a check-up before they will fully… allow everything. It is a formality, I believe.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand perfectly. Medicare often requires these initial assessments. It’s good you're getting it done. Even though it's a formality, it's always a good idea to check in and make sure everything is as it should be. Just to be thorough, even with this being a check-up for insurance purposes, is there anything specific you've been experiencing, or any concerns you have about your health, however small they may seem?
PATIENT: Concerns? No. Nothing… significant. I work in the food plant, you understand? It is not… a delicate job. Aches and pains are… expected. I am a strong man. I do not… need to worry about small things. It is a waste of time, frankly. But I am here for the insurance, so... ask your questions.
DOCTOR: I understand. A physically demanding job certainly comes with its own set of challenges. It’s good you’re so strong, that's excellent. And you’re right, we should be thorough for the insurance. Alright. Let's start with a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you had any serious illnesses or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No. Never. I have… a strong constitution. My grandfather, he lived to be nearly one hundred years old, and he never saw the inside of a hospital. Good genes, you understand? A little cold, maybe, sometimes. But nothing… serious. I eat well, mostly. Lamb and rice, good things. Nothing like these… processed foods everyone eats now.
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful to hear about your grandfather! Good genes are a great thing to have, and it sounds like you’re taking good care of yourself. Have you ever had any surgeries, even minor ones?
PATIENT: Surgeries? Absolutely not. I told you, I do not… need surgery. A strong body, you understand? Why would I allow someone to… cut me open? That is… foolish. No. Never. Are you suggesting I look like someone who has had surgery?
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all! Please don't misunderstand. I'm simply going through a routine questionnaire to get a complete picture of your health history. It’s standard practice. I apologize if I phrased that poorly. Alright then. Let’s move on to your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Family history... hmmm. My father… he had high blood pressure, I think. Yes, that is it. High blood pressure. He did not take care of himself, you understand? Always stressed about… things. And his brother, my uncle… he smoked too many cigarettes. That is… not good. But otherwise… no. Nothing… serious. Just foolish habits. They did not have the… strength of character to live properly. Like me.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in your father, and smoking in your uncle. That’s helpful to know. Thank you. Now, just to cover all bases, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? I am a Yemeni man, Doctor. We eat… everything. Spices, lamb, rice, things you would not even… imagine. No. I do not have allergies. It is… a sign of weakness, you understand? A delicate constitution. I am not delicate. Do you have patients who have… weak constitutions?
DOCTOR: That's good to hear. No, not particularly. Everyone is different, of course. Some people are more sensitive to certain things than others. It's simply important to rule everything out. And currently, are you taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications? No. Why would I need medications? I just told you, I am a strong man. I eat well. Lamb and rice. Sometimes yogurt. That is all. Vitamins? Supplements? Those are for… people who cannot maintain themselves. I am perfectly capable of maintaining myself. Do you think I look like I need supplements?
DOCTOR: No, no, not at all! You appear to be in excellent health. It's simply part of the standard assessment. Alright, Mr. Barban. Just to complete the picture, would you mind if I did a quick physical exam?
PATIENT: A physical exam? More… poking and prodding? Very well. If it is required for the insurance, then… do what you must. But I assure you, you will find nothing… amiss. I am a strong man. Do not waste too much of my time. Just… be quick about it.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will be as efficient as possible. We'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a quick look in your ears, nose, and throat. If you could just sit back and relax… Heart sounds are regular, rate is 72. No murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes or crackles. Blood pressure is 130/80. Ears appear clear. Tympanic membranes are normal. Throat is clear. No redness or swelling. No palpable lymphadenopathy. Everything appears normal, Mr. Barban. All within acceptable ranges for your age and build.
PATIENT: As I said, everything is… normal. I am a strong man, you understand? No surprises. Now, is this… sufficient for the insurance? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Barban, everything appears to be perfectly normal. The exam was quite straightforward, as expected. I'll submit this report to Medicare. It should fulfill the requirements for your coverage. They may require some additional paperwork from you, but this covers the medical assessment portion. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Questions? For you? No. I do not… require any further instruction. You have confirmed what I already knew: I am a strong, healthy man. Now, if you will excuse me… Is there anything I need to pay? Or can I simply… leave? I do not want to waste any more of your – or my – time.
DOCTOR: There is a standard co-pay of \$20, Mr. Barban, as per your insurance plan. Our receptionist will handle that on your way out. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I wish you continued good health. Please don't hesitate to schedule an appointment if anything does change in the future. And please, take care of yourself. It sounds like you're doing a great job already.
PATIENT: Very well. Good day, Doctor. .
