DOCTOR: Good morning, Wynell. My name is Dr. Tosca. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Dr. Tosca, is it? Honestly, I don't even remember why I’m here. My daughter, bless her heart, insisted. Something about not wanting me to… well, I forget. It’s probably nothing serious. I’ve been a podiatrist for… a long time. Longer than you’ve been alive, I imagine. I usually tell people what to do with their feet, not the other way around.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright, Wynell. It happens more often than you think, especially as we get older. Don’t worry about a thing. Your daughter is probably just looking out for you. Let's see if we can figure it out together. Perhaps we can start with how you’ve been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Feeling? Oh, dear. Well, my feet ache, naturally. That's always the case. But that's just old age, isn't it? And my knees… don't even get me started on my knees. Everything creaks. Honestly, I just assumed it was… life. Is this about something specific? Because I really don't have time for a lot of fuss. I have a luncheon on Tuesday.
DOCTOR: Of course, of course. No fuss at all. We’ll take things at your pace. It sounds like you have some typical aches and pains, which is very common. But sometimes, even everyday aches can signal something else going on. Just to get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about these aches?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where do I begin? They're just… there. A dull throbbing, mostly. Worse in the morning, naturally. And after I've been on my feet too long, which is… often. I used to be able to stand for hours, examining feet. Now… not so much. My daughter keeps telling me I need to rest more. She thinks I'm overdoing it. But what am I supposed to do, just sit around?
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It sounds like you’ve been very active for a long time, and it’s hard to slow down. It's good that you're still wanting to be active. When you say "throbbing," is it in both feet, or just one?
PATIENT: Oh, it's both, dear. Definitely both. Though… my right one is usually a bit worse. It's the one I used to use to… well, to really press when examining a patient's arches. You know, to feel for support. A proper podiatrist feels with their feet, you see. Not just looks. Though, honestly, these days, they both feel pretty much the same. Just… achy.
DOCTOR: I see. That’s helpful to know. Would you mind if I took a quick look at your feet and knees?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to look at my feet? After I've spent a lifetime looking at other people’s? It feels a bit… backwards, doesn't it? But… alright. Go ahead. Just be gentle, please. I don’t like being poked and prodded. And don't tell me anything I already know, like they ache. I’m perfectly aware of that, thank you very much.
DOCTOR: Of course, I won't tell you anything you already know. I’m just going to take a feel and assess the range of motion. Okay, just a little pressure here…and here. Does that bring up any sharp pain, or is it mostly just the achiness we discussed?
PATIENT: Mostly the achiness. But… wait a moment. There. There feels a bit… tender. Right along this bone, here. . It’s not sharp, exactly. More like… a deep bruise. I might have bumped it on something a few weeks ago. I forget what. My house is full of furniture, you see. It’s easy to knock into things. And my daughter keeps rearranging it. Honestly, it's a wonder I don't break something every day.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see. That tenderness is good to know. And now, let’s take a look at those knees. Just relax as I move them through their range of motion. Does that cause any pain or discomfort?
PATIENT: Oh, the knees… sigh. Yes, that’s a bit… stiff. Not sharp, mind you. Just… reluctant. Like they need oiling. And it clicks. They always click. I’ve had them click for years. My mother had clicking knees too, you know. It’s probably hereditary. Don’t worry about the clicking, dear. It’s just a… feature.
DOCTOR: Alright, Wynell. Thank you for letting me take a look. Everything seems consistent with some wear and tear, which is common at your age, especially with your active lifestyle. The tenderness on top of your right foot could be from a minor injury, as you suspect. To get a clearer picture, and rule out anything else, I'd like to order some X-rays of both feet and knees. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: X-rays? Oh, dear. More poking and prodding? Honestly, I really don’t see the point. I know my knees are clicking, and I know I bumped my foot. X-rays aren't going to change that, are they? My daughter will probably insist. She's always wanting me to have tests done. Is it really necessary? Because I have that luncheon on Tuesday… and I’d prefer not to spend the whole day in a doctor’s office.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely. You’re right, the X-rays won't change the fact that your knees click or that you bumped your foot. But they can help us rule out other possibilities, like arthritis or a small fracture that might be contributing to the discomfort. It's just a precaution to make sure we're not missing anything. And while I wouldn’t normally push for tests if I wasn’t concerned, given your age and the slight tenderness, I think it's best to have a look. It will give us a good baseline, and peace of mind. It’s a quick procedure, and we can usually get the results back within a day or two. Would it help if I had the office schedule the X-rays for first thing in the morning, so you can get it done quickly and still make your luncheon on Tuesday?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you insist. But first thing in the morning means early, you understand? I need my coffee. And tell them to be gentle. Really gentle. And if it’s going to take a long time, I’m going to need something to read. Do they have any magazines? Not those gardening ones, though. I tried gardening once. It was a disaster. And my daughter… please don't tell her I agreed to this. She’ll be insufferable.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. First thing in the morning, with coffee beforehand. And gentle technicians. I’ll make a note to request magazines – definitely not gardening ones. We’ll do our best to get you in and out quickly. And I promise, your secret is safe with me. I won’t mention it to your daughter. In the meantime, to help with the discomfort, I recommend continuing to rest when you can, and over-the-counter pain relief like ibuprofen or naproxen, as long as you don’t have any allergies or medical conditions that prevent you from taking them. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Ibuprofen… yes, I’ve taken that before. Seems to help a bit. Though, honestly, it’s hard to tell if it’s the ibuprofen or just the rest. And I don't have any allergies, as far as I know. I eat everything. Well, almost everything. I don't care for beets. No, I don't think I have any questions. Just… hurry up with those X-rays, alright? And tell them not to bother me with small talk. I’ve heard enough small talk in my lifetime to last me several lifetimes.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. No small talk, ibuprofen when needed, and we'll get those X-rays scheduled as quickly as possible. I’ll have my assistant come in and take your insurance information and schedule the appointment for you now. Is there anything else I can do for you today, Wynell?
PATIENT: No, dear. I think that’s all. Just… try to find some magazines that aren’t about flowers, alright? And please, tell that assistant to speak clearly. My hearing isn't what it used to be. Honestly, everyone mumbles these days.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be sure to let her know to speak clearly and to find some suitable magazines. Thank you for coming in today, Wynell. We’ll get you taken care of. Let my assistant come in and we'll get everything sorted out. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Alright. Thank you, Doctor. . Just… hurry up with those magazines. And tell that assistant to speak up! Honestly, these young people…
