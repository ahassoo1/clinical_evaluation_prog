DOCTOR: Right. Well, Ms. Redeye, let's get straight to it. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, it's these hiccups! They just won't stop. It's been... well, I lost count after yesterday, but definitely more than two days now. It's really annoying, honestly.
DOCTOR: Annoying, yes. Prolonged hiccups are disruptive. Two days, you say?
PATIENT: More than two days. I think it started Saturday afternoon, maybe? I was having tea with my friend, Layla, and just… hic… started. It wasn’t a big deal at first, just a little one, but then it kept going and going. Now it's almost constant. hic There, you see?
DOCTOR: Yes, I do. And has anything specific triggered them, as far as you can recall?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I don't think so. We were just talking, normal stuff - Layla's new garden, the price of tomatoes, you know? I wasn't drinking anything fizzy, or eating anything spicy. hic I did laugh a lot, actually. Layla’s telling jokes, she’s very funny. But I laugh all the time, it's never bothered me before.
DOCTOR: Alright. And other than the laughing, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just… tired, I guess. It's tiring hic to hiccup all the time! And a little bit frustrated, if I'm honest. It's making it hard to sleep. Everything else feels normal. No fever, no pain anywhere, no… I don't know… nothing like that.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam. Just to rule things out. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your abdomen. Nothing invasive, just a standard check. Please lie back on the examination table.
PATIENT: Okay, that sounds fine. hic No problem at all. It's a bit high, isn't it? But I'll manage.
DOCTOR: Yes, it’s a standard height. Now, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Blood pressure is 138 over 82. Pulse is 76. Everything appears normal so far.
PATIENT: Okay. Good to hear, I suppose. hic It's just so… persistent! What could be causing it, then? Is it… serious? I haven't had hiccups this long since I was a little girl.
DOCTOR: Well, the vast majority of prolonged hiccups are benign. Often, they resolve on their own. It could be something as simple as irritation of the phrenic nerve... or a slight spasm in your diaphragm. Though, given the duration… we should rule out a few more possibilities. Do you have any history of acid reflux or GERD?
PATIENT: Acid reflux… hmm. Not officially diagnosed, no. But sometimes, after I eat a big meal, or something spicy, hic I get a bit of heartburn. It's not terrible, I just take some antacids and it goes away. It doesn't happen often, though. Maybe once a month, or less. Does that… matter?
DOCTOR: It can. Chronic irritation can sometimes trigger prolonged hiccups. We’ll need to investigate further. I’m going to order a basic blood panel – just to check your electrolytes and rule out anything obvious. And a chest X-ray, to ensure there’s nothing pressing on your diaphragm. We’ll get those results back within a few days.
PATIENT: Oh. Blood tests and an X-ray… That sounds… a bit much, doesn't it? For just hiccups? I mean, I feel fine otherwise. hic Is it really necessary?
DOCTOR: Ms. Redeye, I understand your concern. While it's true hiccups are usually harmless, persistent hiccups, lasting this long, warrant investigation. It’s simply to rule out any underlying causes, and ensure we’re not missing something serious. I wouldn’t order these tests if I didn’t think it was prudent. It’s standard procedure. I’ll write you a referral to the lab and radiology. You can schedule the appointments at your convenience. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh… okay. If you think it’s necessary… No, no allergies. I’ve had scans before, when I broke my wrist a few years ago. hic Everything was fine then. Do I need to… prepare for these tests? Anything I should avoid eating or drinking?
DOCTOR: No special preparation is required. Just try to relax, and drink plenty of water beforehand. The lab will provide specific instructions. Here are your referrals. Schedule those appointments as soon as possible. We’ll review the results when they’re available. Do you have any other concerns at this time?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Just… hopefully it’s nothing serious. hic Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, well. Let’s hope so. Have a good day, Ms. Redeye. .
