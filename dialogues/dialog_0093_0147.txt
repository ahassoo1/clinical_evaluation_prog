DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Raghunathan. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a lump in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a few weeks now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: I understand. A lump in the lower abdomen certainly warrants investigation. Could you describe the lump to me?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It’s… firm, I suppose. Not painful to the touch, really. Just… there. It's maybe the size of a plum, or a little smaller. I haven't noticed it getting bigger or smaller, not that I've been actively measuring it, of course. It just feels… unusual.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that’s helpful. "Firm, about the size of a plum, and not painful." And you've noticed it for a few weeks with no change in size. Has there been any associated discomfort—any nausea, vomiting, changes in your bowel habits, or fever?
PATIENT: No, thankfully. No nausea or vomiting at all. My bowel habits are… regular, I suppose you could say. No fever, either. That’s why I wasn’t overly worried at first, but it's still… unsettling to have something there. It just doesn't feel right.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. It's always best to investigate anything new or unusual. Now, let’s delve a bit into your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Not really. I had chickenpox as a child, and a bad bout of the flu a few years back, but nothing major. No ongoing conditions, no surgeries, nothing like that. I generally stay quite healthy, eat well, try to get some exercise when I can. My wife keeps me in line on that front!
DOCTOR: That's excellent to hear. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is very important. And no prior surgeries or significant illnesses to note. Now, thinking about your family—are there any medical conditions that run in your family—anything like abdominal cancers, hernias, or other digestive issues?
PATIENT: That's a good question. My mother had… she had some problems with her stomach, years ago. I don't know exactly what it was, something to do with ulcers, I think. She had them treated, and she was fine for years afterwards. My father was healthy as an ox, really. No known issues on his side. My wife’s family… I honestly can’t say. We haven't talked about it much, to be perfectly frank.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that. Maternal history of ulcers is useful information. It's not always easy to gather a complete family history, so what you've provided is a good start. Now, just to be thorough, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I can eat pretty much anything without a problem, and I’ve taken antibiotics before with no issues. My wife always checks the ingredients on things, just in case, but I’ve never had to worry about it.
DOCTOR: Excellent. No known allergies, which is good to know. And finally, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, nothing at all. I try to avoid taking pills if I can. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, if absolutely necessary, but that's it. I really prefer to let my body heal itself naturally, if possible.
DOCTOR: That's commendable. Alright, Mr. Raghunathan, thank you for providing me with this detailed information. Now, I'd like to perform a physical examination. I'll need to palpate your abdomen to get a better sense of the lump's characteristics and rule out other potential causes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Thank you. I appreciate your trust. I’m going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope, then I’ll gently palpate the area to assess the lump. Please let me know if you experience any discomfort during the examination. Bowel sounds are present and normal in all quadrants. Now, I’m going to gently press on your abdomen. Hmm… okay. The area is soft overall, but there is a firm, non-tender mass approximately 2 centimeters in diameter located in the lower right quadrant. It appears to be slightly mobile. There's no guarding or rebound tenderness. No evidence of organomegaly or other abnormalities. Based on the examination, the lump feels consistent with a possible lipoma or inguinal hernia, but further investigation is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
PATIENT: Okay… that sounds… complicated. A lipoma and a… what was the other one? An inguinal hernia? What does that mean exactly? Is it serious? I have to admit, Doctor, I'm starting to feel a little anxious.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety completely. It's natural to feel concerned when something new is discovered. Let me explain. A lipoma is a benign—that means non-cancerous—fatty tumor that grows slowly under the skin. It’s very common and usually doesn't cause any problems. An inguinal hernia, on the other hand, occurs when tissue—such as part of the intestine—protrudes through a weak spot in the abdominal muscles. Whether it’s serious depends on the type and size of the hernia, and whether it's causing symptoms. But right now, we don't know for certain what we’re dealing with. That's why I recommend a few further tests to get a clearer picture. Would you be open to having a blood test and an ultrasound of your abdomen?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. Whatever you recommend, Doctor. Blood test and an ultrasound… yes, that sounds sensible. I just… I'm hoping it's nothing too serious. This has really thrown me off. How long will it take to get the results? And what happens if it is a hernia? Will I need surgery? I know I'm asking a lot of questions, but I'm just trying to prepare myself.
DOCTOR: You’re not asking too many questions at all. It's important to be informed and prepared, and I'm happy to answer them to the best of my ability. The blood test will help us rule out any underlying infection or inflammation. The ultrasound will give us a detailed image of the lump and surrounding tissues, allowing us to determine its size, shape, and composition. We should have the results back within 2 to 3 business days. If it is a hernia, the treatment will depend on the size and severity of the protrusion. Small hernias may be monitored without immediate intervention, while larger or symptomatic hernias often require surgical repair. However, surgery isn’t always necessary, and we’ll discuss all your options thoroughly if that’s the case. For now, let’s focus on getting those tests done. I’ll write you a referral for the blood work and schedule the ultrasound for you. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden pain, nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits, please contact the clinic immediately. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… much better. Thank you, Doctor. A plan is good. Blood test, ultrasound, and I’ll call if anything changes. Could you just… remind me where I need to go for the blood test? And is there anything I need to do to prepare for the ultrasound? Should I eat anything special beforehand?
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here's the lab order for the blood work. You can go to the lab at St. Luke's Hospital, located at 123 Main Street. They are open Monday through Friday from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM. You may want to call ahead to schedule an appointment, their number is 555-1234. And here are the instructions for the ultrasound. For this test, you don't need to fast beforehand, but it's helpful to drink approximately 32 ounces of water an hour before your appointment to provide a clear image. Please also wear comfortable clothing. The ultrasound will be performed at Suburban Imaging Center, located at 456 Oak Avenue. Their number is 555-5678. Do you have any questions about the locations or preparations?
PATIENT: No, I think I have it. St. Luke’s for the blood test, Suburban Imaging for the ultrasound. Drink some water before the ultrasound, that's good to know. Thank you, Doctor Bakan. You’ve been very helpful and reassuring. I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so thoroughly. I think that’s all for now. I’ll schedule the tests and get them done as soon as possible. I’ll be in touch if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Raghunathan. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime. We'll get to the bottom of this. Wishing you all the best, and I look forward to discussing the results with you soon. Have a good day.
PATIENT: .
