DOCTOR: Good morning, Reneisha. My name is Dr. Gegan. It's nice to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. To start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’m quite worried. I’ve put on weight, and I simply…can’t seem to get it off. It's been happening for a few months now, and it’s rather unsettling. I haven’t changed my diet, and I’m as active as I usually am.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Reneisha. It's definitely unsettling when your body changes without a clear reason, especially when you haven’t altered your lifestyle. A few months of unexplained weight gain is worth investigating. To get a better picture, could you tell me a little more about your usual diet?
PATIENT: Certainly. I try to eat…healthily, I suppose. Lots of potatoes – we Lithuanians, we do love our potatoes – and some meat, usually chicken or pork. Vegetables, when they’re in season, and bread, of course. I bake my own bread, it’s a family tradition. I don't eat a great deal of sweets, perhaps a small piece of cake with my tea on Sundays. I drink tea, mostly, and water. Not much soda. I haven’t been eating more of anything, truly.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Reneisha. That gives me a good starting point. Potatoes are a carbohydrate source, and bread adds to that as well, so it’s good to be mindful of portion sizes. It's helpful to know you're not consuming a lot of sugary drinks or sweets. Now, when you say you're as active as usual, could you describe a typical week for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well, my husband and I run a small farm – not a large one, mostly vegetables and some chickens. So, I'm on my feet a good deal throughout the day. Weeding, planting, harvesting… it's physical work. I'd say I'm walking and bending and lifting for at least six hours most days. On Sundays, we usually visit family, so it’s less physical. But generally, I’m quite active. It’s just… it doesn’t seem to be enough anymore.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very active lifestyle, Reneisha. Farming is demanding work, and six hours a day is substantial. It is concerning that you're not seeing the results you expect despite your activity level. To get a more complete understanding, let’s go through a bit more of your medical history, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any other changes besides the weight gain?
PATIENT: No, I don’t mind at all. Let me think… well, I’ve been a bit more tired lately, I suppose. Not exhausted, but just… more easily fatigued. And my skin feels drier than usual. I put that down to the summer heat, perhaps. I haven’t had any pain, no dizziness, no changes in my… bowel habits, if you don’t mind me saying. Nothing like that. Just the weight and the tiredness. I do sleep well, though – that hasn’t changed.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Reneisha. Fatigue and dry skin are good things to note. It’s helpful that your sleep hasn't been affected. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: No, never. I’ve always been quite healthy, thankfully. I haven’t had any major illnesses or surgeries. A few colds, of course, but nothing serious. My husband is the one who usually needs the doctor, not me. I’ve never had my thyroid checked, though. Is that something we should consider? I don't really know much about those things.
DOCTOR: It's good to hear you've generally been healthy, Reneisha. It's definitely worthwhile considering a thyroid check, given the fatigue and unexplained weight gain. The thyroid gland plays a significant role in metabolism and energy levels. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to ask about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as diabetes, thyroid problems, heart disease, or obesity?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… My mother had high blood pressure, later in life. And my grandmother, on my father’s side, she had diabetes, but she wasn't very good at taking care of herself. She didn’t eat well and didn’t exercise. As far as I know, no one else had any major health problems. My siblings are all healthy as well. My husband’s family… I don’t know them very well, we didn't stay in touch much. So, I suppose that’s all I can tell you. Mostly just my mother’s blood pressure.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Reneisha. That’s helpful to know. History of high blood pressure in your mother is good information. And knowing there’s no significant history of thyroid problems is also reassuring. Now, could you tell me about any medications you are currently taking, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I don’t take any medications. Not even over-the-counter things, unless it's something for a headache, very rarely. And no supplements. We Lithuanians, we prefer natural remedies, if we can. Chamomile tea for calming, honey for a sore throat… things like that. I believe in eating well and getting enough rest, that’s usually enough. I haven’t needed to take any medication in years.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Reneisha. Avoiding unnecessary medication is always a good approach. To get a more comprehensive understanding, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature – and listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also palpate your thyroid gland to check for any enlargement or tenderness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s perfectly alright, Doctor. I understand it's necessary. Please, go ahead. I trust your expertise. I'm a little anxious, of course, but I’m glad we’re getting to the bottom of this. Just… please be gentle. I bruise easily.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Reneisha. We’ll take things slowly and be as gentle as possible. I'll make a note of your tendency to bruise. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, but not drastically so. We can monitor that. Your pulse and temperature are normal. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your thyroid gland feels a bit larger than expected, but it doesn't seem to be causing you any pain. I don’t feel any obvious lumps or bumps. Okay, Reneisha. Based on what you’ve told me and the preliminary physical exam, it's likely we need to order some blood tests to get a clearer picture. I’d like to check your thyroid hormone levels – TSH, T4, and T3 – to see if your thyroid is functioning properly. I'll also order a complete blood count and a metabolic panel to rule out any other underlying conditions. Do you have any allergies to medications or latex that I should be aware of before we proceed with the blood draw?
PATIENT: No, I don’t have any allergies, Doctor. Not to medications or latex. I’m fine with the blood draw. As long as it helps us figure out what’s going on, I’m happy to do whatever is necessary. I do get a little faint sometimes, though, when my blood is taken. Perhaps I should sit down for a bit afterwards? Just to be safe.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the potential for feeling faint, Reneisha. Absolutely, we’ll have you sit down and rest for a few minutes after the blood draw. We’ll also make sure you have something to drink and a small snack if you’d like. Here’s the lab order. You can take this to the lab downstairs, and they'll take care of the blood draw. It usually takes about 15-20 minutes. Once the results are back – which typically takes a few days – we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a plan. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough and explained everything very clearly. I appreciate that. Thank you for listening to my concerns and taking me seriously. I’m a little worried, of course, but I feel much better knowing we’re doing something about it. I’ll go downstairs and get the blood draw done now. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Reneisha. I’m glad I could ease your mind a bit. We'll get to the bottom of this together. Don't hesitate to reach out if anything changes. Have a good day, and I’ll see you at your follow-up appointment.
