DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Thut. I'm Dr. Hembrey. It’s good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Umm… hello. My nails. They look… funny. Not good funny. Just… funny. I don’t really know why I’m here, to be honest. Someone told me to come. It’s about my nails, yeah? They’re… changed.
DOCTOR: Changed how, Ms. Thut?
PATIENT: Ugh. It’s hard to explain. They’re… not shiny anymore? And kinda… bumpy. Not like, painfully bumpy, just… not smooth. And one of them… it’s a little bit… off. Like the color is different. I don’t know. I don’t pay much attention to things like nails. Should I?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's try to be a bit more precise. When did you first notice this change in your nails?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. When? Hmm… I don’t know. A while ago. Maybe… last month? Or was it before that? Everything kinda blends together, you know? I been busy. I think it was after I started… gardening again. But that was… a long time ago, now. Does it matter?
DOCTOR: It does matter, Ms. Thut. The timeline can help us determine the cause. Gardening could be relevant, yes. Are the changes isolated to one nail, or are multiple nails affected?
PATIENT: Oh. Okay. Multiple. Yeah, definitely multiple. Not all of them, but… most. My thumb nails are the worst, I think. And… this one. It looks… weird. Not like my other nails. It’s kinda… thick. Is that bad? I don’t even know what normal nails look like anymore.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. Let's take a look. Please extend your hands, palms up, so I can examine your nails more closely. I'm going to gently palpate them as well. Just let me know if anything is tender.
PATIENT: Okay. Gently now, yeah? I don’t like things poked and prodded. And they aren’t that bad. Honestly. People make too much fuss about nails.
DOCTOR: Hmm. I see what you mean about the discoloration and thickening, particularly on your thumb nails and this one here on your left ring finger. There’s some slight pitting as well. Do you notice any pain or discomfort around the nails, even when you’re not being touched?
PATIENT: Pain? No, not really. Maybe a little… ache sometimes? But I just thought that was my old age. It’s just… annoying. They look awful. Like something’s growing under them, you know? It’s probably nothing. But my niece, she’s a… well, she thinks everything is something. She told me to come here. Is it… fungus? Is that what you’re going to say?
DOCTOR: It could be a fungal infection, Ms. Thut, but we need to rule out other possibilities first. There are several conditions that can cause changes in nail appearance. To get a definitive diagnosis, I’d like to take a small sample of the nail clippings for laboratory analysis. This will allow us to identify the cause and determine the appropriate treatment. It’s a quick and relatively painless procedure. Do you consent to this?
PATIENT: Laboratory analysis? Ugh. Sounds… complicated. And expensive. Will my Medicare cover it? I don't want a big bill. And will it hurt? I really don't like anything… sharp. Honestly, I just want them to look normal again. Is there a cream or something? Can’t you just… scrape it off?
DOCTOR: Medicare should cover the necessary testing, Ms. Thut, but we’ll need to verify your coverage details. The procedure itself is quite simple – I’ll use a small file to collect a tiny sample of the nail clippings. It’s not sharp, and it shouldn't be painful – more like filing your fingernails. Scraping it off, as you suggest, isn’t advisable, as it could potentially worsen the condition or lead to infection. We need to identify the cause of the changes before determining the appropriate treatment. Let's proceed with the nail clippings first, then we can discuss the results and available options. Do you agree?
PATIENT: Fine. But gentle, okay? And make sure my Medicare covers it. I don't want any surprises. And… hurry up. I have things to do. Just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Thut. This will just take a moment. I’m being as gentle as possible. Just relax. Okay, all done. I’ve collected enough sample for the analysis. I’ll send this off to the lab and we should have the results back within a week. In the meantime, I recommend keeping your nails trimmed and dry. Do you have any questions before we finish?
PATIENT: Trimmed and dry… yeah, okay. That’s… easy enough. A week, you say? A whole week? What if it’s something… bad? What if I need… medicine? I don’t like taking medicine. And what if it’s contagious? Should I be wearing gloves? My niece would probably want me to wear gloves. Is that what I should do? .
DOCTOR: Ms. Thut, let’s not jump to conclusions. It’s far too early to speculate about “something bad.” Most nail conditions are not serious, and are easily treatable. As for contagiousness, that’s something we’ll determine once we have the lab results. Wearing gloves is not necessary at this time, but practicing good hygiene – washing your hands regularly – is always advisable. We'll review the results together next week and discuss all available treatment options. I will also provide a referral to a podiatrist if I think it is needed. Do you have any other questions before we finish?
