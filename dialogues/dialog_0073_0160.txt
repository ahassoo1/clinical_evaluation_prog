DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hardenburgh. I'm Dr. Korrell. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t have all day, so let's just get to it. I'm tired. Really tired. And I… well, it's embarrassing, but I’ve been eating dirt. Not like, on purpose, but I just… crave it. Clay, mostly. It started a few months ago, and it’s getting worse. Don't look at me like that, it's not a good habit, I know that.
DOCTOR: Yes, well, unusual cravings can certainly point to something. “Eating dirt,” as you put it… how much dirt would you say you’ve been consuming, and how often?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t act so surprised. It’s not like I’m out shoveling it up by the bucketful! Maybe… a handful a day? Sometimes less, sometimes a bit more when I’m really… low. It’s hard to say exactly. And it’s not just dirt, sometimes it's the red clay from the park near my apartment. Don’t you have anything better to ask me? This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. A handful a day of clay… and you mentioned this started a few months ago and is worsening. Do you feel any other symptoms along with this… craving?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Oh, goodness. Let me think. Well, I’m just generally weak, you know? Like I could barely make it up the stairs yesterday. And I get headaches, a lot of headaches. And… my stomach’s been a bit off. Not sick, exactly, but just… unsettled. Like it’s constantly churning. Honestly, I just feel…old. But what else do you expect? I’m nearly eighty years old, for heaven's sake.
DOCTOR: Weakness, headaches, and stomach upset…and you feel generally unwell. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? No, not really. I eat when I have to. Usually something simple, like toast or soup. Not much of a taste for anything fancy these days. Everything just tastes… bland. And honestly, sometimes I'm so tired I just can't bother. It's not like I'm losing weight, or anything, but I'm definitely not enjoying food, if that makes sense. I haven't had a proper meal in weeks, probably. It's just…effort. Is this going anywhere?
DOCTOR: We are getting somewhere. You mentioned fatigue, headaches, stomach upset, and a loss of appetite. Before we proceed, have you been experiencing any dizziness or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Dizziness… sometimes. When I stand up too fast, you know? It doesn’t last long, just a quick spin. And shortness of breath… well, I get winded easily. Walking to the mailbox feels like climbing a mountain these days. But I just figured that was my age, honestly. I haven't been pushing myself, trying to avoid it. I just...slowed down, is all. Are you going to poke and prod me now? I hate doctors.
DOCTOR: A quick examination would be helpful, Ms. Hardenburgh. Just to get a baseline. Blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs… standard things. And yes, I will need to ask some questions about your medical history, if you'll permit. Have you had any serious illnesses in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, now we're getting to the poking and prodding. Fine. Get it over with. As for illnesses... honestly, I've lived a long life. I had the flu, a bad cold here and there, the usual. Nothing major. I broke my wrist when I was younger, fell down the stairs— ironically—but that healed fine. I’ve never been one to bother doctors unless absolutely necessary. I take a multivitamin sometimes, if that counts. Are you done yet? This is really starting to wear me out.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated. 140 over 90. Heart rate is a little fast as well, 92. Lungs sound clear, but a little… diminished. Ms. Hardenburgh, have you ever been diagnosed with anemia?
PATIENT: Anemia? No, never. Not that I recall, anyway. What is anemia? I mean, I know it has something to do with blood, but… Honestly, I don’t keep up with all that medical jargon. I just know I’m tired, and I’ve been eating dirt, and I’m really starting to regret coming here. This is a waste of time and energy. Are you going to give me something to feel better, or are we just going to sit here and talk about my blood all day?
DOCTOR: Anemia is a condition where your blood doesn’t have enough healthy red blood cells. It can cause fatigue, weakness, headaches…symptoms you’ve described. And the dirt eating… that is called pica. Pica can be a sign of iron deficiency, which can cause anemia. Have you taken any iron supplements in the past?
PATIENT: Iron… supplements? Good heavens, no. I don’t go around popping pills unless the doctor specifically tells me to. I believe in eating a balanced diet, not relying on… chemicals. Honestly, the thought of putting all those artificial things into my body… it’s dreadful. I eat my vegetables, I drink my water, what more do you want from me? This whole thing is ridiculous. Dirt eating, iron deficiency… it’s probably just a phase. I'll stop eating the clay, and I'll be fine. Can we just be done here? I have a television show I need to catch.
DOCTOR: Very well. However, Ms. Hardenburgh, I strongly recommend a blood test to check your iron levels and rule out anemia. It’s a simple procedure, and it will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. I’m ordering a Complete Blood Count, iron studies, and a basic metabolic panel. In the meantime, I would advise against continuing to consume the clay. It could be introducing harmful bacteria into your system. I'll have the lab slip ready for you. Schedule the appointment, and please, if your symptoms worsen— increased fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath— come back immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Questions? Honestly, this has been enough questions for a lifetime. Fine, I'll get the blood test. Just get me out of here. And don't expect me to come back unless I’m practically on my deathbed. I have better things to do than sit in a doctor's office all day. Now, if you'll excuse me… Where do I go to schedule this… procedure? And make it quick, please. I haven't got all day. .
