DOCTOR: Hi Dondre, welcome to the clinic. I’m Courtnee Maskal, one of the family medicine doctors here. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day to you, Doctor Maskal. It’s good to meet you too. Well, it’s… it’s my water. I’m having trouble… getting it all out, you see. Like it’s stuck. It's been going on for a bit now, maybe a week or so.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Trouble fully emptying your bladder, and it's been going on for about a week. That can be concerning, so it's good you came in to get it checked out. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. It's… uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, just… like there's still some left in there after I go. I have to… strain a bit, sometimes. And I find myself going back to the restroom shortly after I thought I was finished. It's a little embarrassing to talk about, if I’m honest.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Dondre, you're in a safe place and these things are very common. No need to be embarrassed at all; I ask these questions all the time. It's important to get all the details. So, you're saying you feel like you don't completely empty your bladder, you sometimes have to strain, and you find yourself needing to go back to the bathroom relatively soon after you’ve just been?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's exactly it. You understand. It’s… it’s more often when I’m trying to go to sleep. That's when it bothers me the most. I end up getting up a couple of times in the night. It didn't used to be like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's particularly bothersome at night, and you’re having to get up multiple times to urinate. And this is a change from how things usually are for you. Good to know. Now, have you noticed any other changes alongside this?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, I have been drinking more water than usual, I suppose. It’s been a warm summer, and I thought I just needed to stay hydrated. But maybe that’s part of it? I don’t rightly know. And… I've been a little more tired lately, but I figured that was just from getting up at night.
DOCTOR: That's helpful information, Dondre. Increased fluid intake could be contributing, and the nighttime trips definitely explain the fatigue. Before we go any further, let’s quickly go through some general health questions. Do you have any problems with diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: No, ma’am. Not that I know of. The doctor back in Anchorage always said I was healthy as a horse. My wife… bless her… she took good care of me. I have Medicare, so they check things regular. I don't recall ever being told I had any of those problems.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear. And I’m sorry to hear about your wife. It sounds like you've been well-cared for in the past, which is excellent. Okay, and have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything in the past?
PATIENT: Let me think… I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That was a long time ago. And I broke my leg once, when I was helping a friend with some fishing nets. But other than that… no, I don’t believe so. Nothing serious, anyway.
DOCTOR: Alright, appendix removed as a child and a broken leg. No other major surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, let’s talk about medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Not a one. I don’t much believe in taking pills unless I absolutely have to. I take a little fish oil now and again, for my joints, but that’s about it. My wife used to remind me about it, but… well, it’s just the fish oil.
DOCTOR: Okay, just fish oil occasionally. And no allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else, correct?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Never had an allergy in my life. Lucky, I suppose.
DOCTOR: You are indeed very lucky, Dondre. Okay, that's a good overview of your medical history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen, and I'll also do a gentle exam of your prostate, if that's alright with you. It’s standard procedure when evaluating urinary issues in men. It will give me a better idea of what might be going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Well… a prostate exam? I’ve heard stories. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then I suppose so. I trust your judgement. It’s just… not something I look forward to, if you understand.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Dondre. It’s not the most comfortable exam, but it’s important, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. It will only take a few moments. Okay, if you could lie down on the examination table, we'll get started. I'll start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Everything sounds normal there. Now, I’m just going to ask you to bend your knees and relax. Okay, all done. I didn’t feel any obvious lumps or abnormalities, but the prostate does feel a little enlarged. It's not necessarily a cause for concern at your age, but it could be contributing to your symptoms. I also noticed some mild tenderness.
PATIENT: Alright. Well, that wasn't as bad as I feared, thank you, Doctor. So, enlarged, you say? And tender? What does that mean? Is it something serious?
DOCTOR: I'm glad it wasn't too unpleasant, Dondre. An enlarged prostate is very common as men get older - it's often just part of the natural aging process. It can press on the urethra, the tube that carries urine from your bladder, making it harder to empty your bladder completely. The tenderness suggests there might be some inflammation there, which could be causing your discomfort. It doesn’t necessarily mean it's something serious, but we need to rule out other possibilities and get a clearer picture. I'd like to order a urinalysis, to check for any infection, and a PSA blood test, which can help us assess your prostate health. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, ma’am. That sounds sensible. A urinalysis and a blood test. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to feel like myself again. It’s… unsettling, not being able to trust my own body, you know?
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Dondre. It is unsettling when your body isn't behaving as it should. We'll get to the bottom of this, and hopefully, get you feeling better soon. I’m ordering those tests now. The lab is just down the hall, and they should be able to take care of you right away. They’ll need a urine sample and a small amount of blood. It usually takes a few days to get the results back. In the meantime, I recommend increasing your fluid intake during the day, but limiting fluids a couple of hours before bedtime. Also, try to avoid caffeine and alcohol, as they can irritate the bladder. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Limiting fluids before bed, that makes sense. No caffeine or alcohol either. I can manage that. Hmm… well, yes, actually. Is there anything I can do right now, to help things along? Like, any exercises or… anything? I don’t want to just sit here and wait for the tests.
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Dondre. There are a couple of things you can try. One exercise is called "stop-start." When you urinate, try stopping and starting the flow a few times. This can help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. Don't do this every time you urinate, just a couple of times a day. Another thing is to practice "double voiding." After you think you’ve finished urinating, wait a few seconds, then try to go again. This can help ensure you’ve emptied your bladder completely. Also, maintaining a regular bowel movement schedule can help, as constipation can sometimes put pressure on the bladder. However, these are just temporary measures. We need those test results to determine the best course of treatment. Do you feel comfortable with those suggestions?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I think I can manage those. Stop-start… and double voiding. And keep regular with my… business. It's… it’s good to have something to do, you know? Makes me feel less helpless. Thank you. That's a big help. When should I expect to hear back about the tests?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Dondre. I'm glad you feel a little more empowered. It’s always good to have a plan. You should hear back from the lab in about 3-5 business days. My nurse will call you with the results, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and go over the next steps. In the meantime, if you develop a fever, chills, or severe pain in your lower abdomen, please contact my office immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Do you have any other questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. I think that covers everything. Thank you kindly for your time and your patience. I feel a lot better knowing what’s going on, and having a plan. I appreciate your help, Doctor Maskal.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Dondre. I'm glad I could help. Remember, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. It was a pleasure meeting you. Have a good day, and I'll talk to you soon.
PATIENT: And you too, Doctor. A good day to you as well.
