DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Dudney. I’m Dr. Vanochten. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t have a lot of time. The blood pressure thing… my husband made me come. He worries too much. It’s probably nothing, but he read something online and now I’m here. Can we just get this over with?
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. We can certainly try to be efficient. So, your husband is concerned about your blood pressure, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. He checks it all the time. Honestly, I think he likes having something to worry about. He gets a new gadget every month to measure… everything. It’s exhausting. But, okay, fine. It’s been a little high lately, according to him. I don't feel any different.
DOCTOR: Okay. And when he says “lately,” roughly how long has he been noticing these higher readings?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. Um… maybe the last three weeks? Something like that. It's hard to say, he’s always pointing it out, you know? One day it’s fine, the next it’s not. He just keeps saying it’s “borderline” whatever. It's just… annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any symptoms yourself during those three weeks?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… what kind of symptoms? I feel normal. Headaches? No. Dizziness? No. I haven't been feeling sick or anything. Honestly, if I didn't know any better, I'd say I'm perfectly healthy. He just…obsesses.
DOCTOR: Okay. Well, let’s just get a reading now to see where things stand. It’s always good to have a baseline. And then we can talk about some other general health questions, just to be thorough. It won’t take long.
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Just… get it over with. I really don't like having my arm squeezed. And please, don't tell me a lot of complicated stuff. I don't understand that medical jargon. Simple English only.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will definitely keep it simple. And I’ll try to be as quick as possible. Just relax your arm. Okay, your blood pressure is 142 over 90.
PATIENT: 142 over… what? Is that bad? He said anything over 140 was… something. I don’t remember. Just tell me, am I going to die? Because if I'm going to die, I need to call my husband. He’ll want to know.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Dudney, let’s not jump to conclusions. 142 over 90 is considered slightly elevated – we call it Stage 1 hypertension. It doesn't mean you’re going to die, not at all. It just means we need to pay attention to it and figure out what’s going on. It’s good we caught it. Can you tell me a little about your overall health?
PATIENT: Health? What do you want to know? I work. I’m a civil engineering tech. It’s mostly office work, some time outside checking things. I eat… normal food, I guess. We try not to eat too much junk. My husband cooks most of the time. I don't exercise, not really. I don't have any… illnesses, as far as I know. I haven’t been to a doctor in years, honestly. Is this going to take much longer?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. No major illnesses, mostly office work. We'll get through this quickly. Have you ever been diagnosed with high cholesterol, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Nope. Never. My husband gets blood tests all the time, but I don’t bother. I feel fine. He tries to get me to go, but I just… don’t see the point. He's always worrying about something. Honestly, I think he likes being sick, or thinking someone else is. It gives him something to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your family?
PATIENT: My mom... she had some heart trouble when she got older. She lived to be 85, though, so it couldn't have been that bad. My dad was healthy as a horse, worked until he was 90. My husband's side… his mother has arthritis, I think. They’re all pretty healthy, actually. That’s why I don’t understand why I’m having problems. It’s probably just stress. I have a really demanding job. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of some heart trouble, but generally healthy. Stress is definitely a factor we need to consider. Now, just to be thorough, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Just the birth control pill. That's it. And I've been on it for… oh, gosh, fifteen years? Something like that. That’s all. No vitamins, no supplements, nothing. He offered me a bunch of stuff, but I told him I don’t want to be a guinea pig. He’s always reading about new things online. It’s exhausting.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the birth control pill. Okay. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, just to get a baseline. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Fine. Just… try to be quick about it. I have a lot to do today. And please, don’t tell me anything scary. I really can’t handle it right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll be as quick as possible. Just breathe normally. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. No wheezing or crackling. Blood pressure is still elevated at 144 over 92. We need to address this blood pressure.
PATIENT: Fine, address it. What do I have to do? Do I have to take pills? Because I really don't want to take pills. I heard they have side effects. And I don't want to be one of those people who has to go to the doctor all the time. Just… tell me what I need to do to make it go away. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, we’re going to try some lifestyle changes. This is often enough to get blood pressure under control, especially when it's newly elevated. That means reducing salt intake, regular exercise – even just 30 minutes of walking most days of the week – and managing stress. We can also look at your diet overall. I also want to order some blood work to rule out any underlying causes. And I'd like you to monitor your blood pressure at home for a week. I can give you a list of reliable monitors. We’ll discuss the results in a week and see how you’re doing with the lifestyle changes. If those aren't enough, then we'll talk about medication. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Lifestyle changes. That sounds… annoying. But, okay. I guess I can try. But I'm not promising anything. And I really don't want to have to buy another gadget. My house is already full of them. And what kind of blood work are we talking about? Do I have to fast? Because I hate fasting. And can you just give me a simple list of what I need to do? No complicated stuff. My husband will just get excited and make me do everything he reads about online. .
DOCTOR: Okay, I'll keep it simple. The blood work is just a basic metabolic panel and a lipid panel – it checks your kidney function, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. You will need to fast for 12 hours before the test – no food or drinks except water. I’ll give you a sheet with specific instructions. For the lifestyle changes, I recommend cutting back on processed foods, reducing your sodium intake to less than 2300 milligrams per day, and aiming for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise most days of the week. I want you to focus on those three things for now. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today to review the results and discuss your progress. Do you have any questions?
