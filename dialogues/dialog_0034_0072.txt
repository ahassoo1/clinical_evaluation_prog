DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Heidenthal. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Seil. It’s good to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, honestly… my memory hasn’t been the best lately. It’s a little scary, to be frank. I just… forget things. Little things, mostly, but it’s happening more and more.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's certainly concerning when you notice changes in your memory, and it’s good you’re addressing it. “Little things” can be important, and it’s wise to get it checked out. To help me understand what’s going on, could you tell me a bit more about these instances of forgetting?
PATIENT: Hmm… where to start? Okay, like… I’ll go into a room and completely forget why I went in there. Or I’ll be talking to someone and lose my train of thought mid-sentence. Sometimes I have trouble remembering names, even people I’ve known for a while. It’s not every time, but it’s frequent enough that it’s worrying me. And I feel like I have to really concentrate to remember things now, which I didn’t used to.
DOCTOR: Thank you. That’s helpful. So, forgetting the reason you entered a room, losing your train of thought, and difficulty recalling names – all requiring more effort than before. Could you tell me approximately when you first started noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly… I’d say maybe six months ago? It was gradual at first, just little things here and there. But the last three months, it’s definitely gotten more noticeable. I thought it was just stress, to be honest. Work has been… busy. But it doesn’t seem to be getting better with less stress, which is why I decided to come in.
DOCTOR: Okay, so approximately six months ago, with a noticeable increase in the last three months. You initially attributed it to stress, but it hasn’t improved with reduced stress levels. Now, are these memory issues impacting your daily life – things like managing finances, taking medications, or keeping appointments?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. It’s… embarrassing to admit. I almost forgot to pay a bill last month and had a late fee. And I’ve definitely had to set more alarms on my phone just to remember appointments. I haven’t mixed up medications yet, but I'm getting worried about that possibility. It's little things, but they feel… significant. I used to be so organized.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern. It’s good you're aware of these changes and taking steps to address them. Forgetting bills and needing more reminders are definitely things we need to investigate. Let’s move on to some other questions, if you don’t mind. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the memory issues, such as changes in your mood, personality, or sleep patterns?
PATIENT: Hmm… Let me think. My sleep hasn’t been great, actually. I wake up a lot during the night, and sometimes I have trouble falling asleep in the first place. I wouldn’t say my personality has changed, but… I’ve been more easily irritated, maybe? My friends have commented on it. I just chalked it up to being tired, but now I wonder if it’s related. My mood is generally okay, though. I wouldn't say I'm depressed or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, so disrupted sleep and some increased irritability. That’s good to know. Now, in terms of your medical history, do you have any existing medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure a few years ago, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for a long time now. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy, I think. I see my general practitioner for checkups annually. I don’t have any major illnesses or anything like that. I take the blood pressure medication, and a multivitamin, that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Good. Well-controlled hypertension is important to note. And just a multivitamin. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant?
PATIENT: Let me see… I had my appendix out when I was a teenager, that’s about it. No other surgeries. And no hospital stays since then, thankfully. It was pretty routine, a long time ago. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy in adolescence. No other surgeries or hospitalizations. Now, thinking about your family – is there a family history of memory loss, dementia, or Alzheimer’s disease?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, had… well, we didn’t really know what it was. She just became very confused towards the end of her life. The doctors said something about her brain, but we never got a clear diagnosis. It was a long time ago, and things weren’t as sophisticated then. My mother always said it was “old age,” but… maybe it was something more. My father’s side of the family seems pretty healthy, as far as I know. No one that I remember having similar issues.
DOCTOR: Okay, a grandmother with unspecified cognitive decline. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. I don't smoke. I very rarely drink alcohol – maybe a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. And I definitely don't use any recreational drugs. I try to stay healthy. I eat a reasonably good diet and try to get some exercise when I can. Work keeps me busy, though, so it’s not always easy.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Okay, to get a better understanding of your current cognitive function, I’d like to perform a brief cognitive assessment. It will involve some simple questions and tasks, just to assess your memory, attention, and language skills. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. I understand. Whatever you think is best. I’m a little nervous, but I’m willing to do whatever it takes to figure out what’s going on. Let’s get started.
DOCTOR: Excellent. It’s a very straightforward assessment, nothing to be worried about. First, I'm going to ask you to recall three words. Please listen carefully, and I'll ask you to remember them for later. The words are: apple, table, and penny. Can you repeat those back to me to confirm you heard them correctly?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. Apple, table, and penny. Those are the words.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, I'm going to ask you some questions about your current day. What day of the week is it today?
PATIENT: Oh dear… um… is it Friday? No… wait. It’s August 2nd, so… it must be Thursday. August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? I’m terrible with days of the week.
DOCTOR: That is correct, it is Thursday, August 2nd, 2025. And where are we right now?
PATIENT: Oh! In the doctor’s office. Dr. Seil’s office, in the… suburban clinic. Is that enough detail? I know it's probably obvious. Sorry, I'm already feeling flustered.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly sufficient. Don't apologize; these questions are just to get a baseline. Now, let's test your short-term memory again. I'm going to ask you to perform a simple calculation. Subtract 7 from 100, and then subtract 7 again from that result. Take your time.
PATIENT: Okay… let me see. 100 minus 7 is 93. And 93 minus 7 is… 86. I think it’s 86. Is that correct? I’m really trying to concentrate.
DOCTOR: That is correct, 86. Good. Now, I’m going to ask you to recall those three words I asked you to remember earlier: apple, table, and penny. Can you tell me what those words were?
PATIENT: Oh… oh dear. Um… apple… and… I’m blanking. Table? No… I just… I can’t remember the third word. This is awful. I knew I was forgetting things, but this is… worse than I thought. I think… I think it was penny? Maybe? I’m so sorry.
DOCTOR: It's alright, Ms. Heidenthal. Please don’t apologize. This assessment is simply a tool to help me understand what’s going on. You remembered apple and table correctly, and a partial recall of penny is not uncommon. Based on this brief assessment, and the information you’ve provided, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. Your symptoms – memory loss, sleep disturbances, and irritability – could be related to stress, as you initially suspected, but given the progression and your partial recall on the assessment, further investigation is warranted. I would like to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid problems. Additionally, I’d like to discuss the possibility of a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best. Blood work and a neurologist… okay. It’s a little scary, but I want to know what’s happening. I just want to get to the bottom of this. So, yes, please. Let’s do both.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll have the lab order sent to the front desk, and they can schedule that for you at your convenience. As for the neurologist, I have a few colleagues I can recommend. I’ll provide you with a list of their names and contact information. In the meantime, I want to emphasize the importance of getting adequate sleep and managing stress levels. While we don’t know the cause yet, these measures can be beneficial regardless. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I think… I think that covers everything for now. You’ve been very thorough, Doctor. Thank you. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I’m still worried, of course, but I feel a little better knowing we’re taking steps to figure this out. Is there anything I should be doing to prepare for the neurologist appointment? Like, should I be keeping a journal or anything?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. It's completely understandable to be worried, and I want to assure you we'll work through this together. Regarding preparation for the neurologist appointment, keeping a journal is an excellent idea. Note down any instances of memory loss, confusion, or other cognitive changes you experience – the date, time, and specific details. Also, make a list of all your medications, including dosages, and any relevant medical history. It can also be helpful to have a family member or friend accompany you to the appointment, as they may be able to provide additional insights. I'll also provide you with a summary of our conversation today to share with the neurologist. Before you leave, do you have any limitations or restrictions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I can walk okay, I don't need any assistance. I can hear and see fine, I think. No allergies I'm aware of, and I'm not pregnant. Just… forgetful. But otherwise, I'm fine. Really. Thank you again, Doctor Seil. I feel much better knowing there's a plan.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Heidenthal. I'm glad I could provide some reassurance. Don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the lab order and schedule your follow-up. Take care, and I look forward to discussing the results with you. .
