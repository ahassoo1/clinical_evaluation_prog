DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome. I’m Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thank you for seeing me. My back... it’s been really bad. Hurts all the time, now. Worse than before.
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain. And you say it’s worse than before… Hmm. Just to get a better picture, can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well... it started a few months ago, just a little ache. I thought I just slept wrong, you know? But it didn't go away. Now… now it's sharp, like a knife sometimes. And it goes down my leg, both legs even. Makes it hard to walk. I didn't think much of it at first… but then I remembered… about the… you know… the cancer.
DOCTOR: Cancer… Right. Okay. We'll definitely get to the bottom of all this. Just to be clear, are you referring to a history of cancer in yourself, or a family history?
PATIENT: Oh. Me. It was… a few years back. They said it was in my… the breast, I think? Had surgery, and… treatments. Everything seemed okay after. They said it was gone. But… now this back pain. I'm scared it's… come back.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of breast cancer treated a few years ago. That’s important to know. It's understandable why you'd be concerned about a recurrence with new pain. Let's try and figure out what’s going on. Can you describe exactly where the pain is located?
PATIENT: It’s… low, in my back. Right across here. And it feels like it goes… right down the back of both legs, all the way to my feet sometimes. Not all the time, just when it’s really bad. It’s worse when I stand for too long, or… try to lift things. Even bending over is hard. Everything is hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, low back pain radiating down both legs, worse with standing, lifting and bending. Do you experience any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Hmm... sometimes my feet feel… kinda numb. Not all the time, like the pain. More when I’m walking, or when I try to stand on my toes. It's not… a bad numb, just… not there, you know? And… my legs feel kinda weak sometimes too, especially after I’ve been walking for a bit. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Numbness and weakness in the legs, associated with walking. Alright. I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to check your reflexes, strength, and see how things are moving. Will that work?
PATIENT: Yes, that's okay. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. I hope it's not… the cancer again.
DOCTOR: We'll do our best to figure it out, Ms. Meigs. Alright, if you could just lie down on your stomach on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Okay. This way?
DOCTOR: Yes, right there. And I’ll need you to bend over and touch your toes, if you’re able. We'll start there.
PATIENT: Okay... Oh... that hurts. A lot. Can I... stop?
DOCTOR: Yes, absolutely. Stop right there. Don’t push yourself. Okay, that gives me some information already. I’m going to gently feel along your spine and the muscles in your back. I'll also check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Please let me know if anything is particularly painful. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Right there. That hurts. A lot. It’s… really tender. Everything feels kinda sore, but that spot… that’s the worst.
DOCTOR: Okay, significant tenderness in the lumbar region. Your reflexes are… a bit diminished, actually, in both legs. And now I’m going to check your strength. Can you lift your right leg straight up while I hold it down?
PATIENT: Okay. This is… harder than it used to be. It feels… weak. Really weak. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's… something we need to investigate further. And now let’s try the left leg. Similar on the left side. Alright, Ms. Meigs, based on what I’m seeing and hearing, it seems like you may have some nerve compression in your lower back. This is often called sciatica, but we need to determine the cause of the compression. Given your history of breast cancer, we'll also want to rule out any potential spread to the spine, even though that’s not necessarily the most likely scenario. I'm going to order an MRI of your lower back, and possibly some blood work. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: MRI... and blood work? Yes… if that’s what you think is best. I want to know what’s going on, so… yes. Will the MRI… show if the cancer has… spread? I’m scared.
DOCTOR: It can show if there's anything there, yes. But remember, a lot of things can cause these symptoms, and it doesn't automatically mean the cancer has spread. It's just a tool to give us more information. The blood work will help rule out any other potential causes, like inflammation. I’m going to have my nurse schedule the MRI for you. It’s a pretty quick scan, and shouldn't be painful. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you some muscle relaxers and an anti-inflammatory to help manage the pain. It's important to avoid any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. We'll get these results back as quickly as possible and discuss them thoroughly. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Okay... muscle relaxers and anti-inflammatory... and no lifting. Will the nurse call me to schedule it? And... how long does it usually take to get the results back from the MRI? And... is it okay if I just… take it easy for now? I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: Yes, the nurse will call you to schedule the MRI. It usually takes a few days to get the results back, but I’ll have them expedite it as much as possible. And absolutely, taking it easy is exactly what you should be doing right now. Rest, avoid any activities that aggravate the pain, and focus on getting comfortable. I'm also going to write you a work note excusing you from any strenuous duties. We’ll take it one step at a time, Ms. Meigs. We’ll get to the bottom of this, and we’ll get you feeling better. Do you have any other questions or concerns I can address before you leave?
PATIENT: No... I think that's everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. You've… made me feel a little bit better just talking to you. I appreciate you taking the time.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. That’s my job, and I’m glad I could ease your mind a bit. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns at all. My nurse will be in touch shortly to schedule that MRI. Get some rest, and we’ll talk soon.
