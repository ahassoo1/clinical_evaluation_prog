DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Popova. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an Internal Medicine physician here at the clinic. It’s nice to meet you. To start, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning to you too, Doctor. Please, call me Aldine. Well, it’s this headache I’ve been gettin’. Right at the back of my head, you know? Been botherin’ me for a bit now. Not constant, comes and goes, but when it does come…oof. It’s a proper nuisance.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Aldine. It's good to meet you as well. I understand you've been experiencing headaches at the back of your head. Could you tell me a little more about them?
PATIENT: Sure thing. Well, like I said, they’re at the back. Feels like…a tight band, kinda. Not a throbbing pain, more of a dull ache. Sometimes it spreads down my neck a little, makes it stiff. It usually starts in the mornin', but not every mornin’. And it doesn’t usually last all day. Maybe a few hours, then it eases off. I haven't noticed anything specific that makes it worse or better, to be honest. Just…comes and goes. I do spend a lot of time leanin’ over folks’ hands at work, though, bein’ a manicurist, you know? Maybe that’s got somethin’ to do with it?
DOCTOR: That's helpful, Aldine. A tight band sensation at the back of your head, sometimes spreading to your neck, mostly in the mornings and lasting a few hours…and you're a manicurist, spending a lot of time leaning over hands. We’ll definitely keep that in mind. To get a better understanding, could you rate the pain on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable?
PATIENT: Hmm, a scale, you say? Alright, let me think. It’s never been a real awful pain, not like a migraine or anything. Usually, it’s around a…maybe a 3 or 4? On a bad day, when it's really stickin' around, it might get to a 6. But mostly, it’s just annoying, not debilitating. I can still work, still do things, but it’s always there, kinda. It doesn’t make me wanna lie down and shut everything out, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, Aldine. A 3 to 6, typically, and not debilitating – that’s good to know. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms along with the headaches?
PATIENT: Let me see…other symptoms. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. No blurry vision, no nausea or dizziness. No fever or anything like that. I haven't been feelin’ sick, just…the headache. Sometimes, my neck feels a little bit stiff, like I said, but that could just be from bendin’ over so much. And…well, I’ve been a little bit more tired lately, but I’m 87, Doctor! I figure a bit of tiredness comes with the territory, eh? I’ve not been sleepin’ badly, just…not as much energy as I used to have. Nothing drastic.
DOCTOR: That's understandable, Aldine. No nausea, dizziness, fever, or vision changes, just the headache and some mild fatigue. It’s good you’re aware of your energy levels and recognize that some fatigue is common with age. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Well now, let me think. My wife, bless her soul, she always kept track of these things. I see the doctor for check-ups every year, and he always tells me my blood pressure is a little bit high, but he says it’s nothin’ to worry about too much if I watch my salt. Other than that…arthritis, maybe? In my hands, mostly. Makes it a little bit hard to grip things sometimes, but I manage. I haven't been told I have diabetes, never had any serious illnesses, nothin' like that. Just the usual aches and pains of gettin’ older, really. I did have a bad fall a few years back, broke my wrist, but that's healed up nicely. Oh, and cataracts, but I had surgery for those a while ago, so my vision is pretty good now. I think that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Aldine. So, you've been told you have slightly elevated blood pressure, some arthritis in your hands, a previous wrist fracture that healed well, and you had cataract surgery. That’s good information. Now, could you tell me about any medications you're currently taking, including any over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Right. Let me see... I take a small pill every day for my blood pressure, the doctor prescribed it. Amlodipine, I think it's called? Just the one, a little white one. And sometimes, when my hands are really achin’, I take ibuprofen, the regular kind you get at the drugstore. Not every day, only when I need it. And...oh, I take a vitamin D supplement. My wife always said I wasn't gettin' enough sunshine, and she swore by vitamin D. That’s about it, really. No fancy pills or nothin’. I try to avoid takin’ too much medicine if I can help it.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take amlodipine for your blood pressure, ibuprofen as needed for hand pain, and a vitamin D supplement. That’s good to know. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm... allergies. Not that I'm aware of, no. Never had a bad reaction to anythin’, not that I can remember. No trouble with penicillin, no skin rashes, no trouble breathin’. I eat pretty much anything, I’ve never been a fussy eater. My wife tried to get me to eat more vegetables, but that's a different story! But no, no allergies that I know of. I don’t wear any fancy perfumes or nothin’, so I haven’t had any reactions to those either. Pretty straightforward, really.
DOCTOR: Good, no known allergies. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Never touched a cigarette in my life. My father smoked, and he always coughed somethin’ awful. Put me off 'em right away. My wife didn’t smoke either, thank goodness. Always said it was a terrible habit. So, no, never smoked a day in my life, and I don’t go near folks who do if I can help it. It smells awful, too.
DOCTOR: That's excellent, Aldine. Never smoked. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, a little bit. I enjoy a small glass of red wine with my dinner sometimes. Just one, mind you. Doctor says it’s good for the heart, in moderation. My wife used to enjoy a glass with me, but…well, never mind. But just a small glass of wine, that’s all. I don’t go drinkin’ heavily or nothin’ like that. Never been much of a drinker, really. Just a little somethin' to relax with in the evenin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, a small glass of red wine occasionally. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your work?
PATIENT: Certainly. Well, like I said, I'm a manicurist. Been doin’ it for…oh, goodness, nearly 50 years now! Started right after I came over from Jamaica. It's a good job, I enjoy it. Meetin' all sorts of people, keepin' their hands lookin' nice. It can be hard on my hands, bendin' over for hours, that’s why I get a bit of ache sometimes. And my neck. But I'm used to it, I suppose. I work at a small salon downtown, with a couple of other ladies. It keeps me busy, keeps me out of trouble. I’ve built up a good clientele over the years, so I'm lucky, really. I don’t know what I’d do if I had to stop.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you've been a manicurist for nearly 50 years. That’s a long and active career! Alright, Aldine, thank you for sharing all of this information with me. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that's fine. Go right ahead. I don't mind a bit of pokin’ and proddin’ if it helps. I'm used to folks touchin’ my hands all the time, bein’ a manicurist and all! Just let me know if somethin’ hurts, eh?
DOCTOR: Certainly. I will. Your blood pressure is 142/88. That's a little elevated, but not significantly different from what you've told me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. I'm feeling some mild tenderness in the muscles at the base of your neck, and a bit of stiffness. And your range of motion is slightly limited, particularly when looking to the left. Your hands have some mild swelling in the joints, and I can see some slight bony prominence consistent with arthritis. I'm also noticing some mild redness around the knuckles. Reflexes are normal and sensation is intact. Overall, the exam findings are consistent with some mild arthritis in your hands and some muscle tension in your neck. The elevated blood pressure is something we’ll need to monitor.
PATIENT: That…doesn’t surprise me a bit, Doctor. My hands do ache sometimes, especially when it's cold. And my neck gets stiff after a long day at work. It's good to know you’ve confirmed it, though. Makes me feel less like I’m makin’ it all up in my head! About the blood pressure… is that somethin' serious? Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: It's good to know that the findings align with your experience, Aldine. It's never a bad thing to have your concerns validated. Regarding your blood pressure, it's elevated, but not drastically so. It’s something we need to monitor and manage, but it doesn’t necessarily mean you need to be overly worried right now. Prolonged high blood pressure can lead to more serious issues like heart disease or stroke, but we can often manage it with lifestyle changes and, if needed, medication. Given your age and medical history, I would like to order some blood work to get a more comprehensive picture of your overall health. We’ll check your kidney function, cholesterol levels, and a complete blood count. I also recommend we repeat your blood pressure reading over the next few weeks to see if it’s consistently elevated. In the meantime, I recommend you continue to monitor your blood pressure at home if possible. Also, focus on maintaining a healthy diet, low in salt, and getting regular exercise, even if it’s just a gentle walk each day. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: That…sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work, checkin’ it at home, watchin’ the salt…I can manage that. I’ve got a friend who’s got one of those blood pressure machines, I can borrow it from her. And I do try to eat healthy, although my wife always made better food than I do. I walk to work most days, that's good exercise, isn't it? What about the headache, though? You didn’t say much about that. Do you think it’s related to my neck tension? Is there anything I can do about it now? I don’t want to be takin’ a load of pills, if I can help it. Perhaps a cream or somethin’?
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Aldine. Walking to work is wonderful exercise, and borrowing a blood pressure machine is a great idea. Regarding your headache, it's very likely related to the muscle tension in your neck. Headaches caused by tension are very common, and often respond well to conservative treatment. Since you're keen to avoid medication, I recommend trying some simple things first. Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, which you already take occasionally, can help manage the pain when it flares up. You can also try applying a warm compress or heating pad to your neck and shoulders for 15-20 minutes at a time. Gentle stretching exercises for your neck can also be helpful. I can show you a few simple exercises to do at home. If the headache persists or worsens despite these measures, we can consider other options, such as physical therapy or, as a last resort, prescription muscle relaxants. But let's try these simpler approaches first and see if they provide relief. Would you like me to demonstrate some of those neck stretches for you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that would be very kind. Some stretches would be wonderful. I’m always up for tryin’ somethin’ before I start takin’ a load of pills. And thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. You’ve put my mind at ease a bit. Perhaps we should get started with those stretches, then? And you’ll let me know when the blood work results are back, won’t you?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Aldine. I'm glad I could reassure you. "First, gently tilt your head to the right, bringing your ear towards your shoulder. Hold for 15-30 seconds, and then repeat on the left side. Do this a few times on each side. Second, gently rotate your head to the right, looking over your shoulder as far as comfortable. Hold for 15-30 seconds, and then repeat on the left side. And finally, gently tuck your chin towards your chest, feeling a stretch in the back of your neck. Hold for 15-30 seconds." "Remember to move slowly and gently, and stop if you feel any pain. You can do these stretches several times a day." "And yes, I will absolutely let you know as soon as your blood work results are back. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and create a plan for managing your blood pressure and headache. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That’s wonderful, Doctor. Thank you. I think I’ve got those stretches sorted. I’ll be sure to do them a few times a day, as you said. And yes, a follow-up appointment sounds perfect. I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything so clearly. I feel much better now, knowin’ we’ve got a plan. I suppose I should be gettin’ home now? My wife will be wonderin’ where I am.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Aldine. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. You take care now, and give your wife my best. I look forward to seeing you again soon.
