DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Benic. I’m Dr. Sham. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Och, good morning to ye too, Doctor. It's this nausea, see? Been happenin' most mornings now, for a few weeks. It's not a proper sick feeling, more like... a queasy churnin' in me stomach. And it seems to be gettin’ a wee bit worse, if I'm honest. They told me to come in 'cause o' me heart, ye ken?
DOCTOR: Right, nausea… for a few weeks, worsening. And you mentioned something about being seen for your heart previously?
PATIENT: Aye, that's right. I've got a bit o' heart failure, the doctor told me. Been seein' someone for it for a couple o' years now. They do their best, but it's not exactly curable, is it? This mornin' sickness just... doesn't seem to fit with the usual stuff. It's usually more like feelin' tired, or me ankles swellin' up. Not this turnin' o' me stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart failure for a couple of years. And this nausea is new, different from your typical symptoms of fatigue and swelling. Hmm. Do you have any other symptoms along with the nausea?
PATIENT: Aye, let me think... Well, I've been a bit breathless lately, maybe a wee bit more than usual. And I've not been keepin' me food down as well as I used to, though I put that down to just not havin' much o' an appetite with the queasiness. It's hard to tell what's causin' what, ye ken? Sometimes I just feel generally a bit weak, but that's been happenin' on and off for ages, too. It's a right bother sortin' it all oot.
DOCTOR: Breathlessness, difficulty keeping food down… and general weakness. You're right, it is difficult to sort out. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Och, now that's a question! Let me see... No, not really. They've been... regular enough, if ye ken what I mean. No different than usual, thankfully. I've enough bother with the rest o' it without worryin' about that bein' off, too! Is that important, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Yes, it's good to know. Now, are you taking any medications for your heart failure, or anything else?
PATIENT: Aye, I am. Let me think... I'm on Lisinopril, that's for me blood pressure, but also helps the heart, they said. And I take Furosemide, a water tablet, to get rid o' the swellin'. Oh, and I take Digoxin, that's to help me heart beat properly. I think that's all o' it. I get a wee bit muddled sometimes rememberin' which pill does what, to be honest. I get them all in a wee box from the chemist, and I try to take 'em at the same time every day.
DOCTOR: Right, Lisinopril, Furosemide, and Digoxin. Okay. And are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know o'. I've had plenty o' pills in me time, and never had a reaction. I’ve had a bit o’ a rash now and again, but nothin' serious. I'm usually pretty good at knowin’ when somethin’ doesn't agree with me, if ye ken? I've got sensitive skin, but that's more topical, if ye follow. I've never had to go to hospital for an allergy, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk a bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Och, no, not anymore. I used to, years ago, when I was a young lad. But I gave it up a good twenty years ago now. Best thing I ever did, that was. My lungs were rattlin' like an old engine, so the doctor convinced me to stop. It was hard, mind ye, but worth it in the end. I used to enjoy a wee dram now and again, but I don't even do that much these days. Too much bother with the heart, ye ken.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, limited alcohol. And how about your diet?
PATIENT: Och, it's not the best, I'll be honest. I try to eat healthy, but I'm a bit o' a creature o' habit. I like a good hearty breakfast, usually porridge with a bit o' fruit. And I like a good piece o' fish and chips now and then, though I know I shouldn't. I try to avoid too much salt, 'cause o' the heart, but it's hard sometimes. I don't eat a lot o' red meat, mostly chicken and fish. I used to grow me own vegetables, but me back's not been the best lately, so I don't bother much with that anymore. It's a right struggle keepin' it all in order.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, before we do a quick examination, I’m going to ask about your family history. Has anyone in your family had heart problems?
PATIENT: Och, aye. Me father had a bad heart, he did. He was a strong man, workin' on the docks all his life, but it finally gave out on him when he was in his seventies. Me mother, she had high blood pressure, but she lived to be eighty-five, so she did alright. And me sister, she's got a bit o' an irregular heartbeat, but it's nothin' too serious, as far as I know. There's been a bit o' diabetes on me mother's side o' the family, but nothin' close on me side. Is that what ye were lookin' for, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and check your abdomen. Just lie back on the examination table, please. I'll need you to take your shirt off, and I'll give you a gown.
PATIENT: Och, right ye are. No bother at all. I'm used to bein' poked and prodded, mind ye, with the heart and all. Just let me know if ye need me to do anythin', Doctor. I'm ready when ye are.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart sounds… a bit irregular, as you might expect with the heart failure. I can hear some crackling in your lungs, which suggests some fluid build-up. Your abdomen is soft, but a little tender in the lower quadrants. No obvious masses or distention. Blood pressure is 140/90, pulse is 88 and irregular. Now, I'm going to check your ankles for swelling. You have some mild swelling in your ankles, as expected. Alright. That’s all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Right ye are. It's no surprise about the ankles, mind ye. They've been a bit puffy on and off for years. It's good ye checked, though. So, what do ye think it is, Doctor? Is it just the heart gettin' worse, or is it somethin' else causin' this mornin' sickness?
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Benic, based on what you've told me and the examination, it could be a worsening of your heart failure. The nausea, breathlessness and fluid build-up could all be explained by that. However, the nausea is a bit atypical, and given your age, we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order some blood tests – a complete blood count, kidney function, liver function, and electrolytes. I’m also going to order an ECG to get a better look at your heart rhythm. Finally, I want to check a BNP level – that's a blood test that helps us assess the level of heart strain. Do you have any concerns about blood tests?
PATIENT: Och, no, not really. I've had plenty o' blood taken in me time, mind ye. It's just a wee prick, isn't it? As long as it gets to the bottom o' this, I don't mind a bit o' discomfort. So, what will these tests tell ye, exactly? Will they show if it is the heart, or somethin' else entirely? And how long will it take to get the results? I'm not one for waitin' around if I can help it, mind ye.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will give us a clearer picture of how your kidneys and liver are functioning, and help rule out other causes of nausea. The BNP will specifically tell us how much your heart is being stretched and strained. The ECG will help me assess the heart rhythm better, and potentially pick up any new abnormalities. The results should be back within a couple of days, usually 48 to 72 hours. Once I have those, I’ll give you a call to discuss them. In the meantime, I recommend you stick to a low-salt diet, and monitor your weight daily. If you notice any significant weight gain, or increased shortness of breath, please come back immediately. Also, if the nausea becomes severe, or you're unable to keep any fluids down, seek medical attention. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Och, aye, that sounds sensible enough, Doctor. Low salt, watch me weight, and come back if it gets worse. I can manage that. I'll keep an eye on it, and I'll give ye a ring if there's any trouble. And ye'll give me a ring when the tests are back, ye said? Right, well, I suppose that's all for today then? I appreciate ye takin' the time to sort this oot, Doctor. It puts me mind at ease a wee bit, knowin' ye're lookin' into it.
DOCTOR: Yes, I’ll give you a call as soon as the results are back. And yes, that’s all for today, Mr. Benic. I’ve sent the lab requests electronically, so you should be able to go directly to the lab at your convenience. Here's a copy of the requests for your records. If you have any questions before I call, don't hesitate to ring the clinic. Get well soon.
