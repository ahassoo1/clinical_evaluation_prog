DOCTOR: Hi Mr. Drahota, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… difficult to explain. My skin, it’s darkening. And I tire so easily these days. It's quite bothersome, frankly. I haven't much time for this, you understand. I have… commitments.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Darkening skin and fatigue...that is something we should look into. When did you first notice the skin changes, Mr. Drahota?
PATIENT: Honestly? It was… some time ago. Weeks, perhaps months. Time blurs, you know. I simply noticed it one day when I was… preparing materials. It wasn't sudden, not like a rash. More… a gradual dulling of the complexion. A rather unpleasant shade, if I may say so. It's… worrying. Though, I doubt it's anything serious. It’s probably just the sun. I work outdoors, you see.
DOCTOR: Right, gradual onset…and you do spend time outside. Okay. And where on your body are you noticing this darkening?
PATIENT: Oh, everywhere, really. My hands, mostly. And my arms, I suppose. Perhaps my face a bit. It’s difficult to say precisely. I don't spend a great deal of time examining myself, Doctor. I have more… important matters to attend to. Is this going to be a lengthy process? Because my wife is expecting me shortly.
DOCTOR: Okay, “everywhere”, but mostly hands and arms… I understand you’re pressed for time, Mr. Drahota. Let me just do a quick exam, just to get a better sense of things. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A quick exam. Yes, alright. But do be swift about it. I’ve little patience for prolonged… scrutiny. And please, be gentle. My hands are… essential to my work. One can’t reinforce iron with damaged hands, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I’m just going to take a look at your hands, then listen to your heart and lungs, and quickly check your vital signs. Okay, your blood pressure is a little low, 108/62, and your pulse is 68, regular. Your lungs sound clear. Now, looking at your hands, I notice some hyperpigmentation, that’s the darkening of the skin. Is there any pain, itching, or blistering associated with it?
PATIENT: Hyperpigmentation? Is that… serious? And no, no pain, no itching. Just… discoloration. It’s unsightly, really. A perfectly good complexion, ruined. Low blood pressure, you say? Perhaps it's the heat. It's been dreadfully warm these past few weeks. Honestly, Doctor, I fail to see what all this examination is accomplishing. Are you quite finished? I’m beginning to feel rather faint. Though, I suppose that could be the heat as well.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or itching, just discoloration. I understand your concern. Low blood pressure can be from the heat, but it's worth investigating. Given the darkening of the skin and the low blood pressure, I'd like to run a few blood tests just to rule out a few possibilities. Things like iron levels, kidney function, and a complete blood count. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Really, Doctor? Must we? I detest needles. And I haven't the time for endless waiting for results. Can’t you simply… prescribe something? A cream, perhaps? Or a tonic? Anything to avoid this… ordeal. Honestly, the younger generation and their reliance on these… invasive procedures. I managed perfectly well for eighty-five years without a blood test. Fine. But do make it quick. And tell the technician to use a small needle. A very small needle.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, Mr. Drahota, and I assure you we'll make it as quick and comfortable as possible. A small needle, certainly. The tests will help us understand what's causing the skin changes and fatigue, and rule out anything serious. Here you go. Please take this to the lab just down the hall. They’ll draw a small amount of blood. It should only take about 15-20 minutes. While you're waiting, I'll see if I can get a preliminary note to your wife explaining a slight delay. Is there anything else you’d like me to note for her?
PATIENT: A preliminary note? Good. Tell her I am… occupied with important matters. And that I may be slightly delayed. That will suffice. I'd prefer not to burden her with the details of this… inconvenience. Honestly, Doctor, the younger generation and their obsession with… documentation. Very well. I shall go. But do hurry things along. I have… commitments. And tell the technician… a very small needle. I cannot stress that enough. .
DOCTOR: Okay. Lab results will be back in a few days. I'll follow up with a phone call as soon as I have them.
