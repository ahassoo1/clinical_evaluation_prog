DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Parascandola, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor Billman. It’s this foot, see? It’s been swelling up something fierce the last few days. Mostly just this one, the left one. It hurts when I walk on it, not all the time, but enough to notice. It just… puffed up, like someone blew air into my shoe.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Puffed up, you say?
PATIENT: Yeah, puffed up. Like a balloon, almost. Not bright red or anything, just… bigger than it should be. And kinda warm, if that makes sense. I noticed it first after work, Tuesday, I think. I work down at the First State Loan office, mostly paperwork, sitting all day. But even sitting, it feels it, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, sitting all day… and it started Tuesday. Warm to the touch, you said?
PATIENT: Yep, warm. Not burning, just… not cold like my other foot. And no, I didn't bump it or anything. I’d remember that. I'm pretty careful, usually. I haven't been able to wear my good shoes, either. Only these old sneakers now.
DOCTOR: Right. No injury that you recall. And you haven't noticed any changes in skin color, just swelling and warmth… okay. Have you had anything like this happen before?
PATIENT: Not exactly like this, no. I had a sprain, years ago, when I was… oh, maybe twenty? Playing soccer with some friends. But that was different. This doesn't feel like a sprain. That was a sharp pain, you know? This is more of a… dull ache, and the swelling is what's bothering me most. It just feels… off.
DOCTOR: Alright, dull ache, not sharp. And primarily the swelling. Do you have any other medical problems that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really. I get a little heartburn sometimes, but nothing a little antacid can't fix. And my blood pressure, the doctor at the free clinic said it was a little high a few years back, but I haven't been back since. They told me to watch my salt, but honestly, I forget sometimes. I don't have diabetes or anything serious, if that’s what you’re asking. No big surgeries or anything like that. Just… getting old, I guess.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little heartburn, slightly elevated blood pressure in the past… Okay. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. I try to avoid them if I can. That antacid is the only thing, and that's only when I eat something spicy. I mostly just drink water, and try to get enough sleep, but with the noise in the neighborhood... sometimes that’s hard.
DOCTOR: And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I've eaten all sorts of things in my life, traveled a bit… never had a reaction. My wife, God rest her soul, she was the one with the allergies. Peanuts, mostly. But I’m clear. No hives, no itching, nothing.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Okay. Let's take a look at this foot. Could you please take off your shoe and sock?
PATIENT: Sure, no problem. There it is. Not pretty, is it?
DOCTOR: Hmm. No visible breaks in the skin, which is good. It is warm to the touch, and tender right here… and here. Any pain when I move your foot like this?
PATIENT: Ooh, yeah, that's a little sore. Not a sharp pain, like I said, but it’s definitely uncomfortable. It feels… stretched, maybe? Like something inside is pulling. And it’s a little hard to move it all the way up and down, you know? Like it’s… stiff. Not locked up, but… not smooth.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion, some stiffness. I’m going to feel along the bones to see if anything feels out of place. Just let me know if this is too painful. Does that hurt anywhere specifically?
PATIENT: That’s okay, that’s okay. A little tender right here. Not a sharp pain, more of a… dull ache, like a bruise. And maybe… right along the top of the foot, where the bones meet. It's not awful, doctor, but it’s definitely something. Like you said, a dull ache. I can handle it, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Parascandola. Based on what you've told me and the examination, it sounds like you likely have a sprain or strain of the ankle, possibly with some mild inflammation. The tenderness along the bones is concerning, though, so we need to rule out a fracture. Do you have any insurance?
PATIENT: Oh, no insurance, I'm afraid. Never could afford it, even when I was working full time. That’s why I try to avoid the doctor when I can, honestly. A sprain, you say? Like I did when I was young? What does that mean, doctor? Will I need a cast or something? And how long will it take to get better? It’s hard to get around like this, and I still need to work, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, no insurance. We can work with that. A sprain is an injury to the ligaments – the tissues that hold the bones together. It sounds like yours is more than a simple one, though. To be sure it's not a fracture, we need an X-ray. Since you don’t have insurance, we can try to get one done at the free clinic downtown. It may take a little longer, and they may only do it if it's causing significant pain. If the X-ray comes back negative, then we'll treat it as a severe sprain. That involves rest, ice, compression, and elevation – RICE. We can also discuss a brace to help stabilize the ankle. Do you have any pain medication at home?
PATIENT: Oh, the free clinic… alright, I can try that. It's worth a shot. RICE, you said? Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation… I think I remember that from somewhere. No, no pain medication at home, just that antacid for my heartburn. A brace sounds good, if it will help. How long, though? How long will I have to rest it? I can't miss too much work, you know? The boss isn’t very understanding.
DOCTOR: Right, a brace will help. As for how long… it’s hard to say without an X-ray. A typical sprain can take anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months to fully heal, depending on the severity. We want to avoid putting weight on it as much as possible until we know what we’re dealing with. I'm going to write you a referral to the free clinic for the X-ray and give you some instructions on how to manage it in the meantime. You'll need to elevate it as much as possible, apply ice for 20 minutes at a time several times a day, and wrap it with a compression bandage. I'm also going to recommend you limit your work as much as possible until we have a better idea of what’s going on. I know that’s not ideal, but it’s important to prevent further injury. Do you understand these instructions?
PATIENT: Yeah, I understand. Elevate, ice, compression… limit work. It's not what I want to hear, but I guess I figured it wouldn't be a quick fix. The boss is gonna be upset, but… maybe I can explain it to him. The referral, you said? Just to the free clinic? Do I need to make an appointment or can I just… go? And how long does the X-ray usually take? I don’t want to be gone all day.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The referral is to the free clinic downtown. You shouldn’t need an appointment, but it’s best to call ahead to confirm their hours and any specific instructions. The number is 555-1234. The X-ray itself shouldn’t take too long, maybe 30 minutes to an hour, including paperwork and waiting time. But it’s hard to say for sure, as they get busy. I’m going to write all this down for you, including the number for the clinic and a brief explanation of what you’re being referred for. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Thank you, Doctor Billman. You've been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I'll call the clinic first thing tomorrow and see what they say. Hopefully, it’s just a sprain. And thank you again for not dismissing it as "just an old man’s foot". It means a lot. .
