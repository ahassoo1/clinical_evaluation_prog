DOCTOR: Hi Sharifa, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor. Though, honestly, I don't usually come to doctors unless absolutely necessary. It's probably nothing serious, but my legs just…gave out on me. After a really bad cold, mind you. It's just…weak. Both of them. I could barely walk yesterday.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It's good you came in to get it checked out, even if you think it might be nothing serious. Weakness after a cold can be a lot of things, so let's try to figure out what’s going on. When you say "gave out," can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Honestly? They just…buckled. Like I was trying to sit down in a chair that wasn’t there. It wasn’t painful, just…suddenly wobbly and I had to practically fall into something to keep from hitting the floor. It happened twice yesterday. Once getting out of bed, and then again when I was trying to make lunch. It's… inconvenient, to say the least. And frankly, a little embarrassing. I’m usually quite coordinated.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it wasn't a gradual weakening, but more of a sudden inability to support your weight. And no pain with that, just the buckling?
PATIENT: Exactly. No pain at all. Just…nothing there. Like the muscles just decided they didn't want to work for a few seconds. It did feel a bit like… when your legs fall asleep, but all the way down. Not just tingling, though. Completely gone. Then it came back, slowly, but it's still…not right. I feel like I have to really think about lifting my feet when I walk. It's a nuisance, really. I have things to do, you know?
DOCTOR: I see. That sounds concerning, especially with it happening after a cold. The feeling of "nothing there" and needing to consciously think about lifting your feet… that gives me some ideas about what might be going on, but we need to rule things out. Let’s go through a little bit more of your history, okay?
PATIENT: Oh, history. Well, what do you need to know? I don’t really have a history, Doctor. I’m a reasonably healthy woman. Divorced, if that matters. I travel a lot for work - tour guiding, you see - so I'm generally on my feet. No smoking, very little drinking. I try to eat well when I can, but it’s hard on the road sometimes. I have Medicare, of course. Is that what you need? Because frankly, I’d rather just get this leg thing sorted and be on my way.
DOCTOR: No, that's all helpful information, Sharifa. It's good to know you travel a lot and are generally healthy. Medicare is good to know for billing, too. Don’t worry, we’ll get to the bottom of this. Let’s start with past medical problems. Have you ever been diagnosed with anything significant – like diabetes, high blood pressure, arthritis, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think. No…nothing major. I had the usual childhood illnesses, measles, mumps, chickenpox, all that. Nothing serious. My mother had some problems with her joints when she got older, arthritis I think, but I haven't had any of that. I had a really bad case of the flu a few years back, but that’s it. Honestly, I try to avoid doctors as much as possible. They always want to put you on medication for everything. I prefer to just…tough it out. Is this going to be a long list of questions, Doctor? I have a tour scheduled for next week, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your reluctance, and I promise to keep it as concise as possible. We just need to cover some basics to make sure we don’t miss anything. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I’ve never needed surgery. And I avoid hospitals like the plague. I had a bad experience when I was a child with a tonsil infection - don’t ask. Just…no. Never been hospitalized. And I sincerely hope I won’t be starting now. Honestly, I think this whole thing is probably just a lingering effect of the cold. A bit of weakness, that's all. I'm sure it'll pass on its own. I just wanted to make sure it wasn't something…terrible.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries or hospitalizations. That's good to know. Now, let’s talk about your family. Do you know of any medical problems that run in your family - heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, neurological problems like weakness or trouble walking?
PATIENT: Oh, family. That’s…complicated. My mother’s side, they had the joint problems, like I said. Arthritis, mostly. And she had some issues with her heart towards the end, but I don’t know the details. My father… he wasn’t around much. I barely knew him. His family… well, they weren’t very forthcoming about things. I think there was something with my uncle, some sort of…nervous condition? But it was never discussed. Honestly, they weren’t the most open family. It was more…sweep it under the rug and pretend it didn’t happen. So, I don’t have much to tell you, I’m afraid. It’s probably just a coincidence, this leg thing. A bad cold, a bit of weakness. It happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some arthritis on your mother’s side, and a vague history of a nervous condition on your father’s side. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I told you, I avoid medication whenever possible. I might take an ibuprofen for a headache occasionally, but that’s it. I don't believe in filling my body with all those chemicals. I prefer natural remedies when I can. A good rest, some herbal tea, that sort of thing. And honestly, I think this whole thing is just a temporary setback. A bit of weakness, a lingering effect of the cold. It'll pass, I'm sure of it. I just wanted to make sure it wasn't something…serious. I have a tour to run, you see. People are counting on me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no regular medications. That’s helpful. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. I’m not a picky eater, and I certainly don’t go around looking for things to be allergic to. Honestly, Doctor, are we almost done? I’m starting to get a little impatient. I have things to do, you see. And I really think this whole thing is just a temporary setback. A bit of weakness, a lingering effect of the cold. It’ll pass, I’m sure of it. I just wanted to make sure it wasn’t something…terrible. But frankly, I think I’m wasting my time here. It’s probably nothing.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. I understand your frustration, Sharifa, and I appreciate your patience. While you feel it’s likely just a lingering effect of the cold, the sudden weakness, especially the buckling, warrants a closer look. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. Okay?
PATIENT: Oh, fine. But please be quick about it. I really don't see the point, but if it'll get me out of here faster… alright. But I'm telling you, it's just a bit of weakness. A temporary setback. Don't go looking for something that isn't there. Just a quick look, you said?
DOCTOR: Yes, just a quick look. First, let's check your vital signs – blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and breathing rate. Blood pressure is 128 over 76, pulse is 72 and regular, temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and your breathing rate is 16 breaths per minute. Those are all within normal limits. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are normal, lungs are clear. Next, I’m going to check your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs. Can you lie down on the exam table for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, this is all rather unnecessary. I feel perfectly fine, except for a bit of weakness in my legs. But alright, if you insist. Just get it over with quickly. I have things to do, you see. And I really don't like being poked and prodded. Just be gentle, alright? And don't go looking for something that isn't there. It's just a bit of weakness, a temporary setback. I’m telling you.
DOCTOR: Okay, just relaxing. I’m going to tap a few spots on your knees and ankles to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m going to check your strength. Can you try to push your leg down against my hand like you’re trying to keep me from bending it?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? Honestly, this is all very undignified. I’m perfectly capable of walking, you know. A bit of weakness, that’s all. Don’t go making a big deal out of nothing. I have a tour to run, you see. People are counting on me. Just tell me it’s nothing serious and I can go. And please, be quick about it. I don’t have all day. And don't go looking for something that isn’t there. It’s just a bit of weakness. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, and now the other leg. Strength is 5 out of 5 bilaterally, meaning full strength in both legs. Now, I’m going to check your sensation. Can you tell me if you can feel this when I touch you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, I can feel it. Is that enough? Honestly, Doctor, I really don't understand what you're trying to accomplish here. I told you, I have full strength in both legs. A bit of weakness, a temporary setback. I can feel everything just fine. Just tell me it’s nothing serious and let me go. I have things to do, you see. People are counting on me. And frankly, I'm starting to get rather annoyed. It’s just a bit of weakness, alright? A temporary setback. Just let me go.
DOCTOR: Okay, sensation is intact bilaterally. Everything I’m checking is normal so far. However, given your sudden weakness and the fact that it happened after a cold, and your description of it "buckling," I’d like to order some blood tests just to rule out a few things, like vitamin deficiencies or inflammation. It's better to be safe than sorry. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Really? Now you want to take my blood? Honestly, Doctor, this is ridiculous. I told you, it’s just a bit of weakness, a temporary setback. I'm perfectly fine. I don't need blood tests. I need to get back to my tour preparations. This is a complete waste of my time. Honestly, I think you’re overreacting. I've never needed blood tests for a little weakness. Just tell me it’s nothing serious and let me go. I have things to do, you see. And frankly, I don't trust doctors who poke and prod and order unnecessary tests. It’s just a bit of weakness, alright? A temporary setback. Just let me go. .
DOCTOR: Sharifa, I understand your frustration, and I apologize if this feels like a waste of your time. However, the sudden onset of weakness, especially after an illness, warrants further investigation to rule out any underlying causes. While it may be nothing, it's important to be thorough. The blood tests will help us check for things like vitamin deficiencies, electrolyte imbalances, and inflammation, all of which can cause weakness. It's a simple procedure, and it will give us peace of mind. If you're really uncomfortable with the tests, we can discuss other options, but I strongly recommend them. I want to make sure you're healthy and safe, especially with your busy tour schedule. Would you be willing to consider the blood tests?
