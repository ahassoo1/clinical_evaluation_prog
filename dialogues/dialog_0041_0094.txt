DOCTOR: Hi Airam, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um... hello. The... the paper said something about learning? I work with metal. Sheets of it. My husband... he said I should come. It’s… important, I think. I don’t really… remember why I wanted to come.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. Sometimes it’s hard to recall things. You work with metal sheets, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes. Big sheets. Small sheets. We… cut them. And bend them. For… buildings. And… things. It’s hot work. It’s not… easy.
DOCTOR: Buildings and things, okay. And it is hot work, you said?
PATIENT: Yes! Very hot. And loud. Lots of banging. My ears sometimes... ring. A little. Not all the time. But sometimes. Is this… what we’re talking about? The learning? Because I don’t… understand.
DOCTOR: Okay, the ringing in your ears is very helpful to know. It could be related to why you’re here, yes. It sounds like we might be looking at something work-related. Just to be clear, is the main reason you came in today because of this ringing, or is there something else you were hoping to discuss?
PATIENT: No! Not… just the ringing. My husband… he keeps saying I forget things. Important things. Like… where I put the keys. Or what we ate for dinner. He worries. It’s not that bad. But he made me come here. For… learning. And maybe… to stop forgetting? I don’t know.
DOCTOR: I see. So it sounds like both the ringing in your ears and some memory concerns are what brought you in today. That’s perfectly alright. We can definitely look into both of those things. To get a better understanding, could you tell me a little bit more about when you first started noticing the memory problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… It’s… hard to say. It feels like… always. But worse lately, maybe? I forget what I was just doing. Like… I’ll be making dinner, and then… I don’t know why I’m standing in the kitchen anymore. My husband says it's been a few months, but I don’t… I don’t remember when exactly. It’s frustrating! He gets mad sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a few months, getting worse recently. And it’s disrupting your daily activities, like cooking. That’s helpful to know. Has this been accompanied by any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes? Like… what kind of changes? I… I get tired easily. More than usual, I think. And sometimes… I feel a little… lost. Not like… really lost, but… confused. It’s hard to explain. I also… I get angry faster, maybe? My husband says I’m… irritable. He says I snap at him. I don’t mean to.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a much clearer picture. Fatigue, feeling confused, and irritability. And you said this has been happening for a few months, and is getting worse. Now, just to be thorough, have you experienced any headaches, dizziness, or vision changes along with these symptoms?
PATIENT: Headaches… sometimes. Not… bad headaches. Just… a dull ache. More in the back of my head. Dizziness… not really. Not often. Maybe… when I stand up too fast. But everyone gets that, right? Vision… no. I think. I wear glasses, but… my vision is always bad. It hasn’t gotten worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, dull headaches, mostly in the back of the head, and occasional dizziness when standing up quickly. No changes in your vision. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Um… I don’t think so. I go to the doctor sometimes, for check-ups, but… they never said anything. My husband… he says I had a fever when I was little. But that was a long time ago! I don’t remember being sick. I’m… generally healthy, I think. I work hard. But I don’t take any… medicines, or anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions or medications. That's good to know. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. I… I don’t like hospitals. My grandmother… she was in the hospital a lot when she was old. It didn’t end well. I try to stay healthy. Avoid getting sick. That’s why I work. Keeps me moving.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly understandable. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: My mother… she had… problems with her memory, when she was old. Very old. My husband said… something about dementia? But I don’t… remember exactly. She forgot who I was, sometimes. It was… sad. And my father… he had high blood pressure, I think. He was always… grumpy. That’s all I really remember. They both… passed away a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of dementia in your mother and high blood pressure in your father. That’s helpful to know. Now, just a few more questions. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No! Absolutely not. I don’t do any of those things. Never have. My husband… he likes a beer sometimes, but I don’t. It’s bad for you. Makes you… forget things, I think. I like tea. Lots of tea. Keeps me calm.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very good. Now, just to finish up with the background, could you tell me a little bit about your work environment?
PATIENT: It’s… loud. Very loud. Lots of banging and clanging. And hot. Like I said. We cut the metal, and bend it, and… put it together. It’s dusty, sometimes. And there’s… fumes. From the welding. Not all the time, but… a lot of the time. We wear masks, but… they don’t always help. It's a factory. Big and… busy. Lots of people.
DOCTOR: Okay, loud noise, heat, dust, and fumes in a busy factory environment. That gives me a good picture. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of your overall health. Is that alright?
PATIENT: A… physical exam? Like… checking me? I… suppose so. As long as it’s quick. I don’t like being… poked and prodded. But… if you think it’s necessary. Just… be gentle, okay? And… explain what you’re doing. I don’t want any surprises.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll explain everything as I go, and I’ll be as gentle as possible. It’ll just be a quick check of your blood pressure, pulse, and a listen to your heart and lungs. I’ll also do a brief neurological exam, just to check your reflexes and balance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Reflexes and… balance? Okay. If you have to. But… please be quick. And… explain everything. I don’t like surprises.
DOCTOR: Alright. First, I'm going to take your blood pressure. I'm just wrapping this cuff around your arm, and it will squeeze for a moment. It doesn't hurt, but it can feel a little tight. Just relax your arm, and try to breathe normally.
PATIENT: It’s… tight. Very tight. Okay… I’m trying to relax. But it’s… uncomfortable. How long does it have to stay on?
DOCTOR: Almost done. Just a few more seconds… Okay, all done. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That's a little elevated. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs with this stethoscope. Just breathe normally. It might feel a little cool.
PATIENT: It’s… cold. Very cold. Is something wrong? It feels… strange. What are you listening for? Is my heart okay?
DOCTOR: Everything sounds clear so far. I’m just listening for any unusual sounds. Your heart rate is a little fast, 92 beats per minute, but that could be from anxiety. Your lungs sound clear as well. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. This won't hurt, I just need you to relax your arm.
PATIENT: Ow! That startled me! Is that necessary? It hurt a little. What were you looking for? I don't like being poked and prodded.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you. It was just a quick check to see how your nerves are responding. Your reflexes are a little diminished, but that could be normal. Now, I’m going to do a quick balance test. Could you stand up for me, and try to stand on one leg for about 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Stand on one leg? For 30 seconds? I’m not very good at balancing. I might fall. This is… difficult. I don't think I can do it. See? I told you I would fall. This is pointless.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, don’t worry. It’s good that you have something to hold onto. Your balance is a little impaired, which is something we need to investigate further. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, I’m concerned about some possible cognitive impairment, and some potential neurological issues. Your elevated blood pressure is also a concern.
PATIENT: Cognitive… what? And neurological… issues? What does that mean? Am I… sick? Is it serious? What’s wrong with me? Tell me! Don’t just say… issues! My husband… is something wrong with my brain?
DOCTOR: Okay, let’s not panic. "Impairment" just means there's a slight reduction in some of your cognitive functions, like memory and thinking. And the neurological findings, like the diminished reflexes and impaired balance, could be related to a number of things. It's too early to say definitively what's going on. That's why I want to order some tests. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a thyroid panel, and a Vitamin B12 level to rule out any underlying medical conditions. I also want to get a brain MRI to get a better look at your brain and see if there's any structural abnormality. And finally, I'd like you to see a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation. It’s important to get to the bottom of this, but there's no need to worry unnecessarily. We’ll take things one step at a time. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: A brain… MRI? That sounds… scary. And a neurologist? Is that someone who… looks at brains? What if… what if it’s something bad? What if I… forget everything? Or worse? I don't want to forget my husband. I don't want to forget my life. Is there anything else I can do? Besides… tests and scans and… doctors? Can't you just… give me something to help me remember?
DOCTOR: It’s okay to be scared. An MRI is just a scan that takes pictures of your brain. It doesn't hurt, and it doesn't involve any radiation. The neurologist is a doctor who specializes in the brain and nervous system. They'll be able to help us figure out what’s going on and recommend the best course of treatment. Unfortunately, there's no quick fix for memory problems. We need to find out the underlying cause before we can start any treatment. There are medications that can help with some memory problems, but they only work for certain conditions. In the meantime, there are things you can do to help your memory. Staying mentally active, eating a healthy diet, and getting regular exercise can all make a difference. And it’s important to have a good support system, like your husband, to help you through this. I’m going to order the tests, and I’ll give you a referral to a neurologist. We'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and come up with a plan. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay… I guess so. Tests… and a neurologist. And… I'll try to stay active. And eat healthy. And… not forget things. Can you… write all of that down? For me? I forget easily, you know. Just… so I don't have to remember everything right now. And… thank you, Doctor. For… not making me feel too scared. Too much.
DOCTOR: Of course. Here are the test orders and the referral. The front desk will help you schedule the tests and the appointment with the neurologist. They're very helpful. And you're very welcome. It's my job to make you feel as comfortable as possible. I also want to mention that, given your work environment, it’s important to protect your hearing. Loud noise can contribute to cognitive problems, so wearing ear protection at work is a good idea. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Ear protection… yes. I should… wear earplugs. My husband… he tells me to. I forget sometimes. It’s uncomfortable. But… I will try. No… I think that’s all. For now. Just… tests, a neurologist, and earplugs. And… trying not to forget things. Thank you, Doctor. Really. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Airam. Take care, and don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. We’re here to help. .
