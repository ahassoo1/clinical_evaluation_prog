DOCTOR: Hi Aron, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Georgiou. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. Good to meet you too. Um… my chest hurts. Not all the time, but… it hurts sometimes. It's in my… breast.
DOCTOR: Okay, chest pain. That’s good you’re getting it checked out. And you said it’s in your breast – is that the right side, the left, or both?
PATIENT: Just… one. The left one. It doesn't hurt all the time, like I said. Mostly when I… move around a lot. Or sometimes, just… random. I don’t know.
DOCTOR: Alright, intermittent pain in the left breast. Can you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Um… it's not… sharp. More like… a heavy ache? Like… when you use your muscles too much, but in my chest. Not like a bad pain, but… noticeable. And sometimes it feels… like a lump? But I don't know if it is a lump. It's hard to tell.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heavy ache, sometimes feeling like a lump… and it comes and goes. Is it associated with any redness or discharge from your nipple?
PATIENT: No, no redness. And… no, nothing coming out. Just the ache. It’s… kinda scary, to be honest. I don't know anything about… this stuff. I've never had this before.
DOCTOR: I understand it’s scary when something new comes up. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. Have you noticed any changes in the size or shape of your breast, or any dimpling of the skin?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. My wife… she hasn't said anything. And I don’t really… look, you know? I just… work. Roofing. It's hard work. I don’t spend time looking at… that part of me. Sorry. It's probably stupid.
DOCTOR: No, it's not stupid at all, Aron. Roofing is hard work. Okay, so no noticeable changes to the breast itself. And just to be thorough, have you had any recent injuries or trauma to your chest?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. I mean… sometimes I bump into things on the roof, but nothing… serious. Just little bumps. Not enough to hurt… like this. I think. It just… started a few weeks ago. Maybe a month. It comes and goes, like waves. Some days it’s okay, some days it’s… not.
DOCTOR: Alright, started a few weeks ago, comes and goes… No recent trauma. And you mentioned roofing – does any particular movement or position make the pain worse?
PATIENT: Yeah… when I'm reaching up high. Like when I'm nailing the shingles. That’s when it hurts the most. And… sometimes when I sleep on my left side. It feels… squeezed. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Pain with reaching and when lying on your left side. Let’s do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll gently feel around your chest and breast area. Just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yeah… okay. That’s fine. I… trust you. It's just… I'm a little nervous. But yeah, go ahead. I hope it’s nothing bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a quick listen first. Take a nice deep breath in… and out… good. And another one… excellent. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to gently feel around your chest and breast area. Just let me know if anything feels particularly tender or uncomfortable. I’ll start on your collarbone… …and moving down here… Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Yeah… a little. Right… about there. Not… bad bad, just… noticeable. Like when I poke it. Does that make sense? It's not sore all the time, just… when you touch it.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in the upper, inner quadrant of your left breast with palpation. I feel a small, slightly firm area there. It's about the size of a marble. I don’t feel any enlarged lymph nodes in your armpit, which is good. Based on what you’ve told me and what I’m feeling, it could be a few things. It could be a benign cyst, or a muscle strain affecting the chest wall. It’s also possible it could be something else, and we need to rule those possibilities out. Because of the tenderness and the small lump, I’d like to order a mammogram and an ultrasound to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: A mammogram… and an ultrasound? What… what are those? I don't want anything… scary. I just want it to go away. Is it… is it cancer? I'm… really scared now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Aron, take a deep breath. It’s completely understandable that you’re scared, and it’s good you’re expressing that. A mammogram is an X-ray of the breast. It helps us look for any abnormalities. An ultrasound uses sound waves to create a picture of the tissues inside the breast. It's non-invasive and doesn't use radiation. We’re not jumping to any conclusions. These tests are simply to get more information so we can figure out what’s causing your pain and tenderness. Most lumps are not cancerous. But it’s important to rule everything out, just to be safe. I’m going to write you a referral for the mammogram and ultrasound. The clinic will schedule those for you. Once we have the results, we can discuss them together and decide on the best course of action. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Okay… a referral. And then… tests. I… I guess so. I don’t really have a choice, do I? What if it is bad? My wife… she’ll be so worried. And… I need to work. I can’t… I can't afford to be sick.
DOCTOR: You’re right, getting the tests is the best way to know what’s going on. And it's completely understandable to be worried about your wife and work. We’ll take things one step at a time. The clinic has financial assistance programs available if you’re concerned about the cost of the tests. And we can also discuss any potential impact on your work schedule once we have the results. We can provide a note for your employer if needed. This referral is to Coastal Radiology. They’re very good. The phone number is listed here, and the clinic staff will help you schedule the appointment. They’ll let you know how to prepare for the tests. In the meantime, if you experience any new symptoms—like changes in the size or shape of your breast, dimpling of the skin, or nipple discharge—please call the clinic right away. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I don't think so. Just… thank you. For… not laughing. And for… being nice. I'm just… scared. I guess I’ll call them. And wait. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aron. It’s okay to be scared, and you're not alone. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions at all. We’ll get through this together. Take care, and I’ll see you when you have the test results.
