DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Stoffregen. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Good morning to you too. Hmm… what brought me in? It’s… it's about going to the bathroom. It's a bit hard now, you see. Not painful, just… takes effort. It’s been like this for a little while, I think. Not sure how long, exactly. Old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: “Old age,” you say. Well, we'll investigate that further, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s good you’ve noticed a change. So, this difficulty... is it with starting to go, with emptying completely, or both?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Hmm… both, I think. It’s hard to start, and then it feels like… like it doesn't all come out, you know? I have to… push a bit, maybe go back again after a little while. It’s just… annoying, more than anything. Not comfortable. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. And is this a recent change, or has it been developing gradually over time?
PATIENT: Oh… gradually, I think. It didn't just happen one day. It's been getting a little worse… slowly. I really can't put my finger on when it started, though. Months, maybe? A long time. Everything feels like a long time these days!
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside this difficulty?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me see… No, not really. I… sometimes I feel like I have to go more often, but that might just be the water I drink. Or… maybe my age! No pain, no fever, nothing like that. Just… the bathroom thing. Is that enough to worry about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Well, we must rule out anything serious. Have you noticed any changes in your stool—its color, consistency, or shape?
PATIENT: Oh my. Changes in… what now? I don't really look at my… stool. I just go when I have to go, you know? I haven’t been paying attention to those sorts of things. Is that bad? I'm an old woman, Doctor, not a… a detective!
DOCTOR: Very well. And do you have any history of constipation, or have you always had regular bowel movements?
PATIENT: Constipation… Well, I’ve always been pretty regular, I think. Never had too much trouble. Though… lately, everything feels a little… off. Maybe slightly harder to go sometimes, even before the bathroom problem. But nothing I ever worried about. Just… old age again, probably! Is that what you're asking about, Doctor?
DOCTOR: Let's proceed with a brief physical examination, Ms. Stoffregen. It’s best to rule out any obvious causes. I’ll need you to lie down on the examination table. We’ll start with abdominal palpation.
PATIENT: Oh… Lie down? Pal-pa-tion? Is that going to be… uncomfortable? I don’t like doctors poking around! Is it really necessary, Doctor? I just thought maybe it was something simple. Old age, like I said.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stoffregen, a basic examination is necessary to assess your condition properly. It's a standard procedure. I assure you, it will not be unduly uncomfortable. I simply need to feel for any abnormalities. Now, if you could please lie down on the table. It will only take a moment.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. If you insist, Doctor. But please be gentle. And don't poke too hard. It’s just… I'm an old woman, you know. Everything aches these days. Are you sure there isn't anything else we can try first?
DOCTOR: Take a deep breath, Ms. Stoffregen. And relax your abdomen if you can. I detect some mild tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no significant masses. Your abdomen is otherwise soft. We will need to run some tests to be certain. A stool sample and a urine analysis, to begin with.
PATIENT: Oh… Ooh, that's a little… sensitive there. Tests, you say? A… stool sample? Oh, dear. That doesn’t sound very pleasant. And a… urine analysis? I can do that, I suppose. But the stool sample… Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? I really don’t like the sound of that. I’m an old woman, you know… these things aren’t easy anymore.
DOCTOR: Ms. Stoffregen, I understand your discomfort. However, these tests are crucial to rule out infection, inflammation, or any other underlying issues. We cannot determine the cause of your difficulty without them. The stool sample is a standard procedure, and the lab will provide you with the necessary collection kit and instructions. It is a small inconvenience for a potentially serious diagnosis. I will write you a requisition form for both tests. Please collect the samples as soon as possible and bring them to the lab. We will review the results and determine the next course of action. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. You always have to do everything the hard way, don’t you? Fine, I’ll do the tests. But I’m not happy about it. And please, make sure the instructions are very clear. I don’t want to mess it up. Old women aren’t very good at these things anymore, you know. Just get it over with, please.
DOCTOR: Here are the forms. The lab is just down the hall. The nurse can assist you with any questions about the collection process. We will schedule a follow-up appointment once the results are available. That will be all for today, Ms. Stoffregen.
