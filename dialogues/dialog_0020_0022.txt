DOCTOR: Good morning, Soila. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Beinborn. It’s nice to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Hmm… what brings me in? Well, my tummy… it feels big. And I don't want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to. It just… doesn't feel right.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your stomach feels big, and you’ve noticed a decrease in your appetite. And it just doesn’t feel right. Could you tell me a bit more about when you first started noticing these changes?
PATIENT: Oh dear… when did it start? That's a tricky one. It feels like… a long time now. Maybe… a few months? It didn’t bother me much at first, just a little full feeling. But now… now it's more noticeable. I don’t really remember exactly when it got worse. Everything is a little blurry these days, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand, it can be hard to pinpoint things sometimes. A few months… okay. And has anything specific made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Specific… No, not really. I don’t think so. Eating doesn’t make it much better or worse, honestly. Just… not enjoying it much. Sometimes, if I eat too much, it feels a bit uncomfortable, but that's all. Nothing really makes it better, I don't think. I just feel… tired, too. But I'm old, so maybe that's normal?
DOCTOR: That’s good information to know. And you're right, feeling tired can be common as we get older. But it’s important to check it out, just to be sure. Now, besides the fullness and decreased appetite and tiredness, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… Let me think… Oh! Sometimes, I feel a little… bubbly. In my tummy, you know? Like little bubbles moving around. Not painful, just… strange. And I go to the bathroom… not as often as I used to. Sorry to talk about that! It's just… things aren't working like they used to.
DOCTOR: No, please, it's important information, and you’re not bothering me at all. Bubbles in your tummy and less frequent bowel movements… okay. And have you had any nausea, vomiting, or any changes in your stool – like if it’s darker or lighter than usual?
PATIENT: Nausea… no, not really sick to my stomach. Vomiting, no, thank goodness. And the stool… Hmm. I think it's… normal colored? Maybe a little… harder than usual? It's hard to say, really. I don’t pay much attention to those things. Sorry, Doctor.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Soila. You’re doing fine. Now, have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Oh, dear. I don't know. I haven’t been weighing myself. I don't think so… but my clothes feel a little looser, maybe? It could be just the heat, though. It's been very warm lately. I’m not sure. Everything feels a little… unclear.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s understandable. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… Oh my. That was a long time ago. I think… the doctor told me I had something with my blood pressure, many years ago. He gave me pills, but I don't take them anymore. I don’t really remember what it was called. And… I think I had a bad gallbladder once, a long time ago, but they took it out. That’s all I can really remember, I'm afraid.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure in the past and gallbladder removal. Do you remember when you had your gallbladder removed?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That was… a very long time ago. Maybe… fifty years? More? I was quite young then, I think. It was in a different country, actually. Russia. Everything is very blurry. I remember being in the hospital, but not much else. It was a long, long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal approximately 50 years ago. And do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, like foods?
PATIENT: Allergies… No, I don’t think so. I’ve never really had a bad reaction to anything. I eat… well, I used to eat everything. Now I don’t eat much of anything. But it's not because of allergies, just… no appetite. I used to love pickled herring, but even that doesn’t sound good anymore.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don’t take anything. Not even a little aspirin. I used to, for my knees, but it didn't seem to help much, so I stopped. I prefer to just… rest when they bother me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your family. Do you have any family history of cancer, heart disease, or other serious illnesses?
PATIENT: Oh, family… That’s a hard one. I haven't seen my family in… well, a very long time. My mother… she lived a long life, I think. She died of… old age, I suppose. My father… he died when I was young. I don't really remember what he died of. I don’t think anyone in my family had… cancer, but I'm not really sure. Everything is so blurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s understandable. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor. I never smoked. Never even tried it. It smelled terrible! My husband… he smoked, but I always made him go outside. It's very bad for you, you know. I always told him that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. And do you drink alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, sometimes. Just a little glass of wine with dinner, if I'm feeling up to it. But not very often, anymore. It doesn't really appeal to me like it used to. Just… a small glass, sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that's alright with you. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check a few other things. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. Go ahead. I'm not scared. Just… be gentle, please? My tummy is a little sensitive, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. Okay, take a deep breath for me… and another… Good. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs sound clear. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. I'm hearing some… decreased bowel sounds. That's consistent with what you've been telling me. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. I'm feeling some… slight tenderness in the lower abdomen. And I do feel a… fullness there. It's not sharply painful, but it is definitely present. Okay. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes.
PATIENT: Oh… that feels a bit strange. Not painful, but… uncomfortable. It does feel full, like you said. Like there’s a… balloon in there. And yes, the reflexes… just do what you need to do, Doctor. I trust you. I just hope it's nothing serious. I'm getting old, you know, and I don't want any… surprises.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Soila. I'm being as gentle as possible. Okay, everything seems relatively normal there. Based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. The fullness in your abdomen, decreased appetite, weight loss, and the bubbling sensation could be related to a few different things. It could be something relatively minor, like constipation, or it could be something more serious. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests and a CT scan of your abdomen. The blood tests will help us check your overall health and rule out any infections or other problems. The CT scan will give us a detailed view of your abdomen and help us identify the cause of the fullness. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Oh dear… tests and scans… It sounds… serious. I don’t like tests. But… if you think it’s necessary, Doctor, then I suppose so. I just hope it doesn't take too long. I get tired easily, you know. And… will it hurt? And… how much will it cost? I don't have much money, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Soila. It's natural to be worried about tests and scans. I’ll try to explain everything as clearly as possible. The blood tests are just a simple blood draw, and it shouldn’t hurt much – just a quick pinch. As for the CT scan, it's painless – you’ll just lie on a table while the machine takes pictures. It will take about 20-30 minutes. Regarding the cost, I understand you're concerned about that. Let me check with the billing department to see what the estimated cost will be, and if there are any financial assistance programs available. We’ll do everything we can to make it affordable. In the meantime, I’m going to write a referral for the CT scan and blood tests. The lab and imaging center will contact you to schedule appointments. I also want you to keep a food diary for the next few days, noting everything you eat and drink, and any symptoms you experience. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A food diary… Yes, I can do that. I don’t eat much, but I can write down what little I do. And you’ll help me with the cost? That’s good… very good. What… what if it’s something bad, Doctor? What if it’s… cancer? I’m an old woman, you know. I’ve lived a long life.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be worried about that possibility, Soila. It’s good you’re being honest about your fears. However, it’s important to remember that the tests are to rule things out and to understand what’s going on. It’s too early to jump to any conclusions. There are many possible explanations for your symptoms, and cancer is just one of them. We will work through this step by step. Once we have the results of the tests, we can discuss them in detail and develop a plan. If it is something serious, we’ll explore all of your options and make sure you get the best possible care. I will be here to support you every step of the way. In the meantime, try not to worry too much. Focus on keeping a food diary and taking care of yourself. Do you want me to write down the name and number of the imaging center and the lab for you?
PATIENT: Yes… yes, please. That would be very helpful. I forget things easily, you know. And thank you, Doctor. Thank you for being so kind. It’s… comforting to talk to someone who listens. I’ll try not to worry. But it’s hard… very hard.
DOCTOR: Of course. Here you are. The imaging center will call you to schedule your CT scan, and the lab will contact you for the blood tests. I also want to remind you that if you experience any sudden changes in your symptoms – like severe pain, nausea, vomiting, or bleeding – please go to the emergency room immediately. I’m glad I could provide some reassurance, Soila. I’ll be here to discuss the results of the tests as soon as they are available. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all, Doctor. Thank you again for everything. You've been very patient with an old woman. I'll try to do everything you asked. I suppose I’ll be going now. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Soila. It was my pleasure. Please take care of yourself, and don't hesitate to call if you need anything. I will be in touch as soon as the test results are available. Have a good day, and be safe. .
