DOCTOR: Hi Lakiya, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good day, Doctor. My back… it is painful. I want to get this sorted quickly, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Back pain – that’s no fun at all, and we'll definitely try to figure things out as efficiently as we can. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: It started… oh, about two weeks ago, I believe. I was fixing fence, mostly. Post holes. It’s a dull ache, usually, but sometimes… sometimes it’s sharp when I bend over. It’s worse at the end of the day.
DOCTOR: Alright, two weeks ago while fixing fence… that gives us a good starting point. And it’s a dull ache that sharpens with bending, worse at the end of the day. Is the pain located in a specific area of your back, or is it more widespread?
PATIENT: It’s… lower back. Right in the middle. Not on the sides, mostly right across. Feels like a weight is sitting there, if that makes sense. It doesn't go down my legs, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back, middle section, feels like a weight... and no pain radiating down your legs, that’s good. Have you noticed anything that improves the pain?
PATIENT: Lying down, mostly. Flat on my back. And… warm baths help a little. Not for long, but for a bit. I take a lot of ibuprofen, too.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying down and warm baths provide some relief, and you’re using ibuprofen. How much ibuprofen are you taking, and how often?
PATIENT: Two pills, 200 milligrams each, three times a day. It helps take the edge off, but it doesn’t fix anything. It just… makes it bearable.
DOCTOR: Okay, 600 milligrams of ibuprofen daily. I'm going to ask a few more questions about your medical history, if that's okay. Have you ever had back problems before?
PATIENT: No, not like this. I pulled a muscle once, a long time ago, but that was different. This is… deeper. More constant. Never been to a doctor for my back before today.
DOCTOR: Alright, no prior back issues. And this feels different, more constant. Do you have any other medical conditions – like diabetes, arthritis, or anything like that?
PATIENT: No. Just… old age, I suppose. Medicare is all I have, if that matters. My husband… he passed five years ago. I’m mostly healthy, otherwise.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally healthy. And I appreciate you letting me know about your Medicare coverage. That’s good information to have. Now, just to complete the picture, are you currently taking any other medications besides the ibuprofen?
PATIENT: No. Just the ibuprofen, and sometimes a little something for my nerves, when they bother me. But that's only when they really bother me. It's an old prescription. The doctor before… he gave it to me years ago. I don't use it often.
DOCTOR: Okay, so an old nerve medication you don't use often. Let’s do a quick physical exam. Could you please stand up for me?
PATIENT: Alright. Be careful, please. My balance isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, I will be very careful. Okay, bending forward… how does that feel?
PATIENT: It’s… uncomfortable. It feels tighter than usual. And… there. That’s where it hurts the most. It’s a sharp pain when I go too far. I can’t go down very far without it hurting.
DOCTOR: Okay, I'm noting that limited range of motion with a sharp pain mid-back. Palpating your lower back, I do feel some tenderness and muscle spasm in that area. Straight leg raise tests are negative, which is good – that suggests the pain isn’t likely radiating from a pinched nerve. Now, if you could lie down on your stomach for me?
PATIENT: This is… difficult. I haven’t been on my stomach in a long time.
DOCTOR: Okay, take your time. Okay, lying down… feels a little better, actually. But still tender to the touch. I don't feel any obvious deformities or masses. Based on what you've told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you're experiencing a muscle strain in your lower back. It's likely aggravated by the fence work and bending. It doesn’t appear to be anything more serious, like a disc issue or nerve compression. Do you have any questions about that so far?
PATIENT: A muscle strain… That's… not so bad, I suppose. Will it heal? I need to fix that fence. And I don’t want this to happen again. What do I need to do?
DOCTOR: Yes, muscle strains usually heal well with proper care. It might take a few weeks, but we can manage it. For now, I recommend continuing to take ibuprofen as needed, but try to stick to the lowest effective dose. We can also talk about some gentle stretching and strengthening exercises to help prevent this from happening again. I'm going to write you a prescription for a muscle relaxant, just to help with the spasms. It will help take the edge off. And I want you to try applying ice packs for 20 minutes at a time, several times a day. Do you have any concerns with a muscle relaxant?
PATIENT: A muscle relaxant… will it make me sleepy? I have things to do. And I don’t want to fall. I’m careful enough as it is.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good question. Muscle relaxants can cause drowsiness in some people, yes. We’ll start with a low dose, and if you find it makes you too sleepy or dizzy, we can reduce it or stop it altogether. It's important to be careful, especially with your balance. We can also explore other options like physical therapy if you prefer to avoid medication. What do you think?
PATIENT: Physical therapy… that sounds good, actually. If it helps, and I don’t need to take something that will make me fall, that’s better. Can you write me a referral for that? And maybe just a small amount of the muscle relaxant, in case the pain is really bad? But not much.
DOCTOR: Okay, that sounds like a good plan. I’m going to write you a referral to a physical therapist nearby, and a prescription for a low dose of muscle relaxant, just for breakthrough pain. I'll also give you a handout with some gentle stretches you can start doing at home. It’s important to listen to your body – don't push yourself too hard. And if the pain worsens, or you develop any new symptoms – like numbness or weakness in your legs – please call the clinic right away. Do you have any questions before we wrap up?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your patience. It’s good to know it’s not something serious.
