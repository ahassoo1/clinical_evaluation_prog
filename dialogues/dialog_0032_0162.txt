DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you're with Lawton Kristofik. Please, have a seat. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, can we just get this over with? It's...bloating, alright? My stomach just feels puffed up. It’s been going on for a bit, and frankly, I don’t have time for a whole lot of questions. Just tell me what I need to do to fix it.
DOCTOR: I understand you’re pressed for time, Mr. Kristofik, but a proper assessment is crucial, even for something that seems straightforward. “Bloating” can have many causes, some more serious than others. To help me determine the best course of action, I do need to ask a few questions. Let’s start with this “bit.” How long exactly has this bloating been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? Fine. A few weeks, maybe? Honestly, I don't keep a calendar of my stomach problems. It just...started. I eat, I work, I try to ignore it. It comes and goes. Is that good enough? Look, I drive a pile driver for a living, I don’t sit around analyzing my digestion.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, alright. And it comes and goes. That’s helpful, to a degree. Now, can you describe the bloating itself?
PATIENT: Describe it? What do you want me to do, write a poem? It feels...full. Like I ate too much, even when I haven’t. Tight. Uncomfortable. It's not painful, exactly, just…annoying. Is that detailed enough for you? It’s a stomach, not a work of art.
DOCTOR: “Full” and “tight,” I understand. And you say it’s not painful, but uncomfortable. Does anything relieve the discomfort?
PATIENT: Relieve it? Laying down, sometimes. Or just...waiting. It goes away on its own eventually. I don't really do anything for it. I’ve got a job to do, I can't spend all day worrying about my belly. Look, I've been through worse, alright? My wife… never mind. It's just gas, probably. Can we just skip to whatever pills you're gonna give me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, while I appreciate your resilience, dismissing this as “just gas” without a proper evaluation would be irresponsible. We need to rule out other possibilities. Before we consider any medication, I'd like to ask a few questions about your diet. What does a typical day of eating look like for you?
PATIENT: Look, I eat what I can, when I can. It’s not exactly gourmet, alright? Usually something quick – sandwiches, burgers, maybe some pasta if I'm feeling fancy. I don't spend a lot of time fussing over organic kale or whatever people are eating these days. It's fuel. I need energy to do my job. I skip breakfast most days, honestly. Too busy. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand you have a demanding job and a busy schedule. Skipping breakfast and a diet consisting of primarily processed foods can contribute to digestive issues. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently?
PATIENT: Ugh, seriously? You're asking me about my poop now? Look, I go when I go. Sometimes it’s regular, sometimes it’s not. What kind of doctor asks this stuff? I'm a grown man, not a baby. I don't keep a log of this stuff. It's…normal. I guess. Can we please move this along? I've got things to do. This is a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration, but these questions are important. Changes in bowel habits can be a significant indicator of underlying issues. It is my professional responsibility to gather this information. Have you experienced any weight loss, fever, or noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Look, are you trying to scare me? Weight loss? No. Fever? No. Blood? Definitely not. I'm telling you, it's just bloating! I eat, I work, I get a puffy stomach. It's not rocket science! Honestly, I've never felt worse after coming to a doctor. This is ridiculous. Just give me something for the gas and let me go. I'm wasting a perfectly good afternoon. .
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I am not attempting to scare you. However, dismissing these symptoms without a thorough assessment is not in your best interest. Given your reluctance to provide further information and your insistence on immediate medication without proper evaluation, I am concerned. I am going to recommend a blood test to rule out any underlying inflammation or infection. I also suggest a stool sample to check for any abnormalities. And, while I understand your busy schedule, I strongly advise a consultation with a gastroenterologist. Do you agree to these recommendations?
