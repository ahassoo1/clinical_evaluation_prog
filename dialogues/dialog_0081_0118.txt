DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Oriley. I am Dr. Paulino. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you, Doctor Paulino. It's… paperwork, really. Some sort of certification I need for… well, for what I do. Honestly, the details escape me. Something about being able to continue practicing, I believe. A young man sent me a form. Seemed important enough. It involves an examination, I gather?
DOCTOR: Paperwork, is it?
PATIENT: Yes, paperwork. These things… they just keep multiplying, don't they? I used to have a very efficient secretary, a very good one, but… well, that's neither here nor there. The point is, I received this notice, and it requires a… check-up, I suppose you’d call it. Eyes, I think? Or perhaps ears. It's all rather hazy. I assure you, I’m perfectly capable, it’s just this… formality.
DOCTOR: Right. I see here it's a recertification for your commercial driver's license. The Department of Transportation requires periodic medical evaluations to ensure drivers are fit to operate vehicles safely. It is more than just a "formality," Mr. Oriley. It’s a rather serious matter, actually. Do you currently operate a commercial vehicle?
PATIENT: Commercial… driver's license? Heavens. Is that what this is about? I… I haven’t driven a large vehicle in… some time. Years, certainly. I do some… consulting work. Various projects. Transporting… equipment, perhaps. Occasionally. Though I usually have someone else do the driving these days. It’s quite tiresome, you know. My back isn’t what it used to be. Is this examination… extensive? I have a rather full schedule.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Oriley, the requirements are fairly standard. We need to assess your vision, hearing, cardiovascular health, neurological function… basic things to ensure you're not a hazard on the road, even if you aren't doing the driving yourself every day. It will involve a physical exam, and likely some bloodwork. It's not a particularly enjoyable process, but it's necessary. Do you have any current medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: A hazard? I assure you, Doctor, I am perfectly healthy for a man of my age. I maintain a… reasonable level of fitness. A brisk walk now and then. And I certainly don't require an extensive assessment. Bloodwork seems… excessive. As for medical conditions… well, I had a touch of the flu last winter, but I recovered quite well. And my back, as I mentioned. A bit stiff, nothing more. Honestly, I find this whole procedure rather… belittling.
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, with all due respect, "a bit stiff" and "a touch of the flu" are not adequate medical histories. Even if you aren’t driving regularly, the DOT has regulations for a reason. I understand your frustration, but I have a professional obligation to ensure you meet the required standards. Do you take any medications?
PATIENT: Regulations, regulations… Everyone has regulations these days. Fine. Very well. I take… a small dose of something for my blood pressure. A little blue pill, I believe. The name escapes me. My previous physician prescribed it. He was a very good doctor. And a small something for… indigestion, occasionally. Something to settle the stomach, you understand. It’s hardly a comprehensive list, Doctor. And I assure you, these are merely… preventative measures. I am perfectly capable of managing my health independently. Now, can we please expedite this process? I have a meeting this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s get this documented. Do you happen to know the names of these medications, even approximately?
PATIENT: Names… Honestly, Doctor, I leave such things to the professionals. My wife used to handle all the medication details. It's been… some time since she passed, and I confess, I haven’t paid close attention. I believe the blue pill was something… “Lisinopril”? Or perhaps “Amlodipine”? They both sound vaguely familiar. And the indigestion one… it’s a white tablet. Small. Perhaps “Pepcid”? I truly don’t recall. It's all rather unimportant, isn't it? As long as they work. Now, if you’ll excuse me... shall we begin the examination? I’m sure it won’t take long, as you said.
DOCTOR: Very well. Just to be clear, you're unsure of the exact medications and dosages you're currently taking. That is… less than ideal. Before we proceed with the physical, I’d like to quickly check your blood pressure and pulse. Please remove your jacket. And do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Less than ideal? It's perfectly reasonable for a man of my age to have a slight lapse in memory, Doctor. Honestly. And I assure you, my health is perfectly stable. No allergies, no. None at all. I've always been a rather robust individual. Though… now that you mention it, I did have a slightly itchy rash a few years ago after eating some… shellfish. But it passed quickly. A minor inconvenience, nothing more. Now, let's get this over with. I trust you have a comfortable chair? My back, you understand.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat. We'll start with your blood pressure. 148 over 92. Elevated. And pulse is 78 and regular. Mr. Oriley, your blood pressure is significantly higher than the recommended range. This needs to be addressed. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply.
PATIENT: Elevated? Well, I do get a bit worked up over paperwork, you know. And this whole process is rather… stressful. Perhaps if we could expedite matters? As for my heart and lungs… they are perfectly fine. Always have been. There. Am I finished now? I have a rather important conference call scheduled shortly. I trust this examination is nearing its conclusion?
DOCTOR: I'm hearing some mild crackles in your lower lung fields, bilaterally. That could indicate some fluid buildup. And I detect a slight murmur. It's not severe, but it warrants further investigation. Mr. Oriley, I'm concerned about your cardiovascular health, and these lung sounds are concerning. We need to order a chest X-ray and an EKG immediately. This isn’t something we can simply dismiss. Do you understand?
PATIENT: A murmur? Fluid buildup? Doctor, with all due respect, you are being alarmist. I assure you, I am perfectly healthy. I have lived a long and productive life without the need for… these unnecessary tests. A chest X-ray? An EKG? This is… preposterous. I refuse. I simply came in for a recertification, not a full-blown medical examination. I’m certain I can find another physician who will sign off on the paperwork without subjecting me to this… ordeal. I think I've had enough of this, thank you very much. Now, if you'll excuse me… .
DOCTOR: Mr. Oriley, please sit down. I understand your frustration, but I have a professional and ethical obligation to ensure your well-being, and to adhere to the DOT regulations. Dismissing these findings would be irresponsible, and potentially dangerous, both to you and to others. I will not sign off on your recertification without a proper workup. You are free to seek a second opinion, but I strongly advise against it. Now, please, let’s discuss the possibility of scheduling these tests. Please, have a seat. We can go through the options together. If you refuse to cooperate, I will be forced to report my concerns to the Department of Transportation. .
