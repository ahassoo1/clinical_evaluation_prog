DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. My name is Dr. Reisig. It's lovely to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. It’s my back. It’s been hurting real bad. Worse than usual, and it's...scary, because of the other thing. You know, the cancer.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do recall seeing that noted in your record. I understand your concern, especially given your history. “Real bad” is helpful, but could you tell me a bit more about the pain?
PATIENT: Okay. It’s...it’s mostly in my lower back, right here. It started a couple of days ago, just a little ache, but now it feels like someone is stabbing me. And it goes down my leg sometimes, on this side. Not all the way to my foot, but pretty far. It makes it hard to stand up straight, and even harder to sit for long.
DOCTOR: Okay, lower back pain radiating down your left leg. And you said it started a couple of days ago, gradually worsening. Is there anything specific that makes the pain better or worse?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. Laying down flat seems to help a little bit. But not much. Sitting is bad. Really bad. And bending over... forget it. Walking isn’t great, but it’s better than sitting. Does that make sense? It's hard to explain. It's just… pain.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Meigs. You're describing exactly what I need to know. Laying down offers some relief, sitting and bending aggravate it, and walking is somewhere in the middle. Has anything like this happened before?
PATIENT: Yes. A couple times, but not this bad. After the treatments, my back would ache for a little while. But it always went away after a few days. This... this feels different. It feels like it’s not going to go away. And I get scared it’s… you know… the cancer spreading. I’m sorry, I’m probably worrying too much.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable to be worried, Ms. Meigs, especially given your history. It's good you're bringing this to my attention. We'll investigate to determine what's going on. You’re not worrying too much at all. To get a better understanding, I’d like to ask a few more questions. Have you experienced any numbness or tingling in your leg, besides the pain?
PATIENT: Yes, sometimes. It's not all the time. Mostly in my toes, on that same leg. Like they are… falling asleep. It comes and goes, but it’s there. It’s worse when the pain is really bad. And it feels…cold. Even when my leg isn’t cold. Does that make sense? It’s a weird feeling.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Numbness, tingling, and a cold sensation in your left toes, correlating with the pain. That's helpful information. Now, have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder function – any difficulty or changes in urination or bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… No. Not really. Everything’s… normal there, I think. Sorry, that’s a personal question. But no, nothing different. I haven't had any trouble with that.
DOCTOR: It is a personal question, and you're right to point that out. I ask because it's important to rule out certain possibilities. Thank you for being so open. Now, let’s talk about your medical history a little more generally. Besides the cancer treatment, do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a little while, but the medicine fixed it. And my knees bother me sometimes, old age, I guess. But that’s it. Nothing major. Just the usual aches and pains. And the cancer, of course. But we already talked about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so managed hypertension and some knee pain. And we will certainly keep your cancer history in mind. Have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Just my appendix when I was a kid. A long, long time ago. That's it. Nothing else. Oh! And I had a wisdom tooth pulled, but that doesn’t count, does it? It was just a tooth. It wasn’t a surgery surgery.
DOCTOR: No, a wisdom tooth removal doesn't count as a major surgery. So just the appendectomy as a child. Now, I'd like to ask about your family history. Is there a history of back problems, arthritis, or cancer in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… My mother had arthritis in her hands, really bad. And my brother had some kind of bone cancer, a long time ago. But he lived a long time after that. My father… I don't really remember. He died when I was little. And I didn’t know much about his family. Does that help? I'm not very good at remembering all that.
DOCTOR: That's very helpful, Ms. Meigs. Arthritis in your mother and a history of bone cancer in your brother—we'll make note of that. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t have all the details. Finally, can you tell me about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean? Like, what do I do for fun? Is that what you want to know? Because I don’t do much these days. It’s hard to get around.
DOCTOR: I apologize for the terminology. It’s a bit of a medical term! I just want to know a bit about your daily life. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh! Okay. No. I don’t smoke. Never have. And I don’t drink much alcohol. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner sometimes, that’s it. And no, I don’t do any drugs. Never have. I'm a pretty boring person, I guess. I mostly just stay home and watch TV. It's not very exciting.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. There’s nothing wrong with a quiet life. And thank you for being so open. Okay, Ms. Meigs, that gives me a good overview. Now, I'd like to do a physical examination to get a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… be gentle, please? It hurts a lot.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Meigs. I will be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Then, I’ll check your reflexes and strength in your legs. Finally, I’ll examine your back, checking for tenderness and range of motion. Please let me know immediately if anything causes you significant pain. Alright, take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Another deep breath… and exhale. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes... could you please lie flat on your back for me?
PATIENT: Okay. That’s a little uncomfortable. But I’m okay. Just… take your time. And be careful with my back, please.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your reflexes are normal and equal bilaterally—meaning both sides are the same. And your strength is 5/5 in both legs, which is good—full strength. Now, I’m going to examine your back. Please tell me immediately if anything is particularly painful. Okay, I’m starting on the right side… any pain here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes! Right there. That hurts a lot. It feels… tender. Like a bruise, almost. And when you push on it… it sends a sharp pain down my leg. Please be careful, Doctor. That really hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Tenderness and radiating pain with palpation on the right lower back. That’s very important information. Now, I’m going to check your range of motion. I’m going to ask you to gently bend forward, but only as far as is comfortable. Please stop if you feel any significant pain. How far can you bend without increasing your pain?
PATIENT: I can only go this far. It hurts too much to go any further. It feels like something is pulling on my back. And it makes the pain in my leg worse. It’s… scary, Doctor. I'm afraid I’ll make it worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion with increased pain. That’s all very helpful information, Ms. Meigs. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and the physical exam findings—tenderness over the right lower back, radiating pain down the left leg, limited range of motion—it's concerning. Given your history of cancer, we need to rule out a few possibilities. It could be a muscle strain or a disc issue, but we also need to be certain that it’s not related to your previous treatment. I would like to order an X-ray of your lower back to start, and possibly an MRI if the X-ray is inconclusive. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An MRI? That sounds…serious. Does that mean you think it is the cancer? I don’t know…I'm scared of what they might find. But… if you think it’s necessary, then yes. Do what you think is best, Doctor. But please explain everything to me, okay? I don't want any surprises. And…how long will it take to get the results?
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to be scared, Ms. Meigs. An MRI provides a much more detailed picture of the soft tissues in your back than an X-ray, and it will help us rule out any serious issues, including whether or not the cancer has spread. It doesn’t necessarily mean I suspect the cancer is the cause, but given your history, it's the most cautious approach. We'll start with the X-ray first, which is quicker and less expensive. If the X-ray doesn’t give us enough information, then we'll proceed with the MRI. I will explain all the findings to you in detail, and we'll discuss the best course of action together. The X-ray results typically take a few hours to come back. If we need an MRI, it may take a day or two to schedule and another 24-48 hours to get the results. I'll have my nurse contact you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a mild pain reliever and a muscle relaxant to help manage your discomfort. And I recommend avoiding any heavy lifting or strenuous activity. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… okay. Pain reliever and muscle relaxant… that's good. And avoiding lifting… I can do that. It's not like I'm doing much anyway. Thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything. And for not rushing. I appreciate it. Just… please let me know as soon as you have the results. I don’t want to wait around and worry.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I understand your anxiety, and I assure you, I will let you know the results as soon as they are available. My nurse will schedule a follow-up appointment for us to discuss them in detail. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor Reisig. You've been very kind. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Meigs. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns or questions before your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and take care.
