DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. My name is Dr. Christopher Neppl. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here that you are a new patient with us. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Neppl. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh dear… what brings me in… It’s… the pain, I suppose. In my lower abdomen. It comes and goes, you see, and it’s been… troubling me. I do have… something the other doctors call SLE. Is that what this visit is about? I confess, I don’t always remember everything they tell me.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Glymph. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t recall all the details; that’s what I'm here for. SLE, or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, is an autoimmune condition, and it’s good you’ve already been diagnosed. It’s certainly possible the pain you’re experiencing is related to that, or something else entirely. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the pain for me?
PATIENT: Hmm… describe it… well, it’s not a constant ache, you understand. It comes in waves, almost. Sometimes it’s a sharp, cramping feeling… and other times it’s more like a dull pressure. It's… lower down, of course, as I said. And it feels… different each time, truthfully. I wish I could be more precise, Doctor. It's very unsettling when it flares up. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Glymph. “Waves” and a varying quality – sharp cramping versus dull pressure – that’s helpful information. And you mentioned it's located in your lower abdomen. Could you point to where you're feeling the pain most prominently?
PATIENT: Yes, right… about here. It’s not always in the exact same spot, mind you. Sometimes it radiates a bit, goes off to the sides, but this is generally where it starts. And it feels… deeper, not just on the surface, if that makes sense. It’s not like a bruise, or a muscle pull. It’s… inside. Oh dear, I hope I’m not being too vague. It’s difficult to explain.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being vague at all, Ms. Glymph. Describing pain can be very challenging. “Deeper” and radiating—that’s good to know. And the location is helpful. Now, can you tell me about how long this pain has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… how long… It feels like… a while now. Not a new thing, certainly. The SLE… it comes and goes in flares, you see. And I think the pain started becoming more frequent during one of those flares… perhaps six months ago? Or was it eight? It’s hard to pinpoint, Doctor. It's not been constant, but it’s definitely been… a recurring issue for several months, at least. It's been worrying me more recently, as it's becoming more intense.
DOCTOR: Thank you for clarifying. Several months of recurring pain, becoming more intense recently—that’s important information. Given your history of SLE, and the fluctuating nature of your symptoms, we need to consider a number of possibilities. To help me narrow things down, could you tell me if anything specifically triggers the pain?
PATIENT: Triggers… hmm. That’s a good question. I don’t know if anything specifically sets it off, Doctor. I try to be careful with my diet, avoid too much sun… things the other doctors have suggested for the SLE. But the pain… it seems to come on randomly, sometimes after I’ve been active, sometimes when I’m resting. I haven't noticed a clear pattern, I’m afraid. Stress, perhaps? I do worry quite a bit, which I suppose isn’t helpful. But I can’t say for certain if that causes it. It just… happens.
DOCTOR: I understand. No clear triggers identified, potentially related to activity or stress. That’s helpful. Now, aside from the pain, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying it?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me see. Well, sometimes I feel a bit… fatigued, you know? Tired, even when I’ve had enough sleep. And occasionally, I’ve had some… digestive issues. Not severe, but a bit of bloating, perhaps some discomfort. And I think I’ve been having more frequent urination lately, but that could just be… well, getting older. I’m not always the best at noticing these things, Doctor. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, occasional digestive issues, and increased urinary frequency. Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Glymph. It’s good you’re letting me know everything you’re experiencing, even if you’re unsure about it. Now, let's talk a bit about your medical history. You mentioned you have SLE. Are you currently taking any medications for it?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Let me see… I take… hydroxychloroquine, I believe. And sometimes, when the flares are bad, the doctor prescribes a short course of prednisone. It helps with the pain and inflammation, but I try to avoid it when I can. It has… side effects, you know? And I take a daily vitamin D supplement, as the doctor said my levels were low. Oh, and something for my blood pressure, a small pill. I think it’s… lisinopril? I apologize, Doctor. I really should keep a better record of these things. My daughter tries to help, but… it all gets a bit muddled sometimes.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Ms. Glymph. Many patients have difficulty keeping track of their medications. Hydroxychloroquine, prednisone as needed, vitamin D, and lisinopril. That’s very helpful. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a severe reaction to anything, thankfully. I’m a little sensitive to some perfumes, they can give me a headache, but that’s not really an allergy, is it? And I try to avoid shellfish, just because I don’t particularly like the taste. But no, no known allergies to medications or anything that would cause a serious reaction. I’ve always been quite lucky in that regard, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know, Ms. Glymph. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your past medical history, besides the SLE. Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… let me see. Oh, yes. When I was quite young, I had my tonsils removed. And… many years ago, I had a hysterectomy. That was… necessary, the doctor said. And I think… I had a small procedure on my knee once, years ago, for a torn meniscus. But those were all quite a long time ago, Doctor. Nothing recent, thankfully. I try to avoid hospitals when I can.
DOCTOR: Tonsillectomy, hysterectomy, and a knee meniscus repair. Thank you. And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… hmm. My mother had… arthritis, I believe. And my father had high blood pressure, like me. My sister… she had some heart problems, later in life. Nothing too serious, as far as I know. It's difficult to recall everything, Doctor. My family wasn’t very forthcoming with medical details, if you understand. It wasn’t something we discussed much. I apologize for being vague.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Glymph. Many families don't discuss medical history in detail. Arthritis, hypertension, and some heart problems in your family. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. I’ve never smoked a day in my life. My mother always warned me about the dangers of it. And I always took her advice. I prefer fresh air, if you understand.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. And how about alcohol consumption?
PATIENT: Oh, very little. I might have a small glass of wine with dinner occasionally, perhaps once or twice a week. But I don’t drink regularly, and it’s always in moderation. It’s more of a social thing, if you understand. I don't really need it, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. And finally, do you have any physically demanding job or hobbies?
PATIENT: Oh, no, nothing like that these days, Doctor. I used to be a ship engineer, but I retired several years ago. Now, I mostly enjoy reading, gardening, and spending time with my family. Nothing too strenuous, if you understand. Mostly quiet activities, to keep me out of trouble. It's a more relaxed pace of life these days, which I appreciate.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that information with me, Ms. Glymph. It’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and do a basic neurological assessment. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, Doctor. Please, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable, alright?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. I'm listening to your heart now. Take some deep breaths for me. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Now, I'm going to gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if you feel any tenderness in a specific area. Okay, I do notice some mild tenderness in your lower abdomen, particularly in the left lower quadrant. It's not severe, but it's present. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes and assess your neurological function. Your reflexes are normal, and your neurological function appears intact. Overall, the exam findings are consistent with abdominal discomfort, and the tenderness I’m palpating seems localized to your left lower quadrant. Based on your history and the physical exam, several possibilities come to mind. Given your SLE, a flare-up is certainly possible. However, other conditions, such as diverticulitis, a urinary tract infection, or even constipation, could also be contributing to your symptoms. To help narrow down the diagnosis, I’d like to order some laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a urinalysis. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible, Doctor. If you think tests are necessary, then please, do order them. I trust your judgment. I just want to know what's causing the pain, and hopefully, find some relief. I confess, it's been rather unsettling, not knowing.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Glymph. It's certainly unsettling not knowing the cause of your pain, and we'll do everything we can to get to the bottom of it. The lab work should give us a clearer picture. I’m also going to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. This will allow us to visualize your organs and identify any potential abnormalities. It does involve radiation exposure, but the benefits outweigh the risks in this case, given your symptoms and medical history. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A CT scan… Radiation… Oh dear. I suppose if you think it’s necessary, then alright. But… is it absolutely essential, Doctor? I've always been a bit wary of those sorts of things. Could we not try something else first? Perhaps… more blood tests?
DOCTOR: That’s a very reasonable question, Ms. Glymph, and I completely understand your concerns about radiation exposure. You’re right to ask. While further blood tests might provide some additional information, they are unlikely to give us a definitive diagnosis in this case. The CT scan is the most effective way to visualize your organs and rule out serious conditions like diverticulitis, appendicitis, or other structural abnormalities. However, we can certainly discuss alternatives. We could start with an ultrasound of your abdomen. It doesn’t involve radiation, but it's not as sensitive as a CT scan for detecting certain conditions. It's a reasonable first step, but if the ultrasound is inconclusive, we may still need to proceed with the CT scan to get a clear diagnosis. What are your thoughts on starting with an ultrasound?
PATIENT: An ultrasound… No radiation… that does sound preferable. If it can give you some information, then yes, let's try that first, Doctor. That would certainly put my mind at ease. And if it doesn’t show anything… well, then we can discuss the CT scan again, alright?
DOCTOR: Excellent. An ultrasound is a good first step, and I agree, we can reassess the need for a CT scan if the ultrasound is inconclusive. I’ll order that for you right away. The lab work and the ultrasound will need to be scheduled. I have a nurse who will contact you shortly to arrange those appointments. In the meantime, to help manage your discomfort, I recommend taking an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, as long as you don’t have any contraindications. And be sure to drink plenty of fluids. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so, Doctor. You’ve been very thorough, and I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly. I trust your recommendations, and I’ll be sure to follow them. I suppose I'll just wait for the nurse to call and schedule the appointments. Thank you again for your time and attention. It's been a relief to finally discuss this with someone.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. I’m glad I could help. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen before your appointments. We're here to support you. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again to discuss the results.
