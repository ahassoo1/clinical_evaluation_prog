DOCTOR: Good morning, Carmaleta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Auelua. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so let’s just get straight to it. I want to get pregnant, and I want it to…you know…work the first time. No problems. Is that something you can…guarantee? My husband…well, he’s gone now, and I don’t want to mess around with years of this.
DOCTOR: I understand, Carmaleta. That’s perfectly reasonable, and I appreciate you being so direct. It’s completely natural to want things to go smoothly, especially given your circumstances. Unfortunately, I can’t guarantee a pregnancy, or that it will happen on the first try – there are a lot of factors involved. However, we can absolutely do everything we can to optimize your chances of a healthy pregnancy. To start, let’s talk a bit about your overall health and medical history. Have you had a check-up recently?
PATIENT: A check-up? Honestly, not really. It’s been…a while. Look, I generally feel fine. I eat okay, I think. I mean, I try to. And I don’t…do anything bad. Is that what you want to know? I just want to know what I need to do to make this happen. My insurance is pretty good, so money isn’t the biggest issue, but I really don’t want a lot of fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's perfectly alright. We'll work with where you are at. It's good to hear you generally feel well. It's helpful to have a baseline understanding of your health, even if everything feels okay. We'll do some basic tests to get a better picture. Let’s start with a bit of your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Ugh, this is what I was afraid of. Look, my husband always handled all that. Doctors and…papers. I just…went. I don’t remember being told anything bad. Maybe? I mean, I had the usual…women’s stuff, you know. Pap smears and…things. He said everything was always fine. He’d tell me if something was wrong, wouldn’t he? Honestly, I really don’t know. Is this important? Because if it’s not going to change anything, I’m not sure I’m remembering all of this.
DOCTOR: It's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed, Carmaleta, and it’s very common for partners to take the lead on medical details. Don’t worry, we’ll take it slowly. It is important, but we'll figure things out even if we don't have all the details right now. We can look through your records – do you know which hospital or clinic you typically went to?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. He…he just took me. Somewhere in the city, I guess. A big building. It was…a while ago. Look, is this going to take long? I have a hair appointment this afternoon, and I really can't be late. I need to look presentable, you know? If I am pregnant, people are going to…notice. And I don’t want to start all this fuss if it’s not even going to…work. So can we just get to the point?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns about time, Carmaleta. Let’s see what we can do efficiently. Since we don't have a clear medical history readily available, and given your desire to get pregnant quickly, I think it's best to do some initial blood work and a quick physical exam. The blood work will check for things like immunity to common infections, and basic hormone levels. The physical exam will just be a standard check-up – weight, blood pressure, listening to your heart and lungs – and a pelvic exam to check your overall reproductive health. It shouldn’t take too long. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…hurry. And please, don't ask me a lot of questions. I don’t remember things, and it just makes me anxious. Can someone just…take the blood? And then…do whatever you need to do. I have a good insurance plan, so I don’t want to hear about costs. Just…get it done. The faster this is over, the better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Carmaleta. We’ll keep things as quick and efficient as possible. I’ll have the nurse come in to take your blood first. Then, I’ll do a quick physical exam. I’ll keep my explanations concise, and we can skip anything you’re not comfortable with. Nurse Davies, could you please come in and draw Carmaleta’s blood?
PATIENT: Fine. Just…make it quick. I really don't like needles. And don’t talk to me about…things. Just the blood. That’s all. I have better things to do. Honestly, I don't know why I even bothered coming in here. It's probably just going to be a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Of course, Carmaleta. The nurse is very skilled, and it will be over quickly. I’ll be right here if you need anything. Just focus on your breathing, and let me know if you feel any discomfort. We'll get through this together.
