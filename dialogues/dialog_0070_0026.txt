DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh… good morning to you too, Doctor. Abady, you said? Hmm. Well, it's this… tiredness. Just dreadful tiredness. Comes on suddenly, you see. Makes me feel… well, useless. And the young man at the lab said something about… numbers? Not good numbers, he said. I don’t keep track of such things. It's just… exhausting, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. Exhausting is certainly a good way to describe it. And it’s helpful to know the lab mentioned some concerning numbers – we’ll definitely look into those. Could you tell me a little more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: More about it? Well… it just happens. One minute I’m puttering about, maybe tidying the garden, and the next… I just have to sit. Or lie down. It’s not like being a little sleepy, Doctor. It’s… a weight. A terrible weight. And it doesn't go away quickly, you know? Sometimes it lasts a day or two. Though I can’t quite recall the last time, truthfully. Things aren’t as clear as they used to be.
DOCTOR: I see. So it comes on rather abruptly and feels more like a significant weakness than just feeling sleepy. You mentioned it lasts for a day or two sometimes. Has this been happening for a long time, or is it a recent development?
PATIENT: Oh… a long time, I suppose. Years, probably. Though I always kept busy, you see. A body needs to be kept busy. My husband, bless him, he doesn’t understand. He just says I should rest more! As if resting will fix it. It’s always been there, this tiredness… it just seems… worse lately. Perhaps it’s the heat? It's been a dreadful summer.
DOCTOR: It sounds like this has been a long-standing issue, and that's important to know. You're right, it's good you recognize it might be worsening. And the heat could certainly be a contributing factor. To help me get a clearer picture, could you tell me if anything specifically seems to trigger these episodes of tiredness?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm… I don’t know about triggers. I mean, I do a lot of… work. Commercial diving, you see. It's not easy work, Doctor. Lots of… lifting and bending. And the water’s cold. Always cold. Perhaps that? Though I’ve been doing it for years! It's... well, it's my profession. I don’t see why the water would suddenly bother me now. It’s really quite perplexing.
DOCTOR: Commercial diving – that is physically demanding work. And you’ve been doing it for years. So it sounds like it’s not necessarily a new activity causing this. You mentioned lifting and bending – do you experience any pain with that, or is it just tiring?
PATIENT: Pain? Not usually… just aches, you know? Old lady aches. I’m not as young as I used to be, Doctor. But it’s not a sharp pain, nothing that stops me. It’s just… everything feels heavier. Like I’m wading through mud. And sometimes, after a particularly long job… my muscles just feel… weak. Like they won’t respond. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: I understand. So, aches rather than sharp pains, and a feeling of heaviness and muscle weakness, particularly after strenuous work. That’s helpful. Now, let’s talk about other things going on with your body. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? Hmm. Well, I’ve never been one for a large appetite, you see. My husband tries to get me to eat more, always fussing. I eat enough to keep going, I suppose. Not much different than usual. Though… I have been a bit… queasy lately. Not sick, mind you, just a little unsettled. It comes and goes. Probably just the heat. Everything is unsettled in this heat.
DOCTOR: Alright, so appetite is generally stable, though you have experienced some occasional nausea. That’s good to know. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits recently – any constipation, diarrhea, or changes in the color of your stool?
PATIENT: Oh… goodness. You're asking a lot of personal questions, Doctor. I… well, let's just say an old lady doesn't discuss such things with strangers. It's all… regular enough. I haven’t noticed anything out of the ordinary. Really. Let’s not dwell on that, shall we? It's quite… unpleasant to talk about.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to set that boundary, Ms. Oitker. My apologies – I sometimes forget that these questions can be quite personal. We can certainly move on. Now, have you experienced any shortness of breath, or any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… sometimes. After a particularly long dive, perhaps. It’s not alarming, mind you. I just need to rest a bit. And my ankles… yes, they swell a little. My husband fusses about that too. Says I should elevate them more. It’s just… old age, I suppose. Everything sags and swells when you get old.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Medications? Just the usual things for an old lady, Doctor. Something for my blood pressure, I think. And… something for my arthritis. But I can’t quite remember the names. My husband handles all that. He’s very organized. Allergies… no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. Though I do get a bit… irritated by his fussing. Does that count?
DOCTOR: I understand. We can certainly get a list of your medications from your husband. That will be very helpful. Now, before we move on to a brief physical exam, could you tell me a little about your family history?
PATIENT: Family history… oh dear. That’s a long story, Doctor. My parents… they were Bhutanese, you see. Very different life. I don’t really know much about their… ailments. They didn’t talk about such things. My husband’s family… they were… well, they were English. Very proper. I don't recall any particular illnesses. Just… proper people.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Ms. Oitker. We don't need a detailed family history if you don't have that information readily available. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. This will just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and looking at your ankles. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh… a physical exam? Well, I suppose so. I haven't had one in ages. Though I’m not particularly fond of doctors poking and prodding. But… if you must. Just be gentle, please. My bones aren’t as strong as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Oitker. I'll be as gentle as possible. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out… good. Your heart sounds… regular, but a little bit faint. And I'm hearing some mild crackling in your lungs, particularly at the bases. I'll need to listen more carefully to determine the significance of that. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 150/90. A little elevated, which isn't entirely unexpected given what you’ve told me. And you're right, your ankles do have some noticeable swelling. I'm going to gently press on them to see if there is any pitting edema. Yes, there is some moderate pitting edema. Now, I'm going to take a look at your hands and feet. I notice some mild redness in your hands. Now, based on what you've told me and the findings of this exam, there are a few things I'm considering. You’ve described longstanding fatigue, with recent worsening. You also have elevated blood pressure, mild crackling in your lungs, ankle swelling, and mild redness in your hands. I would like to order some blood work to help me narrow down the possibilities. This will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid stimulating hormone test. We should also consider an EKG to evaluate your heart rhythm. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear. So many tests. It all sounds very… serious. Is it something dreadful, Doctor? My husband will be very worried. I don't want to cause him undue stress. And… an EKG? What does that involve? I really don’t like the sound of all this poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Oitker. It doesn't necessarily mean something dreadful, but it's important to investigate these findings to get a clearer picture of what's going on. The tests will help us rule out potential causes for your symptoms. An EKG is a very simple, painless test. We simply attach a few small stickers to your chest and arms to measure the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn’t involve any poking or prodding. It's completely non-invasive. Based on your symptoms and the physical exam, I'm considering possibilities like heart failure, kidney problems, or an underactive thyroid. But we need the test results to confirm or rule out these conditions. We are just gathering information at this stage. To be cautious, and since you mentioned the recent fatigue, I would also recommend a chest x-ray to assess your lungs more thoroughly. Do you have any questions about any of these tests?
PATIENT: Chest x-ray… Oh, goodness. That sounds… invasive. I don’t like the sound of that at all. Is it absolutely necessary, Doctor? I mean, my lungs feel… fine. A little crackly, you said, but not bad. And my husband… he’s very particular about radiation. He reads a lot, you see. He’ll worry terribly. Perhaps we could just skip that one? And… what if the tests show something awful? I don't think my heart could handle it.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Oitker, and I appreciate you sharing your concerns with me. You’re right to ask questions. The chest x-ray involves a very small amount of radiation, and the benefits of obtaining this information outweigh the risks in your case. The crackling I heard in your lungs could indicate fluid buildup, which could be a sign of heart failure or another lung condition. It’s important to rule out these possibilities. However, I certainly don't want to cause you undue stress. We can discuss delaying the chest x-ray if that's your preference, but I would strongly recommend it. If we proceed with the blood work and EKG, and the results are inconclusive, we may need to revisit the option of a chest x-ray. The blood work and EKG will give us some initial insights, but they don't always provide a complete picture. If the results are concerning, we may need to consult with a cardiologist for further evaluation. Before we proceed, would you like me to explain the potential risks and benefits of each test in more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's all so… overwhelming. A cardiologist… that sounds dreadful. My husband… he’ll insist on second opinions, and then third opinions, and it will just be endless worry. Tell me… is this something… contagious? I don’t want to risk infecting anyone. My neighbor, Mrs. Higgins, has been feeling poorly lately, and I wouldn’t want to… you know. And… what if it is my heart? What kind of treatment would I need? I don't want surgery. I absolutely do not want surgery.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly understandable that you’re feeling overwhelmed, Ms. Oitker. It’s a lot to take in. Let’s address your concerns one by one. First, no, this is not contagious. It’s not an infection, so you don’t need to worry about infecting Mrs. Higgins or anyone else. Regarding treatment, it's too early to say what kind of treatment you might need. If the tests reveal a heart problem, the treatment options will depend on the specific diagnosis. In many cases, heart problems can be managed with medication and lifestyle changes. Surgery is often a last resort, and we would certainly explore all other options before considering it. In fact, many cardiac interventions are now done through non-surgical methods, such as angioplasty and stenting. Let’s focus on getting the tests done first. I understand your concern about surgery, and I can assure you that we will discuss all treatment options thoroughly before making any decisions. We will also get a second opinion if that makes you more comfortable. Now, would you like me to schedule the blood work and EKG for you?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Schedule the tests, I suppose. But… could my husband come with me? I feel… much better when he’s there. He can ask the questions I forget to ask. And… he’ll know what to do if anything… dreadful happens. And… please, make sure they are gentle. I really don’t want any poking and prodding.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Oitker. Your husband is more than welcome to accompany you to the tests. I’m happy to answer any questions he may have as well. And I assure you, the technicians are very gentle and experienced. They will do their best to make you feel comfortable. I’ll schedule the blood work and EKG for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. The lab is located just down the hall, and the EKG will be performed in the cardiology department, which is on the second floor. I’ll have the receptionists provide you with a detailed map and instructions. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to call the office. We’re here to support you through this. Here’s a summary sheet with all the appointment information, and the contact information for the lab and cardiology department. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, I think… that’s all for now. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with my… fussing. I appreciate it. I just… hope it’s nothing serious. My husband will be very worried.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Oitker. I understand your concerns, and I'm happy to help in any way I can. We'll do our best to get to the bottom of this and provide you with the best possible care. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your appointments tomorrow. Have a good rest of your day, and I’ll see you then.
