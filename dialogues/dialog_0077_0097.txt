DOCTOR: Good morning, Marija. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s nice to meet you. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you as well. I understand you have forms regarding… end-of-life wishes? My husband suggested I come. He worries unnecessarily, but… he insisted. I would like the paperwork, please. I’d prefer to get this over with efficiently.
DOCTOR: Yes, of course. Your husband is quite thoughtful to consider this, Marija. It's always best to be prepared, and we respect those wishes. I do have the advance directive forms here. However, before we delve into those, if you don’t mind, I would like to briefly discuss your current health. It’s standard procedure, even when the primary concern is advance care planning. It helps me understand your overall wellbeing. It doesn't need to be lengthy, just a general overview. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Doctor, with all due respect, I came for a form. My health is… satisfactory. I assure you, I maintain a proper lifestyle. I eat well, I exercise, and I don't burden the medical system with frivolous complaints. Must we really go through a recitation of my daily habits? I’m perfectly capable of filling out the paperwork myself; I'm a literature teacher, after all. I assure you, my comprehension is quite good.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Marija, and I apologize if I’ve caused any inconvenience. You are absolutely right, you are perfectly capable of completing the forms yourself. It's simply my professional responsibility to ensure I have a basic understanding of your current health status before finalizing any legal documents. It's a matter of due diligence, truly. Perhaps we can make this quick. Just a few general questions, if you're amenable. No detailed recitations, I assure you. Are you experiencing any new or unusual symptoms?
PATIENT: Very well. A few questions, then. But please, Doctor, no patronizing inquiries about whether I’m “getting enough sleep.” I assure you, my life is quite organized. And no, I am not experiencing any “new or unusual symptoms.” I would know if I were. Is that sufficient? May we proceed to the forms now?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is perfectly sufficient, Marija. Thank you for your patience. Excellent. Now, these forms cover your wishes regarding medical treatment should you become unable to express them yourself. We’ll go through them section by section. Do you have a designated healthcare proxy – someone you trust to make decisions on your behalf if you cannot?
PATIENT: Of course I do. My husband, Jean-Pierre. He is… perfectly capable. Though, frankly, I anticipate I will always be lucid enough to manage my own affairs. He simply… worries. It's his nature. Is there a section to simply name him, or must I provide a detailed biography of his excellent character?
DOCTOR: No biography required, Marija. Just the name and contact information will suffice. Here, on this section labeled “Healthcare Proxy,” you can simply write his full name, address, and phone number. And his relationship to you, which, as you mentioned, is your husband. Would you like to fill that out now?
PATIENT: Jean-Pierre Dubois. 14 Rue de la Paix, this town. The number is… 555-1234. Satisfied? Is there anything else requiring my tedious input before we conclude this… exercise?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is perfect, Marija. Thank you. Now, this next section pertains to your wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment. It's a bit more involved, asking about things like mechanical ventilation, artificial nutrition, and resuscitation. You can choose from a few options: you can indicate you want all life-sustaining treatment, none at all, or specify which treatments you would or wouldn’t want. It’s perfectly alright if you need some time to consider these options. It's a very personal decision. Would you like me to explain any of the terms in more detail?
PATIENT: Explain? Doctor, I teach post-secondary literature. My students grapple with far more complex concepts than “mechanical ventilation.” Honestly. But… very well. Perhaps a brief clarification. What exactly constitutes “artificial nutrition?” Is this merely a feeding tube, or are we discussing… more invasive procedures? I'd prefer to avoid anything… undignified. And resuscitation… does that include the… chest compressions? My husband has a rather… dramatic flair for such things.
DOCTOR: Excellent questions, Marija. It’s important to be clear on these terms. “Artificial nutrition” generally refers to providing nutrients through a feeding tube, either through the nose or directly into the stomach or intestines. It’s used when someone is unable to eat or absorb nutrients on their own. And “resuscitation” refers to attempts to restore a heartbeat and breathing if they stop. This can include chest compressions, as you mentioned, as well as other measures like administering medication and providing oxygen. It’s a rather involved procedure, and it's understandable to have concerns about that. We can certainly document your preferences to avoid anything you deem undignified. Would you like me to highlight those sections for you, so you know exactly where to indicate your choices?
PATIENT: Highlight, then. Yes, that would be… acceptable. I suppose. I would prefer no chest compressions, under any circumstances. And artificial nutrition… only if it is temporary. I have no desire to be sustained by tubes indefinitely. It is… barbaric. Highlight those sections, Doctor. And perhaps a brief explanation of the options available for each? I prefer to make informed decisions, even if they are… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Marija. I’m happy to provide that clarification. Here, under chest compressions, you have three options: “Full Resuscitation” – meaning all life-saving measures will be attempted; “Do Not Resuscitate” – meaning no attempts will be made to restore your heartbeat or breathing; and “Conditional Resuscitation” – meaning you want resuscitation only under specific circumstances. Given your preference, you would likely choose “Do Not Resuscitate.” And here, with artificial nutrition, you have options regarding the duration of treatment: “Temporary,” meaning it will be discontinued after a certain period; “Permanent,” meaning it will continue indefinitely; and “Conditional,” meaning it will continue only under specific circumstances. You mentioned wanting it only if temporary, so you would choose that option. Does that explanation clarify things for you?
PATIENT: Adequate. Do Not Resuscitate. Temporary. It is… tedious, but I suppose it must be done. Is there anything else? I would prefer to conclude this… ordeal as quickly as possible. I have more pressing matters to attend to. Grading papers, for instance. A far more dignified pursuit, I assure you.
DOCTOR: Just a few more sections, Marija, regarding your overall values and wishes for end-of-life care. This is where you can express your preferences for pain management, spiritual support, and who you'd like to be present during your final moments. This section allows you to indicate your preferences for pain relief, even if it might hasten your death. It's a difficult topic, but important to consider. There’s also a section where you can write down any specific instructions you might have for your loved ones. You are under no obligation to fill out these sections if you are not comfortable doing so. We can simply sign the form as it is. Would you like me to leave you to complete it at your own pace?
PATIENT: Pain management, of course. I expect adequate pain relief. That is… basic decency. As for spiritual support… I require none. And my husband will handle any “instructions” that need conveying. He is… rather insistent. Leave me to it. I can manage the remaining formalities. I simply want to be finished with this… unpleasantness. And then, perhaps, I can return to the far more civilized world of literature.
DOCTOR: Very well, Marija. I will leave you to it. Please take your time. Once you’ve completed the form, just let the receptionist know, and she will have it witnessed and finalized. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.
