DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I’m Dr. Vanochten. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Oh, goodness. Well, it’s my ears, you see. They just… aren’t what they used to be. Things are a bit muffled, like talking through cotton. Not sure when it started, really. Just… gradually, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Muffled hearing that's come on gradually. Can you tell me, is it both ears, or is it worse in one than the other?
PATIENT: Oh, good question. Let me think… I believe it’s both, yes. But… maybe the left one is a little bit worse? It’s hard to say, really. I don’t pay much attention, to be honest, until someone has to repeat themselves. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. And has anything specific happened that you can think of that might have triggered this, even something minor?
PATIENT: Hmm… triggered it? Not that I recall. I used to work in a shoe factory, lots of noise from the machines, of course. But that was… oh, goodness, years and years ago. I don’t think it’s that. Just… old age, I suppose. Is that it?
DOCTOR: Possibly. We’ll need to rule some other things out first. Aside from the muffled hearing, have you noticed any ringing in your ears, any pain, or any dizziness?
PATIENT: Ringing… Sometimes, yes. A sort of… high-pitched whine, but it doesn’t last long. Just comes and goes. No pain, thankfully. And no dizziness, no. Just… can’t hear as well. It’s a bit embarrassing, to be honest. I have to ask people to speak up all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Just a little something for my blood pressure, I think. A small white pill. And allergies… not that I know of. Never had any trouble with that sort of thing. Though, I haven’t been eating much lately, so maybe I’d react to something now! Heh. Though that's not an allergy, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Okay. Do you recall the name of the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that’s a good question. No, I really don’t. It’s a little white pill, like I said. The doctor just… gives it to me. I have it delivered, you see. I don’t bother trying to remember all the names, too much trouble. Is it important?
DOCTOR: It is helpful if we can identify it, but we can work around it. Alright. And have you had any recent illnesses – a cold, the flu, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… I had a bit of a sniffle last winter, I think. Nothing major, just a common cold. Didn't last long. And before that… hmm. I tend to just rest when I’m feeling poorly, you know? Don’t go to the doctor for every little thing. Waste of time, if you ask me. I'm a pretty sturdy old fellow.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let's do a quick examination of your ears just to get a better look. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that sounds sensible. Whatever you think is best. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Schneer. I’m looking in your ear now. It appears there's some wax buildup in both ears, but it's more significant in the left, as you mentioned. The eardrum itself appears intact, but it’s difficult to get a really good view with the wax present. Similar findings on this side – wax buildup, eardrum appears okay. I'm also noting some age-related changes, which is common. Now, I'm going to listen to your hearing with this little device. It won’t be painful, just a little bit of sound in your ears.
PATIENT: Sounds alright to me, Doctor. Wax buildup, you say? Well, that explains things, doesn’t it? I always did have a bit of… ear gunk. Go ahead with the listening, then. Just let me know if it’s going to be loud. I don't want to be startled!
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. I'm just going to play some tones at different frequencies and ask you to indicate when you hear them. Okay, the results confirm some hearing loss, particularly in the higher frequencies, which is common with age and wax buildup. It appears to be mild to moderate, and thankfully, relatively symmetrical - meaning both ears are affected similarly. Now, I suspect the wax buildup is contributing significantly to your symptoms. We can try a simple wax removal procedure in the office today. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Well, that’s… not entirely surprising, is it? Mild to moderate… sounds about right. And symmetrical, you say? Fancy that. Wax removal… yes, I think that would be good. Get rid of the gunk, then maybe I can hear my grandkids properly again. What does it involve, Doctor? Is it… painful? Don't want to be screaming the place down!
DOCTOR: It’s usually quite comfortable, Mr. Schneer. We’ll use a small syringe with warm water to gently flush out the wax. It might feel a little bit of pressure, like a tiny bubble in your ear, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’ll explain the procedure in more detail before we begin. I’ll also check your ears again afterward to make sure we’ve removed everything. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Warm water, you say? That sounds… sensible. Not too cold, I hope! A tiny bubble… well, I can handle a tiny bubble. Yes, go ahead, Doctor. Let's get rid of this gunk, then. I appreciate you explaining it all so thoroughly. It puts an old fellow's mind at ease.
DOCTOR: Alright, excellent. Let me just prepare the water and some ear drops to soften the wax first. It will only take a minute. While I'm doing that, is there anything else you'd like to discuss today?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, Doctor. Just my ears, really. Though… now that you mention it, my knees have been a bit creaky lately. But I suppose that's just old age, too! Don't want to bother you with all my aches and pains. Just focus on the hearing, if you don't mind. It's the grandkids I want to hear.
DOCTOR: Understood, Mr. Schneer. We’ll focus on the hearing today. We can address the knees at a separate appointment if they become more troublesome. Now, let’s get started with the wax removal. I’m going to tilt your head slightly to the side, and then gently irrigate your ear with the warm water. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort at any point, okay?
PATIENT: Right you are, Doctor. Just let me know if it's too cold! And I’ll try to stay still. Don’t want to make a mess. Go ahead when you're ready. I trust you.
