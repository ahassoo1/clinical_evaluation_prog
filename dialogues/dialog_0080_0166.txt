DOCTOR: Hi Tarin, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Dr. Rosanova. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. I’m here regarding some numbness in my leg. It’s… well, it’s been a bit bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, "bothersome" is good to know. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Certainly. It started, I believe, approximately three weeks ago. It’s primarily in my left leg, though it does occasionally…drift…into my foot. It isn’t constant, thankfully. More like a tingling, then a complete lack of feeling for a short while. It seems to be worse after I’ve been standing for extended periods, or if I’ve been very active. I work as a special effects artist, so there’s quite a bit of that.
DOCTOR: Three weeks…and worse with activity, that’s helpful. When you say “drift,” does it stay in just the left leg and foot, or does it feel like it’s moving up your leg at all?
PATIENT: It doesn't move up, not exactly. It remains contained to the leg and foot, but the area of numbness can expand, if that makes sense. Sometimes it’s just my toes, other times it’s my whole foot, and occasionally it creeps up to my ankle. It hasn't gone higher than my ankle yet, thankfully. I recall noticing it first while I was working on a motion capture project. A lot of walking and precise movements.
DOCTOR: Okay, expanding area, contained to the leg and foot, starting with the motion capture project. That paints a clearer picture. Have you experienced any weakness in your leg or foot at all?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I haven’t felt any weakness, no. But I did stumble a little last week while carrying some equipment. It wasn’t a major fall, thankfully, just a bit off balance. I initially attributed it to being tired, and the equipment was rather heavy. But now that you mention it… perhaps it wasn’t just fatigue. It's difficult for me to say definitively if it was related to the numbness.
DOCTOR: Right, stumbling could be significant. Okay, let's move on to some other things. Any pain accompanying the numbness?
PATIENT: Not consistently. There’s a mild ache sometimes, particularly after a long day, but it’s not sharp, and it’s easily manageable with over-the-counter pain relievers. It isn’t the pain that’s concerning me so much as the complete lack of sensation. The numbness itself is… unsettling. It feels as though my leg isn't quite there, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: I understand exactly what you mean—that lack of sensation is unsettling. Let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, no. I’ve always been quite healthy, physically active, even outside of work. I recall having a fairly standard childhood, all vaccinations up to date, no serious illnesses. I haven’t had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything significant. I do have private insurance through my employer, so I’ve had regular check-ups, though they haven’t detected anything unusual.
DOCTOR: Good. Any family history of neurological conditions – things like multiple sclerosis, neuropathy, or anything similar?
PATIENT: That’s a thoughtful question. Let me recall… My maternal grandmother, on my mother’s side, did suffer from some nerve issues in her feet later in life. She wasn’t formally diagnosed, as far as I know, but she often complained of tingling and numbness, similar to what I’m experiencing. It was…attributed to age and circulation problems, primarily. She was of Yupik descent as well, if that’s relevant. I don’t recall any other neurological conditions in the family, though my parents weren’t particularly forthcoming about health matters.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good information to have. And you mentioned you're Yupik; do you have any experience with, or knowledge of, any health conditions common within the community?
PATIENT: That’s a pertinent question. Yes, actually. While not directly experienced by me, there is a noted prevalence of peripheral neuropathy within some Yupik communities, often linked to dietary factors and historical patterns of food insecurity. Historically, our diet relied heavily on traditional foods, which were rich in certain nutrients. With changes in lifestyle and access to food, there’s been an observed increase in related nerve issues. I recall hearing stories from elders about similar symptoms, often dismissed as simply “growing old.” It’s…a concern that's been discussed within the community, particularly as it relates to modern dietary habits.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s very helpful context. Thank you for sharing that. Let's quickly run through a few other things. Any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of. I recall being tested for common allergies as a child, and the results were all negative. I have no known food allergies, and I haven’t experienced any adverse reactions to any medications in the past. I do occasionally use over-the-counter pain relievers, as I mentioned, and those haven’t caused any issues. I recall having a slightly sensitive skin to certain detergents, but it’s a minor irritation, not a true allergy.
DOCTOR: Good. Are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, I am not. I prioritize a healthy diet and get sufficient exercise, so I don’t find the need for supplements. I recall attempting a Vitamin D supplement during the winter months a few years ago, but I found it didn't make a noticeable difference, so I discontinued it. I don’t take any prescription medications, nor do I have any chronic health conditions that require regular treatment. I recall being quite careful about what I ingest, both for health and professional reasons.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, certainly. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I recall reading that a physical examination is a crucial step in diagnosis, and I’m happy to cooperate in any way that’s helpful. Please proceed at your convenience.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, if you could just lie down on the examination table, that would be great. First, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Then I’ll assess your strength and sensation in both legs and feet. I'll also take a look at your feet to see if there are any visible abnormalities. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: That sounds entirely appropriate. Yes, please proceed. I recall being quite cooperative during previous medical examinations, and I’ll do my best to remain still and provide accurate feedback. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Great. Okay, let's start with your reflexes. Right knee: 2+ … Left knee: 2+ … Right ankle: 2+ … Left ankle: 2+ … Normal reflexes bilaterally. Now, let’s check your strength. Can you push against my hand with your legs?
PATIENT: Certainly. Please proceed. I recall ensuring I didn’t tense my muscles during the reflex assessment. I’m attempting to apply a consistent force, if that's helpful. Is there anything specific you’d like me to do?
DOCTOR: That’s perfect, consistent force is exactly what I need. Okay, strength appears to be 5/5 bilaterally – meaning full strength in both legs. Now, let’s check sensation. I’m going to lightly touch your legs and feet with this cotton swab. Tell me when you can feel the touch, and where you feel it. We’ll start with your right leg.
PATIENT: Very well. I will close my eyes to avoid any visual cues. I feel it…here, on the outer side of my shin…and here, on my big toe…a slight tingling sensation there, but I can definitely feel it. I believe the sensation is slightly diminished on the outer edge of my foot, compared to the rest of my leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Diminished sensation on the outer edge of the foot, noted. Now, let’s repeat that on your left leg.
PATIENT: Proceeding. I feel it…here, on my calf…and here, on my heel…but the sensation is considerably weaker on the outer side of my foot, similar to my right leg, but more pronounced. It feels…numb, almost, on the very edge of my foot. It takes longer to register the touch, and it’s a much fainter sensation overall. I’m attempting to be as precise as possible, but it’s difficult to pinpoint the exact location due to the diminished sensation.
DOCTOR: Okay, more pronounced diminished sensation on the outer edge of the left foot. That’s helpful. Visually, your feet appear normal. No swelling, redness, or obvious deformities. No tenderness to palpation, and no lumps or masses detected. Okay, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your cooperation.
PATIENT: You are very welcome. I recall ensuring I remained still and provided accurate feedback throughout the examination, and I am glad to have been of assistance. It was a thorough assessment, and I appreciate your careful attention to detail. What are your initial thoughts?
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on the exam—normal reflexes and strength, but diminished sensation on the outer edges of both feet, more pronounced on the left—along with your history, especially the family history of similar symptoms and the reported association with activity, several possibilities come to mind. It could be peripheral neuropathy. Given your Yupik heritage and the community’s documented history, this is definitely something to consider. It could also be a nerve entrapment issue, like compression of the peroneal nerve – that's the nerve that runs along the outside of your leg. Your work as a special effects artist, with a lot of walking and precise movements, could be contributing to that. However, to rule out other causes and get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a couple of tests. First, a nerve conduction study and electromyography to assess the function of the nerves in your legs and feet. This will help determine if there’s nerve damage and where it’s located. I also want to check your vitamin B12 levels, as a deficiency can cause neuropathy. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds entirely reasonable, and I appreciate your thorough explanation. I recall reading about both nerve conduction studies and vitamin B12 deficiencies, and I agree that further investigation is warranted. Considering my family history and occupation, those tests seem logical and appropriate. I am happy to proceed with both the nerve conduction study and the vitamin B12 level check. Would you like to schedule those appointments now, or should I contact my primary care physician?
DOCTOR: Excellent. We can schedule those here. I'll put in the orders now. Okay, I've ordered the NCS/EMG and the B12 level check. The lab is just down the hall; they'll contact you to schedule an appointment. It usually takes a few days to get everything done. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and decide on a treatment plan. In the meantime, try to avoid activities that exacerbate the symptoms – prolonged standing, intense walking, anything that makes the numbness worse. Over-the-counter pain relievers are okay for any discomfort, but I don’t want you to rely on them long-term. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Thank you, Dr. Rosanova. That is very helpful, and I appreciate you taking the time to explain everything so clearly. I recall noting all of your recommendations, and I will certainly avoid activities that exacerbate the symptoms and refrain from long-term use of pain relievers. I do have one question, if you don’t mind. Given the potential link to my heritage, are there any specific lifestyle modifications or dietary changes I should consider in addition to avoiding exacerbating activities? I recall reading that certain foods and practices may be beneficial for nerve health, and I am eager to proactively address this issue.
DOCTOR: That’s a great question, and I’m glad you’re thinking proactively. Considering the potential connection to peripheral neuropathy within the Yupik community, and historically dietary factors, there are a few things to consider. Firstly, ensure you’re getting enough omega-3 fatty acids. These are important for nerve health. Fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines are excellent sources, but you can also get them from flaxseed, chia seeds, and walnuts. Secondly, maintaining stable blood sugar levels is crucial. High blood sugar can damage nerves. A diet rich in whole grains, lean protein, and plenty of fruits and vegetables is key. Finally, and this might be the most important, if possible, incorporate traditional foods back into your diet. These foods were historically rich in nutrients essential for nerve health. If you have access to them, I highly recommend it. However, be mindful of portion sizes and overall balance. I'm not advocating for any drastic changes, just a conscious effort to incorporate healthier options and traditional foods where possible. Do you have access to traditional foods?
PATIENT: Yes, fortunately, I do. My family still practices some traditional fishing and gathering, and we have access to salmon, berries, and certain types of seaweed. I recall my grandmother emphasizing the importance of those foods for overall health, and it seems her wisdom was well-founded. I appreciate your specific recommendations, Dr. Rosanova. I will certainly prioritize incorporating those foods back into my diet, and I will continue to monitor my symptoms closely. Is there any additional information or resources you would recommend regarding peripheral neuropathy and traditional Yupik diets? Perhaps a website or organization that specializes in this area?
DOCTOR: Excellent. That’s fantastic that you have access to those traditional foods. That’s a huge advantage. Regarding resources, there isn't a single comprehensive resource specifically linking peripheral neuropathy and Yupik diets. It's a bit of an under-researched area. However, the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium website ) has some information on health and wellness within Alaska Native communities, and it may be a good starting point. Also, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke website ) has a lot of general information about peripheral neuropathy, including causes, symptoms, and treatments. Finally, if you’re interested in learning more about traditional Yupik foods and practices, I can provide you with some contacts within the community who may be able to offer guidance. Do you think you'll be able to incorporate those foods into your diet?
PATIENT: Yes, I am confident I can incorporate those foods into my diet. My family is very supportive, and we prioritize maintaining our traditions. I recall many conversations about the importance of preserving our cultural heritage, and that includes our dietary practices. I appreciate you providing those resources, Dr. Rosanova. I will certainly explore the ANTHC website and the NINDS website, and I would be grateful for any contacts within the community that you can provide. I believe we have covered everything for today. Thank you again for your time and expertise. I feel much more informed and optimistic about addressing this issue. I will await the lab’s call to schedule the tests.
DOCTOR: Wonderful. I'm glad I could help. I'll email you the contact information for a couple of elders in the community who are knowledgeable about traditional foods and practices. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your tests. And remember, we'll discuss the results and create a plan together. Take care, Tarin. I hope you feel better soon.
