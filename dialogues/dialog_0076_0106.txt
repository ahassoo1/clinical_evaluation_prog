DOCTOR: Alright, Mrs. Cannington, good to see you…or, well, to meet you. I’m Dr. Ruocco. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hm. Well, it’s my foot. It’s just…awful. Been bothering me for weeks now, and it's not getting any better. It’s a sore, really. A nasty one, and it hurts. I haven’t been able to walk properly, and that's not ideal, you understand. Not ideal at all for someone my age.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, weeks. At least. Maybe longer, honestly. Time does funny things when you’re in pain, doesn't it? I thought it would just…heal. You know, like cuts used to. But this one…it just gets worse. I’ve tried putting creams on it, the ones my daughter sent, but they haven’t done a thing. She means well, but she doesn't understand these things. Living in the city…it’s a different world.
DOCTOR: Right. And where exactly on your foot is this sore?
PATIENT: On the bottom, mostly. Right near my heel, but a bit towards the side. It’s red, and…well, it’s not a pretty sight. And it’s deep. Not just a surface thing, you understand. I don’t like poking around at it myself, it makes me feel faint, and my eyesight isn’t what it used to be. Honestly, it looks infected. I’ve seen pictures.
DOCTOR: Infected, you say. Hmm. And any fever, chills, or red streaks going up your leg?
PATIENT: Goodness, no. No fever, thankfully. And no streaks, no. Just the sore. A very stubborn, very painful sore. I do have the sugar, you know. The doctor back home—old Dr. Kim—he said I had to watch it. He always warned me about my feet. Said if anything happened, to get it looked at right away. He was a good doctor, Dr. Kim. Much better than some I’ve met.
DOCTOR: Diabetes. Okay. And are you currently taking anything for that?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. Little white pills. Two of them every morning. And I try to watch what I eat, but it’s hard. Everything tastes so much better with a little sugar! My daughter sends me those sugar-free things, but they taste like cardboard. She means well, but really. I used to be very strict, but after my husband passed…well, what’s the point, you know? It's just me now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s take a look at this foot. Can you please sit back and lift your leg up for me?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. Be gentle, now. It's quite sensitive. And don't be alarmed if I flinch. It’s just…a very unpleasant sensation. There. Is that alright? I hope you have good lighting. These old bones don’t bend like they used to, you understand.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Yes, alright. It is quite inflamed. There’s a definite break in the skin…and some…discharge. Not a huge amount, but it’s there. It’s deeper than I initially thought. And I do see some redness extending slightly up your heel. We need to rule out a more serious infection. I’m going to order some blood work, and we’ll likely need an X-ray to see if there’s any bone involvement. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Bone involvement? That doesn’t sound good at all. Blood work, yes, I suppose that's necessary. X-rays…well, I don't like radiation, you understand, but if it’s important… Yes, do what you have to do. Just…please be quick about it. And try not to poke around too much. It really does hurt. Is this going to take long? I have a bit of an appointment later this afternoon. With the church ladies. We're making quilts for the children. A very important cause, you understand.
DOCTOR: Alright, we'll get the orders in for the blood work and X-ray right away. It shouldn't take too long. The X-ray tech will be as quick as possible. In the meantime, I’m going to clean this wound and apply a sterile dressing. It’s important to keep it protected. We'll also need to start you on an oral antibiotic, just to be safe. I'll have the nurse explain everything. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Allergies…hm. Let me think. I used to be allergic to penicillin, many years ago. But that was a long time ago. I haven't taken it since…well, I don't remember when. And I’m not sure about everything else. Honestly, I take so many pills, I can’t keep track. My daughter handles most of that. Perhaps she knows. But I’m generally alright, you understand. I’ve always been a strong woman. Just a bit worn down lately. But please, no penicillin. That always made me feel dreadful. Absolutely dreadful.
DOCTOR: Alright, no penicillin. We’ll make sure of that. The nurse will get a list of your current medications and check for any potential interactions. We'll start with a broad-spectrum antibiotic, just to cover all bases. Let me call her in now to get things started. It'll be a few minutes before she's here, so try to relax. Nurse, can you come in here, please?
PATIENT: Well, that sounds sensible. Broad-spectrum, you say? Very good. I’d rather not be lying here all day, if you don’t mind. And please tell the nurse to be gentle. I've had enough poking around for one afternoon, thank you very much. My feet are my livelihood, you understand. Even if I don’t walk as much anymore. Quilting requires a steady hand, and steady feet. A very important craft, you know. Very important indeed.
