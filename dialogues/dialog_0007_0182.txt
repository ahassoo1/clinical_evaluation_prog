DOCTOR: Hi Werner, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you too, Doctor. Though I must say, a bit young to be a doctor, aren’t you? Anyway, it’s this…procedure. My daughter insisted I get a check-up beforehand. Says it's “standard practice” these days. Honestly, it feels like a waste of time, but here I am. It's for some…work. On my face.
DOCTOR: Age doesn't always reflect experience, Werner, but I appreciate the comment! And it's excellent your daughter is so proactive about your health – she's right to be cautious. A check-up before any procedure is always a good idea, just to make sure everything is optimal. So, this “work” on your face… could you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Honestly, it’s a bit embarrassing. It’s… a facelift. There. I said it. Getting old isn’t for the faint of heart, and gravity isn't my friend anymore. My daughter says I look “tired.” Tired! I’ve been working hard my entire life, of course I look tired! But she’s paying for it, so…here we are. Now, are we going to poke and prod me all day, or is there a point to this visit? I have things to do, you know.
DOCTOR: No embarrassment at all, Werner. It’s very common, and you’re absolutely right to want to be in the best possible shape for it. And it's wonderful your daughter is supporting you. We definitely don't want to spend all day poking and prodding! Just some standard questions to get a baseline, make sure there aren’t any underlying things that could affect the procedure or recovery. First, let’s talk a little bit about your overall health. Do you have any medical conditions – like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: High blood pressure, maybe? The doctor mentioned something about it years ago, but I don't take any pills for it. I felt fine then, I feel fine now. Aside from the…sagging, of course. And I had a bit of a bad knee from all the years on the job – terrazzo work isn’t exactly easy on the joints, you know. Mostly just aches, nothing serious. Honestly, I’m a pretty sturdy Norwegian. We don't tend to fall apart easily. Do you need me to list every little ache and pain from the last eighty years?
DOCTOR: No, absolutely not every ache and pain! Just the things that might be relevant. High blood pressure is good to know, even if you aren’t currently medicated. We'll check your blood pressure today to see where things are at. And the knee is helpful too. Have you been diagnosed with arthritis or any other joint problems in that knee?
PATIENT: Arthritis… no, not officially. The doctor said something about “wear and tear,” but that was decades ago. It flares up sometimes, especially when it’s cold. Mostly just a bit of stiffness. I can still get around, I still do work when I can, though it's not like the old days. Really, I'm not one to complain. Back in my time, you just toughed things out. You didn’t go running to the doctor for every little twinge. Honestly, I’m starting to think this whole visit is unnecessary.
DOCTOR: I understand your perspective completely, Werner. Your generation definitely had a different approach to healthcare, and there's a lot to be said for resilience. We just want to make sure we have a full picture before proceeding, and to minimize any potential complications. Okay. Let's move on to medications. Besides anything you might take occasionally for pain, are you currently taking any prescription medications?
PATIENT: No. Nothing. Like I said, I don't believe in filling myself with pills just to appease doctors. I take a little fish oil, if that counts. My daughter keeps telling me I should be on something for my cholesterol, but I refuse. It’s all just… unnecessary, if you ask me. Now, are we nearly done here? I have a lunch date.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. Fish oil doesn't typically interfere with procedures. I appreciate you being upfront about your preferences, Werner. We're almost through the main questions. Just a couple more to finish up. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, latex, anything like that?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had any. I eat everything. I've lived a full life, I've eaten things you wouldn't believe. Now, honestly, if this is all you were going to ask, I could have just filled out a form. This is a complete waste of my time. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. People depend on me.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Werner. I assure you, this is more than just filling out a form. We need to hear your answers, to get a sense of your overall health and how you feel. Alright, one final section before we do a quick physical exam. Have you had any previous surgeries or hospitalizations?
PATIENT: Let me think…hmm. I had my appendix out when I was a boy. That’s about it. Nothing major. A broken arm once, fell off a roof. That was…a long time ago. No hospitalizations, not unless you count when my daughter dragged me in for a check-up once. Which, frankly, feels like a hospitalization. Is that it? Can we please get on with this now? I’m starting to feel faint. Probably from all the questions.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendix removed, broken arm. Good to know. Alright, let's do a very quick physical exam. Just listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a quick look at your overall condition. Nothing invasive, I promise. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don't expect me to lie still for long. I have things to do. And if you tell me I need to start taking cholesterol pills, I'm walking out. Just so you know.
DOCTOR: Okay, blood pressure is a little elevated, 148 over 82. Heart sounds are good, lungs sound a little quiet, which is not uncommon with age, but we’ll keep an eye on it. Your abdomen feels fine. Now, let’s just take a quick look at your knee. Can you bend it for me?
PATIENT: There. Happy? It pops. It always pops. And it hurts. Not terribly, but it's not exactly comfortable. Honestly, I told you it wasn't good. It’s just old. Like me. Can we please stop poking around now? I feel like I’m being dissected. My daughter is going to hear about this, you know. She thinks you doctors are all miracle workers. You're not. You’re just…question-askers. And prodders.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see some slight swelling and I felt a little bit of tenderness when I touched around the side of your knee. The popping is likely from some wear and tear, as you mentioned. Alright, Werner, I think we have enough information for now. Based on what you've told me and the quick exam, you have some elevated blood pressure and some expected wear and tear in your knee. Your overall condition seems stable, but we should address that blood pressure. Before we discuss a plan, do you have any family history of heart disease, high blood pressure, or stroke?
PATIENT: Family history? My father lived to be ninety, working on the docks his entire life. Smoked like a chimney, drank hard liquor every night. Never saw a doctor in his life. My mother… she was the same. Tough Norwegians, both of them. Heart disease? No. They just… died when they were old. Naturally. It was the weather, probably. Now, are you going to tell me I need to start taking pills, or are we going to discuss this “procedure” I came here for? Because frankly, I’m losing patience. I have a lunch date, you know. With important people.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Considering your family history and your overall condition, we don’t necessarily need to jump to medication right away. However, elevated blood pressure can increase your risk of complications during the facelift, so we should monitor it. To be safe, and before proceeding with the procedure, I’d like to get a baseline EKG – just to check your heart rhythm – and some blood work to check your cholesterol and kidney function. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: An EKG? Blood work? More poking and prodding? Honestly, this is ridiculous. It's just a facelift. Not open-heart surgery. I'm starting to regret agreeing to this whole thing. My daughter will be thrilled. She always wants me to get "tests." Tests, tests, tests. Fine. Do your tests. Get it over with. But if they find anything, I’m walking out. And tell her to stop trying to turn me into a medical specimen. I'm a perfectly healthy eighty-one-year-old man, despite what the blood pressure reading says. Now, where do I sign these forms? I have a lunch date, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Werner. It's not about turning you into a medical specimen, it's about ensuring your safety and a smooth recovery. These tests are just a precaution. These forms are just standard consent forms for the EKG and blood work. I’ll have the nurse come in and draw the blood and get you set up for the EKG. It will just take a few minutes. Once we have the results, we can discuss a plan for the facelift and whether any adjustments are needed. And please, don’t hesitate to ask any questions you have. I want you to feel comfortable and confident with everything we do. The nurse will be with you shortly. I'll be back to discuss the results as soon as they're available.
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. But if this takes too long, my lunch will be cold. And don’t expect a tip. This whole thing is a waste of time.
DOCTOR: I understand. We'll do our best to be as efficient as possible.
