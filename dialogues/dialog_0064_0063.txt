DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Meigs. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Smetak. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Um, my back. It’s been really bad. Worse than usual, I think. It hurts to move, even just sitting here.
DOCTOR: Okay, your back… and you say it’s worse than usual. That’s good to know. Can you tell me a little more about it?
PATIENT: Well, I… I had cancer a few years back. They did treatments, and it went away, but now it’s back, and the pain… it’s in my back, mostly. It started slow, just a little ache, but now it’s… sharp sometimes. And it makes it hard to sleep. I don’t know if it’s the cancer again, or just… old age, maybe?
DOCTOR: I understand. It's concerning when pain returns after cancer treatment. We'll definitely look into this carefully. So, you had cancer previously, and you’re experiencing back pain now that’s gotten sharper and is affecting your sleep. Just to clarify, about how long ago did you complete your cancer treatments?
PATIENT: Let me think… It was… 2020, I think. So, about five years ago. They said everything was good after that, no more cancer, but… well, here we are.
DOCTOR: Five years ago… alright. And this pain, when did it start to bother you?
PATIENT: Hmm… it started, maybe, three months ago? Just a little ache, like I said. I didn’t think much of it at first. I thought I just slept wrong. But it just kept getting worse. Now it’s… hard to ignore.
DOCTOR: Okay, three months ago, starting as a mild ache and progressively worsening. And you mentioned it's making it difficult to sleep. Can you describe the pain a little more specifically?
PATIENT: It’s… hard to explain. It’s not just one kind of pain. Sometimes it’s a dull ache, like a heavy weight on my back. Other times it’s sharp, like a stabbing feeling. And sometimes it shoots down my legs a little. It's mostly in my lower back, but it does go up higher sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a variety of pain – dull ache, sharp stabbing, and some radiating down the legs. That gives me a better picture. Now, does anything specifically make the pain worse?
PATIENT: Yes! Bending over, for sure. And lifting things… even just groceries. Sitting for too long isn’t good, either. I try to move around, but it still hurts. And sometimes, if I cough or sneeze, it really shoots through my back.
DOCTOR: Okay, bending, lifting, prolonged sitting, and coughing or sneezing all aggravate the pain. And are there things that make it better?
PATIENT: Um… lying down helps a little. And sometimes, if I take a warm shower, it feels better for a bit. But it doesn’t last long. Mostly, nothing really makes it good. Just… less bad sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Lying down and warm showers provide some temporary relief. Now, Ms. Meigs, I’m going to ask a few questions about your overall health. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel or bladder habits recently?
PATIENT: Oh. Um… yes, actually. A little. I have to go to the bathroom more often, and… sometimes it’s hard to go. Like I’m not emptying everything, you know? I didn't think it was important, but...
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for telling me. That is important. And have you experienced any weakness or numbness in your legs or feet?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. My feet feel… tingly sometimes. And my legs feel weak when I walk for too long. It’s not all the time, but it’s been happening more often lately.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tingling in your feet and weakness in your legs… Okay. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Besides the cancer treatment, do you have any other medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I have high blood pressure, but I take medicine for it. And my knees bother me sometimes, old age, I guess. But that’s it.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication, and some knee pain. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me think… It’s… Lisinopril, I think. And a water pill, Hydrochlorothiazide. I take them every morning.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide. And do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. They’ve given me lots of medicine over the years, and I haven’t had any bad reactions.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, before we do a quick physical exam, I'd like to ask about your family history. Is there a history of cancer, back problems, or arthritis in your family?
PATIENT: Yes… my mother had cancer. Breast cancer, I think. And my father had bad back problems when he got older. Lots of pain, he couldn’t walk much. And my grandmother had arthritis, really bad in her hands.
DOCTOR: Okay, a family history of breast cancer, back problems, and arthritis. Thank you. Now, Ms. Meigs, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do.
DOCTOR: Alright. Okay, if you don’t mind, I'm going to gently palpate your spine and lower back to check for tenderness or any masses. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, right… there. It’s really tender there. And… a little bit higher up, too, but not as bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness in your lower back, specifically to the left of your spine. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes and muscle strength in your legs. Please relax your legs for me. And can you please lift each leg one at a time?
PATIENT: Okay. It’s… hard to lift my right leg all the way. It feels weaker than my left leg.
DOCTOR: Okay, I noticed some diminished strength in your right leg. Everything sounds clear. Alright, Ms. Meigs, based on your history and the physical exam, it sounds like you're experiencing a combination of issues. The tenderness in your lower back, combined with the pain radiating down your legs, the weakness in your right leg, and the changes in your bowel and bladder habits are concerning. Given your history of cancer, we need to investigate this thoroughly.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound good. What do you think it is? Is it the cancer again?
DOCTOR: It's too early to say definitively whether it's the cancer returning, Ms. Meigs. Those symptoms can be related to cancer, but they can also be caused by other things. We need to rule out other possibilities first. Given your history, I want to order some imaging to get a better look at your spine and surrounding structures. I'm thinking an MRI of your lumbar spine would be the most helpful. That will allow us to see if there’s any compression of the nerves, any evidence of a tumor, or other structural issues. We'll also do some blood work to check for inflammation and rule out other potential causes of your pain. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. An MRI and blood work… okay. Will it take long to get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay. The blood work results should be back within a couple of days. The MRI will take a little longer, probably 3-5 business days to schedule and then to get the results. My office will contact you as soon as we have them. In the meantime, I want to recommend that you continue to take it easy, avoid any strenuous activity, and continue with the warm showers and lying down when you're experiencing pain. I'm also going to prescribe you a mild muscle relaxant to help ease some of your discomfort while we wait for the results. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: A muscle relaxant… okay, that sounds good. Will it make me sleepy? And… what if it is the cancer again? What happens then?
DOCTOR: That's a good question. Yes, the muscle relaxant can cause some drowsiness, so I'll start you on a low dose and we can adjust it if needed. Avoid driving or operating heavy machinery if you feel sleepy. And regarding the possibility of it being cancer again… if that is the case, we have options. Treatment has come a long way in recent years, and depending on the location and extent of the cancer, we can discuss options like chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery. We’d also discuss palliative care options to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. We will have a thorough discussion about all your options if that becomes the diagnosis, and I will be here to support you every step of the way. Right now, let’s focus on getting those tests done so we have a clear picture of what’s going on. Do you have any allergies to medications that I should be aware of before I write the prescription?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Like I said, I haven’t had any bad reactions to medicine before. But… maybe check if it interacts with my blood pressure medicine? Lisinopril and Hydrochlorothiazide. Just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Okay, it looks like there are no major interactions between the muscle relaxant and your blood pressure medications, but it's good you asked. I'll print out the prescription for the muscle relaxant and a referral request for the MRI. My office will schedule the MRI for you. They’ll also give you instructions on how to prepare for it. Do you have any other questions or concerns before we finish today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I’m still scared, but I feel a little better knowing we’re doing something.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Meigs. It’s completely understandable to be scared, and I'm glad I could help ease some of your anxiety. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your tests. We're here to support you. We'll get those tests scheduled and get to the bottom of this. I'll see you back here once we have the results. Have a good day, and please take it easy.
