DOCTOR: Well, good morning, Ms. Fabing. I’m Dr. Fourney. Have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Fourney. It’s nice to meet you too. I’m just here to get some forms filled out, really. Medicare sent me a bunch and said I needed a doctor to sign off on ‘em. Nothing’s wrong, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Forms, alright. Medicare always has forms. Still, it's good to get a baseline, even if you're feeling well. It's my job to make sure everything stays that way, you understand. Just so I can properly sign off, let’s go through a quick medical history, okay?
PATIENT: Sure, that sounds good. No problem at all. Where do we start? I guess… my birthdate is November 12th, 1989. Does that help?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s a start. Age 35. Good. Now, let’s talk about why you’re here today, even if it’s just for paperwork. Any specific concerns that prompted Medicare to send these forms?
PATIENT: Hmm… I don't think anything prompted them, exactly. I just had my yearly check-up with my tribal health services a few months back, and everything was fine then. I think they just send ‘em to everyone on Medicare, you know? Just to be safe. I haven’t been sick or anything.
DOCTOR: Right. "Just in case." Always. Still, we need to document everything. Let's go through a quick review of systems, just to be thorough. Have you experienced any… unusual fatigue lately?
PATIENT: No, not really. I work pretty physical job, installin’ valves and stuff, so I’m usually tired after work, but that’s normal. Not like… unusually tired during the day, if that makes sense. I get enough sleep, usually. Seven or eight hours.
DOCTOR: Alright, seven to eight hours is good. And no fever, chills, or night sweats?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I haven't felt a fever in years, thankfully. And I definitely haven't been sweatin' through the night. My husband would tell me if I was, he’s a light sleeper!
DOCTOR: Good. Any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. I eat pretty normally, I guess. Maybe gained a few pounds over the winter, but that happens. I try to eat healthy, but it's hard with my job. Lots of fast food on the go sometimes. No big changes though, like losing a ton of weight or anything. I’d say I’m around 170, maybe 165? I don’t weigh myself too often.
DOCTOR: Okay. And any problems with your… digestion?
PATIENT: Nope, no problems there. Everything’s… regular. Sorry if that’s too much information.
DOCTOR: It's… necessary. Alright. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, or palpitations?
PATIENT: No, none of that. My heart feels fine. Sometimes it races a little after I’ve been liftin’ heavy stuff, but that’s just from the work, I think. Not like a flutterin’ or anything, just… fast. And it goes away pretty quick. I haven't been havin' trouble breathin’ at all. Is this normal for a check-up, even if it’s just for forms? It’s a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: It is a check-up, Ms. Fabing. Even if it's prompted by paperwork, I need to get a complete picture of your health. It's my professional responsibility. Now, any joint pain or swelling?
PATIENT: Okay, I understand. You’re right. Sorry for asking. Uh, joint pain… sometimes my knees ache after a long day at work. Lots of bendin’ and squattin’ and stuff. It’s not constant, just… sore. And sometimes my back aches too. Probably just from the lifting, like I said. No swelling, though. It doesn't feel like arthritis or anything.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any headaches, vision changes, or dizziness?
PATIENT: No headaches lately, thankfully. My vision's been fine, I had my eyes checked last year and didn't need new glasses. And no dizziness or anything like that. I get a little motion sick sometimes if I’m a passenger in a car, but that’s been happening forever. Nothing new there. Should I be worried about all this questioning, Dr. Fourney? It’s makin’ me a little nervous.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fabing, I am conducting a medical history. It is standard procedure. You said you were here for Medicare forms, but I need to be thorough. Now, any skin changes, rashes, or sores?
PATIENT: No, nothin' like that. My skin's been fine, I don't think. A few freckles, but that's just from bein' outside. No rashes or anything worryin'. I haven't noticed any new moles or anything changin'. I just... I don't usually get this worked up about doctor stuff. I usually just see my tribal health services, and it's more about preventative care. This feels different.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fabing, I understand your concern. It sounds like you’re accustomed to a different type of medical care. My role here is to ensure a comprehensive assessment, regardless of whether you're presenting with specific symptoms. Now, to finish the review, any changes in your urinary or bowel habits?
PATIENT: No changes there. Everything's… normal. I haven’t noticed anything different. Sorry if that's too personal, I just don't know what else to say. I feel like I’m makin’ a big deal out of nothin’. I just want to get the forms signed and be done.
DOCTOR: Ms. Fabing, you are not making a big deal out of nothing. I am obligated to ask these questions. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No allergies, thankfully. Nothing I know of, anyway. My husband says I react to poison ivy sometimes, but that's just a rash, not a real allergy. No problems with medications, either. I haven’t had to take much, thankfully. Just over-the-counter pain relievers sometimes. Is that… is that everything?
DOCTOR: Almost. What medications are you currently taking, even over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Uh… well, like I said, just ibuprofen sometimes, for aches and pains. And maybe a multi-vitamin every now and then, but not regularly. That’s it, really. I don’t take anything prescribed, and I try to avoid taking pills if I can. I don’t have any medical conditions that require medication, thankfully. Is that everything now? I really appreciate you bein’ thorough, Dr. Fourney. I just… I get anxious at doctors.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on to your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Never been diagnosed with anything, thankfully. I've always been pretty healthy. My mom had high blood pressure, but I haven't had any problems myself. I get check-ups regularly with my tribal health services, and they always tell me I’m in good shape. I hope I’m not makin’ this harder than it needs to be.
DOCTOR: Have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No, never had any surgery. Not even tonsils! I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. No broken bones, either. Just a few scrapes and bruises over the years. Nothing serious. Is that all?
DOCTOR: And what about your family history?
PATIENT: Okay, let's see… My mom, like I said, had high blood pressure. My dad passed away a few years ago from… well, just old age, I guess. He had some heart trouble towards the end, but it wasn’t diagnosed or anything. My brother is healthy, as far as I know. No major illnesses in the family, really. My grandma on my mom’s side had arthritis, but that’s about it. Does that help? I’m not sure what you need to know exactly.
DOCTOR: And finally, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Sure. Um… I've been married to my husband, David, for ten years now. We don’t have any kids. I work as a control and valve installer, like I mentioned earlier. It’s pretty physical work. I don’t smoke, and I only drink alcohol occasionally, like at holidays or special occasions. I don't use any drugs. I live on the reservation, with my husband. We don't travel much, mostly stay close to home. I spend most of my free time with family and friends. Does that cover everything?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Fabing. Based on the information you’ve provided, and given your relatively good health, I am completing the Medicare forms as requested. However, I do have a few observations. Your work is physically demanding. It is important to prioritize proper hydration and lifting techniques to prevent musculoskeletal injuries. Also, while you state no allergies, it’s always advisable to inform any healthcare provider of potential reactions, even minor ones. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. That makes sense. I appreciate you lettin' me know about the hydration and lifting stuff. I'll try to be more careful. And I will definitely remember to tell any doctor about the poison ivy thing, just in case. Thank you for bein' so thorough, Dr. Fourney. I feel much better now. And thank you for bein' patient with me.
DOCTOR: You’re welcome, Ms. Fabing. I will submit the forms to Medicare. If you experience any new or concerning symptoms in the future, please do not hesitate to seek medical attention. You may get dressed now. Have a good day.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Dr. Fourney. You too.
