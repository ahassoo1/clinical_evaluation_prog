DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Jezik. My name is Dr. Chagaris. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Chagaris, is it? Yes, well… it’s this shaking. Mostly in my hands, you see. It’s… bothersome. I don't rightly remember when it started, to be honest. Just… happened, I suppose. It’s why I’m here. Can we… get this over with quickly? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. We’ll do our best to be efficient. The shaking in your hands – when did you first notice it?
PATIENT: Honestly? I told you, I don’t remember. A while ago. Months, maybe? It comes and goes. Sometimes it's worse when I'm trying to… do something precise. Like, holding a cup of coffee. That's when I really notice it. It spills, you know? A lot. And it's embarrassing. But pinpointing when it started… that’s a tough one. My memory isn’t what it used to be. Is this important?
DOCTOR: It is important, Mr. Jezik, but don’t worry if you can’t recall the exact date. Even a general timeframe is helpful. So, you’ve noticed it’s more pronounced when you’re performing tasks that require fine motor skills, like holding a cup. Does it happen at rest as well, when your hands are simply lying in your lap, for example?
PATIENT: Hmm… lying in my lap… I… I don’t think so. Not usually. Though, I suppose I haven’t specifically looked. I mostly notice it when I’m trying to do something. Like, when I was working on the… the water plant. Fixing things. That’s when it was really bad. It makes it hard to tighten bolts, you know? Small things. Everything feels…slippery. Is that making sense? I’m not very good at explaining things these days.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Jezik. You’re explaining it very well. So, it’s primarily noticeable during activity, particularly tasks requiring dexterity. And you mentioned working on the water plant – is that your current occupation?
PATIENT: Yes, still at the plant. Though I’m… slowing down, you could say. Water and Wastewater. Been doing it a long time. Too long, maybe. It’s… physical work. Used to be, I didn’t even notice. Now… well, now everything is harder. The shaking doesn’t always happen at work, mind you. Just… when I need to be precise. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I’d really like to know what’s going on, and then be on my way.
DOCTOR: Yes, we are, Mr. Jezik. We're gathering information to understand what might be causing the shaking. Knowing your occupation is helpful. Before we proceed, could you tell me if you’ve noticed any other symptoms along with the shaking?
PATIENT: Other symptoms…? Let me think… Hmm. Not really. I get tired easily, I suppose. But I'm 79! That's just… old age, isn’t it? I don’t think anything else. Maybe a little… stiffness in my hands sometimes, but that comes and goes too. I wouldn't say it's anything major. Truth be told, I'm not one to pay much attention to my body. It just… does what it does. Is this important? I'm starting to feel a bit… overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: It's good you're telling me all of this, Mr. Jezik. The fatigue and occasional stiffness are helpful to know. It's certainly possible they are related to aging, but we need to consider everything. Now, have you noticed any changes in your balance or coordination?
PATIENT: Balance… no, not really. I haven’t fallen or anything. I walk… normally, I think. Maybe a little slower than I used to. But that’s just because of my age, right? I haven't bumped into things any more than usual. I… I don't know. It's hard to say. I haven’t been paying that much attention. Look, can we just get to the point? Is it something serious? I really don't have time for a long… investigation.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern and desire for a quick answer, Mr. Jezik. I want to assure you that we’ll do our best to determine the cause of the shaking efficiently. To help me understand what might be going on, I would like to perform a brief physical and neurological exam. This will involve checking your reflexes, strength, coordination, and balance. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… make it quick, Doctor. And don’t poke around too much. My body isn’t what it used to be, you know. I'm a practical man. I don't like fuss. Just tell me what’s wrong and how to fix it. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Jezik. I will be as efficient and gentle as possible. First, let’s check your reflexes. Please relax your arms completely. I’m going to tap on your tendons here, and you don’t need to do anything. Okay, those seem…slightly diminished, but within the range we sometimes see with age. Now, could you please close your eyes and extend your arms out in front of you, like you’re trying to balance?
PATIENT: There. Happy now? I'm not very steady, Doctor. You know, I'm not a young man anymore. Everything is… wobbly. Please hurry this up. It’s… unnerving, having my eyes closed like this. It’s making me feel… anxious. What are you looking for, anyway?
DOCTOR: It's alright, Mr. Jezik, you're doing fine. I'm looking for any involuntary movements or difficulty with coordination. Now, could you please touch your finger to your nose with your right hand?
PATIENT: There. See? It’s… difficult. My hand isn’t listening to me. It’s… frustrating. This is ridiculous. Are you sure this is necessary, Doctor? I'm telling you, it's just old age. I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Jezik. This is helpful information. Now, let's try that with your left hand.
PATIENT: There! See? It's getting worse! This is… embarrassing. I'm not an invalid, Doctor! I used to be able to do this with my eyes closed, no problem. What does it mean? Just tell me what’s wrong, already! This is taking too long. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Jezik. Thank you for your patience. Based on what you’ve told me and the brief exam I’ve performed, the shaking you're experiencing, along with the difficulty with coordination, is suggestive of a possible tremor. There are several potential causes for tremors, and it’s not always easy to pinpoint the exact reason without further investigation. Given your age and the nature of the symptoms, the most likely possibilities include essential tremor, which is a common neurological condition, or potentially a tremor related to some age-related changes. However, it’s important to rule out other potential causes. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order some blood tests to check your thyroid function and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Additionally, I think it would be beneficial to get a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive evaluation and potential imaging of your brain. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests… a neurologist… more tests… Honestly, Doctor, this is exactly what I was afraid of. Just… more fuss. Look, I'm an old man. I've lived a long life. Is this something serious? Will I… fall apart? I don't want to end up in a home. If it's just… a little shaking… and it's not going to get worse… maybe I can just live with it. I don't want to spend my last years running around to doctors and getting poked and prodded. Just tell me straight. Is this something I need to worry about?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Mr. Jezik. It’s perfectly reasonable to want to avoid unnecessary tests and procedures, especially at your age. To answer your question directly, it’s difficult to say definitively without further investigation. However, based on what we’ve discussed, the symptoms don’t immediately suggest a life-threatening condition. Essential tremor, for example, is not typically dangerous, although it can be bothersome and interfere with daily activities. However, it's important to rule out other possibilities, such as medication side effects or other neurological conditions, which could require different treatment approaches. Here’s what I propose: Let’s start with the blood tests. They are relatively simple and can provide valuable information. If the results are normal, we can then discuss whether or not a referral to the neurologist is necessary. You don’t have to commit to anything at this point. We can take it one step at a time. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Fine. Blood tests, then. Just… don’t keep me waiting all day. And try to find a nurse who’s gentle. I bruise easily, you know. But if the blood tests come back normal… I’m not going to the neurologist. Do you understand? I’ve had enough fuss for one lifetime. I just want to go home. Stop.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Jezik. We will proceed at your pace, and I will respect your decision either way. We’ll get the blood test order written up right away, and I’ll make sure to note your preference regarding the neurologist referral. I’ll also ask the nursing staff to be particularly gentle when drawing the blood. .
