DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Kelder. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Oh, goodness… well, it’s my stomach, mostly. Been feeling… off, for a little while now. It’s hard to explain, exactly. It just… doesn’t feel right.
DOCTOR: Okay, "doesn't feel right" is a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it’s mostly nausea, I suppose. Not all the time, but often enough to be bothersome. And… I don't seem to be able to eat much. Just a few bites and I feel full. It's… strange. I used to enjoy a good meal, you know? Now… not so much. It's been going on for… oh, dear. How long has it been? A few weeks, I think. Maybe a month? It all sort of blends together these days.
DOCTOR: A few weeks to a month, that’s helpful. And the nausea and early fullness – that gives us something to work with. When you say nausea, is it more like a queasy feeling, or do you actually feel like you’re going to be sick?
PATIENT: It's more… queasy, I think. Not like I’m going to, thankfully. Just… unsettled. Like something isn't agreeing with me, even when I haven't eaten anything. And it doesn’t really go away, just sort of… lingers. It's more annoying than anything, really. But it's making it hard to keep anything down, even the little bit I do try to eat.
DOCTOR: Okay, lingering queasiness with early fullness. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside that?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I've been a bit more tired than usual, I suppose. But I am 76, you know? So it's hard to say if that's anything new. Oh! And I think… maybe a little bit of weight loss? Not a lot, but my clothes feel a little looser than they used to. That’s about all I can think of right now.
DOCTOR: Okay, some fatigue and noticing your clothes feel a little looser – that’s good information. Let’s talk a bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear… medical history. That’s a long story. Well, I had my gallbladder removed years ago. A long time ago now. And… I was diagnosed with cancer a while back. It’s… in my abdomen. They’ve been treating it, of course. I see the oncologist regularly. Everything was… stable, last time I checked. But that was a couple of months ago, I think. I’m on Medicare, if that helps. I'm afraid I forget details easily these days.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Kelder. It’s helpful to know about the gallbladder removal and, of course, the history of cancer. Knowing you’re under the care of an oncologist is very important. Is the oncologist aware of this current issue with the nausea and decreased appetite?
PATIENT: I… honestly, I don’t remember. I have appointments so often, you see. And I don't always remember what I’ve told whom. I think I mentioned feeling a little tired at my last appointment, but not specifically the nausea or not being hungry. It just… seemed like part of feeling unwell from the treatment, maybe? It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s perfectly alright. It’s easy to get things mixed up with multiple appointments. We'll make a note of that to discuss with your oncologist if needed. Now, let’s talk about your medications. Can you tell me what medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh my. That’s another long list, I’m afraid. Let me see… there’s this one for my blood pressure… and another for my cholesterol. And this one is… oh dear, what is this one? It's from the oncologist, I think. It's a little purple pill. And I take something for my arthritis, too. Honestly, I don’t always know what they’re for anymore. I just take what the doctors tell me. It's all a bit much to keep track of.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. We can go through these together. Do you mind if I take a look at the bottles?
PATIENT: Not at all, dear. Please do. Honestly, I'm glad you're helping me sort this all out. It’s just… overwhelming sometimes. I'm a little worried, I suppose. Just… not feeling like myself.
DOCTOR: Okay, I see here you’re taking lisinopril for blood pressure, atorvastatin for cholesterol, a medication called capecitabine – which is a chemotherapy drug, and naproxen for arthritis. Any known allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I’ve been taking those for a while now, as you can see. I’ve never had any… reactions, as far as I know. Though, sometimes the naproxen makes my stomach a little upset, but I just take it with food. Oh! And I'm allergic to… penicillin! Yes, that's right. I remember that very clearly. I broke out in a rash when I was young.
DOCTOR: Okay, penicillin allergy noted. That’s important to know. Now, let's talk a little bit about your social history. Do you live alone?
PATIENT: Yes, dear, I do. My husband passed away a long time ago. I have a daughter, bless her heart, but she lives quite a ways away. She calls often, and visits when she can, but it’s not the same. I mostly keep to myself these days. I used to love gardening, but it’s gotten harder with my arthritis and… just feeling tired all the time. I have a few friends, but they aren’t all doing too well either, you see.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Now, before we proceed, would you mind if I perform a brief physical exam?
PATIENT: No, not at all, dear. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. I just want to feel better, you see. I'm hoping you can figure out what's going on. I’ve just been feeling so… off.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll gently palpate your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. …Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. When I palpate your abdomen, it’s… soft, but I do notice some mild tenderness in the upper right quadrant. It’s not sharp pain, just…discomfort when I press. Any pain radiating to your back or shoulder?
PATIENT: No, no pain radiating anywhere. Just… uncomfortable when you press there. It's been feeling a little tender there for a little while, I think. I didn't really pay much attention to it, to be honest. I just figured it was part of… everything else. It’s hard to say what's normal anymore, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand. And that’s helpful to know. Based on what you’ve told me, and the exam findings, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. Given your history of cancer and the tenderness in your upper right quadrant, it’s important to rule out any potential recurrence or complications. We should order some blood tests to check your liver function, as well as a complete blood count. An ultrasound of your abdomen would also be helpful to get a better look at your liver, gallbladder, and other organs. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever you think is best, dear. I just want to know what’s going on. I trust you. Blood tests and an ultrasound… yes, that’s fine. Will those take long? And will they be… uncomfortable? I'm a little nervous, you see.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will only take a few minutes, and you might feel a slight pinch when the phlebotomist inserts the needle. The ultrasound is non-invasive—a technician will apply a gel to your abdomen and move a wand over your skin. It shouldn’t be painful, but you might feel some pressure. I’ll write the orders for these tests now. The lab and radiology departments will schedule the appointments for you. We can also discuss the results when they come back. Do you have any questions about these tests, or the process?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Just… I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. And for not dismissing my concerns. It's nice to feel like someone is actually hearing me. So, the lab and radiology will call me to schedule things?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s correct. The lab and radiology departments will contact you directly to schedule the tests. They should be calling within the next day or two. While we wait for the results, if you experience any worsening symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, fever, or jaundice, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. In the meantime, let’s focus on managing your symptoms. Since you’ve been experiencing nausea and decreased appetite, I recommend eating smaller, more frequent meals, avoiding fatty or greasy foods, and staying well-hydrated. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. That all makes sense. Smaller meals and staying hydrated… I can certainly try that. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind. I feel a little better just knowing we’re looking into this. I’ll wait for the lab to call. I think… that’s everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Wonderful. I’ll have the nurse print out a summary of our visit for you, as well as the orders for the blood tests and ultrasound. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results as soon as they become available. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before then. I'm glad I could help, Ms. Kelder. And please, take care of yourself. .
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You too. I appreciate everything.
