DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. I’m Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Hmm... let me see. It’s about a letter, I think. Something to do with… a pet? My niece, she said I needed something from the doctor. Honestly, these things always fall on me. It's a dog, I think. A little fluffy thing. Not my cup of tea, but… she’s insistent.
DOCTOR: A letter regarding a pet… right. And your niece believes you require a medical document of some kind related to this dog?
PATIENT: Medical document… yes, that sounds about right. She said something about needing proof I'm… capable? Of looking after it. Honestly, it’s ridiculous. I've managed perfectly fine on my own for years. A dog is hardly a challenge, is it? It’s not like I’m getting a chimpanzee. Though, why she thinks I need my doctor involved, I couldn’t tell you. She's always been a bit dramatic, that one.
DOCTOR: Well, sometimes legal matters require documentation of… competence, even for seemingly straightforward things. It appears your niece is concerned about fulfilling certain requirements, perhaps related to pet ownership regulations or insurance. Do you have the letter with you?
PATIENT: Insurance… oh, right. She mentioned something about that. Always something with insurance, isn't it? Here, I think this is it. Honestly, I don’t even remember receiving this. It was probably buried under a mountain of bills and… well, everything else. It looks official enough, I suppose. Though, I still don't understand what I need to prove to anyone about a dog.
DOCTOR: Hmm. It is rather specific. It appears the insurance company requires a physician's statement confirming your physical and mental capacity to care for a pet, specifically due to a… pre-existing condition they’ve identified on your niece’s application. It’s… unusual, I must admit. They’re concerned about your ability to provide consistent care should you become unwell. Do you have any history of significant illness or mental health concerns that might prompt this request?
PATIENT: Oh, now they’re getting to it, are they? A pre-existing condition? Honestly. That’s a bit… forward, isn’t it? Well, I had a touch of the flu last winter, but who hasn’t? And… there was that time with my blood pressure, years ago, but it’s perfectly fine now. Perfectly fine! I take my vitamins, you know. And I don’t go stressing myself out over nonsense. But to think they’d question my ability to look after a dog because of a little… hiccup… it’s just… I don’t know. What kind of insurance company is this?
DOCTOR: Alright. So, a history of influenza and previously elevated blood pressure, now well-controlled with vitamins. We’ll need to document that. To be thorough, I’m going to ask a few routine questions about your overall health, just to get a complete picture. It's standard procedure, Ms. Wrye. Have you been experiencing any changes in your energy levels recently?
PATIENT: Energy levels… hmm. Well, I’m not as sprightly as I used to be, that’s for sure. But who is? I get a bit tired after a long day, but honestly, that’s just… life. I do get a bit… listless sometimes. Not sad, exactly. Just… not particularly motivated. I mostly just enjoy relaxing with a good book, if I’m being honest. Does that count as low energy? I haven’t been climbing mountains, if that's what you’re asking.
DOCTOR: No, I'm not expecting mountain climbing, Ms. Wrye. Just trying to get a sense of your baseline. You mentioned feeling listless. Have you noticed any difficulty with your sleep?
PATIENT: Sleep… Oh, don’t even get me started. I used to be able to sleep like a log, but now… Now I’m up half the night, tossing and turning. It’s not every night, mind you. But often enough to be annoying. I try a bit of warm milk, sometimes. Or reading. But my mind just… wanders. I think about all sorts of things. Old friends, things I should have done differently, that niece of mine… Honestly, it's exhausting. And then I’m tired all day! It's a vicious cycle, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, occasional insomnia, associated with racing thoughts. We should also review your diet. Are you eating regular, balanced meals?
PATIENT: Regular, balanced meals? Doctor, I eat! I enjoy a good meal when I have one. I don’t go starving myself, if that’s what you’re implying. It’s not like I’m living on air. I have a bit of toast in the mornings, sometimes. And I do enjoy a good biscuit with my tea. Though I admit, I don’t bother with all that… green stuff. It doesn’t really appeal to me. I prefer something a bit more… comforting, you know? Like a nice stew or a slice of cake. Is that so terrible?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I’m not suggesting anything is terrible. I'm simply gathering information. A diet lacking in essential nutrients can contribute to fatigue and listlessness. It appears we have a few areas to address. Now, have you experienced any changes in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Oh, appetite… it comes and goes, doesn't it? Sometimes I'm ravenous, other times I haven't much of a stomach for anything. It depends on my mood, really. When I'm feeling a bit… down, I don't feel like eating much at all. And when I’m stressed, well, I tend to snack a bit more. Biscuits mostly. It's not a particularly healthy pattern, I suppose, but honestly, I haven't been prioritizing my health lately. Too much else going on, you know? That niece, mostly. Always something with her.
DOCTOR: Right. So, fluctuating appetite, potentially linked to stress and mood. Alright, Ms. Wrye, I’m going to perform a brief physical exam just to get a baseline assessment. It will be quick. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological assessment. Then we can discuss a plan for addressing these concerns. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Honestly, Doctor, must you? I feel perfectly fine. A bit tired, perhaps, and a little stressed, but nothing a good cup of tea and a lie-down can’t fix. But… Alright, fine. Get it over with. But don’t go poking and prodding too much. I bruise easily, you know. And honestly, I haven’t got all day. This whole thing is rather inconvenient, if I'm being honest.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please have a seat on the table. I’ll start with your blood pressure. 140 over 88. Slightly elevated, but not alarmingly so. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please breathe deeply. Heart sounds are regular. Lungs are clear bilaterally. Now, a quick neurological assessment. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: There. Done. Is that all? Honestly, this is all rather… unnecessary. I told you, I’m perfectly fine. A bit stressed, a little tired, but perfectly capable of looking after a small, fluffy dog. It’s just… a dog, you know? Not a great responsibility.
DOCTOR: Alright. Reflexes are within normal limits. Muscle strength appears adequate. Overall, the physical exam is… unremarkable. However, given your reported fatigue, fluctuating appetite, and slightly elevated blood pressure, I recommend a few basic blood tests to rule out any underlying deficiencies or imbalances. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test would be a good starting point. Would you be agreeable to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests? Oh, for heaven’s sake. Honestly, Doctor, are you sure this is necessary? It all seems a bit… excessive. But… Alright, fine. If it will get this whole thing over with, I suppose. But I expect you to explain everything very clearly. No medical jargon, please. And I don't want to be poked and prodded more than necessary. Just get it done quickly. And can I get a referral somewhere close? I'm not going traipsing all over town for a few blood tests.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll write you a lab requisition for the tests I mentioned. There’s a lab just down the street at the shopping center – I’ll mark the address on the form. The results should be back within a few days. Once I have those, we can discuss a plan for addressing your concerns and I'll provide a statement regarding your capacity to care for a pet, as required by the insurance company. In the meantime, I recommend trying to prioritize getting regular sleep and incorporating some healthier foods into your diet, even if it's just a small change. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: A shopping center? Well, that's… convenient, I suppose. No, I don’t think so. Just… get this over with. And tell me when I can expect the results. I have other things to worry about, you know. This whole situation is rather… frustrating. Honestly, I just want to be left alone with my tea and my books. Right. Well, thank you, Doctor. I suppose. Let’s just hope this whole thing doesn’t take too long.
DOCTOR: The lab will contact you directly with the results. I’ll also have my office follow up with you in a week to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Thank you for your patience, Ms. Wrye. Have a good day. .
PATIENT: Right. Goodbye, Doctor. Let’s hope this is all worth the trouble. And please, no more poking and prodding. Honestly, a dog… it’s ridiculous.
