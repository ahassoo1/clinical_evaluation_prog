DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kammann. I'm Dr. Bombara. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Real nice to meet you too. Well, I'm 69 years old now, and things… well, they ain’t what they used to be, ya know? I figured it was time to see if we could get things optimized, keep me goin' as long as possible. Just want to feel my best, if that makes sense. It’s a “men’s health” visit, like the scheduler said.
DOCTOR: Yes, I see that in your chart – a men's health visit. That's a very good idea, Mr. Kammann. It’s good you're being proactive. “Optimized,” as you say, is a great goal. To get started, could you tell me a little more about what specifically is bothering you, or what changes you’ve noticed that have prompted this visit?
PATIENT: Well, it's not one big thing, Doctor. More like… little things addin’ up. I get tired quicker than I used to, for one. Used to be able to work in the garden all day, now I gotta take breaks every hour or so. And… well, things just don't work like they used to, if you catch my drift. Not as… firm as they once were, ya know? It's embarrassing to talk about, but I figured you’re used to hearin’ about it. And sometimes, I gotta get up a couple times a night to… well, use the restroom. That wasn’t happenin’ a few years back.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Kammann. These are very common concerns for men your age, and you’re right to address them. There's no embarrassment needed – we deal with these things all the time. It's good you're being open with me. Let's break those down a little. You mentioned fatigue, changes in… function, and increased nighttime urination. Are there any other symptoms you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Now that you mention it, I’ve been feelin’ kinda… down, lately. Not sad, exactly, just… not as interested in things as I used to be. My gardenin' ain’t bringin' me the joy it once did. And my appetite's been off and on. Some days I eat like a horse, other days I barely touch a thing. And… oh! My wife, bless her soul, she passed away a couple years ago. And I miss her somethin’ fierce. I don’t know if that plays into things, but it’s always there, ya know?
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing all of that, Mr. Kammann. That's a lot to be dealing with, and yes, the loss of your wife absolutely plays into things. Grief can affect so many aspects of our well-being. So, to summarize, we have fatigue, changes in…function, increased nighttime urination, decreased interest in hobbies, and fluctuating appetite, along with the significant grief you’re experiencing. Before we proceed, could you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Sure, Doctor. Well, I had my tonsils out when I was a kid, and I broke my arm when I was maybe ten, fell outta a tree. But nothin’ serious, really. I had high blood pressure for a while, maybe fifteen, twenty years ago, but it’s been under control with medication ever since. I see Doc Henderson for that, he’s a good man. Other than that… I’ve been pretty lucky, I guess. I don’t smoke, and I don't drink much anymore. Used to enjoy a beer now and then, but not so much lately. And I take a baby aspirin every day, just to be safe. My wife always told me to take care of myself, and I’m tryin’.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils out as a child, broken arm, history of hypertension well-controlled with medication – that's good to hear. And a daily baby aspirin. Very good. No significant surgeries other than the tonsils?
PATIENT: Nope. Just the tonsils, when I was little. Nothing else. I was always pretty careful, never took many risks. My wife, now she was the adventurous one. She loved to travel, always draggin' me along on some new adventure. But me? I was happy stayin' close to home, workin' in my garden.
DOCTOR: That’s nice. Okay, and what about your family history?
PATIENT: Hmm… family history… Well, my dad had heart trouble, ended up havin’ a heart attack when he was in his early seventies. Mom was pretty healthy, lived to be eighty-nine. She had arthritis, but other than that, she was doin' alright. My brother, he’s still livin’, but he’s got diabetes. That runs in the family, I think. My wife’s side… her dad had high cholesterol, and her mom had glaucoma. That’s about all I can remember, really. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about health much back then.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful. Heart trouble in your father, diabetes in your brother, and high cholesterol and glaucoma in your wife’s family. Knowing these things gives us a better picture. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, are you currently taking any other medications besides the baby aspirin and the medication for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Nope, just those two. The aspirin and the blood pressure pills. I take 'em every morning with my breakfast. I’m pretty good about rememberin’, always have been. My wife used to double-check me, though. She was good at keepin’ me organized.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear, Mr. Kammann. So, to recap – baby aspirin, blood pressure medication. No other medications, no allergies that you know of, and a history of some minor childhood issues and well-controlled hypertension. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. It'll just involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a brief neurological assessment. How does that sound?
PATIENT: Sounds alright, Doctor. Go right ahead. I ain't got nothin’ to hide. I trust you, and I figured this was gonna happen anyway. Just let me know if somethin’ feels… off, ya hear?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kammann. I will explain everything as I go, and please, let me know if anything feels uncomfortable at any point. Okay, your heart sounds regular, but I do notice a slightly increased rate. Your lungs are clear. Blood pressure is a little elevated today, 148 over 92. We’ll want to keep an eye on that. Your reflexes are good, and your balance seems stable. I’m also going to palpate your abdomen. Your abdomen is soft, no tenderness. I notice some slight… fullness. And finally, I’m going to check your prostate. This will involve a quick digital rectal exam. It helps us assess the size and texture of your prostate. It may be a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn’t be painful. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Whoa now, hold on a minute. A… what now? A digital exam? You mean… I understand it's important, Doctor, and I trust you, but… is that really necessary right now? I mean, I'm comin' to you for a general checkup, not… that. Is there somethin' specifically worryin' you? Maybe we could skip that part, if that's alright? I ain't gettin' any younger, ya know, and that just… sounds awful.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to ask, Mr. Kammann, and I apologize if I’ve made you uncomfortable. It’s a routine part of a men’s health exam, particularly given your age and the symptoms you’ve described – the increased nighttime urination and changes in…function. It allows us to assess your prostate, as an enlarged prostate can cause those symptoms. However, it is absolutely your decision. If you are not comfortable with it, we can skip it for today. We can focus on managing your blood pressure and addressing the other symptoms you’re experiencing. But I want you to be fully informed. Skipping this exam means we won’t be able to rule out benign prostatic hyperplasia , which is a common cause of those symptoms. We could order a PSA blood test, which can give us some information, but it's not as accurate as a physical exam. Would you like me to explain the PSA test in more detail?
PATIENT: Well, darn. I figured you'd say somethin’ like that. I always end up doin’ what the doctor tells me, even when it ain't somethin' I wanna do. My wife used to say I was a pushover. Okay, fine. Let's get it over with. But be gentle, alright? And explain what you're doin’ as you go. I don’t need any surprises. And… what exactly is this PSA test you were talkin' about? Is it just a blood draw?
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Kammann. I promise to be as gentle as possible and explain every step. It will be quick. The PSA test stands for prostate-specific antigen. It's a blood test that measures the level of PSA in your blood. Elevated levels can sometimes indicate an enlarged prostate, inflammation, or even prostate cancer. However, it’s important to remember that a high PSA level doesn't necessarily mean you have cancer – many other factors can cause it to rise. Okay, I’m just going to insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. This will allow me to feel your prostate and assess its size, shape, and texture. You may feel some pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Just relax your muscles, and breathe normally. Okay, all done. The prostate feels slightly enlarged and a little firm, but there are no obvious nodules or irregularities. I’m going to order a PSA test to get a better understanding of your prostate health. It will be a simple blood draw, and we should have the results in a few days.
PATIENT: Well, that wasn't as bad as I thought, to be honest. Still not somethin’ I’m gonna volunteer for again, but… it’s over now. So, enlarged and firm, huh? What does that mean exactly? Is that somethin' I should be worryin’ about? And how long does it usually take to get those blood test results? A few days is good, I guess. I don’t wanna be waitin’ around for weeks.
DOCTOR: I'm glad it wasn’t as bad as you expected, Mr. Kammann. Enlargement and firmness can be normal findings with age, and often indicates benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, which is a common condition. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. However, the PSA test will help us rule out other possibilities. The lab typically processes results within 2-3 business days. I'll have the nurse call you as soon as they’re available. In the meantime, we can address your other symptoms. Your fatigue and decreased appetite could be related to stress, grief, or even a simple vitamin deficiency. We'll start with some basic blood work to check your vitamin levels and thyroid function. And your blood pressure is a little elevated, so I'm going to prescribe a low dose medication to help bring it under control. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Blood work and some pills… better than just sittin' around worryin’, I suppose. My wife always said I needed to take better care of myself, and maybe she was right. What kind of medication is it for the blood pressure? Any side effects I should be lookin' out for? And… will those pills interact with the aspirin I’m already takin’? I don’t wanna end up makin’ things worse.
DOCTOR: I’m prescribing Lisinopril, a low-dose ACE inhibitor. It’s a very common medication for blood pressure, and generally well-tolerated. The most common side effects are a mild cough, dizziness, and fatigue. It’s rare, but some people experience kidney problems, which is why we’ll monitor your kidney function with regular blood tests. And yes, you're right to ask about interactions. Lisinopril doesn’t directly interact with aspirin, but both medications can increase the risk of kidney problems. That’s why we’ll keep a close eye on your kidney function. I’ll also order a complete blood count and a metabolic panel to check your overall health and identify any potential vitamin deficiencies. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Yeah, that makes sense, Doctor. Lisinopril… gotta watch for a cough and dizziness, and keep an eye on my kidneys. It sounds like a lot of tests, but… I guess that’s what you’re here for. So, let me get this straight… blood work for vitamins and thyroid, a PSA test for the prostate, and pills for the blood pressure. And gotta watch for cough and dizziness. Anything else I'm forgettin'? My memory ain't what it used to be, ya know.
DOCTOR: You've got it perfectly, Mr. Kammann. Let me write this all down for you. Here's a summary: Medication: Lisinopril 10mg daily. Watch for cough or dizziness. Blood Work: Complete Blood Count, Metabolic Panel, Thyroid Function Test, Vitamin Levels. Tests: PSA Test. Follow-up: We'll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of the tests and adjust your treatment plan if needed. The nurse will contact you to schedule that. And don't worry about forgetting things - that’s perfectly normal. If you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: Nope, I think that covers it, Doctor. You been real thorough, and I appreciate it. Thank you for not laughin’ at me, and for explainin’ everything so clearly. I feel a lot better now, even if I am gotta take a bunch of pills and get poked and prodded. I guess I'll be seein' you in a couple weeks, then. Thanks again, Doctor Bombara.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kammann. It was my pleasure. I'm glad I could help. And please remember, taking care of your health is the most important thing. The nurse will be right in to go over the paperwork and schedule your follow-up appointment. Have a good day, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. It was nice meeting you.
