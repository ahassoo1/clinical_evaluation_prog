DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, um… well, it’s my stomach, mostly. Lower part. It’s been… bothering me. It comes and goes, you see. Quite painful when it does come, though. I… I suppose it’s been happening for a little while now. Not constantly, thankfully. It's just… difficult to pinpoint exactly when it started, if I'm honest. My memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay. “Stomach pain.” And you said lower part of your abdomen?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. Lower abdomen. It feels… a cramping sort of pain, usually. Sometimes it’s sharp, other times more of a dull ache. It radiates around a bit, if that makes sense. It's hard to describe. And… oh dear, is today the 2nd of August already? Time does seem to slip away.
DOCTOR: Yes, it is August 2nd. We'll try to get to the bottom of this. Radiates where exactly, Ms. Glymph?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me see. It seems to go… across my lower belly, and sometimes… sometimes a little bit into my back. Not a lot, but a little. It’s not constant, you understand. It flares up, then goes away. It’s just… worrying, because I do have… well, the doctor told me about something a while back. Something with my system, I think. I don’t recall the name precisely. It was quite a long time ago.
DOCTOR: "Something with your system?
PATIENT: Yes… well, it was a rheumatologist who explained it. A very kind man. He spoke about… inflammation, and things being… auto-immune? I believe that was the word. It was years ago, and I've not had much trouble with it until recently. He said it could cause issues with… many parts of the body. It was all rather overwhelming, to be honest, and my memory… it isn't the best. I think it was Lupus? Is that right? Perhaps. It's been a while since I've thought about it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Lupus is a possibility, then. And this pain… does anything specific trigger it?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Let me think… It doesn’t seem to be connected to anything I eat, not that I've noticed. And I haven’t done anything strenuous recently. It just… happens. Sometimes after I’ve been sitting for a while, perhaps? Or sometimes when I’m just walking around. It's very unpredictable, really. I’ve not been able to identify a pattern, if that’s what you mean. It’s just… there. And then it's gone. A frustrating sort of pain, you see.
DOCTOR: Right. Unpredictable. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, my… well, um… that’s a rather personal question, isn’t it? Let me see… I suppose… a little bit more frequent, perhaps? But not drastically. And… well, sometimes a little uncomfortable afterwards, if I'm honest. Nothing too alarming, though. It’s difficult to say if it’s connected to the pain, or just… a coincidence. I do try to drink plenty of water, you know. It's important to stay hydrated. But… no, nothing drastically different. Just a little… off. I hope that answers your question. It's a bit embarrassing to discuss, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any fever, nausea, vomiting, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh dear, that sounds… unpleasant. Let me think… No fever, thankfully. And I haven't been sick, no nausea or vomiting. Blood… no, not that I’ve noticed. I always check, you see, but no. Definitely no blood. I do try to be mindful of things like that. It's good to be cautious, isn't it? I… I suppose that’s good news, at least. It's just this pain… it’s unsettling. It reminds me of when… well, never mind. It was a long time ago.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm going to need to do a quick examination, Ms. Glymph. Just going to listen to your abdomen, and gently feel around. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Please do. I'll try to relax. It's just… I do get a bit nervous with these things. Do let me know if you need me to do anything specific. And please, don't hesitate to tell me if you encounter anything concerning. I trust your judgment, of course. Just… be gentle, if you wouldn’t mind. I'm not as young as I used to be, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’m hearing normal bowel sounds. Now, I’m going to palpate your abdomen. That area… on the lower left side… is a little tender, isn't it?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… yes, that is a bit sore, isn’t it? Just there… on the left. Not excruciating, but… uncomfortable. I hadn’t consciously noticed it until you pressed there. It’s… a dull ache, really. It’s funny, I hadn't realized how much it bothered me until just now. It’s… a bit concerning, now that you point it out. Is that… bad? I do hope it's nothing serious. It’s just… my stomach has been acting up lately, and it’s unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright. Tenderness in the left lower quadrant. I'm going to order some blood work and a CT scan of your abdomen, Ms. Glymph. The blood work will help us look for any signs of inflammation, and the CT scan will give us a better look at what's going on internally. We need to rule out diverticulitis, and other possibilities. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. A CT scan… that sounds… rather involved. But if it’s necessary, of course. Allergies… let me see. I don’t think so. I’ve had scans before, quite some time ago, and I don’t recall any reaction. But my memory… it’s not what it used to be, you see. I suppose it's best to err on the side of caution. I… I don't think I am allergic, but please do double-check. It's best to be safe. And what exactly is diverticulitis? Is that something serious? I do get rather anxious with these things.
DOCTOR: Diverticulitis is an inflammation of small pouches that can form in the lining of your colon. It can be serious if left untreated, which is why we're getting the scan. I'll make a note to check your allergy history. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe you a bland diet, and a stool softener. And please, if you develop a fever, severe abdominal pain, or any blood in your stool, go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Oh, my. Inflammation of… pouches? That doesn’t sound pleasant at all. And going to the emergency room… well, I do hope it doesn’t come to that. A bland diet and a stool softener… yes, that sounds manageable. I can certainly do that. I understand. Bland diet, stool softener, and watch for fever, severe pain, and blood. I’ve got it. Thank you, Doctor. I do appreciate you looking into this. It’s… reassuring to have a plan. I… I suppose I should schedule the scan, then? Is there anything else I should be aware of?
DOCTOR: Yes, please schedule the scan as soon as possible. The radiology department will call you to arrange an appointment. And honestly, Ms. Glymph, try to be more proactive about your health. You mentioned a history of autoimmune issues and a vague memory of Lupus. I recommend seeing a rheumatologist for a follow-up to revisit those concerns. This pain could be related. Is that clear?
PATIENT: Oh… yes, a rheumatologist. You’re right, of course. I really should. I… I suppose I’ve been putting it off, to be honest. It all seemed… so long ago. But you’re right, it could be connected. I will schedule an appointment. As soon as possible. And the scan… yes. Everything. Scan, rheumatologist… I’ve got it. It's just… a lot to think about. But you're right. I need to be more proactive. Thank you, Doctor. For… reminding me. And for everything. I truly appreciate your patience. I’ll schedule everything today. I promise.
DOCTOR: Good. That's all for today, Ms. Glymph. The nurse will give you the prescriptions and instructions for the scan. I'll review the results when they come back, and we'll discuss them then.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Thank you again, Doctor. The nurse… yes. I'll see her now. Thank you for your time. .
