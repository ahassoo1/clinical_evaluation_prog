DOCTOR: Good morning, Airam. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It's nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um... hello. Yes. My husband... he said I should come. Something about... learning? I don't really remember. It's just... a check, I think? Not sick. Just... learning. Is this where I sit?
DOCTOR: Yes, this is where you can sit. It sounds like this check-up is something your husband encouraged, and that’s wonderful. It's perfectly alright if you don't remember the specifics. We can go through everything together. A check-up is a good idea even if you’re not feeling sick – it’s a way to make sure everything is healthy and catch anything early, if needed. To start, can you tell me a little bit about how you’ve been feeling lately?
PATIENT: Feeling? Oh. Well... tired, I guess. Always tired. Work is hard. Sheet metal... it's heavy. And my back... always a little sore. But that's just... work, right? Everyone's back hurts from that job. I don't know what you want me to say. I don't feel sick, if that's what you mean. I eat... food. Sleep... sometimes. It's all normal. Mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, tired, and some ongoing back soreness from your work with sheet metal. That's helpful to know. It is common to have aches and pains with physically demanding jobs, but we still want to make sure everything is alright. When you say “tired,” can you describe that a little more?
PATIENT: Describe...? Like... just... sleepy all the time. Even after sleep. Not like a good sleepy, like wanting a nap. Just... dragging. Hard to get going in the morning. Hard to finish the day. My husband... he says I complain more. He says I have no energy. I don't know. It's just... how I feel. Is this important? I thought this was about learning.
DOCTOR: Yes, this is important, Airam. It’s good that you’re noticing these changes and that your husband has noticed them too. Feeling tired all the time, even after sleep, and having less energy definitely warrants a closer look. We're not just doing this to "learn" something, we're trying to understand what's going on with your body and make sure you feel your best. Let’s try to get a bit more information. Do you have any trouble sleeping – falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early?
PATIENT: Hmm... sometimes. I fall asleep okay, I think. But then... I wake up. A lot. Maybe two or three times a night? Sometimes it's just... needing to go to the bathroom. Sometimes... I don't know. Just awake. And then... hard to get back to sleep. My husband... he snores. Very loud. That wakes me up too. Does that matter? It's always been like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, waking up multiple times during the night, potentially due to needing to urinate and your husband's snoring. Yes, that absolutely matters. Frequent nighttime awakenings can disrupt your sleep and contribute to daytime fatigue. Now, let’s talk about other things. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Appetite...? Not really. I eat when I'm hungry. Sometimes not so hungry, sometimes very hungry. Depends. Weight... I don't know. I haven't... weighed myself. I think I'm... the same? Maybe a little bigger? My clothes... feel a little tighter. But I don't know. I don't pay much attention. It's not like I'm trying to lose weight or anything. Is this important too? I feel like you're asking a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: It may seem like a lot of questions, and I apologize if it feels that way, Airam. We just want to get a complete picture of your overall health. Small changes can sometimes point to bigger things, and it’s important to rule everything out. Okay, so appetite is fairly consistent, but you’ve noticed your clothes feeling a bit tighter. That’s good information. Now, let's talk about your body. Have you noticed any unusual aches, pains, or swelling in any other parts of your body besides your back?
PATIENT: Um... sometimes my hands ache. After work. From using the tools. But that's... normal, right? Sheet metal... it's hard on your hands. And my ankles... sometimes they feel a little puffy at the end of the day. But only if I'm on my feet all day. I don't know. I just... put my feet up. And it goes away. My husband... he said I should wear support stockings. But I don't like those. They're too hot. Is this what this is about? Asking about stockings? I thought this was a learning thing.
DOCTOR: No, this isn’t about the stockings! Your husband is just looking out for you, and that's thoughtful of him. We're just gathering information. The hand aches after work and ankle swelling at the end of the day are helpful to know. Now, let’s switch gears a bit. Have you had any changes in your bowel habits lately – constipation, diarrhea, or anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh. Um... I don't really want to talk about that. That's... personal. Is this really necessary? I thought we were talking about learning. This is very embarrassing. I just want to go home. Maybe I'm not feeling well after all. This is making me nervous.
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right to feel that way, Airam. It’s perfectly okay if you're not comfortable discussing that. We don't have to talk about anything you don't want to. My apologies for making you feel uncomfortable. It seems like you’re feeling a bit overwhelmed, and that’s understandable. Let's take a step back. We've talked about fatigue, sleep disturbances, some minor aches and pains, and a little bit of weight gain. Before we continue, would you be comfortable if I quickly check your height and weight, and then take your blood pressure and listen to your heart and lungs?
PATIENT: Height and weight...? Okay. That's... okay. Not too embarrassing. But no... nothing else. No listening to my heart. No poking around. Just the height and weight. And then... can I go home? This is making my head hurt. I don't think I'm learning anything.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Airam. We'll just do the height and weight. And then, if you’d like, we can discuss what we've learned and decide together what the next steps should be. No poking around, I promise. If you'd step onto the scale, please. And then we can measure your height. It will only take a moment. Okay, your height is 151 centimeters, and your weight is 136 pounds. Thank you.
PATIENT: Okay. 151... and 136. What does that mean? Is that bad? I feel like I'm being tested. My husband... he always says I'm too short. But I can't help it. Now... can we go home? I really want to go home. This is making me very anxious. I don't feel like learning anything at all. I just want to rest.
DOCTOR: It's not a test, Airam, I promise. Your height and weight are simply information that helps us get a better picture of your overall health. 151 centimeters is about 4 feet 11 inches, and 136 pounds... well, it puts your Body Mass Index in the range that indicates you are carrying some extra weight. That doesn't mean anything is wrong, but it can contribute to some of the symptoms you've been describing, like fatigue and difficulty sleeping. You’ve mentioned you're feeling anxious and overwhelmed, and I want to respect that. We don't have to delve deeper into anything if you're not comfortable. Before we finish, let me quickly review everything we've talked about: fatigue, disturbed sleep, some minor aches and pains, a little weight gain, and some anxiety. Based on this, I think it would be helpful to run some basic blood tests to rule out any underlying medical conditions, like thyroid problems or vitamin deficiencies, that could be contributing to your symptoms. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Blood tests...? Oh. No. No blood tests. I don't like needles. My husband... he always gets blood tests. He hates them too. I don't want to do that. Can we just... stop? I just want to go home and rest. I'm very tired. And anxious. This is too much. I don't feel like learning anything. I just want to be left alone. Maybe I'm sick after all. But I don't want to know. Just... stop. .
DOCTOR: Okay, Airam. I completely understand. We will stop. No blood tests. We can absolutely respect your wishes. It sounds like you’re feeling very overwhelmed and anxious right now, and your priority is to rest. That’s perfectly valid. Based on what you've told me, and respecting your decision not to pursue further testing, I recommend prioritizing rest, and focusing on stress reduction techniques. If your symptoms worsen, or you develop any new symptoms, please don't hesitate to seek medical attention. I’m happy to provide you with some resources for stress management and relaxation techniques. Would that be helpful?
