DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I see here you’re 44 years of age. Could you tell me, in your own words, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Bakan, is it? Yes, well, it’s about this… letter. For a pet, you see. A rather… nice one, if I do say so myself. People are always asking about my… standards, and a letter just seemed the easiest thing, really. Though, frankly, I don’t see why everyone needs proof for everything these days. It’s all a bit silly, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes, it can be frustrating when documentation is required. Perhaps I misunderstood. Are you referring to a letter from a veterinarian regarding a pet?
PATIENT: A veterinarian? Oh, goodness, no. Not a vet. Though, a lovely thought, really. This is for… well, it’s a crested gecko. A very refined crested gecko. And the building management needs a letter stating I’m a responsible owner. Something about… hygiene, I think. Honestly, the whole thing feels rather… beneath me. I’ve had far more challenging creatures in my life, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Wrye. So, you're requesting a letter confirming your ability to responsibly care for your gecko to satisfy building management requirements. That's certainly… an uncommon request in internal medicine, but I can certainly see how documentation might be needed. To best fulfill this request, could you tell me a little more about your gecko’s setup and your care routine?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s all very… contained. Everything is quite neat, really. A lovely terrarium, humidity controlled, the proper substrate… Honestly, you wouldn’t even know there was a reptile in the house, it’s so discreet. I feed it… insects. Crickets, mostly. Live ones, of course, can’t be giving it anything processed. Though, I confess, I can’t quite recall where I purchase them. There's a shop… somewhere. It’s all a bit of a blur, you see. I have people who… assist with things. Mostly.
DOCTOR: I see. A controlled environment, live insects… and assistance with some aspects of care. To ensure I can write a comprehensive letter, could you describe the terrarium in a bit more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… glass, naturally. A good size, not cramped at all. Plenty of foliage. Artificial, mostly. I don't believe in bringing the outdoors indoors, really. And a heat lamp. And a water dish. A lovely little one. It’s all very… tasteful. I believe it’s got some sort of climbing branches too, for… enrichment. Though, I must admit, I don't spend an awful lot of time examining its interior. It’s all quite self-sufficient, you see. My assistant handles most of the… upkeep. I just ensure everything looks presentable. Does that suffice?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Ms. Wrye. It sounds as though you’ve created a very suitable environment. To ensure I can accurately reflect your responsible ownership, could you tell me a little more about your assistant’s role?
PATIENT: Oh, she’s… quite good, really. Handles the… messy bits. Changing the substrate, cleaning the glass, feeding the cricket things… all the things I find… distasteful, frankly. She comes twice a week. Though, I can’t quite recall her name at the moment. It’s… something common, I’m sure. She’s very reliable. She just… does things. I pay her, of course, handsomely. It's all very straightforward. Honestly, I shouldn’t have to be detailing all of this for a letter, should I? It seems rather excessive.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Wrye. I agree that the request is somewhat…unconventional. However, to ensure the letter is thorough and demonstrates responsible pet ownership, it’s helpful to have as much information as possible. To that end, have you ever taken your gecko to a veterinarian for a check-up, or noticed any changes in its behavior or appetite that might warrant a visit?
PATIENT: A veterinarian for a gecko? Goodness, no. Never. They seem perfectly healthy. As I said, she—my assistant—handles all of that. If there were anything amiss, she would certainly inform me. She’s quite observant. I haven’t seen anything wrong, personally. It just… sits there, mostly. And eats its crickets. I suppose if it stopped eating… that would be a sign. But as long as it’s contained and presentable… that’s all that really matters, isn’t it? It's not like it’s a… golden retriever, needing constant attention. Though I suppose all creatures deserve some level of care. It's all a bit much, really.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, while I appreciate your efforts to maintain a presentable environment for your gecko, a lack of regular veterinary check-ups could be detrimental to its health and wellbeing. Even seemingly healthy reptiles can harbor underlying conditions that require professional attention. To write a letter accurately reflecting responsible ownership, I would strongly recommend establishing a relationship with a qualified reptile veterinarian. Would you be open to me providing you with a list of local vets specializing in reptile care?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Now you’re just being difficult. A reptile vet? Honestly, it's all a bit excessive. And frankly, a bit insulting. I assure you, I am a responsible pet owner. I provide a suitable habitat, a clean environment, and adequate sustenance. What more could they possibly want? I am quite capable of assessing its… condition, though admittedly, I don’t examine it closely. It simply looks healthy. And my assistant assures me it is thriving. I fail to see the necessity of subjecting it to… invasive examinations by a specialist. It seems rather… barbaric. No, thank you. I simply require a letter confirming my ownership and responsible care, and I fail to see why that is such a difficult request. I'm paying for your time, after all. Are you able to provide this letter, or not?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand your frustration. However, as a physician, I have an ethical obligation to ensure the accuracy and integrity of any documentation I provide. Writing a letter confirming responsible pet ownership without any verifiable evidence of veterinary care would be irresponsible and potentially misleading. Furthermore, it could create a false sense of security regarding the gecko's health. Given these concerns, I am unable to provide the letter you requested at this time. I would be happy to discuss alternative options, such as establishing a relationship with a reptile veterinarian and obtaining a health certificate. However, without that documentation, I cannot fulfill your request. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Perhaps you could consider discussing this further with the building management to understand their specific requirements.
PATIENT: .
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Wrye. I wish you the best in resolving this matter. If you change your mind regarding establishing veterinary care, please don't hesitate to contact the clinic. .
