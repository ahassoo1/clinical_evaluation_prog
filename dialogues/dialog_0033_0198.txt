DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sugino. So, you’re here today… why don’t you tell me what brought you in?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor… Dechene, is it? Yes, it’s Liza Sugino. Well, to be honest, I’ve been thinking a lot about… finding a little more peace, I suppose. I’ve been hearing good things about mindfulness and meditation, and I thought maybe you could tell me a little more about it, or if it might be helpful for someone like me. I work on the railway, you see – signal and track switches – and it can be… a bit stressful sometimes, keeping everything running smoothly.
DOCTOR: Mindfulness?
PATIENT: Yes, mindfulness. I’m not entirely sure what it is, exactly! I’ve read a few articles online, something about focusing on your breath and being present… but it all seemed a little… vague. I suppose I’m hoping it could help with the worrying, and maybe just… feeling calmer throughout the day. It’s not a big problem, not at all, just… a general sense of being frazzled, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Ms. Sugino, with all due respect, you’re in a medical setting. We address medical concerns. While I’m sure mindfulness is… pleasant for some, it’s not within my purview to provide… lifestyle advice. I specialize in internal medicine. Are you experiencing any actual symptoms – fatigue, changes in appetite, difficulty sleeping – anything that would indicate a physiological issue?
PATIENT: Oh! Oh dear. I… I hadn’t thought of it quite like that, I suppose. I just… I thought doctors were for… well, for everything, a little bit. You’re right, of course. I’m sorry. No, no specific symptoms like that. I sleep alright, eat reasonably well… perhaps a little too much chocolate sometimes, but nothing serious! It’s just… the stress, I guess. I just thought maybe stress management was… part of medicine? But if it's not… then I apologise for taking up your time.
DOCTOR: Stress is a component of many illnesses, yes, but you’re presenting as… generally healthy. Honestly, Ms. Sugino, I'm detecting a certain level of… anxiety about needing a medical reason for feeling a certain way. Have you considered talking to a counselor or therapist?
PATIENT: Oh. That… that’s a very astute observation, Doctor. Yes, you're probably right. I do tend to worry about whether things are… bad enough to warrant attention. My mother always said… well, never mind. It’s silly. I suppose I just didn’t want to bother you with… feelings. A counselor, you say? I hadn’t really thought about that, no. Do you have any recommendations? Perhaps someone who understands… people who work unusual hours? Railway work isn’t nine-to-five, you see. It’s a bit… unpredictable.
DOCTOR: I have a list of referrals. Let me see… there’s Dr. Anya Petrova. She specializes in workplace stress and has experience with shift workers. Here’s her contact information. Frankly, Ms. Sugino, I believe she’d be a far more appropriate resource for you than I am. Is there anything else medically concerning you today?
PATIENT: Oh, that's wonderful! Dr. Petrova sounds perfect. Shift work is the biggest part of it, I think. Thank you. No, no, nothing else medically. Just… thank you for being honest with me, and for the referral. I really appreciate it. Perhaps I was a little… misguided in coming here. I suppose I just needed someone to… point me in the right direction.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’m glad I could clarify things. I wish you all the best with Dr. Petrova. And Ms. Sugino, please don't hesitate to return if you develop any actual medical concerns. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting.
PATIENT: Oh, certainly! Thank you again, Doctor Dechene. I won’t take up any more of your time. Have a good day. And thank you, truly.
