DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Vodzak. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, good to meet you too, I guess. It's… well, my face and legs are kinda puffed up. Been that way for a little while now. Not sure why though, and it’s not getting any better, so figured I should get it looked at. Don’t really go to doctors unless I have to, to be honest. Waste of time, usually.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in to get it checked out, even if you don't usually. “Puffed up,” you say—can you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it's like… swollen. My face, especially around here <gestures to cheeks and chin>, feels tight, you know? And my legs… well, I can barely see my ankles anymore. Not like they're painful, exactly, just… big. It's been worse the last few days, I think. Honestly, I’ve just been trying to ignore it. It’s probably nothing. Probably just… old age, or something.
DOCTOR: I see. And when you say it’s been worse the last few days, can you recall anything specific that might have triggered that, or any changes in your routine?
PATIENT: Routine? Not much changes in my routine. I get up, I eat, I work… same as always. Though… <pauses, tapping a finger to his chin>… I did have a bit more salt with my dinner last week. My neighbor brought over some smoked fish, and it was really good. I usually don't eat much of that stuff. Could be that, I suppose. But I doubt it. Seems like a small thing to cause all this. What would you know about it anyway?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know about the smoked fish. Salt can sometimes contribute to fluid retention, so it’s good you mentioned that. And you’re right to ask what I would know—my job is to figure out what's going on, and we do that by gathering information. To get a better understanding, let’s start with your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney problems, or heart issues?
PATIENT: High blood pressure… maybe? The doctor back in the city said something about it years ago, but I didn't pay much attention. I don't take any pills or anything. Never really bothered me. Diabetes? Nope. Heart issues? Nah, I've always been pretty strong. Did a lot of heavy lifting in my younger days. As for kidney problems… never had any trouble peeing, if that's what you mean. Honestly, I mostly just ignore what doctors tell me. They always want to put you on some medication. Don’t need that.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation about medication. We'll certainly focus on figuring out the cause first, and only discuss treatment options if they are necessary. Alright, and have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. <pauses, looking upwards> There was that time I cut my hand pretty bad when I was welding. Had to get a few stitches, back when I was still working at the shop. Nothing major. And… I was in the hospital when I broke my leg as a kid. Fell out of a tree, silly thing. But that was a long time ago. Besides that, I’ve mostly just patched myself up myself. You get used to it after a while. Don’t see much point in going to the hospital for everything. Too much fuss.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. Now, thinking about your family – are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Family… <scoffs> Not much of a family left, to be honest. My wife passed away a few years back. And I don’t really keep in touch with my brother. He moved to California ages ago. As for medical problems… my mother, she had… well, something with her heart, I think. But she didn't go to the doctor much either. And my father… he just… got old. Nothing specific, really. It's not like there's a family history of anything important. Mostly just stubborn people who don’t like going to the doctor.
DOCTOR: I understand. And what about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What do you want to know? I work. I eat. I sleep. It's pretty simple. I used to drink a bit more beer, back in the day, but I’ve cut back. Maybe a couple of glasses a week now. I don’t smoke. Never really liked it. I try to stay active, do a bit of gardening. Nothing fancy. Don’t go to the gym or anything like that. It's not like I'm a health nut. Just… try to keep moving. What kind of answer are you looking for?
DOCTOR: That’s helpful. Just trying to get a full picture. And are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: Nope. Not a one. Told you, I don’t like taking pills. Never seen much point in them. I figure if I'm feeling okay, why mess with it? I used to take something for my arthritis, years ago, but it didn’t really do much, so I stopped. And my wife used to try and get me to take vitamins, but I always forgot. Just… no pills. Don’t bother me. What would you even do with that information anyway?
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty. Knowing what medications you aren’t taking is just as important as knowing what you are. Okay, last question for now before we move onto a quick physical exam. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nah. I eat pretty much anything. Never had any trouble with food. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, since I don't take any. Bees, maybe? Got stung a few times as a kid, but nothing serious. Just a bit of swelling. Nothing like this. Honestly, I'm starting to wonder what you’re trying to find out. Seems like a lot of questions for a bit of swelling.
DOCTOR: Alright, well, that's good to know about the bee stings. It's just standard procedure to rule things out. Now, would you mind if I took a look at you?
PATIENT: Fine. Get it over with. But don't expect much. I’m a simple man. Just a bit puffed up, like I said. But I warn you, I don't like being poked and prodded. And I’m not fond of cold things on my skin. Just saying. Let’s just get it done, okay? The sooner I’m out of here, the better.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll be as quick and gentle as possible. I'm just going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I'll check your legs and face. Please lie down on the examination table when you're ready. I'm going to start with your heart and lungs. Okay, breathing sounds are clear, although a little diminished. Heart sounds are regular, but slightly… distant. Let’s check your legs now. Hmm. Significant pitting edema – that’s the swelling that leaves an indentation when I press on it – in both legs, up to the knees. Skin is warm to the touch. And your face… … yes, there’s noticeable swelling here as well. No tenderness. Blood pressure is 158/92. That’s a bit elevated. I’ll take a look at your ankles as well. Pulses are present, but a little weak. The skin feels slightly cool to the touch. Overall, it’s consistent with fluid retention, and the elevated blood pressure is a concern.
PATIENT: Fluid retention? That’s what all this is? What causes fluid retention? Is it serious? And what’s wrong with my blood pressure? I don't understand all this medical talk. It’s just a bit of swelling! You’d think it was something terrible. Is it the smoked fish? Or… is it something worse? I don't like this. Tell me straight, doctor. What’s going on?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. Miner. It is a lot of information, and I apologize if I’m using too much medical jargon. I’ll explain it as clearly as possible. Fluid retention—also called edema—means there’s too much fluid in your body tissues, causing swelling. There are several possible causes. It could be something as simple as eating a lot of salty foods, like the smoked fish, but it can also be a sign of more serious underlying conditions. Possible causes include problems with your heart, kidneys, or liver. It could also be related to a protein deficiency, or certain medications. Your elevated blood pressure is concerning because it puts extra strain on your heart and kidneys, and can worsen fluid retention. Right now, I can’t say definitively what’s causing your swelling and elevated blood pressure. We need to do some further testing. I want to order some blood tests to check your kidney and liver function, and your protein levels. I also recommend an EKG—that’s a simple test that checks the electrical activity of your heart—and a urinalysis to check your urine. These tests will help us figure out what’s going on and develop a treatment plan. It's important to find the underlying cause so we can address it properly. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Of course. Just what I needed. More poking and prodding. And blood work? I hate getting blood drawn. Always bruise easily. But… you said something about my heart? Is my heart bad? Is that why my blood pressure is high? I don't like this at all. And what’s a… a… EKG? Does it hurt? And what about the urinalysis? Do I just… pee in a cup? Honestly, this is ridiculous. Just a bit of swelling, and now I’m talking about my heart and peeing in cups. Look, I’m an old man. I've lived a good life. Is this something serious? Should I be worried? Just tell me straight, doctor. Am I dying?
DOCTOR: Mr. Miner, I understand your anxiety, and I want to assure you that we’re taking this seriously. Let’s take things one step at a time. You asked if this is something serious. It's potentially serious, but we don’t know enough yet to say definitively. That’s why we need to run these tests. Fluid retention and elevated blood pressure can be signs of underlying conditions that need to be addressed, but they’re not always life-threatening. An EKG is a very simple and painless test. We just attach some sticky pads to your chest, arms, and legs, and it records the electrical activity of your heart. It doesn’t hurt at all. And yes, the urinalysis involves providing a urine sample in a cup. It’s a standard test that helps us assess your kidney function. Regarding your heart, the slightly diminished sounds I heard during the examination suggest there could be some underlying issues, but the EKG will give us a much clearer picture. It's important to remember that I'm just gathering information right now. I don’t have enough data to make a diagnosis. And to answer your direct question – no, based on what I’ve seen so far, I don’t believe you are dying. But it's crucial that we identify the cause of your swelling and elevated blood pressure so we can treat it appropriately and prevent any potential complications. I'm going to write you a referral for the blood work and EKG. The order will also include the urinalysis. Do you have any questions about where to go for these tests, or how to schedule them?
PATIENT: So… I’m not dying. That’s good. I guess. But more tests… honestly. I don’t like going to labs. All those people in white coats poking around. Okay, so… where do I go? Is it the same place as this clinic? And do I need to make an appointment? I don't do computers, you know. I'll have to ask my neighbor to help me. He’s pretty good with all that technology stuff. And… how long will it take to get the results? I don’t want to be waiting around for weeks. I have things to do, you know. Gardening, mostly. And I don’t want to worry about it the whole time. Just tell me straight, doctor. When will I know something?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable. It’s good you have a neighbor who can help you with scheduling. The lab is located at 123 Main Street, about a 15-minute drive from here. The phone number is 555-1212. They do require appointments, so your neighbor can call and schedule that for you. As for the results, the lab typically takes 2-3 business days to process the blood work and send the results to my office. The EKG results are usually available within a day. Once I have the results, my nurse will call you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and develop a treatment plan. So, you should have the results within about a week, give or take a day or two. I know waiting is difficult, but it's important to gather all the information before making any decisions. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: A week… okay. That’s not too bad, I guess. As long as it doesn’t take any longer. No… I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything pretty well. Just… don’t make me come back too often. I don’t like hospitals or clinics. And… try not to give me too many pills, okay? Alright. I guess I’ll go call my neighbor now and get these tests scheduled. Thank you, doctor. Even though I don’t like all these tests, I appreciate you explaining everything to me. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Miner. I understand your concerns, and I promise to do everything I can to make this process as comfortable as possible. We'll take things one step at a time, and we’ll focus on finding the best solution for you. Please don’t hesitate to call my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, Mr. Miner. And please, don’t worry too much. We’ll get to the bottom of this. Have a good day.
