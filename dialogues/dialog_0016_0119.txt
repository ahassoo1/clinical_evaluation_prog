DOCTOR: Hi Jinnie, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Maskal. It's August 2nd, and I see you're here today. Can you tell me what brings you in?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s… rather embarrassing, to be frank. It’s a problem with… a gentleman friend. A recent gentleman friend. There's… discharge. A most unpleasant thing, really. And not at all what one expects.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jinnie, thank you for sharing that. It’s perfectly alright, these things happen, and it's good you're getting it checked out. To help me understand what’s going on, can you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s… yellowish, I suppose. Not terribly thick, but certainly… noticeable. And it has a rather… pungent odor. Honestly, Doctor, it’s quite uncouth. I haven’t experienced anything like this before, and I assure you, my standards are quite high. Is it… is it something dreadful?
DOCTOR: Okay, yellowish discharge with a pungent odor. That gives me a bit more information. And you said this is a recent issue with a new partner?
PATIENT: Yes, quite recent. We’ve… only been acquainted for a few weeks. I met him at the bocce ball league, you see. A respectable man, on the surface. Though one can never truly know, can one? It’s terribly upsetting. I do try to be careful, but… well, a girl enjoys a little company. But this… this is simply unacceptable.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're addressing this. To get a clearer picture, and to ensure we cover all bases, I'm going to ask a few more questions. Don't hesitate to tell me anything that feels relevant, even if it seems minor. Have you noticed any burning or itching in the vaginal area?
PATIENT: Burning? Itching? Doctor, I assure you, my personal hygiene is impeccable. However… now that you mention it, there has been a slight… discomfort. Not a terrible ache, but a bit of… irritation. It’s very subtle, really. But I suppose it’s better to be thorough, as you say. It's just… rather dreadful to discuss these things. Is it… is it something contagious?
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to feel uncomfortable discussing this, Jinnie. That's why I'm here. The irritation is good to know. And yes, it could be contagious, which is why it's important we figure out what's causing it. Have you had any other symptoms, like pain during urination, or any unusual bleeding?
PATIENT: Pain during urination… no, thankfully not. I drink plenty of water, you see. A girl must stay hydrated. And bleeding… well, I had my usual monthly… course, just a few days ago. Nothing out of the ordinary. Honestly, Doctor, I'm rather meticulous about tracking these things. It's just this… discharge. It’s so… common. Is it a sign of something… serious? I really don't have time for illnesses, you know. I volunteer at the historical society. Very important work.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain with urination, normal menstrual cycle recently. That’s helpful. It's good you're so aware of your body, Jinnie. I understand your concern, and it's good you're getting this checked. To get a better understanding, I'd like to do a quick pelvic exam. It'll help me rule out some possibilities and determine the best course of action. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… pelvic exam? Doctor, are you certain that is necessary? It seems… rather invasive. I’ve never had one before. And frankly, I’m not sure I’m comfortable with it. Couldn't we simply… prescribe something? Perhaps an ointment? I read about those in a magazine. Surely a simple remedy would suffice. I really don't see the need for… prodding.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Jinnie. A pelvic exam is the best way to determine the cause of the discharge, and unfortunately, prescribing something without knowing what we're treating isn't advisable. It could mask the symptoms and make it harder to diagnose if it’s something more serious. The exam itself is fairly quick and shouldn't be too uncomfortable. I'll explain everything as I go, and you can stop me at any time if you're feeling uncomfortable. We'll just take a look to see if there's any visible inflammation or discharge, and I'll take a small sample to send to the lab for testing. It’s really the most accurate way to proceed. Would you like me to explain the procedure in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, very well. If you insist. But I expect a very thorough explanation. And I do hope it will be quick. I have a luncheon engagement with the Daughters of the Revolution afterwards. Very important people will be there. Explain it to me, Doctor. But please, be brief. And try not to use… vulgar terms. I am a lady, you know. And I do hope you have thoroughly sanitized everything. One can never be too careful.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jinnie. I completely understand. We use sterile instruments for every exam, and I'll explain everything step-by-step. You’ll lie on your back, with your knees bent and feet flat on the table. I’ll gently separate the labia – that’s the outer folds of your vagina – so I can see the vaginal opening. Then, I'll use a speculum, a smooth, slightly curved instrument, to gently open the vaginal canal so I can get a better look at the cervix – that’s the lower part of your uterus. It might feel a little pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’ll then use a small brush or swab to collect a sample of the discharge, and another swab to collect a sample from your cervix. That’s all there is to it. The whole process takes just a few minutes. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: A speculum? That sounds… dreadful. And you say it might not be painful? That’s not terribly reassuring, Doctor. And you’re going to collect a… sample? Honestly, it sounds… barbaric. Perhaps… perhaps we could just skip the sample? I’m sure my description is sufficient. I told you it was yellowish, with a pungent odor. Surely that’s enough for a diagnosis. I really don't see the need for… invasive procedures. And I have a very delicate constitution. Would an ointment not suffice? A nice, soothing ointment?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Jinnie, and I wish we could skip it, but a sample is really crucial for an accurate diagnosis. The color and odor give me some information, but they don’t tell me what’s causing the discharge. It could be a number of things – a common infection like bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection, but it could also be something else, like a sexually transmitted infection. Without a sample, I wouldn't be able to prescribe the correct treatment. Prescribing an ointment without knowing what we’re treating could actually make things worse, or mask the symptoms and delay proper care. The sample collection is very quick and shouldn’t cause any lasting discomfort. It’s a small inconvenience for peace of mind, and to ensure we get you the right treatment as quickly as possible. I will be as gentle as possible, and I’ll explain everything before I do it. Would you like me to show you the speculum?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! I do not want to see it! Honestly, Doctor, you’re making me very uncomfortable. This is simply dreadful. I came here expecting a simple prescription, not… a gynecological examination. Perhaps I should just consult another physician. One who is more… understanding of a lady’s sensibilities. This is simply unacceptable. I really must insist… is there no alternative? Perhaps a very strong antibiotic? I read about those in a magazine… they say they cure everything.
DOCTOR: Jinnie, I understand your reluctance, and I apologize for making you uncomfortable. However, prescribing an antibiotic without a proper diagnosis is not safe or ethical. It can lead to antibiotic resistance, and it won't address the underlying cause of the discharge. I assure you, I am trying to provide you with the best possible care, and that includes getting an accurate diagnosis. I'm happy to discuss this further and answer any questions you have. I can also explain why the sample is so important. But I cannot, in good conscience, prescribe a treatment without knowing what we're treating. If you'd prefer to seek a second opinion, I completely respect that decision. However, I strongly recommend getting a diagnosis before starting any treatment. Before you decide, may I ask if your gentleman friend has experienced any symptoms?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, he did complain of a slight… irritation. A very subtle discomfort, he said. But he dismissed it as… chafing, I believe. From playing bocce ball, you see. He’s quite active. But honestly, Doctor, I do not wish to discuss his… private matters. It’s rather indelicate. And I’m starting to feel quite faint. Perhaps I should just lie down. This is simply dreadful. I never expected such… indignity. Is there at least a comfortable chair where I can wait? And perhaps a glass of water? I really must insist.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jinnie. Please, sit down and take a sip of water. I completely understand your discomfort, and I apologize again for the situation. The fact that your partner is experiencing similar symptoms is important information, and it further supports the need for a diagnosis. It suggests that it could be a sexually transmitted infection. I will not push you to do anything you are not comfortable with. However, I strongly recommend considering a quick examination and sample collection, for both your health and your partner’s health. It’s a simple procedure that can provide peace of mind and ensure we get you the right treatment. I'll give you a few minutes to compose yourself. If you decide you'd like to proceed, please let me know. Otherwise, I can provide you with a referral to another physician.
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor… this is simply humiliating. To think, a lady of my standing… subjected to such… scrutiny. I really do not know what my friends would say. Very well. If you absolutely insist… and if it truly is a quick procedure… perhaps I can steel myself. But I want everything explained to me before you do anything. And I want a very thorough apology afterwards. And perhaps a small discount on the bill? I really do not believe I should be charged full price for such… an ordeal. But I will not lie down. I will remain seated. Is that acceptable? And please, no… vulgar terms. I am a lady, you know.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jinnie. Absolutely. You can remain seated, and I promise to explain everything before I do anything. I will use respectful language, and I will be as gentle and thorough as possible. And I will certainly take your concerns about the bill into consideration. Let's start by getting you comfortable. I’ll adjust the chair so you’re in a relaxed position. Then, I’ll explain the procedure step-by-step. First, I'll use a speculum to gently open the vaginal canal so I can see your cervix. It might feel a little pressure, but it shouldn’t be painful. Then, I’ll use a small brush or swab to collect a sample of the discharge, and another swab to collect a sample from your cervix. The whole process will take just a few minutes. Do you have any questions before we begin?
PATIENT: Will it… hurt? And will it be… messy? I do so dislike any sort of… disarray. And what if it reveals something… dreadful? I really do not have the constitution for bad news. And will I need to… change afterwards? Honestly, Doctor, this is simply appalling. I never expected such indignity from a medical professional. Perhaps I should just faint. It would be so much easier.
DOCTOR: Jinnie, I understand your apprehension, and I want to assure you that I will do everything I can to make this as comfortable and dignified as possible. It shouldn’t hurt. You might feel a little pressure or discomfort, but it’s usually very mild. And no, it won’t be messy. I’ll use sterile instruments and take every precaution to ensure it’s clean and comfortable. As for revealing something dreadful, that’s why we’re doing this – to get an accurate diagnosis and ensure you receive the appropriate treatment. I will explain the results to you in a clear and sensitive manner, and we’ll discuss all your options together. You won't need to change afterwards. The procedure is very quick and clean, and there will be no mess. I understand this is not pleasant, but it’s a simple procedure that can provide peace of mind and protect your health. I will be with you every step of the way, and I will answer any questions you have. Would you like me to demonstrate how the speculum works?
PATIENT: Absolutely not! I do not want to see it! The very idea! Honestly, Doctor, you are testing my patience. I came here expecting a simple prescription, not a… gynecological exhibition. Very well. If you absolutely insist, you may proceed. But be quick about it. And be gentle! And please, no… vulgar terms. I am a lady, you know. And I expect a full explanation afterwards. And a discount on the bill. I really do not believe I should be charged full price for such… an ordeal. But I will not lie down. I will remain seated. Is that acceptable? And please, no… sudden movements. I have a delicate constitution.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jinnie. You will remain seated, and I will be as quick and gentle as possible. I promise to use respectful language and explain everything as I go. I will also keep your request for a discount in mind. First, I’m going to use a clean cloth to gently wipe the area. Then, I’ll use a small amount of lubricant to make the speculum more comfortable. The speculum is just a smooth, curved instrument that helps me gently open the vaginal canal so I can see your cervix. It might feel a little pressure, but it shouldn’t hurt. Are you ready?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… oh, dear… this is simply dreadful. Do hurry, Doctor. Please, do hurry! And be gentle! It feels… cold! And… invasive! This is simply appalling. I never expected such indignity from a medical professional. I really must insist… please, do be quick! And no… vulgar terms! I am a lady, you know. This is simply… unbearable.
DOCTOR: Okay, Jinnie, I’m just gently opening the speculum now. Take a deep breath. It might feel a little pressure, but it shouldn’t hurt. I’m just taking a quick look at your cervix now… everything looks okay so far. Just a quick swab now… all done. That was very quick. Okay, all done. I’m just cleaning up now. That was very quick, Jinnie. You did great. Here’s a tissue, and a glass of water. Are you feeling okay?
PATIENT: Oh, dear… oh, dear… that was simply… awful. I feel quite faint. And… violated! I really must insist… a strong drink would be most welcome. And a discount on the bill. A very significant discount. Honestly, Doctor, I do not believe I will ever recover from this ordeal. I feel quite… sullied. And I’m sure my gentleman friend will be most upset. He’s a very sensitive man, you see. When will I have the results? And what if it's something… dreadful? I really do not have the constitution for bad news. And I expect a full explanation. And a strong drink. And a discount on the bill. A very significant discount.
DOCTOR: I understand your distress, Jinnie, and I apologize again for the ordeal. I will do everything I can to make you feel more comfortable. Unfortunately, we don’t have alcohol here, but I can offer you another glass of water and a quiet place to rest. The results will take about 3-5 business days. I’ll call you as soon as they’re available. And I promise to explain everything in a clear and sensitive manner. We’ll discuss all your options together, and I’ll do everything I can to support you. Regarding the bill, I will certainly take your concerns into consideration and offer you a significant discount in light of the uncomfortable experience. Let’s focus on getting you feeling more comfortable right now. Would you like me to call someone for you?
PATIENT: Oh, Doctor… you are most kind. A glass of water would be most welcome. And perhaps a quiet place to rest. I really do not think I can face the world right now. No, please do not call anyone. I would not want my friends to know about this… ordeal. It would be most embarrassing. Just… a quiet place to rest. And a significant discount on the bill. A very significant discount. And please, no sudden movements. I have a delicate constitution. And do not mention this to anyone. It would be most embarrassing.
DOCTOR: Of course, Jinnie. Please, make yourself comfortable. I’ll bring you a glass of water and ensure you have complete privacy. I’ll also make a note to adjust your bill accordingly. I want to assure you that you did nothing wrong, and you are not alone. Many women experience similar concerns, and I’m here to support you every step of the way. Please, take your time. I’ll be nearby if you need anything at all. Don’t hesitate to let me know. .
