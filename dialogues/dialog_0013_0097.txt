DOCTOR: Hi Marija, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. It’s Marija Chilla. I was told you are the one to speak with regarding… these end-of-life documents. My husband suggested I come. He worries unnecessarily, of course, but one does not argue with a man. I understand you have forms for… planning ahead? For when one is… unable to make decisions.
DOCTOR: Right, absolutely. Those are advanced directives – things like a living will and durable power of attorney for healthcare. It’s very responsible of you to think about these things, and your husband is right to encourage it. It’s much easier to do this before a crisis. We have a standard packet here, but we’ll go through it together and I can answer any questions you have. It's really about making your wishes known. Before we dive in, can you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: My overall health is quite… satisfactory, thank you. I maintain a very strict regimen, naturally. I do not suffer from any… common ailments. Though, I suppose at my age, one must be… proactive. But truly, Doctor, I fail to see why my daily constitution is relevant to deciding who speaks for me when I am… indisposed. Is this standard procedure? It seems rather… intrusive.
DOCTOR: You’re absolutely right to question that. It is standard to get a sense of your general health, but primarily to understand if there are any existing conditions that might influence the types of decisions we discuss, or if you have specific concerns about future care. It’s not about scrutinizing your lifestyle. My apologies if I made it sound otherwise. We can absolutely skip that part for now and focus directly on the documents if you prefer. However, knowing if, for example, you have a chronic condition or a specialist you see regularly would be helpful later on. It’s your choice, of course. What are you most concerned about when thinking about these directives?
PATIENT: Well, my husband is perpetually concerned about my… delicate constitution. He imagines all sorts of things. I assure you, I am perfectly capable of articulating my wishes when the time comes. But if you must know, I have a rather… sensitive stomach. And I see Dr. Benali for allergy testing, though it's mostly seasonal irritants. But truly, Doctor, I do not wish to spend the afternoon detailing my digestive history. I came for the forms, not a wellness check. Please, let us proceed with the matter at hand. I find this conversation… unnecessarily drawn out.
DOCTOR: Understood. Absolutely, we’ll focus on the forms. So, these documents cover two main things: a living will, which outlines your wishes for medical treatment if you’re unable to speak for yourself, and a durable power of attorney for healthcare, which designates someone – usually a family member – to make those decisions on your behalf. Do you have a preference for who you’d like to name as your healthcare proxy?
PATIENT: Naturally, my husband, Ahmed. He’s… capable. Though, rather prone to panic, as I mentioned. He will likely consult every doctor within a fifty-mile radius before making a single decision. But he is my husband. And he knows where all my… important papers are located. Though, I suspect even he won't understand half of what's in them. But yes, Ahmed. He’ll do. Now, what sort of… options are we discussing? I certainly do not wish to be kept alive artificially if there is no… prospect of recovery. That much is certain.
DOCTOR: Good. Ahmed sounds like a responsible choice. This section covers end-of-life care preferences. It asks about things like resuscitation – whether you’d want CPR if your heart stopped – mechanical ventilation, feeding tubes, and pain management. We'll go through each option, and you can choose how far you want to go with each treatment. For example, regarding resuscitation, you can choose full resuscitation, selective resuscitation – meaning only if there’s a reasonable chance of recovery – or do-not-resuscitate. Do you have any initial thoughts on that?
PATIENT: Resuscitation… Honestly, Doctor, the very thought is… vulgar. All that… poking and prodding. If my time has come, it has come. I do not wish to be… jolted back into existence only to suffer. A dignified exit is paramount. Do-not-resuscitate, then. Absolutely. And please, no… heroic measures. I’ve seen enough medical dramas to know what that entails. Simply allow nature to… take its course. And do ensure my husband understands this. He has a tendency towards… melodrama.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Do-not-resuscitate it is. And we’ll definitely make a note to discuss this thoroughly with Ahmed. It’s important everyone is on the same page. Now, the next section covers mechanical ventilation – essentially, a breathing machine. Would you want to be placed on a ventilator if you were unable to breathe on your own?
PATIENT: A breathing machine? Doctor, the thought of being tethered to a device… it’s appalling. It sounds… undignified. I prefer to… naturally conclude my affairs. I do not wish to be kept alive by artificial means. No ventilation, then. Unless, of course, it’s a temporary situation. A brief reprieve, perhaps, while one sorts things out. But no prolonged… existence on a machine. That is simply unacceptable.
DOCTOR: Understood. No prolonged ventilation. We can specify that it’s acceptable for a limited time if necessary, for comfort or to allow for other decisions to be made. Okay, and the next section concerns artificial nutrition and hydration – things like feeding tubes. Would you want to receive nutrition and hydration if you were unable to eat or drink on your own?
PATIENT: Feeding tubes… honestly, Doctor, must we delve into such unpleasant details? It's… barbaric. If my body is failing, then it is failing. To prolong life artificially with tubes and… fluids… it’s simply prolonging suffering. No artificial nutrition or hydration, then. Let nature take its course. And please, do ensure my husband understands this. He tends to… cling to hope, even when there is none. He may try to… interfere.
DOCTOR: Certainly. No artificial nutrition or hydration. We’ll make a very clear note to discuss this with Ahmed, and to emphasize your wishes. Now, this section is about naming your healthcare proxy – the person who will make medical decisions on your behalf if you're unable to do so. You’ve already mentioned Ahmed, which is good. This section just formalizes that designation, and allows you to specify any limitations or preferences you might have for his decision-making. For example, do you want him to consult with other family members before making a decision?
PATIENT: Consult with other family members? Absolutely not. Ahmed is perfectly capable of making decisions on his own, despite his… occasional anxieties. I do not wish to involve anyone else in this matter. It’s… complicated enough as it is. No, he should consult with his doctors, of course. And perhaps Dr. Benali, if it pertains to my allergies. But no… aunts, uncles, or cousins. It’s a private matter. And please, ensure he understands that my wishes are paramount. He has a tendency to… seek the opinions of others, even when they are ill-informed. This form needs to be very clear on that point. Very clear indeed.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. We'll make a very specific note that Ahmed should consult with his doctors and Dr. Benali, but that he has the final say and that he should prioritize your previously expressed wishes. No involvement from other family members. Alright. We've covered the Living Will and the Durable Power of Attorney. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any questions you have before we finalize these documents?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, I suppose that covers the… necessities. Though, I must say, this has been a rather… unpleasant experience. Delving into such morbid details is not my idea of a pleasant afternoon. I trust these forms are legally sound? And that my husband will… adhere to my wishes? He can be… stubborn, at times. And I do hope he doesn't try to… alter them after I'm gone. It's a sensitive matter, you see. A very sensitive matter indeed. Perhaps a copy for my lawyer as well? Just to be safe.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. These forms are legally sound and compliant with all state regulations. We'll provide you with a copy for your records, and we can absolutely forward a copy to your lawyer as well – just let me provide the contact information. We also document everything thoroughly in your chart. And while we can’t guarantee anyone’s actions, we’ll make it very clear to Ahmed that these documents represent your wishes and should be respected. We can even schedule a follow-up appointment with both of you present to discuss everything in detail and answer any questions he might have. Here are the completed documents. Please review them carefully, and let me know if you have any questions. And again, thank you for taking the time to do this. It’s a very responsible thing to do. Do you have any other concerns for today?
PATIENT: A follow-up appointment… perhaps. Though, I doubt Ahmed will require any further explanation. He simply needs to… understand my wishes. And I trust he will. As for other concerns… no, Doctor. I believe that is all. Though, I must say, your office is rather… drafty. Perhaps invest in a warmer thermostat? But no, that is neither here nor there. Thank you for your time, Doctor. I do hope we don't have to revisit this matter again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Marija. And thank you for bringing that to my attention – I’ll certainly speak with the facilities manager about the thermostat. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. And I hope we don’t need to revisit this, either. Have a good afternoon.
