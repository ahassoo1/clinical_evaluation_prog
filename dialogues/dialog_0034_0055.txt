DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Rannells. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure, I suppose. Though I must say, this suburban location is…rather understated. My husband and I were discussing it on the drive over. Anyway. I’m here about getting one of those…medical marijuana cards. I understand you can prescribe them now? It’s for a friend, of course. A very dear friend. Needs a little…help relaxing, you understand.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Rannells. We do offer evaluations for medical cannabis authorization, yes. However, to determine if it’s appropriate, I’ll need to gather some information about your friend’s condition – or, if you prefer, we can discuss your own medical history and whether it might be a suitable option for you. To be clear, the evaluation process requires a legitimate medical need, regardless of who the authorization is ultimately for. Before we proceed, could you clarify if you are seeking the authorization for yourself or if this is on behalf of someone else?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly, Doctor, the bureaucracy! It’s simply exhausting. Very well. It is for me. Though I assure you, I don’t go around broadcasting these things. A woman of my…standing doesn’t need to be reliant on…well, never you mind. Let’s just say I’ve had a stressful year. My husband retired, which, while lovely for him, has left me handling…everything. Everything, you understand? And a little…assistance in the evenings wouldn’t go amiss.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Rannells. Retirement can be a significant life change, and it’s common to experience increased stress when roles and responsibilities shift. It’s good you’re proactively seeking ways to manage that stress. To help me determine if medical cannabis might be appropriate, could you tell me a little more about what that stress feels like?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s not as if I suffer. I’m not one for dramatics. But it’s…a constant low-level agitation. Sleeplessness, naturally. Not every night, but enough to be…irritating. And I find myself…short-tempered. With the staff, mostly. They don’t understand the importance of proper decorum, you see. It’s just…everything feels slightly off-kilter. And it’s not like I can simply relax. I have responsibilities. A reputation to uphold. It's a…constant state of being on, if that makes any sense. I simply require something to…smooth things over, you understand?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense, Ms. Rannells. A constant state of being "on" can be incredibly draining. Sleeplessness and irritability are common symptoms of chronic stress. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Where to begin? I’ve always been remarkably healthy, thankfully. A good constitution, you see. I had my tonsils out as a child – a dreadful affair, but quite necessary, the doctor said. And a rather nasty bout of influenza a few years back, but I recovered splendidly. Otherwise? Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, naturally. Nothing that requires…constant attention. I certainly don’t go running to doctors for every little twinge. I had a hysterectomy in my early forties, if that's relevant. It was…routine. Really, I've been quite fortunate. Why do you ask? Is this necessary? It feels rather…invasive, if I may say so.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly alright to feel that way, Ms. Rannells. I apologize if it feels invasive; I simply need to gather a complete medical picture to ensure medical cannabis is a safe and appropriate option for you. Knowing your medical history helps me identify any potential interactions or contraindications. The hysterectomy is relevant, thank you for sharing that. And I appreciate you mentioning the influenza – that gives me a better understanding of your body's response to illness. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, just a small thing. A low-dose aspirin, every other day, for…well, one never knows, does one? And a multivitamin, naturally. I try to maintain a balanced diet, but one can’t be too careful. That’s really all. I absolutely refuse to be one of those people who rely on a cocktail of pills. It’s simply…undignified. And frankly, I distrust most pharmaceuticals. All those side effects! It's appalling. My husband tried one of those blood pressure medications last year, and he was a complete wreck for weeks. No thank you. I prefer to handle things…naturally, whenever possible.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly reasonable, Ms. Rannells. It's good to be mindful of potential medication side effects and prioritize a holistic approach to health. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see. No, I don’t believe so. I’ve always been rather fortunate in that regard. A slight sensitivity to pollen in the spring, but that's hardly an allergy. A bit of a sniffle, perhaps. Nothing that requires…antihistamines or anything of that nature. And I can’t say I’ve ever had a reaction to food. My husband is quite particular about what he eats, so we generally stick to…simple, well-prepared meals. Nothing overly processed or…exotic. Honestly, the thought of a food allergy is rather unsettling. All those sensitivities these days! It's a modern affliction, I suspect.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Rannells. Now, thinking about your family history – are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or mental health conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history…that's a complicated matter. My mother lived to be ninety-two, but she was a rather…eccentric woman. Always insisted on home remedies and refused to see a doctor unless absolutely necessary. My father had…high blood pressure, I believe. And a touch of arthritis in his later years. As for more serious conditions…my aunt on my husband’s side had breast cancer, but that was many years ago. And my great-uncle suffered from…nervousness, apparently. He was a bit of a recluse, if I recall correctly. Honestly, the family wasn't terribly forthcoming about medical matters. It was considered rather…indelicate to discuss such things. A bit of a hush-hush affair, really. I don't believe there's anything particularly…concerning, if that's what you're asking. Though, like I said, my mother was remarkably healthy. A truly extraordinary woman. She swore by chamomile tea. Perhaps I should try that. Though I suspect it wouldn't be quite as…effective as what you prescribe.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Rannells. Family medical history can be difficult to trace. Before we proceed, let's briefly discuss your social history. Do you currently smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely not. Heavens, no. I find the habit utterly repulsive. My husband smoked a pipe for a few years when he was younger, but he gave it up decades ago. Said it didn’t agree with him. And frankly, I wouldn’t allow it in the house. It’s simply…unhealthy and…uncouth. I do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. A nice Cabernet Sauvignon, perhaps. But that’s hardly the same thing. I believe moderation is key in all things. And I certainly don’t partake in any…other substances. A respectable woman such as myself wouldn't dream of it. I simply wanted to address this stress, you understand? And I trust you can help me with that.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Ms. Rannells. Thank you for being so open. Now, to get a better understanding of your current state, could you describe a typical day for me?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it’s rather…structured, if I may say so. I wake up around seven, though not by choice, naturally. My husband insists on a rather early start. I oversee breakfast - he’s a bit particular about his eggs, you see - and then I generally spend the morning attending to various…responsibilities. Managing the household staff, reviewing finances, corresponding with…acquaintances. It’s a rather involved process, I assure you. Afternoons are usually devoted to…social engagements. Luncheons, charity events, the occasional bridge game. I’m quite active in the community, you see. And then evenings are…quiet. Dinner with my husband, perhaps a bit of reading, and then bed. It’s a rather…routine existence, I suppose. Though I wouldn’t have it any other way. It keeps me…occupied, you understand? It’s just…the constant pressure of maintaining everything can be…exhausting. It's a constant state of being on, as I mentioned before. And that's what I'm hoping you can help me with. A little something to...take the edge off.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very full and demanding schedule, Ms. Rannells. It's perfectly understandable that you're feeling stressed. Now, just to be thorough, have you experienced any other symptoms besides sleeplessness and irritability?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me see. Well, my digestion hasn’t been quite what it used to be, if I’m being honest. A bit of…indigestion, occasionally. And I find myself feeling…rather fatigued towards the end of the day, even after a full night’s sleep. Though that could simply be due to…age, naturally. And my memory isn’t quite as sharp as it used to be, I suppose. I sometimes forget…names, or where I’ve placed my glasses. But that happens to everyone, doesn’t it? Nothing terribly concerning, I assure you. Just the usual…declines of getting older. And I do find myself…a bit more anxious than I used to be, particularly when I have to…travel. I simply don’t enjoy being away from home. Everything must be just so, you understand? It’s just…everything feels a little…off-kilter, as I said before. And that’s what I’m hoping you can help me with. A little something to…smooth things over. I just want to feel…more like myself again.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Rannells. It’s helpful to have a complete picture of what you’re experiencing. Now, I’m going to do a brief physical exam, just to get a baseline. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly acceptable. Though I must warn you, I bruise rather easily. My skin is…delicate, you see. And please be gentle with my blood pressure cuff. It always feels rather…constricting. But otherwise, please proceed. I trust you know what you’re doing. I do hope this won’t take too long. I have a luncheon engagement at one o’clock. With the garden club, you see. It's rather important. And I simply must remember to bring the petit fours.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Rannells. I’ll be as gentle as possible. I'll keep it brief, and I’ll certainly remember the petit fours. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient? My husband always says I take rather shallow breaths. He insists on proper diaphragmatic breathing. Honestly, the man is a bit of a…health enthusiast. Always lecturing me about posture and hydration. It's exhausting. But, yes. There. Is that what you needed? I do hope I'm not making a fuss. It's just…I don't generally enjoy being…examined. It feels rather…invasive, if I may say so. Though I trust you are a professional. Proceed.
DOCTOR: Your heart sounds regular, Ms. Rannells. Your lungs sound clear, although your breath sounds are a little shallow, as you mentioned. No wheezes or crackles detected. Now, I’m going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Please relax your arm for me. Your blood pressure is 138/82, and your pulse is 72 and regular. It is slightly elevated, but not concerning at this moment. Now, I’m going to briefly examine your throat and ears. Could you please open your mouth and say "Ah"?
PATIENT: There. Is that sufficient? My tonsils were removed many years ago, as I mentioned before. A dreadful affair, but quite necessary, the doctor said. And I do hope I don't have any…inflammation. I simply must attend that luncheon this afternoon. It's the annual petit fours competition, you see. And I'm determined to win. My recipe is a closely guarded secret, of course. It involves a rather delicate lavender cream. But please proceed. Just be gentle. And do try not to poke too much.
DOCTOR: Your throat looks clear, no signs of inflammation. Your ears appear normal as well. Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Please let your arms relax. Your reflexes are normal and equal on both sides. Alright, Ms. Rannells, that completes the physical exam. Everything appears within normal limits for your age. Based on your history and the physical exam, it appears you are experiencing stress-related symptoms, including insomnia, irritability, fatigue, and digestive issues. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, which could be related to stress as well. Do you have any questions about the exam?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I don’t believe so. You’ve been very thorough, I must say. Though I do hope it wasn’t too much trouble. It's simply…I’m not accustomed to being…prodded and poked. Honestly, it’s all rather…unsettling. But you’ve assured me that everything appears within normal limits, which is…reassuring. So, what does this mean? Are you going to prescribe me something? Something to…take the edge off? Something to help me sleep? And perhaps something for my digestion? I do trust you have something…suitable. And preferably something that won’t interfere with my luncheon. I simply must be at my best this afternoon. The petit fours competition is rather important, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Rannells. Based on your symptoms, medical cannabis may be a suitable option to help manage your stress, improve your sleep, and alleviate your digestive issues. However, it’s important to understand the potential risks and benefits before proceeding. There are various strains and methods of consumption available, each with different effects. We can discuss those options and determine what might be best for you. It’s also important to start with a low dose and gradually increase it as needed. Before we proceed, I want to review your medications and allergies to ensure there are no contraindications. We will also discuss potential side effects and drug interactions. Are you comfortable proceeding with a trial of medical cannabis?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it sounds…promising. Though I must confess, I’m a bit apprehensive. I’ve always been rather…conservative when it comes to these sorts of things. And I certainly wouldn’t want to become…dependent. Or…giddy. Or…unmanageable. But if you think it might help, I suppose I’m willing to try. Though I trust you’ll monitor me closely. And I certainly wouldn’t want anything that would interfere with my…social engagements. The luncheon, you see. It’s rather important. And please, Doctor, nothing…too potent. Just something to…smooth things over. And help me sleep. And perhaps settle my digestion. And nothing that would make me…forget my name. Or my petit fours recipe. Yes. I believe I’m willing to proceed. But cautiously. And under your strict supervision.
DOCTOR: Excellent, Ms. Rannells. I understand your concerns, and I assure you we'll proceed cautiously. Given your concerns about potential side effects and your active social life, I recommend starting with a low-THC, high-CBD tincture. CBD is non-psychoactive, meaning it won't cause any intoxicating effects. It can help with anxiety, sleep, and inflammation without making you feel “giddy” or impaired. We’ll start with a very low dose – 2.5 milligrams – taken one hour before bedtime. We’ll monitor your response closely and gradually increase the dose as needed, up to a maximum of 5 milligrams if tolerated. I’ll also provide you with detailed instructions on how to administer the tincture and potential side effects to watch out for. We’ll schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess your response and make any necessary adjustments. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds…reasonable. Low-THC, high-CBD…that’s reassuring. And 2.5 milligrams…that doesn’t sound too alarming. And one hour before bedtime…that should allow me to sleep soundly. And a follow-up appointment in two weeks…that will allow you to monitor my response closely. Yes. That sounds…acceptable. Though I do trust you have a reputable source for the tincture. I wouldn’t want anything…tainted or…unreliable. And please, Doctor, ensure it doesn’t have any…peculiar taste. I have a rather delicate palate, you see. Yes. Proceed. But cautiously. And under your strict supervision. And with a reputable source for the tincture. And a palatable taste. And low-THC. And high-CBD. And 2.5 milligrams. And…one hour before bedtime. Yes. That sounds…acceptable. Now, about the petit fours competition…do you have any experience with pastry?
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, Ms. Rannells, my pastry skills are…limited. I’m a physician, not a baker! But I certainly wish you the best of luck in the competition. I’m sure your recipe is exceptional. I'll write you a prescription for the 2.5mg CBD tincture and provide you with a list of reputable dispensaries in the area. I’ll also give you some educational materials on medical cannabis and potential side effects. Before you leave, do you have any other questions or concerns?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that covers everything. You’ve been very thorough, I must say. And reassuring. Though I still harbor a bit of apprehension, I feel…somewhat confident. Yes. I believe that covers everything. The prescription…the dispensaries…the educational materials…that will suffice. Now, about those petit fours…my secret ingredient is a touch of lavender cream, as I mentioned before. It’s a closely guarded family recipe, passed down through generations. And I use only the finest Madagascar vanilla beans. It’s all in the details, you see. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been most helpful. I do hope this tincture…works. And doesn’t interfere with my luncheon. Yes. Thank you. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Rannells. I’m confident you’ll do well, both with the tincture and the competition. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And do let me know how the luncheon goes! Have a wonderful day, and best of luck! .
