DOCTOR: Good morning, Jase. I'm Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Um, hi Doctor. It's… well, it's my stomach. It’s been really bothering me. Like, a lot of diarrhea. It's been going on for a bit now, and it’s just… persistent, you know? I think it might be something I've had before, something with… well, I don't really remember the name, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Persistent diarrhea, alright. And how long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. A while… maybe a couple of weeks? It comes and goes, but it keeps coming back, if that makes sense. It’s hard to keep track, honestly. I've just been trying to… deal with it. It’s not fun, that’s for sure.
DOCTOR: A couple of weeks, fluctuating. I see. And are you experiencing any other symptoms alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I feel a little tired, I guess? But I always feel a little tired, so it’s hard to say if that’s new. And… sometimes my stomach cramps a bit. Not awful, but noticeable. Oh! And I haven’t been as hungry as usual, I think. I've lost a little weight, probably, but I don’t really weigh myself regularly.
DOCTOR: Alright, fatigue, intermittent cramping, and decreased appetite. We’ll need to get a better understanding of this. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool, or black, tarry stools?
PATIENT: Blood? No, not that I’ve seen. And… what did you say? Black, tarry stools? No, thankfully. That sounds… not good. I haven't noticed anything like that, no. That's a relief, right?
DOCTOR: It is, yes. Now, have you had any fever, nausea, or vomiting with this?
PATIENT: No fever, no. And I haven’t been sick, like, throwing up. No nausea either, just… not wanting to eat much. It’s not a sudden thing, like food poisoning. It’s more… gradual, you know? I just slowly started feeling less hungry and then the stomach issues started getting worse. It’s kind of a blur, to be honest. I don’t remember exactly when things started.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's talk about what you’ve been eating and drinking. Any recent changes in your diet?
PATIENT: Um… not really. I mean, I try to eat pretty normally. My husband does most of the cooking, and he makes good stuff. We eat a lot of… Pakistani food, of course. Biryani, curry, things like that. I guess I’ve been drinking a little more water than usual, just because I’ve been… well, losing fluids. But nothing major. No new foods or anything like that.
DOCTOR: And have you traveled anywhere recently?
PATIENT: No, not at all. We haven’t been on a trip in… oh, goodness, years! We mostly just stay around here. We don’t really get the chance to travel much. It’s just… home, work, and trying to keep things running smoothly. So, no travel. Definitely not that.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any known allergies – to food, medications, anything at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… Not that I know of. I've never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I don't take any regular medications either. Just… over-the-counter stuff sometimes, for headaches or a cold. Nothing serious. I think I’m pretty allergy-free, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Oh… that's… a bit complicated. I was diagnosed with something years ago… something with my intestines. I think it was celiac disease, or maybe Crohn's? Something like that. But it was a long time ago, and I don't really remember all the details. It was… a lot of tests and stuff, and then I just… tried to manage it. I don't go to the doctor much. I just deal with things as best I can. I think my husband knows more about it than I do, honestly. It feels like a lifetime ago.
DOCTOR: So you were diagnosed with either celiac disease or Crohn’s disease in the past?
PATIENT: Yes! That's it. One of those. I think… Crohn’s, maybe? It was years ago, and honestly, the doctor explained it all so fast. I was young, and I just… wanted it to be over with. I remember having to change my diet and stuff, but I can’t recall the specifics. It's all a bit blurry. I think it's Crohn's, but I could be wrong. Sorry, I'm not very helpful, am I?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, we'll get to the bottom of this. Do you recall if you were ever specifically told to follow a gluten-free diet?
PATIENT: Oh… yes! I think so. My husband always makes sure there’s gluten-free bread and stuff in the house. And I remember avoiding certain foods… wheat, barley, rye… things like that. He was really good about it. I think it was part of managing… whatever it was. He’d always check labels and everything. So, yes, I think I was told to follow a gluten-free diet. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It is. Okay. Now, have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not that I remember. I've never had anything major. Nothing like surgery. Just… regular check-ups and stuff. No operations or anything like that. I think I would remember something like surgery, wouldn't I? So, no. No surgeries. Thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: Family? My parents… they're both back in Pakistan. I don't see them very often. My husband’s family is here, but they're all pretty healthy, as far as I know. No one has… anything like this, I don't think. No one has stomach problems or anything like that. They all eat everything! I don't know… I don't think there's a family history of this. But I haven't really asked, to be honest. It's not something we talk about much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never! Absolutely not. I don't smoke, I barely drink any alcohol – maybe a sip of wine with dinner sometimes. And definitely no drugs. My husband and I are… pretty healthy people. We try to take care of ourselves. So, no, none of those things. Definitely not.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen, and then I'll palpate it. Please let me know if anything feels painful.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. Just let me know if you need me to do anything. I'm a little nervous, to be honest. But I trust you, Doctor. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm going to palpate your abdomen now. Is there any tenderness here?
PATIENT: Ooh, yes, a little bit there. It’s not awful, but it’s… sensitive. A little bit uncomfortable. Does that mean something’s wrong? It’s been feeling a little tender there for a few days now.
DOCTOR: Tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant. Alright. Do you feel any rebound tenderness when I release pressure?
PATIENT: Yes! A little bit. It… hurts more when you let go. Is that bad? I’m sorry, I’m not very good at explaining this. It’s just… a sharp pain when you release the pressure. It feels… concerning.
DOCTOR: Positive rebound tenderness in the right lower quadrant. Alright, Jase. Based on what you've told me, and what I've found during the exam, I'm concerned about a possible flare-up of your Crohn's disease, or potentially something else causing inflammation in your bowel. We need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a stool culture, and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. The CT scan will help us rule out any serious complications. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… like a lot. But… yes, okay. If that’s what we need to do, that’s fine. I just… I want to know what’s going on. And I want to feel better. So, yes, please. Run the tests. How long will it take to get the results? And… what if it is a flare-up? What do we do then? I’m getting a little scared now.
DOCTOR: Alright, the blood tests should come back within a few hours. The stool culture will take a couple of days, and the CT scan results usually take about an hour to review. If it is a flare-up, we'll need to start you on medication to reduce the inflammation. Depending on the severity, this could involve oral steroids or other immunosuppressants. We may also need to adjust your diet and ensure you’re getting enough fluids. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary. But let's not jump to conclusions. We’ll wait for the results and then discuss the best course of action. I'm going to have the nurse draw your blood now. And we’ll get the orders in for the stool culture and CT scan. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think I’m a little overwhelmed. Just… the blood tests first, I guess? And then we’ll see. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. I just want to feel normal again. .
