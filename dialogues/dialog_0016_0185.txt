DOCTOR: Hi Zelina, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Maskal. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, I don’t really have time for this. It’s my breath. It smells, okay? Bad. My ex-husband definitely noticed. It’s… embarrassing. Can we just figure out how to fix it?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It is frustrating when something like that happens, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. We can definitely try to figure out what's going on. “Smells bad” can mean a lot of things, so let’s try to narrow it down. Can you describe the smell?
PATIENT: Like… bad. I don't need to give a detailed fragrance report, Doctor. It’s just… unpleasant. Like something’s rotting. Is that good enough? Honestly, I brush, sometimes. And I use mouthwash when I remember. It’s not like I’m never cleaning my teeth.
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear you. No fragrance report needed! And it’s helpful to know you do brush and use mouthwash sometimes. Just trying to get a complete picture. When did you first notice the smell?
PATIENT: Ugh, probably a few months ago? It’s been getting worse, I guess. Right around when things started… not working out with Tomas. It’s probably stress. Everything is stress these days. Can’t it just be stress?
DOCTOR: It very well could be stress, Zelina. Stress can definitely contribute to things like bad breath, but we want to rule out anything else going on. A few months ago… have you noticed it being worse at certain times of day, or after eating certain foods?
PATIENT: Look, I work on the highway, okay? I eat when I can, wherever I can. Usually it's something quick, like a sandwich or a pastry from the gas station. I don’t exactly have a gourmet schedule. It’s probably worse in the afternoons when I’m tired and haven't had water for a few hours. Happy?
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Working on the highway and a less regular eating schedule… Yes, that gives us some good information. And no, I’m not trying to make you unhappy! Just trying to understand the whole picture. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like what? I told you, it's my breath. It smells bad. I don't have a fever or anything. Look, I'm a practical person. I fix things. I don't have symptoms. I have a problem. Can we just skip to the solution?
DOCTOR: I understand you’re looking for a solution, and we’ll get there. Sometimes, what feels like a simple problem has other things going on underneath. So, I’m just going to ask a few quick questions, okay?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it fast. I have a shift to get back to. And if it’s going to involve a lot of poking and prodding, just tell me now. I really don’t have the patience for that.
DOCTOR: Okay, I promise to be quick. No extensive poking and prodding right now. Let’s start with your teeth. Do you have any pain or sensitivity in your teeth or gums?
PATIENT: No. Look, I told you, I brush sometimes. If something was seriously wrong, I’d know, wouldn't I? I'm not completely oblivious. Can we move on? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Okay, you're right, it's good you're aware of your own body. We can move on. Have you noticed any changes in your saliva – is your mouth often dry, or do you feel like you have too much saliva?
PATIENT: I don’t really… pay attention to my saliva. It’s saliva. It’s just… there. Sometimes my mouth feels a bit dry, I guess, especially when it’s hot working outside. But that’s it. Is this going anywhere? Honestly, I’m starting to think this was a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Okay. We're gathering information. Now, have you noticed any unusual taste in your mouth recently?
PATIENT: Ugh, no. It tastes like… whatever I last ate. Gas station pastries, usually. Or a sandwich. Definitely not a gourmet flavor profile, Doctor. Look, can we just give me something to fix it? Mouthwash? A stronger toothpaste? Anything? I really don’t have time for a full dental investigation.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration and wanting a quick fix. However, bad breath, especially if it’s new or worsening, can have several causes. It’s not always just about brushing more. It could be related to something going on with your sinuses, or even less commonly, something else entirely. I'd like to do a quick exam of your mouth and throat, just to rule out any obvious issues. Then, if we don’t find anything, we can discuss other possibilities. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. But make it quick. Seriously quick. And no lectures, okay? I’m already late as it is. Just look, tell me what you see, and give me something to fix it. That’s all I want. Let’s just get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will be as quick as possible. Please open your mouth for me. Okay… Your teeth and gums look generally healthy, though there’s some minor redness along the gumline. Your tongue looks a bit coated. And I do see some mild redness in the back of your throat. No obvious signs of infection, but it's a little inflamed. Do you have any allergies to medications, or any medical conditions I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No allergies. And no. I’m perfectly healthy. I work outside, I fix things. I don't have time to be sick. Look, is that it? Can we just get to the fix now? I'm starting to feel like I'm wasting my time here.
DOCTOR: Okay. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it could be a mild inflammation causing the bad breath. It's likely not a serious issue, but we should address it. I recommend a few things. First, improve your oral hygiene – brush twice a day and floss daily. Second, stay well-hydrated. Drinking plenty of water helps wash away bacteria. And third, I'm going to recommend a mouthwash containing chlorhexidine gluconate. It's an antibacterial mouthwash that can help reduce bacteria in your mouth. You can find it over-the-counter at most pharmacies. If the bad breath doesn't improve within a week with these measures, please come back, and we can consider other possibilities, such as a referral to a dentist or further investigation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Water, brushing, fancy mouthwash. Got it. Look, I really don’t have time for follow-up appointments. I’m hoping this actually works. Is there anything else? Because if not, I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay. I understand. I’m hopeful this will resolve the issue. I do have one last thing. Given your job and being outside, it’s always a good idea to stay up-to-date on your tetanus vaccination. Do you know when you last had a tetanus shot?
