DOCTOR: Good morning, Larin. My name is Dr. Octavis AX. It's good to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Good to meet you too. My back... it really hurts. Bad. It's been hurting for a little bit now, but today it's... a lot. You see, I have... the cancer, and I think maybe it has something to do with it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Larin. I understand your back is hurting, and it's significantly worse today. And you’re concerned it might be related to your cancer diagnosis. That’s a very valid concern, and we'll definitely explore that. First, let’s talk about this back pain. When you say "a little bit now," how long has it been bothering you – roughly?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. It started, I think, maybe... three weeks ago? But it was just a little ache. Like when you sleep wrong. I didn't pay it much mind, you know? But then, like... four days ago, it got much worse. Now it's hard to even stand up straight. And sitting? Forget about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, three weeks with a mild ache, worsening significantly over the last four days. That makes sense. And you're finding it difficult to stand and sit, is that right?
PATIENT: Yes, that's right. Standing... oof. And sitting is just... pain. Like a sharp pain, sometimes, and then just a dull ache. It makes it hard to do things, you know? I work at the factory... and I need to be able to do things.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s impacting your ability to work, which is concerning. Can you describe the location of the pain more precisely?
PATIENT: It's... low, low on my back. Right here. It feels like it goes through to my stomach sometimes, too. Not all the time, but when it’s really bad. And sometimes, I feel it in my hips a little bit. Both sides.
DOCTOR: Okay, so lower back pain, radiating through to your stomach at times, and some discomfort in both hips. Has anything specific caused this pain to flare up, or did it just gradually get worse?
PATIENT: Hmm... I don't think so. Nothing I can remember doing. I didn't lift anything heavy. I didn’t fall. It just... started. Maybe it got worse after work one day, but I do a lot of the same things every day. That’s why I’m worried about the cancer, you know? I thought maybe... maybe it’s spreading?
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable concern, Larin, given your history. We absolutely need to investigate that possibility. Let's talk a bit more about your cancer diagnosis. What type of cancer was it, and what treatment have you received so far?
PATIENT: It's... stomach cancer. They found it last year. I had surgery to take out part of my stomach, and then I had… the medicine. Chemotherapy, I think it was called. I finished that about six months ago. The doctors said it was good then. Everything looked good. But now this pain… it's making me scared.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Larin. It's completely natural to be worried when new pain arises after cancer treatment. It’s good that your scans were clear six months ago. Just to clarify, have you had any other symptoms alongside the back pain?
PATIENT: No, not really. No fever. No… losing weight. I’m still tired, but I’m always tired, even before this pain. And… my stomach feels okay, mostly. It hurts sometimes, like a normal stomach ache, but it’s not bad. Oh! And I haven’t been going to the bathroom as much as usual, maybe? But I drink a lot of water, so... I don't know if that means anything.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no weight loss, usual fatigue, and a possible change in bowel habits. That’s helpful information. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what’s happening. And if… if it is the cancer, what can we do?
DOCTOR: Of course. We'll figure this out together. Can you tell me if this is tender anywhere?
PATIENT: Ouch! Yes, right there. And… a little bit here too. It really hurts when you press. It's not a sharp pain, it’s more of a deep ache, like a bruise.
DOCTOR: Okay, tenderness to palpation in the lower back, right and slightly off midline. Do you feel any pain when I ask you to bend forward?
PATIENT: Yes! Oof! It really hurts. Like something is pulling. And I can’t go much further. I feel… stuck. It’s hard to straighten up again too. Maybe I shouldn't do that.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited range of motion with forward flexion and pain with movement. Your reflexes are normal, and I'm detecting normal sensation in your legs and feet. Based on this brief examination, Larin, it could be a muscle strain or a problem with your spine. However, given your history of stomach cancer, we need to rule out other possibilities, including potential metastasis. I want to order some imaging – an X-ray of your lower back and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. These scans will give us a clearer picture of what’s going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good, Doctor. I want to know what’s happening. Whatever you think is best. A CT scan… is that the one where I have to drink something? And will it show if the cancer has… spread? I just want to be sure.
DOCTOR: Yes, a CT scan typically involves drinking a contrast solution to help visualize the organs more clearly. And yes, it will help us determine if there’s any sign of the cancer having spread. We'll also get the X-ray to check for any immediate fractures or alignment issues. I’m going to write these orders now. The radiology department will schedule the scans for you. Once the results are available, we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail and create a treatment plan. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant and some pain medication to help manage your discomfort. It's important to take them as directed. Also, try to avoid any strenuous activity and focus on gentle movements. Is that something you can manage?
PATIENT: Yes, I can do that. No lifting, gentle movements… I understand. Muscle relaxant and pain medicine... okay. So, you don't think it's definitely the cancer? I know you haven’t seen the scans yet. It just… it's scary to think about.
DOCTOR: I understand your fear, Larin. It's completely natural to be worried. It could be something else, and we are taking the necessary steps to find out. Muscle strains and other spinal issues are common, and we need to rule those out first. The scans will help us do that. I’m also going to have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in one week, regardless of the scan results, just so we can discuss everything and address any concerns you may have. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. One week... okay. And the nurse will call me about the scans? And to schedule the appointment? Thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better knowing we’re doing something.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Larin. Yes, the nurse will contact you to schedule both the scans and the follow-up appointment. I’m glad to hear you’re feeling a little better. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Do you have any other questions or concerns for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You've been very helpful. I'll go wait for the nurse.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Larin. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if any new symptoms develop before your follow-up. Have a good day, and we’ll see you soon.
