DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Pirl. It’s lovely to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor Pirl. It is very nice to meet you as well. Um… well, for the past few days, I have been coughing up… blood. Just a little, but it worries me. It is in my… spit, when I cough.
DOCTOR: I understand. Coughing up blood, even a small amount, is certainly something we need to investigate. Just to clarify, Ms. Weichers, when you say “a few days,” could you tell me approximately how many days has this been occurring?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started… maybe four days ago? It was just a tiny spot at first, I thought maybe I bit my tongue in my sleep. But then it happened again yesterday, and again this morning. It is not a lot of blood, but enough to make me concerned.
DOCTOR: Okay, four days. And you've noticed it each time you cough?
PATIENT: Not every time, no. Mostly when I cough harder. Like… if I try to clear my throat really well, or if I wake up and have a bit of a cough then. Sometimes it’s just… normal spit. But when the blood is there, it is… bright red. Does that make sense? I am sorry, I am not very good at explaining.
DOCTOR: You're explaining perfectly well, Ms. Weichers, please don’t apologize. Bright red blood is helpful information, thank you. Now, have you been experiencing any other symptoms alongside the coughing?
PATIENT: Oh, good. I was worried I was being unclear. Um… let me think. I have been a little tired lately, but I thought that was just because of the heat. And… maybe a little bit of a chest pain, but it is not very bad. It only happens when I cough a lot, and it feels… like a dull ache. Nothing sharp. I do not have a fever, I checked this morning.
DOCTOR: Alright, some fatigue, a dull chest ache with the coughing, and no fever. Have you noticed any shortness of breath, Ms. Weichers?
PATIENT: Shortness of breath… hmm. Not really. I walk a lot, you see. I like to walk to the market and back. I haven't had any trouble with that. Maybe… just a little winded sometimes, but I always get a little winded when I walk uphill. Is that what you mean?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. So, normal exertion shortness of breath, nothing new or unusual. Now, Ms. Weichers, could you tell me a little about your medical history?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Well… my husband, he passed away five years ago. He had… heart problems. And… I had pneumonia once, a long time ago, when I was in my twenties. I was in the hospital for a week. Other than that, I am usually very healthy. I eat a lot of vegetables and I try to get enough sleep. I do not smoke, and I do not drink very much alcohol. I don't have any allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: I am very sorry for your loss, Ms. Weichers. That must have been very difficult. And thank you for sharing your medical history. So, no known allergies, a history of pneumonia in your twenties, and generally good health. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. It was a long time ago, but… thank you. No, I am not taking any medications right now. Nothing at all. Just vitamins sometimes, but I haven't taken them in a few weeks. I try to get most of what I need from my food. I really prefer to avoid taking pills if I can.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, Ms. Weichers, I’d like to listen to your lungs and check your vital signs. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… sensible. Please, go ahead. I will do whatever you think is best. Just let me know if it will be… uncomfortable. I am a little nervous, but I trust your judgement.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Weichers. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all. I’ll just listen to your breathing, and then take your temperature, blood pressure, and pulse. Please take a few deep breaths for me. I'm hearing some slight crackling in the lower lobes of both lungs. Not significant, but something we should investigate further. Your blood pressure is 130/80, pulse is 72 and regular, and your temperature is normal at 98.6 Fahrenheit. Now, could you please tell me if you have any family history of lung problems, like asthma or bronchitis?
PATIENT: Oh… crackling? That doesn’t sound good. My… my mother, she had bronchitis a few times when she was older. She smoked, you see. She didn’t take very good care of herself. And… my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had… I think it was emphysema. He also smoked. But no one else that I know of had any lung problems. I always tried to stay away from smoke, even as a child. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That is helpful information, thank you, Ms. Weichers. A family history of bronchitis and emphysema, with smoking as a common factor. Given your symptoms – coughing up blood, the crackling in your lungs, and your family history – I think it would be prudent to order a chest X-ray to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An X-ray… yes, I think so. If you think it is best, then yes, please. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I just… I want to know what is causing this. It worries me to think it could be something serious. Where will I go for the X-ray? And when will I get the results?
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Weichers. I understand your worry. We'll get to the bottom of this. The X-ray can be done right here in the clinic, I'll have my nurse schedule you for that immediately. It’s a quick and painless procedure. The radiologist will read the results, and I should have them back to you within 24 hours. I will call you as soon as I have them, and we can discuss them then. In the meantime, I recommend you avoid any strenuous activity and drink plenty of fluids. If you experience any increased bleeding, shortness of breath, or chest pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: That sounds… good. Thank you, Doctor. Twenty-four hours… I can wait. I will avoid exercise, and drink lots of water. And I will go to the emergency room if anything changes. Um… just one question. Is it… is it possible it is nothing serious? Sometimes I worry too much. I don’t want to cause a fuss if it is just a little cold.
DOCTOR: It’s good you ask, Ms. Weichers. It is possible it’s nothing serious, but given your symptoms and family history, we need to rule out anything concerning. We're being thorough to ensure your peace of mind. The X-ray will give us a much clearer picture. Try not to worry too much, but please, be vigilant and don’t hesitate to seek immediate care if your condition worsens. My nurse will be in shortly to schedule your X-ray. Do you have any other questions before she arrives?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. Thank you very much, Doctor Pirl. You have been very kind and helpful. I feel… a little better knowing we are doing something to find out what is wrong. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I'm glad I could ease your mind a little. Please don’t hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your results are in. Take care of yourself, and we'll speak again soon.
