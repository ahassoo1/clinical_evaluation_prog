DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Wrye, good to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello. It's... about a letter. For a pet, you see. A nice little thing, really. I need something… official-looking, I suppose. To prove I can take care of it. Honestly, the whole thing feels a bit silly, but they're being very particular. Don't ask me who "they" are, though. It's all a bit fuzzy now.
DOCTOR: A letter… for a pet?
PATIENT: Yes, exactly! A letter. Some places just insist on paperwork, don't they? It's a dog, a small one. Not a bother, really. Well-behaved, mostly. I just… I need a doctor to say I’m capable, I guess? It’s ridiculous, honestly. I've had pets my whole life. You'd think they'd trust me!
DOCTOR: Right. So, this isn't… a medical issue with the dog, per se. It’s a request for a statement about your ability to care for it. Just to be clear?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! The dog is perfectly fine. A bit spoiled, maybe, but healthy as a horse. It's just… this housing place, you see? They want to be sure I'm… responsible enough. It's just a formality, I'm sure. Honestly, it feels like they think I'm going to neglect a tiny little dog. The nerve! Is that what they're thinking?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, with all due respect, this is a medical practice. I address medical concerns. While I understand you're frustrated, a letter verifying your pet care abilities isn’t something I typically provide. Perhaps a veterinarian could assist you with that?
PATIENT: A veterinarian? Oh, heavens, no. They just want to sell you things! Shots, food, toys… It's a racket, I tell you! They don't understand people. This is about proving I'm a sensible adult who can look after an animal. Surely a doctor can attest to that! I come here for check-ups, don't I? You know I'm healthy. Doesn’t that count for something? It's just a simple letter... Honestly, it's so much fuss over nothing.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I appreciate you are a patient here, and I am glad you prioritize your health. However, my professional opinion on your general health status does not equate to an assessment of your pet care capabilities. It's... a different skillset, frankly. I wouldn't feel comfortable providing a letter that could be misconstrued as a professional medical evaluation of your ability to care for an animal. I'm not qualified to do so. Perhaps you could explore alternative documentation?
PATIENT: Alternative documentation? What is that supposed to mean? Look, I'm not trying to be difficult, but this is ridiculous. I've always had animals, always! A cat, a bird, a hamster… even a little iguana once! I’m perfectly capable. It feels like you're questioning my responsibility, and frankly, it's insulting. I just need a signed piece of paper... Is that really too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand your frustration. But let me reiterate: I am a physician, focused on human health. I assess and treat medical conditions in people, not animals. Providing a statement about your ability to care for a pet falls outside the scope of my practice, and frankly, could have legal implications. It's simply not something I can do. I suggest you contact the housing authority and discuss your concerns with them directly. Perhaps a reference from a previous landlord or a responsible pet ownership certificate would be more appropriate. I truly am not the right person for this request.
PATIENT: Well. That's… unhelpful. Honestly. Fine. I suppose there's no reasoning with you, is there? A responsible pet ownership certificate… where does one even get one of those? This whole thing is a nightmare. I came here for a simple letter, and now I'm being lectured on the scope of medical practice! It's beyond ridiculous. .
