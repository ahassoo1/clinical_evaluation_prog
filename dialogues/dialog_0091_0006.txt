DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Weichers. My name is Dr. Talen Delacour. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Well, I… I have been coughing up some blood. It scared me a lot, so I thought I should come see someone right away. It’s… not a lot, but enough to worry me.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. Weichers. Coughing up blood, even a small amount, is certainly something we need to investigate. To help me understand what might be going on, could you tell me a little more about this cough?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Um… it started maybe a week ago? Just a little tickle in my throat, really. I didn’t think much of it at first. But then, a couple of days ago, I noticed… red. Not a lot, like you said, just… streaks in my spit when I cough. It happens mostly in the morning, I think. Sometimes during the day, but not as often. I don’t smoke, if that matters.
DOCTOR: That is helpful information, Ms. Weichers. The fact that it started a week ago and the streaks are primarily in the morning are important details. And thank you for mentioning you don’t smoke; that’s relevant. Could you describe the color of the blood?
PATIENT: Oh… um… it’s… bright red. Not dark, not… old-looking. Very red. And… it’s mixed with my spit, of course. It’s not… clumps of blood, just… lines and spots. I hope that makes sense. It’s hard to describe, sorry. It just… worries me.
DOCTOR: You’re describing it perfectly well, Ms. Weichers. Bright red blood suggests the source is likely relatively close to the airways. Let’s gather a bit more information. Have you experienced any other symptoms alongside the cough?
PATIENT: Yes. Well, I have been… very tired lately. More tired than usual, even. And sometimes I feel a little… short of breath. Not all the time, but when I walk up the stairs, or… if I try to do something quickly. Also, I think I have a little… chest pain? Not sharp, more like a dull ache. It comes and goes. I thought maybe it was just getting old, but… it’s probably related, right?
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re sharing all of this, Ms. Weichers. Fatigue, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort are all potentially relevant. To clarify the chest pain, could you describe where exactly you feel it?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. It’s… mostly in the middle of my chest. Not on the side, right in the front. And sometimes it feels like it goes through to my back a little bit. It’s not a bad pain, like… something is broken. Just… uncomfortable. Like a pressure, maybe? It doesn’t hurt when I breathe, usually. It’s hard to explain. I’m sorry if I’m not being very clear.
DOCTOR: You're being perfectly clear, Ms. Weichers. Mid-chest discomfort, even if described as pressure, warrants careful attention. Now, let's move on to your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. I had high blood pressure, for a while. But the doctor said it was under control with medicine. I take a small pill every day for it. And… oh, years ago, I had pneumonia. A long time ago. I recovered fully, though. I don’t have any… allergies that I know of. My husband… he passed away last year. It was… sudden. That’s why I have the high blood pressure, I think. The stress.
DOCTOR: I’m sorry to hear about your husband, Ms. Weichers. That must have been a very difficult time. And thank you for sharing your medical history. It’s helpful to know about the high blood pressure and the previous pneumonia. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: No, just the one. A small white pill. I take it every morning with my breakfast. The doctor said it was all I needed, and it has been working fine. I don’t take any vitamins or… anything else. I just want to know what’s wrong, you know? It’s scary when you don’t know.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ms. Weichers, and we will work to determine the cause of your symptoms. To complete the history, could you tell me about any family history of lung conditions, heart disease, or bleeding disorders?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. My mother… she had a cough a lot when she was old. I don’t think it was anything serious, just… an old person’s cough. My father… he had heart problems. He had to have a… a pacemaker, I think they called it. And… my brother, he had some trouble with bleeding. He bruised very easily, and he had nosebleeds a lot. But that was when he was a child. It was a long time ago. I don't know if any of that matters.
DOCTOR: That information is all valuable, Ms. Weichers. A family history of heart problems and a bleeding tendency are relevant. Now, I’d like to perform a physical examination. I'll listen to your lungs and heart, check your blood pressure and oxygen saturation, and feel your lymph nodes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just… I just want to know what’s going on. Please, go ahead. I trust you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: I hear some mild wheezing in the lower lobes of both lungs, and some diminished breath sounds on the left side. I’ll also palpate your lymph nodes, checking for any swelling. They feel normal. Your oxygen saturation is 95%, which is within a normal range. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and some blood work to help determine the cause of your symptoms. The X-ray will allow us to visualize your lungs and heart, and the blood work will assess your overall health and rule out any infection or bleeding disorders. Does that sound acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. An X-ray and blood work… okay. Will it take long to get the results? And… will it hurt? I don’t like needles very much.
DOCTOR: The X-ray itself is painless, Ms. Weichers. It involves standing in front of a machine for a few seconds. As for the blood work, there will be a brief pinch when the needle is inserted, but it’s usually very quick. The lab technician is very skilled. The results usually take 24 to 48 hours to come back. I will personally review them as soon as they are available and contact you to discuss them. In the meantime, if your cough worsens, if you develop a fever, or if you experience any chest pain that is severe or doesn’t go away, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. You explained everything very clearly. Just… thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me. I’m just… worried. It’s hard to think straight when you don’t know what’s wrong. I guess I will just… wait for the results.
DOCTOR: You are very welcome, Ms. Weichers. I understand your anxiety, and I will do my best to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. Please don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns or questions before we receive the results. Here’s a lab requisition form for the blood work and an order for the chest X-ray. The receptionist will schedule the X-ray for you. Thank you for coming in today.
