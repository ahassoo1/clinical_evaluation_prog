DOCTOR: Right. Odell Tayar, yes?
PATIENT: Uh, yeah. That's me. Is… is something wrong? You looking at me like that.
DOCTOR: No, no, it's just… well, you're a young man. Shouldn't need to be in here bothering me with… whatever it is. But, alright. Let's get this over with. Why are you here today?
PATIENT: Bothering you? Look, I lost my wife, okay? And I'm going… somewhere. Need some… shots, I think. She always took care of this stuff. I don't… remember where exactly I'm going, just… far. Hot place. That's all I know.
DOCTOR: Lost your wife, you say. Right. And this "far, hot place"... is this a planned trip, or… are you just deciding on a whim?
PATIENT: Whim? No! It… it was her dream. We talked about it. A long time ago. Before… everything. I'm just… doing what she wanted. It's important. Though, honestly, I can't even remember what she wanted to do there. Just… go. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Vaguely. Look, "important" doesn't get you very far in medicine, Mr. Tayar. We need specifics. Do you know what vaccinations you might need?
PATIENT: Vaccin… uh… no. She handled all that. Little cards, I think? She kept them somewhere. I looked… but I can't find anything. I just know I need… something, before I go. For… sickness. It's a long trip, yeah? And I don't want to get sick.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's start with the basics. I see here your height is… 155 centimeters. And weight, 104 kilograms. That’s… significant. Have you had any medical issues recently?
PATIENT: Significant? What’s that mean? I'm just… small. And okay, yeah, I eat. So what? No problems, not really. Just… sad, I guess. Since… well, you know. Nothing medical, though. Just… tired a lot. Is being sad a medical problem?
DOCTOR: "Tired a lot" is remarkably unhelpful, Mr. Tayar. And while grief is unpleasant, it doesn’t usually necessitate a doctor’s visit. We’re trying to determine if you need preventative care for travel to… wherever you're going. Have you experienced any fever, chills, cough, or any other symptoms recently?
PATIENT: No! No fever, no chills. Just… tired. And a little bit… jumpy, maybe? I keep forgetting things. Like where I put my keys. Or what I had for breakfast. Important things! But no sickness. Just… old. I feel old, even if I'm not. Does that make sense? Is being forgetful a sickness? I don’t even know anymore.
DOCTOR: “Jumpy” and “forgetful” could indicate a number of things, none of which are helpful without more detail. Let’s try this. Have you traveled internationally before?
PATIENT: Uh… I think so. With her. Years ago. Maybe to… India? Or Thailand? I don't remember very well. We went a lot of places, but… it's all a blur now. She always planned everything. I just… went along. Did I get shots then? I have no idea. I didn't ask. She took care of it. Honestly, I'm starting to get a headache.
DOCTOR: Right. Let's start with a basic physical assessment. We'll check your blood pressure, pulse, and temperature. Then we can see if there are any obvious red flags. Roll up your sleeve. And please, try to focus. We need to establish some baseline information before sending you off to… wherever it is you're going.
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Just… hurry up. It's hot in here. And I really don't like doctors.
DOCTOR: Blood pressure is… elevated. 160 over 95. That’s not ideal. Pulse is also a bit fast, 90 beats per minute. Temperature is normal, 98.6 Fahrenheit. Lungs are clear. No obvious signs of infection. However, your weight is a concern. And the elevated blood pressure... We really need to get a better handle on your medical history, Mr. Tayar. Have you ever been diagnosed with hypertension or any other chronic conditions?
PATIENT: Hy… what now? Chronic… what? Look, I just worked on airplanes. Fixing things. Not… medical stuff. I never went to the doctor unless she made me. She said I was… strong. But maybe she was wrong. I don't know. I just felt tired. And… sad. Is that a condition? Being really, really sad? Because I’m pretty good at that one.
DOCTOR: "Strong" is not a medical diagnosis, Mr. Tayar. And while grief is certainly a valid emotion, it doesn't explain the elevated blood pressure or your… vagueness regarding your medical history. Do you take any medications currently?
PATIENT: No! Never. She said I didn’t need any. Just… rest. And eat. She made me eat a lot. Maybe too much? Look, I really don't remember. It’s all… fuzzy. Like a bad dream. I just want to go where she wanted me to go. And I need… something to make sure I don’t get sick. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tayar, with all due respect, you're providing remarkably little information. You're planning a trip to an unknown location, you have elevated blood pressure, and you refuse to provide a clear medical history. I understand you're grieving, but this isn't helping. Before I can even consider recommending any vaccinations, I need to know if you have any allergies, or if you’ve had any previous serious illnesses. It's not just about getting shots. It’s about ensuring your safety. Do you have any family members I can contact to gather more information?
PATIENT: No! No family. Just… her. She’s… gone. Don't ask me about family. It makes it worse. Allergies? I don't know! Maybe to dust? Everyone's allergic to dust. I never had serious… what did you call it? Illnesses. Just… colds. And… sadness. A lot of sadness. Look, can’t you just give me something? Anything? To protect me? Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tayar. This is… challenging. Given your lack of a medical history, your elevated blood pressure, and the vague nature of your travel plans, I’m not comfortable administering any vaccinations at this time. It could be… detrimental. However, I will recommend a complete blood workup and an EKG to assess your overall health. We also need to get a better understanding of your destination to determine any potential risks. Are you able to provide even a general idea of where you’re going?
PATIENT: …She talked about… mountains. And… a temple. Somewhere warm. With… lots of colors. She showed me pictures… a long time ago. But I don’t remember the name of the place. Or even the country. She just said it was… beautiful. And peaceful. Somewhere she could… rest. Is that helpful?
DOCTOR: Mountains, a temple, warm climate… that narrows it down somewhat. It could be Nepal, India, Thailand, several other locations. Nepal is… plausible, given your background. However, without more information, I’m hesitant to proceed. I strongly recommend contacting the CDC Travel Health hotline. They can provide guidance based on potential destinations. I will write you a referral. And, Mr. Tayar, I urge you to consider seeing a grief counselor. Your emotional state is clearly affecting your ability to recall important information. Here’s the referral, and the phone number for the CDC. Please contact them. And schedule a follow-up appointment with me after you've spoken with them and have a better idea of your travel plans. Do you understand?
PATIENT: CDC… grief… It’s a lot. Okay. I… I guess. Mountains and temples. I’ll try to remember. She would want me to. Thank you… I think. It's just… hard. Is it okay if I just… go now? I don’t think I can… talk anymore.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Tayar. You may go. But please, follow up with the CDC and schedule a follow-up appointment. And consider the grief counseling. It may be beneficial. The nurse will escort you out. Have a… safe trip. .
PATIENT: .
