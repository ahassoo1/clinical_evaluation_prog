DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. Welcome to the clinic. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to you too, doctor. Ross, you say? Hmm. Well, it’s… down there. Somethin’s leakin’. It’s kinda… icky. Not a lot, but enough to bother me. I don’t like it. It’s just… there.
DOCTOR: Okay, “down there” – I understand. And you say it’s been leaking?
PATIENT: Leakin’... yeah. For a little while now. Not sure how long. Maybe a week? Two? Time kinda… slips, you know? It’s not like a waterfall, thankfully. Just… a little damp. And smells… off. Not good.
DOCTOR: I do understand – time can slip away. A week or two is helpful. And you’ve noticed an odor as well?
PATIENT: Yeah, a bad smell. Like… old fish, maybe? I try to keep things clean, I really do. But it’s still there. I don’t know what’s goin’ on. It’s embarrassing to even talk about, honestly. My mama always said… well, never mind what my mama said. It’s just… unpleasant.
DOCTOR: It's perfectly alright to feel embarrassed, Ms. Genard. It is a sensitive topic, and you've done the right thing by coming in to get it checked out. Old fish… okay, that gives me a little more to work with. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the leaking and the odor?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmmm. Let me think. It kinda… burns a little when I… use the bathroom. Not all the time, just sometimes. And it feels… itchy. Not real bad, but enough to make me… fidget. That's about it, I think. Oh! And I feel tired, but I’m always tired. That’s probably just old age, though.
DOCTOR: Okay, burning with urination and some itching – that's good to know. And the fatigue – while it could be age-related, it’s important to consider everything. Now, I’m going to ask a few more general questions, if you don’t mind. Have you had any changes in your urinary habits recently?
PATIENT: Changes…? Like, how much I go? I don’t think so. Seems about the same. Gotta go just as often as always, I guess. No trouble startin’... or stoppin’. Just… the leakin’ is new. And the smell. And the burn. It’s a whole mess, really. I don’t usually bother doctors, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand you don’t usually bother doctors, and I appreciate you coming in today. No trouble starting or stopping your urine stream is good information. Now, have you experienced any pain in your lower abdomen or back?
PATIENT: Lower abdomen…hmm. Sometimes a little ache. But I get aches all over! Old bones, you know? Can’t really say it's any different than usual. Back’s okay, mostly. Gets a little stiff when I garden, but that’s nothin’ new either. I do a lot of bendin’ and reachin’. It's just… aches. I don’t pay ‘em much mind.
DOCTOR: Okay, aches are common, and it’s helpful to know you don't have any specific, new back pain. Now, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like diabetes or urinary tract infections?
PATIENT: Diabetes… no. Never been told that. Urinary tract… uh… I had somethin’ when I was younger, maybe? A long time ago. Needed to drink a lot of water. Can’t really remember much about it. It didn't last long. I mostly just… get over things. Don't usually need doctors for it. My mama had strong remedies, you know?
DOCTOR: That's helpful to know. A past urinary tract infection is worth noting, even if you don't remember much detail. And your mama’s remedies… I respect that. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications or supplements?
PATIENT: Medications… well, I take a little somethin’ for my arthritis, keeps the joints from gettin’ too stiff. Just a little white pill, I think. Can’t remember the name. And sometimes I take somethin’ for sleep, but not every night. Just when I can’t get to rest. And I drink chamomile tea, does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for arthritis, something for sleep occasionally, and chamomile tea – thank you for telling me. Now, do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Not that I know of. I eat all kinds of things, never had no trouble. I’ve been stung by bees, but just a little owie. Never had no real bad reaction to nothin’. I’m pretty tough, you know? Mama always said I was a strong girl.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No known allergies are helpful. Alright, Ms. Genard, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you're comfortable with that. We'll just take a look at your abdomen and do a quick pelvic exam to try and determine the cause of the leaking and discomfort. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Pelvic exam? Oh dear. Now hold on just a minute… I… I don't know. That sounds… invasive. I don’t think so. I really don’t. Is there any other way? I’m an old woman, doctor. I don’t need… pokin’ and proddin’. Can’t you just give me somethin’ for it?
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Ms. Genard, and I completely respect your concerns. A pelvic exam is the most accurate way to determine the cause of your symptoms, but it is absolutely your choice whether or not to proceed. We can certainly discuss other options, but without a physical exam, it will be difficult to make a diagnosis. However, I would like to explain why I recommend it. It allows me to visually assess the area for any signs of infection, inflammation, or other abnormalities. It also allows me to gently check for any tenderness or masses. We can start with a urine sample to rule out a urinary tract infection. And if that comes back negative, we can discuss the possibility of referring you to a gynecologist who may be more comfortable with performing the exam. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: A urine sample? That sounds… okay. Not scary. And a gynecologist…? I don't want to see another doctor! Too much fuss. So, just the pee test then. Yes. That’s all I want. Just tell me what’s wrong with my pee, and give me somethin’ for it. Please.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Genard, just the urine sample then. I completely understand. We’ll start there. I'm going to have the nurse bring you a sterile cup. Please try to collect a midstream sample – that means start urinating, then collect a small amount in the cup, and finish urinating. The nurse will explain it if you need it. It’s important to be as clean as possible when collecting the sample. After you’ve collected it, she’ll take it to the lab, and we should have results within a few hours. In the meantime, is there anything else you'd like to discuss or any other symptoms you've been experiencing?
PATIENT: Midstream… hmmm. Okay, I think I understand. Start and stop, you said? I can do that. A few hours, huh? Well, that’s better than pokin’ and proddin’. No, I don’t think so. That’s everything. Just… fix my pee, doctor. That’s all I ask. And maybe a little somethin’ for the tiredness. If you got anythin’.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Genard. We’ll do our best to “fix your pee” and see about something for the tiredness. I’ll have the nurse come in and get you started with the urine sample. It's important to remember that the results will help us determine the best course of action. While we wait, I’ll document everything we’ve discussed today. Do you have any questions for me before the nurse comes in?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all. Just get it over with, and hopefully, it won’t be too bad. Thank you, doctor. And tell that nurse to be gentle. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Genard. I’ll make sure the nurse is aware of your concerns. I’ll let you know as soon as the results are back. Please just relax, and I’ll be right back to discuss the results with you. I’ll be just outside if you need anything.
