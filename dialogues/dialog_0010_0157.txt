DOCTOR: Good morning, Tasmia. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s a pleasure to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Look, I don’t have a lot of time, so I’ll just say it. The nurse took my blood pressure, and it was high. My husband made the appointment. He worries too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're short on time, and your husband is concerned about your blood pressure reading. That's perfectly alright. We'll get through this efficiently. Just to clarify, do you know what the blood pressure reading was, specifically?
PATIENT: No, I don’t. Honestly, I don’t pay attention to numbers. That’s his thing. He’s always talking about readings and charts. I just know it was “high” enough to make an appointment. I feel fine.
DOCTOR: Alright, no problem at all. We can certainly look that up in your chart. Okay, it looks like the nurse recorded a blood pressure of 148 over 92 this morning. And you mentioned you feel fine – have you been experiencing any symptoms at all – things like headaches, vision changes, chest pain, shortness of breath, or anything else unusual?
PATIENT: Headaches? Sometimes. But I work outside a lot. Sun, heat… it gives me headaches. I don't see anything different. And no, no chest pain or… breath stuff. Look, I’m a civil engineering tech. I build roads. I don't sit around thinking about how I feel. Is this going to take long?
DOCTOR: I understand. Working outside can definitely contribute to headaches. And it’s good you’re generally feeling well. Okay, just a few more questions to get a better picture. Has anyone in your family – parents, grandparents, siblings – had problems with high blood pressure or heart disease?
PATIENT: My grandma, on my mom’s side, had something. She was always sick, though. A lot of different things. My dad's side… not that I know of. They mostly just… worked. Hard. And didn't complain. This is my husband's worry, not mine. Honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful to know. And it’s perfectly reasonable for your husband to be concerned, even if you aren’t. Now, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter – and do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No medications. Except maybe ibuprofen sometimes for those headaches. And no allergies that I know of. I mean, I get stung by bees sometimes, working outside, but that’s just a sting. Not an allergy. Look, are we almost done here? I have a site survey to get to.
DOCTOR: Okay, no current medications or known allergies. Good. Alright, Tasmia. Just to be thorough, I’d like to do a quick physical exam – just listen to your heart and lungs, and feel your pulse. It won’t take more than a few minutes. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. But make it quick. I really don’t have time for… poking and prodding. Honestly, I don't see the point, but my husband will be asking if I did everything you said if I don't.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your time constraints. This will be quick and straightforward. Heart sounds are normal, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Pulse is a bit strong, but regular. Blood pressure, taken now, is 145 over 90. Okay. Your blood pressure is elevated, and it's consistently high based on the nurse’s reading and this one. We call that hypertension, or high blood pressure. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything is wrong right now, but it does mean we need to address it to prevent problems down the road.
PATIENT: Prevent problems? What kind of problems? I build roads. I don't have time to worry about… future problems. Look, can we just write a prescription for something and be done with this? My husband keeps talking about a pill he read about online... Lisinopril, I think it was called. Is that one okay? Honestly, I just want to get back to work.
DOCTOR: I understand your wanting to get back to work, and I appreciate you being upfront about your husband’s research. Lisinopril is a medication often used to treat high blood pressure, and it’s a reasonable option. However, I’m hesitant to simply write a prescription without a little more information. High blood pressure can, over time, increase your risk of heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, and other serious conditions. We want to make sure we’re addressing the cause of your high blood pressure, if possible, not just treating the number. Before we start any medication, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your lifestyle – your diet, exercise habits, and stress levels. Also, it would be helpful to run a few simple blood tests to check your kidney function and rule out any other underlying causes. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Ugh. More questions? More tests? Honestly. Fine. But make it quick. I eat… normal stuff. Burgers, fries, sometimes salad. I don't really have time to cook. Exercise? I build roads, okay? That's exercise. Stress? Yes, I’m stressed. I have deadlines. I have people relying on me. Honestly, I don’t have time for a diet or… relaxing. Just tell me what tests you need. But I don’t want to be here all day. And I really don’t want to change my life.
DOCTOR: I understand. We can certainly work with your current lifestyle. The blood tests I'm recommending are a basic metabolic panel – that checks your kidney function, electrolytes, and blood sugar – and a lipid panel, which checks your cholesterol levels. They'll give us a better overall picture of your health. The lab is just down the hall. They can draw the blood right away. It shouldn’t take more than 15-20 minutes total. Once we have the results, we can discuss the best course of action – whether that’s starting medication, making some small lifestyle adjustments, or simply monitoring your blood pressure more closely. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just point me to the lab. Honestly, I have a meeting in an hour. I don't have time for… discussions. Just tell me what I need to do, and let me get back to work. This is ridiculous. Really. All this over a number.
DOCTOR: Certainly. The lab is right down the hall, first door on the left. Just tell them Dr. Annesley ordered a basic metabolic panel and a lipid panel. They will take care of everything. I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the inconvenience. We'll get these tests done quickly, and I’ll do my best to get you back to work as soon as possible. Once the results are back—usually within a day or two—we'll schedule a quick follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you experience any severe headaches, chest pain, shortness of breath, or vision changes, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions before you head to the lab?
PATIENT: No. Just get it over with. Honestly. .
