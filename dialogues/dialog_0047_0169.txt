DOCTOR: Right, Mr. Miner… Derick. Yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, it's my face and legs. They’re… puffy, you know? Been like this a bit now. Not sure why though. It just… happened. Don’t remember doing anything to cause it.
DOCTOR: “Puffy.” Right. And how long exactly has this “puffiness” been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, geez. How long… that's a good question. A while. Maybe a month? Two? Honestly, time kinda… slips away these days. Since Martha passed, things aren’t as… structured. You understand. It's just… there. Swollen. Not getting worse worse, just… there.
DOCTOR: A month or two. “Just there.” Alright. And is this puffiness constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Come and go… hmm. I think it's… worse in the evenings? Yeah, definitely worse when I sit for a long time. I like to watch the telly, see? And then… well, then it gets bad. When I get up and move around a bit, it goes down some. But it always comes back. Not completely gone, mind you. Just… less.
DOCTOR: Right. So, more noticeable after prolonged sitting. And you said your face is puffy as well?
PATIENT: Yeah, my face. Especially around here. It’s not like… drastically swollen, you know? Just… fuller. My Martha always said I had a round face, but this is… different. It feels… tight. And sort of… achy, sometimes. But not all the time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… well, I get a bit breathless sometimes, walking up the stairs. But I always have, a little bit. I’m not exactly a young man anymore, see? And… I think I’m going to the loo more often. But, like I said, time slips away, hard to tell what’s new and what ain’t.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you had any changes to your diet recently?
PATIENT: Diet? Not really. Same as always. Toast for breakfast, maybe a bit of soup for lunch. Fish and chips on Fridays, if I’m feeling up to it. Nothing fancy. I don't go for all that health food nonsense, never have. Salt's good for you, you know. Keeps you going.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Medications… not that I know of. I don't take much, see? Just a little something for my… aches and pains, sometimes. Doctor gave it to me a while back. Can't remember the name though. Little white pill. Doesn’t seem to be doing much good these days anyway.
DOCTOR: And do you happen to know what that “little white pill” was for?
PATIENT: Well, now, that’s a tough one. Doc said it was for… inflammation, I think? Something about swelling in my joints. But like I said, it was a while back. I just keep taking it because that's what he told me. He was a good doctor, that one. Now… I can’t recall the specifics. It's just a pill, see? Takes the edge off… sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, I’m going to have a quick listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look at your legs and face. Just to get a better picture of what’s going on. If you don’t mind.
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Whatever you need to do. Just try not to poke around too much, alright? I haven’t had a good check-up in ages, so I’m a bit sensitive.
DOCTOR: Right. If you could just lie back for me. Take a deep breath… and exhale.
PATIENT: Here we go. Deep breath… whoosh. There. Happy? It's not easy being an old man, you know. Everything creaks.
DOCTOR: Breathing sounds are a bit… diminished on both sides. Not alarming, but something to note. Now, if you’ll just let me examine your legs. Could you point to where you’ve noticed the most swelling?
PATIENT: Right about here. And here. It’s worst at the ankles, definitely. And it feels… kinda tight. Like my skin's stretched too thin, if that makes sense. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… uncomfortable. And when I press on it… well, it leaves a dent. For a little while.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do note some pitting edema in your lower extremities, and your face does appear somewhat… congested. We'll need to run some blood work to investigate this further. I want to check your kidney function, electrolytes, and rule out any underlying causes. Specifically, we need to consider heart failure, kidney issues, and fluid retention.
PATIENT: Kidney issues? Heart failure? Good heavens. That sounds… serious. What exactly does that mean? I just thought I was a bit puffy, that’s all. This is getting a bit much, isn't it?
DOCTOR: It could be nothing serious, Mr. Miner, but we need to rule things out. Heart failure simply means your heart isn't pumping as efficiently as it should, leading to fluid build-up. Kidney issues can cause fluid retention as well. The blood work will give us a clearer picture. I’m also going to order a urinalysis to check for protein in your urine. Do you have any trouble breathing when you lie down flat?
PATIENT: Lie down flat…? Now you’re talking. Yes, actually. A little bit. I usually need an extra pillow, or two. Been like that for a while, now. Thought it was just getting old. Never bothered to mention it to anyone. Just… adjusted. I’ve always been one to just adjust.
DOCTOR: Right. And the frequency of urination?
PATIENT: Urination… well, more often than usual, I think. Especially at night. Have to get up a couple of times. It’s a nuisance, really. Wakes my… well, never mind. It’s just a bit annoying, that’s all. Keeps me from getting a good night's sleep.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, we have swelling, shortness of breath when lying flat, increased urination, particularly at night… These are all concerning symptoms. I’m going to write you a referral to a cardiologist, and we’ll get you in as soon as possible. I also want to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in one week to discuss the blood work results. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Cardiologist…? Now you're talking serious business. A heart doctor! Good heavens. I just thought I was a bit puffy! Is it… bad? Is it really bad? I don't like doctors, never have. And a heart doctor... I understand… I think. One week? And blood work? Alright, alright. Whatever you say. But I’m not promising I’ll remember all this.
DOCTOR: The blood work will help us determine the severity and the cause. The cardiologist will assess your heart function. I understand this is a lot to take in. The lab results and referral information are here, and I’ve included a sheet with basic instructions for the blood work. It is important you follow these. We need to rule out serious causes, Mr. Miner. It's best to be proactive. Please schedule your blood work appointment and the cardiologist appointment immediately. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Questions…? Well… yes. What exactly do I tell the cardiologist? What should I say? And what if the blood work shows… something bad? I don’t do well with bad news. And… how long does all this take? I just want to feel normal again. Just… normal.
DOCTOR: Tell the cardiologist about the swelling, the shortness of breath when lying down, the increased urination at night, and that you've noticed this has been going on for a couple of months. Bring the blood work results with you. As for "bad news"... we'll cross that bridge when we come to it, Mr. Miner. It could be nothing serious, but we need to investigate. As for how long it will take… that depends on the cardiologist’s schedule and the results of the tests. I can't give you a definite timeline. But delaying this will only make things potentially worse. Is there anything else?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s it. Just… a lot to take in. A cardiologist. Blood work. It's all a bit much. I just wish it was simpler. Will this cost me a fortune? I’m a widower, you know. Not exactly rolling in it.
DOCTOR: I understand your financial concerns, Mr. Miner. Unfortunately, I can’t provide an exact cost estimate. You’ll need to contact the cardiologist’s office and the lab directly for pricing information. There may be options for financial assistance available, and I can provide you with a list of local resources if needed. However, addressing these symptoms is crucial, and delaying treatment due to cost could lead to more serious and expensive complications down the line. Here's that list of resources. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have other patients waiting. Please schedule those appointments as soon as possible. Good day, Mr. Miner.
