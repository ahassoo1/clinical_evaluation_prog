DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Barban. I'm Dr. Press. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is… a check-up, yes? For the insurance. I need to have this done before it starts. It is… required.
DOCTOR: Right. A required check-up for Medicare, is it?
PATIENT: Yes. That is correct. My… friend said I must do this. Before they will… pay for things. He said you are… good doctor. Very thorough. I hope so. It is a lot of… trouble, this insurance.
DOCTOR: Well, I appreciate the vote of confidence, Mr. Barban. Thoroughness is certainly a priority here. To make this as efficient as possible, let’s start with a bit of background. Have you been generally healthy?
PATIENT: Generally… yes. I work. I eat. I sleep. No big problems. I get tired, of course. Everyone gets tired. But no… sickness. Nothing a little rest cannot fix. I have had the… usual things. A cold sometimes. But nothing serious. You understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. And when was the last time you saw a doctor, Mr. Barban?
PATIENT: Hmm… a long time. Many years ago, I think. When I… first come to this country. For the papers. But just a quick look. They checked… things. Not a real doctor visit like this. Maybe… ten years? I do not remember exactly. It was a long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: No medications. Never. I do not like to take pills. They are… bad for you. And allergies… no. I eat everything. Spicy food, sweet food, everything. Sometimes my stomach… disagrees, but it is not an allergy. It is just… strong food.
DOCTOR: Right. No medications, no allergies. And what about any major illnesses in your family – heart disease, diabetes, cancer, anything like that?
PATIENT: My family… it is complicated. Many cousins, many aunts, many uncles. Some have… problems. My father’s brother had… trouble with his sugar. Diabetes, I think you call it. And my mother’s sister… she had sickness. A bad sickness. But I do not know exactly what it was. It was long ago, in Yemen. They did not have good doctors then. So, I do not know much. It is not important, yes?
DOCTOR: It's good to know, even if the details are limited. Family history can be quite important. Alright. Let’s move on to your current lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, no, and no. I do not do those things. They are… foolish. Bad for the body, bad for the mind. I work hard. I need to be strong, to think clearly. Those things… they would make that difficult. I drink tea, sometimes. Yemeni tea. It is good for you. Much better than those other things.
DOCTOR: Very good. That’s all helpful information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don’t mind. Just to get a baseline of your current health. We'll check your blood pressure, heart rate, listen to your lungs, and take a look at your ears, nose, and throat. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that is fine. Whatever you need to do. Just… be quick, please? I have things to do later. Work does not wait for insurance check-ups, you understand. But go ahead. I will… cooperate. Do not worry.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you’ll just have a seat here and loosen your shirt, we can get started. Let’s begin with your blood pressure. 140 over 90. A little elevated. We'll keep an eye on that. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. Take a deep breath for me… and again…
PATIENT: It is… tight. This shirt. But it is all I have. And my lungs… they are fine. I work with my hands. Strong hands. They need air. Do not worry about my lungs. They are strong. Like the rest of me. What did you find? Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Lungs sound clear, thankfully. Ears look normal. Throat… slightly red, but nothing alarming. Your pulse is a bit fast as well. 88 beats per minute. You mentioned working with your hands. What kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: I work in… the food place. Processing. Cutting, cleaning, packing. It is… hard work. Long hours. It is not a clean job. And sometimes… it is hot. Very hot. I lift many heavy things. That is why my pulse is fast, I think. And my… everything is fast. It is a physical job. You understand. I do not sit at a desk. I work.
DOCTOR: Right. A physically demanding job. We’ll need to factor that in. Now, to complete the check-up, I’d like to take a few blood samples. Just routine blood work to assess your overall health. Cholesterol, blood sugar, a complete blood count. It's standard procedure, even for an insurance check-up. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: Blood? You want to take my blood? Is that… necessary? For the insurance, you say? I do not like needles. And I do not feel sick. I told you, I work. I do not have time for… this. How much blood do you need? And will it hurt? I do not understand why this is… needed. Just for the insurance?
DOCTOR: It is necessary, Mr. Barban. The insurance company requires a baseline blood work panel for anyone undergoing a physical examination. It's not about whether you feel sick, it’s about establishing a reference point for your health. It helps to rule out any underlying issues you might not be aware of. And yes, there will be a brief pinch, but it's very quick. A small amount of blood is all we need. Just enough for the lab tests. We can proceed with the blood work now, or we’ll have to reschedule the entire examination. The insurance won’t approve it without it.
PATIENT: Fine. Do it quickly, then. Just… be careful. I do not want to… faint. And tell me when you are… finished. I have things to do, you understand. Quickly, please. I do not have all day for… needles.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax your arm, and try to take a few deep breaths. Alright, all done. Just keep pressure on that for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. I'll have the lab results sent to me within a few days. Once I have those, we can discuss the next steps. For now, I recommend maintaining a healthy diet, getting enough rest, and continuing to be mindful of your physical health. And if you experience any unusual symptoms – chest pain, shortness of breath, severe fatigue – please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… when will I hear about the insurance? That is all I care about. And thank you. I think. Just… get me the insurance. That is enough. I will be going now.
DOCTOR: The lab results will be sent to me, and once I’ve reviewed them, I'll submit the paperwork to the insurance company. You should hear back from them within a few weeks. Have a… good day, Mr. Barban. .
