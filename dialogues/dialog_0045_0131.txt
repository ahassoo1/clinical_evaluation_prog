DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sladen, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Dr. Billman. It’s Mykeisha Sladen, actually. And it’s my blood pressure. It’s been a bit high lately, and my sister told me I should really get it checked out. She worries, you know?
DOCTOR: Sladen, right. Family always has something to say, doesn’t it?
PATIENT: Tell me about it! She means well, though. Always looking out for me. But yeah, the blood pressure… it’s just been feeling off, I guess. Like, I get headaches sometimes, and I feel a little dizzy when I stand up too fast. Nothing major, but it’s enough to make me wanna get it checked.
DOCTOR: “Feeling off” isn’t a diagnosis, Ms. Sladen. We need specifics. How high is high?
PATIENT: Oh, right, sorry. I don’t really… know the numbers. I took it at the pharmacy a couple of times, and the machine said something like 140 over… 90, maybe? Both times it was around there, or a little higher. I didn’t write it down, I shoulda, shouldn’t I?
DOCTOR: You should have. It’s hard to get a proper baseline when you don’t bother to document things. Still, 140/90 isn't ideal. Let's get a proper reading now. And truthfully, relying on pharmacy machines... well, let's just say they aren't known for their precision. Have a seat and relax your arm. Don't talk while I'm taking it. It throws off the reading.
PATIENT: Okay, okay, I’m sorry. I just… I don’t really know what I’m doing, you know? Pharmacy machine sounded easy enough. I’ll try to remember next time, I promise. Is this alright? Should I keep it still like this?
DOCTOR: Yes, perfectly still. Honestly, it's not that complicated. 148 over 92. Not drastically different from what you said, but confirming it's consistently elevated. Have you been experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Um… let me think. Not really, not that I’ve noticed. Maybe a little tired sometimes, but I work a lot, so I just figured it was that. Oh! And my ankles feel a little swollen at the end of the day, but I’m on my feet a lot too. Does that count? I don’t… I don’t know if that's related. It just started happening a couple of weeks ago.
DOCTOR: “A little tired” and “a little swollen” aren’t exactly helpful, Ms. Sladen. It all sounds like you’re just pushing yourself too hard. But alright, let’s go through the motions. Any family history of hypertension?
PATIENT: Well, my grandfather on my mother’s side had high blood pressure, I think. He was always sick, though, so it could have been something else. And my aunt, her brother, he had a stroke a few years back. I don't know if it was related to blood pressure, but… it was definitely serious. I don't really know much about it, though. My mom never really talked about it. Is that important?
DOCTOR: It’s always important. Family history matters, even if your family isn’t forthcoming with details. So, stroke on your mother’s side and hypertension in the grandfather… good to know. Now, let's talk about your habits. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: Oh no, not me. Never touched a cigarette in my life. My sister tried to get me to once when we were teenagers, but I said no way. I don’t like the smell, and it just doesn’t seem healthy. I do drink sometimes, though. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe a couple on the weekends. Nothing crazy, though.
DOCTOR: “Nothing crazy” is subjective, Ms. Sladen. How many glasses are we talking?
PATIENT: Um… usually just one or two glasses of wine with dinner, maybe three if it’s a special occasion. And sometimes on a Saturday night, I’ll have a rum and coke. But really, not every weekend. Maybe twice a month, tops? I don't drink to get drunk, just to relax. And I always eat something with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And your diet?
PATIENT: Well, I try to eat healthy. I work at a senior center, so we always have to make sure the residents are getting good meals. It rubs off, you know? Lots of vegetables, some chicken or fish. I like macaroni pie, though. And dumplings. My sister makes the best dumplings. I do eat a bit of salt, I like to season my food. But I try not to overdo it. I’m not perfect, but I try.
DOCTOR: “Trying” isn’t a strategy, Ms. Sladen. It sounds like you have some risk factors here: family history, occasional alcohol, a diet that's… less than optimal. We’ll need to run some tests to get a clearer picture. A basic metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and an EKG. Just to be safe. And then we can talk about possible treatment options. I’ll put in the orders now. The lab is down the hall.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Tests… that sounds serious. What are you looking for exactly? And treatment options… does that mean medication? I really don't like taking pills, if I can help it. I always get stomach aches with them.
DOCTOR: Don’t panic. It’s standard procedure. The tests will tell us how your kidneys are functioning, your cholesterol levels, and if there’s any strain on your heart. As for medication… we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it. Lifestyle changes can often make a significant difference. We'll start there. But if those aren’t enough, then yes, medication might be necessary. I'm printing out the lab orders now. And I’m going to have the nurse check your weight and blood pressure again before you leave, just to confirm. Here are your orders. Go down the hall, and they’ll take care of you.
PATIENT: Okay, okay. Weight and blood pressure again… I feel like you’re just checking me over and over. But alright. I'll go. Is there anything else I should be doing? Like, should I cut out salt completely? Or stop drinking wine?
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Sladen, I’m not going to give you a rigid set of rules right now. Just… be mindful. Reduce your salt intake, limit your alcohol consumption, and try to eat healthier. And for goodness sake, try not to stress so much. Stress raises your blood pressure. Go get the tests done, and we’ll discuss the results next week. And try to get some rest. Next patient.
PATIENT: Oh… alright. Okay, I’ll try. Thank you, Dr. Billman.
