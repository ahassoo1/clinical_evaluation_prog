DOCTOR: Hi Raymonde, welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. DeCosta. It’s nice to meet you. Why don’t you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. Land, things have been…well, not so good lately. I’ve been feeling awful sick to my stomach, most days. And I don’t even get hungry like I used to. Just a few bites of food and I feel full, but not in a good way, you know? It's just… unpleasant. I don’t rightly know what’s going on. It’s been going on for… a little while now, I reckon. I forget exactly when it started.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Feeling sick to your stomach and not having much of an appetite – that’s certainly unpleasant, and it’s good you came in to get it checked out. It can be a lot of things, so we’ll try to figure it out. You mentioned it's been going on for "a little while". Could you try to be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Oh dear… specific. That's the hard part, isn’t it? My memory… it just ain’t what it used to be. Let me think… it started… after… well, after my husband passed, I think. Or maybe a little before? It’s all a bit of a blur. Maybe… three or four months ago? It’s hard to say for sure. Everything seems to run together these days. It definitely got worse after… after the funeral. Does that help any?
DOCTOR: That does help, Raymonde. Losing your husband must have been incredibly difficult, and it's very common for things like appetite and digestion to be affected by stress and grief. Three or four months ago is a good starting point. So, it started around the time of your husband's passing, and has been ongoing, perhaps worsening after the funeral. Besides the nausea and lack of appetite, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, you’re very kind to say that. It was hard. Still is, truth be told. Let me see… other symptoms… well, I've been feeling awfully tired. More tired than usual, and I’ve always been a napper, you know? But this is… different. And I've lost a little weight, I think. My clothes feel a bit looser. Not a lot, but noticeable. And… sometimes my stomach just hurts. A dull ache, mostly. It comes and goes. I don’t know if that makes sense. It's hard to explain.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Raymonde. Fatigue, some weight loss, and a dull ache in your stomach – those are all things we need to explore. It's good you're telling me everything, even if it seems small. Now, about that stomach ache… where exactly do you feel it?
PATIENT: Well, it's mostly… right here. It's not a sharp pain, like a cramp or anything. Just a… heavy feeling. Sometimes it feels like a fullness, even when I haven’t eaten much. And it seems to bother me more after I try to eat something, even just a little bit. Though, like I said, I don’t get very hungry these days. It’s just… uncomfortable. I hope I’m not explaining this very well.
DOCTOR: You’re explaining it perfectly fine, Raymonde. That’s very helpful. So, a dull ache in the upper left part of your abdomen, feeling full quickly, and it’s worse after eating. Let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any medical conditions that you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Oh my. Well… let me see. I had my gallbladder out years and years ago. Probably… thirty years ago, maybe more? And I have… arthritis, in my hands mostly. It flares up sometimes. And… they told me I had high blood pressure a while back, but I take a pill for that. A little white pill. I think it works okay. I also… I had cancer a few years back. Breast cancer. But they removed it, and I had… radiation, I think. It was a long time ago. I don’t remember all the details. It’s all a bit of a blur, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's a lot of information, Raymonde, and thank you for sharing all of that. Gallbladder removal, arthritis, high blood pressure managed with medication, and a history of breast cancer with treatment – that all gives us a good picture. Do you remember what kind of breast cancer it was?
PATIENT: Oh dear… now that's a hard one. The doctors told me… something about… cells, I think? Invasive something-or-other. And… they said it was early stage when they found it. And… they did a lumpectomy, I think. And then the radiation. Honestly, Doctor, it was so long ago, and I was so scared and upset, I don’t remember the specifics. They did tell me it was treatable, and they got it all, thankfully. I just… I don’t remember the details of what kind it was. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Raymonde. It was a stressful time, and it's understandable that you wouldn't remember all the details. Knowing it was invasive and early stage is helpful. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the one for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… well, there's the pill for my blood pressure. And… sometimes I take something for my arthritis, when my hands are really bothering me. It's a little orange pill. Ibuprofen, I think? Or something like that. And… oh! Sometimes I take a stool softener. I… well, I get a little constipated sometimes. Especially since… everything started. I try to drink plenty of water, but… it doesn't always help. It's not very glamorous, I know.
DOCTOR: It’s not glamorous, but it's important information, Raymonde! Thank you for telling me. So, you take medication for blood pressure, ibuprofen for arthritis as needed, and a stool softener. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, allergies… hmm. Let me see. I don’t think so. I’ve never had a really bad reaction to anything. I used to get a little itchy when I ate strawberries, but that was when I was a little girl. I haven’t eaten strawberries in years, and I don’t think it would bother me now. And… no, I don’t think I’m allergic to any medications either. The doctors always asked me, and I always told them no. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything, but… honestly, I can’t remember for sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. No known allergies. Now, I’d like to ask about your social history. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh no, never. My mama always said smoking was a terrible habit, and I always listened to her. I never picked up a cigarette in my life. My husband, bless his heart, he tried it a few times when he was younger, but he quit a long time ago. He said it just didn't agree with him. We both preferred a nice cup of tea, always.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. No history of smoking. Do you drink alcohol, Raymonde?
PATIENT: Oh, very occasionally. Just a little bit of wine with dinner, sometimes. Especially on special occasions. My husband and I used to enjoy a glass of red wine with our Sunday roast. But I don’t drink very often now. Not much call for it, living on my own. Maybe a small glass at Christmas, or Thanksgiving. But honestly, Doctor, it’s been a while since I had a drink. I wouldn't say I drink, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It does make sense, Raymonde. Occasional, very light alcohol consumption. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh dear… now that’s a hard one. My mama, she had… diabetes, I think. And her mama, she had… heart trouble. And my brother, he had… high blood pressure, like me. But honestly, Doctor, it was so long ago, and there were so many of us, it’s hard to remember exactly who had what. We didn’t talk about medical things much when I was growing up. It wasn't really the done thing. I know my husband’s mama had… arthritis, really bad arthritis in her hands. But other than that… honestly, I can't really say. I wish I could be more helpful.
DOCTOR: That's okay, Raymonde. You've given me a good start – diabetes, heart trouble, and arthritis in the family. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else you’d like to tell me about how you’ve been feeling, or anything you think might be relevant?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Well, I've been feeling a little more tired than usual, like I said. And… sometimes I just feel… down. I miss my husband terribly, of course. But it's not just that. It's like… a weight on my chest. A heaviness. I don’t sleep very well either. I wake up a lot during the night. And… sometimes I get a little confused. I forget things easily. Like names, or where I put my glasses. It's just… little things. But they're starting to bother me. And… I guess that’s about it. I just want to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand, Raymonde. Feeling down, fatigue, trouble sleeping, and some forgetfulness, on top of everything else – that’s a lot to deal with. It's completely understandable that you're not feeling your best. Okay, I’d like to do a quick physical exam now, if that’s alright with you. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and check your reflexes. It won’t take long. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Go ahead. I trust you. Just… be gentle, please. My tummy's been a bit sensitive lately.
DOCTOR: Of course, I will be very gentle. Your heart sounds regular, a little bit fast, but otherwise normal. Lungs are clear. Okay, I'm just going to feel your abdomen now. Let me know if anything feels painful. Hmm… a little tenderness here, but nothing too concerning. No masses that I can feel. It does feel a bit… full. Everything else feels okay. Reflexes are a little bit slow, but within normal limits. Okay, that’s all done. Everything seems generally okay physically, but your tenderness and fullness in the upper abdomen, along with the fatigue and other symptoms you've described, are concerning enough to investigate further. I’d like to order some blood tests. A complete blood count, a metabolic panel, a liver function test, and a thyroid test. These will give us a better idea of what might be going on. Do you have any allergies to blood draws?
PATIENT: Oh, good. Well, it doesn’t sound too bad, if you don't find anything awful. And no, I don’t have any allergies to blood draws. I’ve had plenty of those in my life. It’s just… the thought of more tests makes me a little anxious. But I trust your judgment, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what's going on.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Raymonde, and I’ll do everything I can to make sure we get to the bottom of this quickly and efficiently. The tests will help us rule out a lot of possibilities. While we’re waiting for the results, I’m also going to recommend a stool test to check for any signs of infection or blood in your stool. It's a simple test you can do at home. I’ll give you the kit before you leave. Given your fatigue, feeling down, and some forgetfulness, I’d also like to do a brief cognitive assessment. It's a short series of questions to assess your memory and thinking skills. It's not a formal diagnosis, but it will give us a baseline and help us monitor any changes. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds like… a lot of tests. But… I suppose if it helps, I should do them. Yes, I’m comfortable with the cognitive assessment. I just… I worry about my memory, to be honest. It’s not what it used to be. And… I don’t want to be a bother.
DOCTOR: You're not a bother at all, Raymonde. It's my job to help you, and that includes investigating any concerns you have. It's good you're being honest about your memory. We're just gathering information to get a clearer picture of what's going on. This won't take long. I'll just ask you a few simple questions. Okay, good. That's helpful. Based on your responses, your memory seems a little bit slower than average, but there's nothing alarming. We'll keep an eye on it. Okay, so we’ve got the blood tests, the stool test, and we’ll monitor your memory. I'm also going to recommend some supportive care measures while we wait for the results. It’s important to stay hydrated, eat small, frequent meals, and get as much rest as possible. And, if you're feeling down, don't hesitate to reach out to friends or family, or consider talking to a therapist. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Oh my. That's… a lot to take in. Hydrate, small meals, rest… I can try. And… I have a friend, Martha, who’s always been good to me. I can talk to her. Yes… I do have a question. You said… blood tests, and… monitoring my memory. Could it be… something serious, Doctor? I've had cancer before, and… well, it worries me.
DOCTOR: That's a very valid concern, Raymonde, and I appreciate you asking. It’s important to address your fears. It’s too early to say definitively whether it’s something serious. The tests will help us rule out a lot of possibilities, including cancer recurrence, but also things like vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and infections. Your symptoms could also be related to stress and grief, or even a side effect of medication. We need to gather more information before we can jump to any conclusions. I want to be upfront with you – there is a possibility it could be something serious, but it’s equally likely it’s something less concerning. I’m going to order these tests as quickly as possible, and we’ll discuss the results as soon as they come in. We’ll take it one step at a time. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as fever, severe abdominal pain, or any significant changes in your mental state. Do you have any other questions, or is there anything else I can do to help you feel more comfortable?
PATIENT: Oh dear. One step at a time… that sounds good. Less concerning… I hope it's less concerning. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very kind. No, I don't think I have any other questions right now. Just… thank you. And… can you tell me where I need to go for the blood tests? And… what do I do with the stool test kit? I don't want to mess it up.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Raymonde. I’m here to support you through this. For the blood tests, you can go to the lab at Suburban General Hospital. It’s just down the street, at 123 Main Street. You don’t need an appointment. Just tell them Dr. DeCosta ordered the tests for Raymonde Kelder. I'll print out a requisition form for you now. As for the stool test kit, it comes with simple instructions. Basically, you collect a small sample of your stool in the container provided, and then seal it in the bag. There’s a pre-paid envelope to mail it back to the lab. I’ll have the nurse go over the instructions with you before you leave, just to make sure you’re comfortable with it. It’s important to follow the instructions carefully to get an accurate result. Do you think you’ll be able to manage that, or would you like me to have the nurse come in and explain it again?
PATIENT: Oh, that's good. Suburban General… I know where that is. And… the nurse explaining the stool test kit… that would be very helpful, thank you. I don't want to mess it up. My eyesight isn't what it used to be, and… well, I'm just a little nervous. Thank you, Doctor. You've been very patient with me. I really appreciate it. I think… I think that's all for now. I just want to go home and rest. And… try not to worry too much.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Raymonde. It’s my pleasure. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns at all. I’ll have the nurse come in right away to go over the stool test instructions with you. And I'm going to write you a note for a follow-up appointment in two weeks, or sooner if we get the test results back earlier. Please take it easy and try to relax. We’ll get to the bottom of this together. Take care, Raymonde. And don’t hesitate to call. .
PATIENT: .
