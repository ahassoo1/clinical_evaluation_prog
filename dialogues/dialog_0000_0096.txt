DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Komarov. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, uh, hi Doctor Batara. It’s… well, it’s my eyes, really. They’ve been bothering me a lot lately with the sun. Anything bright, even indoors sometimes. It feels like they’re really sensitive, you know? Like I need sunglasses all the time, even on cloudy days.
DOCTOR: Sensitive to light… hmm. And how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It started maybe… six months ago? It was gradual, at first. Just a little discomfort. But the last month or so it's gotten much worse. I used to be able to handle the sun just fine. Now, even looking at my phone screen sometimes feels too bright. It's a bit worrying, to be honest.
DOCTOR: “A bit worrying,” you say. Well, of course it is. Six months is… significant. And you say it’s affecting your phone screen usage as well. Do you have any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… not really, no. Just the light sensitivity. No blurry vision, no pain, no… floaters or anything like that. It doesn't feel painful, exactly. More like… uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable. Like I need to squint all the time. And it makes me tired, actually. Squinting all the time is exhausting, you know? Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, yes, I understand. Squinting can be tiring. Though, frankly, most people exaggerate. Now, have you had any changes in your vision otherwise?
PATIENT: No, nothing else with my vision. Everything looks clear, it’s just… bright. Like the sun’s always too strong. And it’s not just the sun, like I said, sometimes the lights indoors bother me too. Fluorescent lights are the worst. I haven’t noticed anything different about seeing things, just the brightness. It's hard to explain. I feel like I'm being a bit silly, honestly. Is it even something a doctor needs to look at?
DOCTOR: “Silly?
PATIENT: No, not silly, exactly! Just… I don't know. Maybe it’s just getting older? I mean, things change, right? But it's really affecting things. I used to enjoy gardening, but now I can barely spend five minutes outside without feeling awful. It’s just… frustrating. I didn’t want to bother you with something so small, I guess. But it’s getting worse, and I thought… well, it’s best to check, isn’t it? I just worry about wasting your time.
DOCTOR: Wasting my time is a constant occupational hazard, Mr. Komarov. Gardening, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, gardening. I love it. Used to spend hours out there. Tomatoes, peppers, all sorts of things. But now, even with a hat and sunglasses, it's just too much. My eyes feel really gritty afterwards, too. Not like something in them, just… tired and uncomfortable. And a little bit blurry for a while. I have to come inside and rest for ages. It’s a shame, really. It’s a good way to relax. It’s just… not very relaxing when my eyes hurt.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a look, shall we?
PATIENT: Yes, please. That sounds good. I’m happy to do whatever you need. I brought my glasses, just in case. I wear them for reading mostly, but… well, they don't seem to be helping with the brightness.
DOCTOR: Right. If you'll just sit here and look straight ahead. I'm going to check your pupils and do a quick visual field test. It's quite simple. Just tell me when you see my finger.
PATIENT: Okay, sounds good. No problem. I’m ready when you are. Just let me know if there’s anything I need to do. I sometimes get a bit nervous at the doctor’s, if you don’t mind. Just being honest. It’s silly, I know.
DOCTOR: Focus on that point on the wall. Now, tell me when you see my finger. Don't blink, if you can help it. Can you see it now?
PATIENT: Yes, I can see it… but it’s… really bright. It's hard to focus, actually. Like there's a glare. I’m trying not to blink, but it makes my eye water a little. Is that normal? It's not a painful watering, just… irritating. Can you maybe dim the light a little? It’s making it hard to see anything, even with my eyes open.
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. Now, look to your right. Still seeing my finger?
PATIENT: Yes, I can see it. But… it’s a little fuzzy around the edges. Like there’s a shadow. It’s hard to explain. Not blurry, exactly, just… not as sharp as it should be. Is that… concerning? I don't want to worry you, I'm just trying to be accurate. It's easier to see it when I look directly at it, but when I try to look around, it fades a bit. Is that normal? It's probably nothing, I bet. But I thought I should mention it.
DOCTOR: Fuzzy around the edges… and fades when you look around. Hmm. Alright. Let's check your right eye now. Same thing. Focus on that point on the wall and tell me when you see my finger.
PATIENT: Okay. Here we go… Yes, I can see it. But it's… worse on this side. Much fuzzier. And the shadow is bigger. It's really hard to keep it in focus, even with the light dimmed. It feels… strained, actually. Like I'm forcing my eye to see. Is everything alright, Doctor Batara? You're quiet. It’s okay if you need a moment. I just hope it's not anything serious.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Komarov. I’ve seen enough. It appears you have a significant visual field defect, particularly in your right eye. Now, I need to ask you some questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with glaucoma, cataracts, or any other eye condition?
PATIENT: No, never. I've never had any problems with my eyes before, not really. Just… normal aging, I guess. I get a bit of dry eye sometimes, but nothing a few drops couldn't fix. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything, though. I've had regular checkups with my family doctor, but they never mentioned anything about my eyes. I’m a bit surprised, to be honest. Is it something serious, Doctor Batara? You’re worrying me a little. Is it… is it something I should have known about before?
DOCTOR: "Should have known about" is a rather accusatory question, Mr. Komarov. It's not always easy to detect these things. Now, do you have a family history of glaucoma or any other eye diseases?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. My mother had high blood pressure, and my father had diabetes, but nothing with their eyes. They both passed away a few years ago, so I don't have a lot of information. I never really asked them about their medical history, to be honest. I wasn't very good at those kinds of conversations. It’s all a bit hazy now. Is it possible it could be something else? Something that’s not genetic? I just… I’m a bit scared, Doctor Batara. You’re saying things I don’t understand. Could it be a vitamin deficiency? Or… something temporary?
DOCTOR: Vitamin deficiencies are rarely the cause of significant visual field defects, Mr. Komarov. Given your symptoms and the findings of the exam, I suspect you may have early-stage glaucoma. We need to confirm this with further testing. I'm going to order a visual field test, tonometry to measure the pressure inside your eyes, and optical coherence tomography, which will allow us to examine the optic nerve.
PATIENT: Okay… glaucoma. That sounds… serious. What does that mean, exactly? Is it… is it going to make me go blind? I've heard terrible things about glaucoma. I'm sorry, I'm probably being silly. I just… I rely on my vision. I like to read, I like to garden… I don’t want to lose that. What kind of testing are we talking about? Will it hurt? How long will it take? And… is there anything I can do about it? Is there a cure? I know I’m asking a lot of questions, but I’m a little overwhelmed.
DOCTOR: "Terrible things," you say. The internet is a dangerous place, Mr. Komarov. Glaucoma is a condition where the optic nerve, which connects your eye to your brain, becomes damaged. It’s often, though not always, associated with increased pressure inside the eye. If left untreated, it can lead to vision loss, yes. The testing is not painful, though it can be a bit time-consuming. The visual field test involves looking at a series of lights and indicating when you see them. The tonometry test involves a brief puff of air on your eye. The optical coherence tomography uses a laser to scan your optic nerve. As for a cure… there is no cure for glaucoma. However, it can be effectively managed with medication, laser treatment, or surgery to lower the pressure inside your eye and slow down the progression of the disease. We need to get the test results first to determine the best course of action. I'm going to write you a referral to an ophthalmologist for these tests. It’s essential you schedule an appointment as soon as possible. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Okay… so no cure, but it can be managed. That's… something, I guess. Better than nothing. An ophthalmologist… right. I’ll schedule an appointment right away. Do you have a recommendation? Is there anyone nearby you would suggest? And… how quickly do I need to get this done? Should I be worried about driving? I drive a lot for work. And… is it possible it's not glaucoma? Could it be something else entirely? I know I’m repeating myself, but I'm just trying to understand everything. And… Will Medicare cover these tests? I'm on Medicare. I just want to be prepared. And… I'm sorry to bother you with so many questions. I appreciate your patience. Really.
DOCTOR: Here. This is a list of ophthalmologists in the area who accept Medicare. I recommend Dr. Evelyn Reed. She is… thorough. As for how quickly you need to get this done… sooner rather than later. Glaucoma progresses slowly, but it’s best to catch it early. Regarding driving… I’m not going to advise you against driving at this moment. However, be aware of your vision and avoid driving at night or in low-light conditions until we have more information. And yes, Medicare should cover these tests, though you may be responsible for a copay or deductible. The ophthalmologist’s office will be able to provide you with more information. Now, do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: No… I think that's everything for now. Thank you, Doctor Batara. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll schedule an appointment with Dr. Reed right away. And I’ll be careful driving. I really appreciate you taking the time to explain everything. It's… it's a lot to take in, but I feel a little better knowing what’s going on. Hopefully, it’s not too serious. Thank you again. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: Very well. Don’t delay. And try to manage your expectations, Mr. Komarov. And please, try not to self-diagnose based on internet searches. It only creates unnecessary anxiety. .
