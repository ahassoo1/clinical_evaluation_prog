DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Rannells. My name is Dr. Alanes. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. It’s… adequate to meet you. I understand you’re the one who can… authorize this medical marijuana, is that correct? My daughter, bless her heart, she says it’s the only thing that will help with… well, the discomfort. I’ve never been one for… all that, but I’m willing to consider it, if it's properly done, you understand.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Rannells, that is correct. I am authorized to discuss medical marijuana as a potential treatment option, where appropriate. I understand you’re considering it for discomfort. To help me determine if it might be a suitable option for you, could you tell me a bit more about this discomfort?
PATIENT: Well, it's… it's in my joints, mostly. My knees, my hips… getting old, I suppose. It’s not a sudden thing, it’s been building for years, really. Makes getting around a bit… challenging. And honestly, the pain keeps me up at night. I’ve tried… creams, you know. And my general practitioner gave me something, but it didn’t do much good, and frankly, I didn’t like the way it made me feel. A bit… foggy. Is this something you deal with often? Old people and their… complaints?
DOCTOR: It’s very common, Ms. Rannells. Joint pain is a frequent concern, and it’s absolutely not a complaint – it’s a legitimate health issue. Many things can cause it, and we want to understand what's going on with you specifically. You mentioned it’s been building for years and affects your knees and hips. On a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate your pain right now?
PATIENT: Oh, a scale. Always with the scales. Well, right now… it’s not terrible. I’ve had a cup of tea, and I’m sitting down. I’d say… a four, perhaps? But on a bad day, when it’s damp, or I’ve been on my feet too long… it can easily climb to an eight, even a nine. It’s a throbbing, you see? Not a sharp pain, but a… persistent ache. It makes walking… unpleasant. And I do enjoy my walks.
DOCTOR: Okay, a four right now, climbing to eight or nine on bad days, described as a throbbing, persistent ache. That gives me a better understanding. Now, have you noticed any stiffness in your joints, especially in the morning?
PATIENT: Stiffness? Well, yes, naturally. I don't bounce out of bed like a young gazelle, Doctor. It takes a bit to… loosen up, you see? My knees, especially. I have to… carefully maneuver myself out of bed. And it doesn't go away immediately. It’s a process. I suppose that’s what you mean by stiffness? It’s… expected, at my age.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s exactly what I meant. And how long does that stiffness typically last in the morning?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It depends, doesn’t it? Some mornings it’s barely noticeable, maybe fifteen minutes. Other mornings… it can be a good hour before I feel… functional. I have to do a bit of stretching, very gently, you understand. I don’t want to exacerbate anything. My daughter is always telling me to be careful. She’s a very sensible girl. But it’s… inconvenient, to say the least. Starting the day feeling like a rusty gate. It doesn’t set a good tone, does it?
DOCTOR: No, it certainly doesn’t. And you mentioned your daughter is concerned. Has anyone else in your family experienced similar joint pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My mother, God rest her soul, she had arthritis in her hands, terribly crippling towards the end. And my brother, he’s got something in his back, always complaining about it. But that's… different, isn't it? Back pain is back pain. This is… in the joints. My husband… no, he’s always been remarkably healthy, touch wood. He’s a bit skeptical about all this marijuana business, I must say. Thinks it’s… a fad. But he’s willing to let me explore it, as long as it's done properly, with a… reputable doctor like yourself.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. Family history can sometimes give us clues. You mentioned your mother had arthritis. Do you know what kind of arthritis she had, if any specific type was diagnosed?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That's… a detail I don’t recall. I was quite young when she was diagnosed, and frankly, I wasn't terribly interested in medical matters. She just… had terrible pain in her hands, and the doctor gave her pills, and she tried all sorts of creams. I believe she had… the rheumatoid kind? Or was it the osteoarthritis? Something… with the joints. It was a long time ago, Doctor. I’m afraid my memory isn’t what it used to be. I’m much better at remembering recipes, if you're interested. I make a lovely arroz con gandules. But medical details… not so much.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Rannells. We can proceed without that specific detail. Now, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you may have?
PATIENT: Well… I have high blood pressure. The doctor puts me on medication for that. And… I had a hysterectomy many years ago. That’s… about it, really. Nothing too serious. Just the usual aches and pains that come with age. And I’m a bit… sensitive to the cold. Always have been. I have to bundle up, even in the summer. My husband teases me about it, says I’m like a little penguin. But I prefer to be comfortable, you understand. I don't like to be chilled.
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a history of a hysterectomy. And sensitivity to cold. Are there any medications you're currently taking for your blood pressure that you can recall the names of?
PATIENT: Oh dear, the names… They give me so many pills, it’s hard to keep track. Let me see… I believe it’s… Lisinopril? Or is that for something else? No, wait… Hydrochlorothiazide? Yes, I think that’s one of them. And… Amlodipine? I write the names down when the doctor tells me, but then I misplace the paper. My daughter keeps telling me to use a pill organizer, but I prefer to take them as needed. It’s more… flexible, you understand. I don’t like to be rigidly scheduled.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's helpful. And do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I can eat anything, and I’ve never had any trouble with pills. My daughter always worries about it, asks me about shellfish and nuts, but I've never had an issue. I used to eat everything in the Dominican Republic, everything fresh from the market, and I was perfectly fine. So, no, no allergies that I know of. I'm a very… resilient person, you understand. I don't get sick easily.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Now, before we discuss potential treatment options, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Well… I suppose so. As long as it's not too… intrusive. I'm not a fan of being poked and prodded, you understand. But if it's necessary, I trust your judgment, Doctor. I just hope it doesn't take too long. I have a bridge game this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Rannells. It will be a fairly standard exam, focusing on your joints. We'll check your range of motion, look for any swelling or tenderness, and listen to your heart and lungs briefly to get a general picture of your health. It shouldn’t be too long at all. If you’d like, you can lie down on the table, and we’ll start with your knees.
PATIENT: Very well. It's not the most comfortable thought, but if it's necessary… I suppose I can manage. Just be gentle, Doctor, please. My knees are rather sensitive, you know. And do let me know if I need to adjust anything. I’m not as nimble as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Rannells. We'll take things slowly and at your pace. Now, can you bend your right knee for me, as far as is comfortable?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's… a little stiff. It doesn't go as far as it used to, you know. That’s about as much as I can do without… considerable discomfort. It feels… tight. And there's a bit of a… grating sensation. It’s not sharp pain, but it’s… unpleasant. Is that normal, Doctor? Is that what you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: It’s not uncommon to experience some crepitus – that grating sensation – with age and joint wear, Ms. Rannells. And the limited range of motion is consistent with what you’ve described. There's a slight tenderness along the medial joint line. Now, let’s take a look at your left knee. Can you bend that one for me, as comfortably as you can?
PATIENT: This one is… marginally better. Still stiff, of course, but not quite as… problematic as the other one. It doesn't go all the way, naturally. It feels… tighter than it should, but the discomfort isn’t as acute. It’s a subtle difference, perhaps, but I can feel it. And… there’s a bit of swelling, I think. Have you noticed any swelling, Doctor? I sometimes dismiss it as… my imagination.
DOCTOR: Yes, I do notice some mild swelling on your left knee, Ms. Rannells. It’s subtle, as you said, but it’s there. And some crepitus, similar to your right knee. Now, let’s take a look at your hips. Can you lie on your back for me?
PATIENT: There we go. Though I must warn you, my hips aren't as cooperative as they once were. It takes a bit of effort to… maneuver them, you understand. I haven't done yoga, if that’s what you were thinking. I prefer a nice, gentle walk, myself.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Rannells. I'm noting some limitation in your hip range of motion, particularly with internal rotation, and some mild discomfort with hip flexion. It’s not severe, but it’s there. Now, I’m just going to listen to your heart and lungs briefly to get a general assessment. Your heart sounds regular, and your lungs are clear. Alright, Ms. Rannells, that completes the physical exam. Thank you for your patience. Now, let’s discuss your medical history in more detail.
PATIENT: Thank goodness. It's not my favourite activity, being poked and prodded, you understand. Though I appreciate you being gentle, Doctor. Now, as for my medical history… I've already mentioned the high blood pressure, and the hysterectomy. I suppose I should also tell you about my… anxiety. It's not terribly severe, but I do worry. About everything, really. My daughter says it's my age, but I think it's just… the state of the world. Is that something we should discuss, Doctor? Perhaps the marijuana could help with that as well?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Rannells, that’s certainly something we should discuss. Anxiety is very common, and it’s good that you’re bringing it up. It’s absolutely something medical marijuana could potentially help with, depending on the specific type and dosage. You mentioned it’s not severe, but it impacts you. Can you describe what your anxiety feels like?
PATIENT: Well, it’s not… panic attacks or anything dramatic, you understand. It’s more of a… constant unease. A feeling of… dread, really. I worry about my family, about my health, about… everything, as I said. I have trouble sleeping sometimes, tossing and turning, replaying scenarios in my head. And I find myself… jumpy, easily startled by noises. It’s… exhausting, really. It drains my energy, and makes it difficult to enjoy things. I used to love gardening, but now I find myself… preoccupied with worries. It’s a subtle thing, but it's… persistent. Does that make sense, Doctor? It’s hard to explain. It’s just… a constant weight on my chest.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Rannells, that makes perfect sense. It sounds like you’re experiencing a generalized anxiety with some sleep disturbance, and it’s impacting your quality of life. Given your history of joint pain and anxiety, and your reluctance to take medications with significant side effects, medical marijuana is a reasonable option to consider. Now, have you ever tried any other treatments for your anxiety, such as therapy or other medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I haven’t. I’m not one for… talking about my feelings, you understand. I prefer to keep things to myself. And as for medications… I tried a sleeping pill once, many years ago, but it made me feel so… groggy the next day. I couldn't function. And I don’t like the idea of becoming dependent on something. My daughter suggested therapy, but… well, I just don’t think it’s for me. I’m a private person. I prefer to deal with things on my own, as best I can. That’s why I’m considering this marijuana, really. I’ve heard it can help without… all the side effects. Is it… safe, Doctor? That’s my biggest concern. I don’t want to trade one problem for another.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Rannells. It’s admirable that you’re proactive about finding solutions that align with your preferences. Medical marijuana does have potential side effects, but they are generally milder than those associated with traditional medications. Common side effects include dry mouth, drowsiness, and dizziness. It can also interact with certain medications, which is why it’s important we have a complete list of everything you’re taking. Given your medical history and concerns, I believe a low-dose, CBD-dominant formulation might be a good starting point. CBD, or cannabidiol, is a non-psychoactive component of marijuana, meaning it won’t produce a “high”. It has anti-inflammatory and anxiety-reducing properties. We can gradually increase the dosage if needed, and monitor your response closely. Does that sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: CBD-dominant, you say? Non-psychoactive? That sounds… much more appealing than something that will make me… giddy. And you’ll monitor my response closely? That’s reassuring. I don’t want to be left to figure this out on my own. And it won’t interact with my blood pressure medication, will it? That’s my biggest worry. I read something online about… complications. And what form does this CBD come in, Doctor? Pills? Oils? I’m not sure I’d be comfortable… smoking anything.
DOCTOR: You are right to ask about interactions with your blood pressure medication. There is a potential for CBD to lower blood pressure, which could be problematic if your medication is already effectively controlling it. We will need to monitor your blood pressure closely if we proceed. Thankfully, CBD comes in a variety of forms, and smoking is not required. It’s available as oils, tinctures , capsules, edibles , and topical creams. Given your preference to avoid smoking and potential for interaction with your blood pressure medication, I recommend starting with a CBD oil or tincture. You can easily control the dosage, and it’s absorbed quickly. We would start with a very low dose – perhaps 5mg twice a day – and gradually increase it as needed, monitoring your blood pressure and symptoms closely. We can schedule a follow-up appointment in two weeks to assess your response and make any necessary adjustments. Does that sound acceptable to you, Ms. Rannells?
PATIENT: Five milligrams twice a day… that doesn't sound too daunting. And a follow-up appointment in two weeks… that's reassuring. I appreciate you being so thorough, Doctor. It’s… comforting to know you're taking my concerns seriously. Yes, that sounds acceptable. Though… what if it doesn't work? What if I still feel anxious, and my joints still ache? Is there anything else we can try? I don't want to get my hopes up, only to be disappointed. And… how much will this cost? I’m on a fixed income, you understand. I need to be mindful of expenses.
DOCTOR: Those are excellent questions, Ms. Rannells. It's important to have realistic expectations. CBD doesn't work for everyone, and it may take some trial and error to find the right dosage and formulation. If CBD doesn't provide sufficient relief, there are other options we can explore. We could consider adding a small amount of THC – tetrahydrocannabinol – the psychoactive component of marijuana, to the CBD formulation. THC has stronger pain-relieving and anxiety-reducing properties, but it can also produce a “high”. We would start with a very low dose and monitor your response closely. Other options include referral to a physical therapist for joint pain, or a consultation with a therapist to address your anxiety. Regarding cost, the price of CBD oil varies depending on the brand and potency. A typical 30ml bottle of CBD oil costs around $50-$100, which should last you about a month. We have information on local dispensaries with varying price points. The medical assistant can provide you with a list, and we can discuss payment options if needed. I want to assure you that we will work together to find a solution that is right for you, Ms. Rannells. We will start with the lowest possible dose of CBD, monitor your response closely, and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: That sounds… reasonable, Doctor. Very reasonable indeed. I appreciate your patience, and your willingness to work with me. It’s… comforting to know I’m not alone in this. Yes, let’s proceed with the CBD oil, then. Five milligrams twice a day, and a follow-up appointment in two weeks. And I’ll take the list of dispensaries from the medical assistant. I suppose… that’s all for now, then? I’m feeling… a little overwhelmed, to be honest. But also… hopeful. Thank you, Doctor Alanes. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Rannells. It was my pleasure meeting you, and I’m glad I could help alleviate some of your concerns. Yes, I believe that covers everything for now. The medical assistant will provide you with the list of dispensaries and a prescription for the CBD oil. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll see you in two weeks. In the meantime, take care, and I wish you all the best.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will.
