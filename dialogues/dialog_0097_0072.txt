DOCTOR: Hi Ebony, welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Georgiou. It’s lovely to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Hi Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um… well, it’s my memory, really. It’s just… not what it used to be. I’ve been forgetting things lately, and it’s starting to worry me.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Memory concerns can definitely be unsettling. It’s good you’re addressing it now. To get a better idea of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about these forgetful moments?
PATIENT: Sure. It’s… hard to explain. It's not like big things, you know? More like… where I put my keys, or what I had for breakfast. Little things. But it’s happening more and more often. And sometimes… sometimes I have trouble remembering names, even people I see regularly. It’s frustrating.
DOCTOR: I see. So, mostly everyday things – keys, meals, names – and it’s increasing in frequency. That is concerning, and perfectly valid to bring to a doctor. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been more gradual?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I think… gradual, mostly. It’s not like it happened overnight. But maybe over the last… six months or so, it’s gotten noticeably worse. It's hard to pinpoint exactly when it started, to be honest. I just kept thinking I was stressed or tired, but it hasn’t gotten better with more rest.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual onset over the last six months, and not improving with rest. That’s helpful to know. And is this memory loss impacting your daily life at all?
PATIENT: Yes, a little. I work as a dentist, and I haven’t had any big problems yet, thankfully. But I’ve definitely had to double-check appointments a couple of times, and I’m worried I might forget something important with a patient. It’s making me anxious at work, which doesn’t help, I’m sure. And outside of work… I’m just more cautious about things, always making lists and stuff. It's… a bit exhausting.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like it’s creating some stress and anxiety, both at work and in your personal life, which is completely understandable. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or thyroid problems?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty healthy, to be honest. I see my regular doctor for check-ups every year or so, and everything's always been normal. No major illnesses, no surgeries. I do get a little stressed sometimes, but that's about it. I haven't really taken any medications regularly, just pain relievers for headaches occasionally.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know – no significant medical history or regular medications. And what about your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she had some memory problems when she got older, but she was much, much older than I am now. Probably in her 80s, maybe 90s. It wasn’t diagnosed or anything, just… typical age-related memory loss, I think. My father was healthy as a horse, never had any issues. I don’t really know much about my grandparents’ health, to be honest. They passed away when I was pretty young. Does that help?
DOCTOR: That is helpful, thank you. Family history of memory issues later in life is good to know. Now, let’s talk about some of your daily habits. Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those. Never really been interested. I don’t drink at all, and I definitely don’t smoke or use drugs. I try to eat healthy, mostly, and I try to get some exercise when I can, though it’s hard with work sometimes. I drink a lot of coffee, if that counts!
DOCTOR: Coffee doesn’t count as a vice, in my book! Okay, so healthy lifestyle, no significant substance use. Excellent. And are you currently experiencing any other symptoms – headaches, dizziness, vision changes, mood swings, or anything else at all?
PATIENT: Not really. I get the occasional headache, but nothing major. I wear glasses, so my vision isn't perfect, but it’s been stable for years. I wouldn’t say I'm moody, exactly… but I have been a little more anxious lately, probably because of the memory issues. Sometimes I feel a bit tired, but again, I think that’s just stress. Honestly, the biggest thing is just the forgetfulness. It's... unsettling. It feels like something's not quite right.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like the forgetfulness is the primary concern, and the anxiety and fatigue might be related to that. Okay, well, let's do a quick physical exam, just to rule out anything obvious. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. Then I'd like to do a brief cognitive assessment – some simple memory and thinking tests. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to figure out what's going on. Blood pressure and everything is fine with me. And I'm happy to do those tests, too. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Blood pressure is 130 over 80, pulse is 72 and regular. Heart and lungs sound clear. Now, I’m going to ask you a few questions, and we’ll do a couple of simple tests. This is just to get a baseline and see how things are functioning. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… um… it’s August… the 2nd, 2025. Yes, August 2nd, 2025. I think.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s correct. Good. Now, can you repeat these three words for me, and I’ll ask you to remember them later?
PATIENT: Okay. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: The three words are: apple, table, penny. Can you repeat them back to me?
PATIENT: Apple, table, penny. Got it. I think I can remember those. Hopefully!
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Now, I’m going to ask you to spell the word “world” backwards. Take your time.
PATIENT: Um… okay. Let me think… d… l… r… o… w… Yes. D-l-r-o-w. That's right, isn't it?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct! Now, can you tell me the names of the current president and vice president?
PATIENT: Oh… um… that’s… tricky. I usually follow the news, but… I'm blanking. Let me think... The President... is it… Biden? Yes, Joe Biden. And the Vice President… Harris. Kamala Harris. Is that right?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is correct! Both of them. Okay, now, I’m going to show you a picture of four common objects – a hammer, a key, a comb, and a pen – and I’m going to ask you to name them.
PATIENT: Okay… um… that’s a hammer… a key… a comb… and a pen. Easy enough.
DOCTOR: Okay. Now, can you draw a clock face, and put the hands in to show 10 past 11?
PATIENT: Here. It’s not very artistic, but I think it shows ten past eleven.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. That was helpful. Now, let’s go back to those three words I asked you to remember earlier: apple, table, penny. Can you recall them for me now?
PATIENT: Um… apple… and… penny. I think… table? Yes, apple, table, and penny. I think that’s right. It felt like they were right on the tip of my tongue.
DOCTOR: Okay, you remembered two out of three, which is reasonable. Based on this quick assessment, and your reported symptoms, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It's good you're noticing these changes, and it’s important we investigate them further. Your recall is slightly below what we'd expect for someone your age, and the difficulty with the clock drawing suggests some possible cognitive impairment, but this isn't definitive. I want to order some blood work to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be affecting your memory, such as vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, or kidney or liver issues. I also want to recommend a referral to a neurologist for a more comprehensive cognitive evaluation, including some more detailed neuropsychological testing. Would that be okay with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Blood work and seeing a specialist. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. I just want to find out what's going on and… hopefully fix it. A neurologist sounds good. It's a little scary, but better to know, right?
DOCTOR: You are absolutely right – better to know. It is a little scary, but we're taking the right steps. The neurologist will be able to give you a more accurate assessment and recommend a treatment plan if necessary. I’ll get the lab order sent to the lab near the clinic, and I’ll write a referral for a neurologist. I recommend Dr. Anya Sharma – she’s excellent and has a good reputation. I’ll have the receptionist schedule the appointment for you, or you can call her office directly if you prefer. In the meantime, I want you to continue to monitor your symptoms and let me know if anything changes or worsens. Also, try to maintain a healthy lifestyle – eat a balanced diet, get regular exercise, and get enough sleep. And don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No… I think you’ve covered everything, actually. Dr. Sharma sounds good. I'll let the receptionist schedule the appointment then. It's a relief to have a plan, to be honest. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ebony. I’m glad I could help. Remember, we're taking this one step at a time. The receptionist will be in touch about the appointment. If you think of anything else, don't hesitate to call. Have a good day, and take care. .
