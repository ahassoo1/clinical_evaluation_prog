DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Voner. I’m Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Um… my joints. They’re just… stiff, you know? Especially in the mornings. It’s been going on for… well, a while now, I guess. I can’t really say how long. It feels like forever.
DOCTOR: “A while now.” Right. That’s…not particularly helpful for a medical assessment, Ms. Voner. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. I’m so sorry. My memory… it’s not what it used to be. Let me think… Maybe… six months? Or was it a year? Honestly, it all blurs together. It started after… after my husband passed, I think. But maybe before? Ugh. It's hard to say. It’s just… harder to get moving when I wake up.
DOCTOR: Approximately six months. And you associate the onset with your husband's passing. Alright. Now, is the stiffness localized to certain joints, or is it all over?
PATIENT: Hmm… that's a good question. I think… mostly my hands and knees. My back too, sometimes. But it's not always my back. It kind of moves around, you know? Like, some days it’s really bad in my hands, and other days my knees are worse. It's not… consistent. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: “Not consistent.” That’s… concerning. And when you say “bad,” can you describe that for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well… it just hurts to move them. Like, really achy. And sometimes… sometimes they feel a little… swollen? Not huge, but… puffy, maybe. It's hard to explain. It's not like a sharp pain, more like a… a deep ache. And it takes a long time to get them working in the morning. I have to really push myself. It’s just… uncomfortable. Do you understand?
DOCTOR: Achy, puffy, difficulty with morning movement. Have you noticed any redness or warmth in those joints?
PATIENT: Redness… warmth… hmm. I don’t think so. I haven't really looked, to be honest. I just feel the ache. Maybe a little warm sometimes, but I just figured that was from… trying to get moving? I don’t know. I’m not very good at noticing things like that. I mostly just try to ignore it until it gets better, or worse.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let’s go through some other things. Do you have any other medical problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear… Let me think. Um… I had my gallbladder out, years and years ago. And I have… high blood pressure, I think the doctor told me once. But I don't really take anything for it. It hasn't been bothering me. And… that's about it, I think. Nothing else comes to mind. I haven't been to a doctor in… a long time. Honestly, I mostly just deal with things on my own. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal, hypertension, untreated. And you said “mostly.” Are there any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Oh… well… I get tired a lot. More tired than I used to. And sometimes my hands… they feel a little numb, you know? Like when I’m holding something for a long time. It goes away, but… it's there sometimes. And I’ve been… a little forgetful lately, but I figured that was just getting older. I don't know if that counts. Is that what you mean by 'symptoms'?
DOCTOR: Fatigue, intermittent numbness in the hands, and… increased forgetfulness. Alright. Now, are you currently taking any medications, even over-the-counter things like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Oh, no. Not really. Just… sometimes I take a little ibuprofen for my hands when they really hurt. But not every day, just when I need it. And… I used to take a vitamin D supplement, but I ran out a while ago and haven't gotten around to buying more. That's about it. I don't like taking a lot of pills, if I can help it. It makes me feel… funny sometimes.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen as needed, previous vitamin D use. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… allergies… Let me see. No, I don't think so. Not that I know of. I’ve eaten pretty much everything over the years. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything. At least, nothing I can remember. I used to get stung by bees when I was a little girl, but I haven’t been stung in ages. Does that count? I don't think I'm allergic, just… it hurt. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: No known drug allergies. Alright. Now, let's talk about your family. Is there anyone in your family with arthritis, or any other joint problems?
PATIENT: Oh, my family… That's a good question. My mother… she had some trouble with her hands when she got older. Sort of stiff, like me. But I don't think she ever went to the doctor about it. She just… rubbed them a lot. And my grandfather… he had something with his back, I think. But I don't really remember the details. It was a long time ago. He was a farmer, so I figured it was just from hard work. Do you need me to be more specific? I’m not very good at remembering these things.
DOCTOR: Family history of possible arthritis and back pain. Alright. Now, briefly, what do you do with your days?
PATIENT: Oh, well, I mostly just take care of things. I used to work at the daycare, you know? But I retired a few years ago. Now I just… keep busy. I do a little gardening, mostly herbs. And I try to help my neighbors when they need it. And I watch a lot of TV, if I'm being honest. Nothing too exciting, really. Just… quiet things. I like quiet things. Does that answer your question? I don’t really do a lot.
DOCTOR: Quiet activities, retired. Alright, Ms. Voner. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better sense of what’s going on. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I trust you. Just… please be gentle? My joints… they’re a little sensitive, you know? I’m not very good with… poking and prodding. But do what you need to do. I want to figure out what's going on.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your hands. I'm going to feel around, and you just let me know if anything feels particularly painful. I'm assessing for tenderness and swelling. There’s some slight tenderness on the base of your right thumb, and a little on the knuckles of your left hand. Now, let's take a look at your knees. Bend them for me, if you can. There’s some crepitus with flexion and extension of both knees, and a mild effusion on the right knee. And finally, your lower back. There’s some muscle spasm, but no acute tenderness. Alright. I’ve completed the exam. It appears you have some tenderness and swelling in multiple joints, and decreased range of motion in your knees. It's likely some degree of osteoarthritis, although further testing is needed to confirm.
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Osteo…what-itis? That sounds… serious. Is it bad? Will I need… surgery? I've heard terrible things about surgery. And what's effusion? Is that… a lot of swelling? I just want to be able to get moving again. It's just… harder and harder every day. What kind of testing do I need? And will it cost a lot of money? I don't really have a lot to spare, you know.
DOCTOR: “Osteoarthritis” means the cartilage in your joints is wearing down. It’s a common condition, especially as we age. Effusion simply means fluid buildup in the joint, causing swelling. And no, surgery is rarely the first step. We'll start with some imaging – X-rays of your hands and knees, to get a better look at the joints. As for the cost… The X-rays will be approximately $150, without insurance. I can also order some blood tests – a complete blood count and a rheumatoid factor – just to rule out other causes of joint pain. Those will be about $100. It’s important to be thorough. We need to confirm the diagnosis before we start any treatment. While we wait for the results, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen as needed, and gentle exercises to keep your joints moving. But don’t push yourself too hard. We'll discuss other treatment options once we have the results of the tests. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, my. $250… That’s… a lot. I don’t know if I can afford that right now. Is there… is there any way to get help with the cost? I don't have any insurance, you see. And I’m on a fixed income. As for the blood tests… are they really necessary? I just want to be able to move again. Maybe the pain relievers will be enough. And gentle exercises… I’ll try, but it hurts, you know? I’m just… worried about the money. And I don’t understand all the medical terms. What does “rheumatoid factor” mean? Is that something terrible? I feel so confused.
DOCTOR: “Rheumatoid factor” is a blood test that helps rule out rheumatoid arthritis, a different type of joint condition. It's important to differentiate between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, as the treatments are different. As for the cost, I can write a referral to a facility that offers discounted imaging services for low-income patients. It may take a little longer to get an appointment, but it could significantly reduce the expense. I understand your concerns about the cost, Ms. Voner. However, it’s important to get an accurate diagnosis before we start any treatment. Taking pain relievers alone may only mask the symptoms, and it won’t address the underlying problem. I can also provide you with some resources for financial assistance programs. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Oh, that would be wonderful! Yes, please, anything you can do to help with the cost would be greatly appreciated. And resources for financial assistance… that sounds very helpful. I really don't want to get further behind on my bills. Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. And… about the rheumatoid… whatever it is… is it worse than the osteo-thing? Is that why you need to test for it? It just… all sounds very scary. And I’m a little worried about getting an appointment somewhere else. It takes me a while to get around, you know. And I get nervous going to new places.
DOCTOR: Rheumatoid arthritis is a more aggressive condition than osteoarthritis, and it requires different treatment. It’s important to rule it out. Here’s the referral to the community imaging center. They offer a sliding scale fee, based on income. And here’s a list of resources that may help cover the cost of the imaging and blood tests. As for getting to a new place… The imaging center is on the number 7 bus route. And if you’re concerned about getting there, I can have a social worker contact you to help with transportation arrangements. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Oh, the bus… that's… manageable, I suppose. I can handle the bus. And… a social worker? To help with transportation? That would be… very kind, actually. Yes, please. If it’s not too much trouble. I really appreciate all your help, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I just… I feel so overwhelmed sometimes. It’s hard getting older, you know? Everything aches and everything costs so much. And… I forget things so easily. I’m afraid I’ll miss the appointment or forget to take the tests. Is there… anything else I need to know? Before I leave? Or should I just call the imaging center and schedule an appointment?
DOCTOR: Alright. Just call the imaging center to schedule the appointment. The number is on the referral form. And I've put in a referral for a social worker to contact you regarding transportation. They’ll be in touch within a few business days. In the meantime, continue with the over-the-counter pain relievers as needed. And try to be mindful of your movements. Avoid activities that aggravate your pain. I’ll follow up with you once I receive the results of the tests. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No… I don’t think so. I think that’s everything. Thank you again, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate your time. I'll try to schedule the appointment as soon as I can. And I’ll wait for the social worker to call. Have a good day, Doctor. And… thank you again.
DOCTOR: Alright. Have a good day.
