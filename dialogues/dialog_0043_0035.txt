DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sucich. My name is Dr. Kalinski. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Kalinski, is it? Lovely name. Well, it’s these hiccups, you see. Been going on for… goodness, feels like a week now. Just won’t stop! It’s quite bothersome, really. Not painful, just… persistent.
DOCTOR: Yes, Kalinski is the name. It's a pleasure to meet you as well, Ms. Sucich. A week of hiccups, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a week, give or take a day. It started right after I had a rather large glass of ginger ale. Now, I love ginger ale, don’t get me wrong, but maybe that had something to do with it? I don’t usually drink a whole glass at once, you see. Usually just a little with my biscuit.
DOCTOR: That’s interesting. Sometimes carbonated beverages can trigger hiccups, though it’s not always the case. And a larger-than-usual amount could certainly play a role. Could you describe the hiccups for me?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, how to describe them… they're just… regular hiccups, I suppose? Not fast, not slow. Just… hic! There. See? Not terribly strong, either. More annoying than anything. They come and go, but they always come back. I've tried holding my breath, like my mother used to tell me, but that doesn’t seem to do a thing these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. Regular, not particularly strong, and persistent despite trying home remedies. That’s helpful. And you’ve tried the breath-holding technique, which is a common first step. Now, aside from the hiccups, have you noticed any other symptoms at all?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, not really. I’ve been eating alright, maybe a little less because it sometimes triggers one when I eat too fast. Sleeping is fine, no trouble there. No heartburn, no stomach pain… just the hiccups. I feel perfectly normal otherwise. I’m still able to do my gardening, which is very important to me.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear that you're able to continue your gardening. And it's reassuring that you haven’t experienced any other concerning symptoms like heartburn or stomach pain. Now, let’s go over a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, medical history… well, let’s see. I had my gallbladder out years ago, must be… forty years now? And I have a bit of arthritis in my hands, but it’s not too bad. I take some over-the-counter medicine for that, glucosamine, I think it is. Otherwise, I’ve been quite lucky, really. Always been a strong woman, I like to think. Divorced, you know, long ago. Nothing serious health-wise ever.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Gallbladder removal forty years ago and some arthritis managed with glucosamine. And it sounds like you’ve generally been in good health. Do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. Never had a reaction to anything. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, travelled a bit, and never had a problem. I used to help my husband with his beekeeping, and I was around the bees constantly! No allergic reactions there, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent. No known allergies is good. And that’s quite a testament to your constitution, being around bees like that! Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the glucosamine?
PATIENT: No, just the glucosamine. And sometimes a little something for my blood pressure, but the doctor said it was just borderline and to only take it when I feel a bit… flushed. It’s a small white pill, I can’t even remember the name of it. Honestly, I try to avoid taking pills as much as possible. Prefer a cup of chamomile tea, myself!
DOCTOR: I understand your preference for chamomile tea. And the medication for borderline blood pressure, only as needed. That’s helpful information. Now, Ms. Sucich, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just listening to your heart and lungs, and feeling your abdomen. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds perfectly fine. I don't mind at all. Always good to be thorough, you know. I always try to keep myself in good shape, even at my age. Go ahead, when you're ready.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sucich, just breathe normally for me. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, I'm just going to gently feel your abdomen. Any tenderness here?
PATIENT: No, no tenderness at all, Doctor. That doesn’t hurt a bit. Just… feels normal, I suppose. A little soft, maybe, but that’s probably just from enjoying my biscuits! I’ve always had a good appetite, you see. Everything feels… quite ordinary, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sucich, everything feels normal as you say. Reflexes are a bit diminished, which is not uncommon at your age, but still within a normal range. Everything seems unremarkable on physical exam. Given the duration of your hiccups – a week now – and the absence of any concerning symptoms or physical exam findings, I’m suspecting this is likely a case of persistent, idiopathic hiccups. "Idiopathic" simply means we don't have a clear cause at this point.
PATIENT: Oh, “idiopathic,” is it? That sounds… complicated. So, you don't know why I have them? Well, that's alright, I suppose. Everything’s got to have a reason, eventually. What does that mean for me, Doctor? Will they just… go away on their own? Or is there something you can do? I don't want to be hiccuping forever!
DOCTOR: You are right to ask, Ms. Sucich. "Idiopathic" just means we haven’t pinpointed a specific cause yet. Often, these hiccups will resolve on their own within a few days to a few weeks. However, since yours have persisted for a week, and it's impacting your comfort, we can try a few things. First, we can try a few simple maneuvers. Drinking a glass of water quickly, holding your breath for a longer period , and sucking on a lemon wedge are often effective. Given your age and general good health, I’m not immediately concerned about anything serious. However, if the hiccups worsen, if you develop any other symptoms like shortness of breath, chest pain, or difficulty swallowing, or if they last longer than a month, it's important to let me know right away. We could also consider a trial of a medication called baclofen, which is sometimes used for persistent hiccups, but given your preference for avoiding medication, I would prefer to try the simpler maneuvers first. What do you think?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds sensible, Doctor. Trying the simpler things first is definitely the way to go. I don’t want to be filling myself with pills if I can help it! Drinking water quickly… I can certainly manage that. Holding my breath… I’ll try, but I don’t know if I’m as good at that as I used to be! And a lemon wedge… well, I do love a bit of lemon. I think I’ll give those a try for a few days and see if it helps. And I promise, if they get any worse, or if I start feeling unwell, I’ll come right back to you. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve put my mind at ease. Is there anything else I should be doing? Anything I should avoid?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sucich. I’m glad I could reassure you. As for things to avoid, try to avoid carbonated beverages for now, as they can sometimes trigger hiccups. Also, eating very large meals quickly can sometimes exacerbate them. Beyond that, there aren't any specific restrictions. Just continue to stay hydrated and get plenty of rest. I’ll write down these recommendations for you, and also a note about the importance of contacting me if things worsen. We’ll follow up in a week to see how you’re doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s very thoughtful of you, Doctor. Writing it down is a wonderful idea – my memory isn’t quite what it used to be, you know! A week sounds perfect. And yes, avoiding the fizzy drinks and big meals – I can certainly manage that. Thank you again for your kindness and patience, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll be sure to let you know how it goes. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I’ll go home and try a glass of water!
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Sucich. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And do try the water – hopefully that will provide some relief. Have a wonderful day, and please take care. .
PATIENT: .
