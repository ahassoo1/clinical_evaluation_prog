DOCTOR: Hi Sasha, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Polczynski. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s my leg, mostly. It’s been… puffy, you know? After the cancer stuff. It's not painful, exactly, just… big. I had treatment a while back, and it just started swelling a few weeks ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, "puffy" and swelling a few weeks ago… after cancer treatment. That’s good information to start with. To help me understand a little better, could you tell me what kind of cancer treatment you had?
PATIENT: Oh dear… um… let me think. It was… radiation, I think? And… pills. Lots of pills. They gave me a schedule, you know? I went every day for a while, then just the pills after that. It was at the big hospital in the city. I don’t remember the name of the pills, sorry.
DOCTOR: No worries at all, Sasha. It's perfectly understandable to forget details like that. Radiation and pills… okay. And this swelling – is it in one leg, or both?
PATIENT: Just the left one, Doctor. My left leg. It’s mostly in my ankle and calf, I think. It’s… annoying, mostly. Makes it hard to get my shoes on sometimes.
DOCTOR: Okay, left leg, ankle and calf mostly, making shoes difficult. Has anything specific made it worse – like standing a lot, or being on your feet?
PATIENT: Hmm… you know, I have been doing a bit more gardening lately. I like to get out in the sun when I can. Maybe that? Or maybe just the heat. It’s been so warm!
DOCTOR: Okay, gardening and the heat… that’s helpful. And just to be thorough, have you noticed any redness or warmth to the leg, besides the swelling?
PATIENT: No, no redness. It just feels… heavy, you know? And puffy. Not warm, though. It feels normal temperature. I checked it a couple times.
DOCTOR: Okay, heavy and puffy, normal temperature. Do you have any pain anywhere else – like in your chest, or shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no chest pain! And I can breathe just fine. It’s really just the leg. I get a little tired, but that’s just… being my age, I suppose!
DOCTOR: Alright, no chest pain or shortness of breath, just the leg and some expected fatigue. Now, let’s take a look at it. Would you mind if I examined your leg?
PATIENT: No, not at all. Go ahead, Doctor. I hope it's nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay. I’m just going to feel around a bit. I do notice some swelling in your left ankle and calf, as you mentioned. And there’s some definite pitting edema when I press on it. Your pulses feel good, strong and regular. Skin color looks normal, and the temperature doesn’t seem different than the other leg. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs just to be sure, and then we can talk about what might be going on.
PATIENT: Okay. That sounds… good. Pitting edema? What does that mean exactly? Is that bad? I always forget the words the doctors use.
DOCTOR: It means when I press on your skin, it leaves a little dent for a bit. That dent is the "pitting." It’s often a sign of fluid buildup. It's not necessarily bad, but it can be a sign of a few different things, especially after cancer treatment. Given your history, and the swelling being in one leg, it could be related to how the fluids are moving in your body now. Your heart and lungs sound clear, which is good. We need to figure out what’s causing this fluid buildup, though. Have you noticed any changes in your weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, I see. A dent… yes, I think I noticed that. Okay. Weight… hmm. Not a lot, but maybe a few pounds? I’ve been enjoying my meals a bit more lately, if I’m honest. It's hard to resist a good pastry!
DOCTOR: I understand completely! It’s good to enjoy life. A few pounds could contribute, but given your cancer history, we should rule out a few other possibilities. I'm going to order a blood test to check your kidney function and look for any signs of blood clots. It's just a precaution, Sasha. We'll also get a basic metabolic panel to see how your electrolytes are doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, blood tests… alright. That sounds… sensible. Blood clots? That sounds scary. But if it's just to check, then yes, that’s fine. I trust you, Doctor. I just want to get this leg sorted out.
DOCTOR: Good. It’s good to be thorough. Blood clots are something we want to rule out, but they're not necessarily likely. It's more common after certain surgeries or long periods of immobility, but we always want to be careful. The blood test will give us a better picture. In the meantime, I recommend elevating your leg whenever possible – when you're sitting or lying down. And try to avoid standing for long periods. Do you have compression stockings?
PATIENT: Compression stockings? No, I don't. What are those? Are they like… bandages? I don’t think I've ever worn those before.
DOCTOR: They're like tight socks that help improve blood flow in your legs and reduce swelling. They're not bandages, they're more like… supportive socks! They come in different strengths. I’m going to write you a prescription for a pair, and the pharmacy can help you get the right size. They can be really helpful, especially with the swelling. And just keep an eye out for any new pain, redness, or warmth in your leg, okay?
PATIENT: Okay, socks! That sounds… manageable. I can do socks. I'll ask the pharmacy. And yes, I’ll watch for pain or redness. Thank you, Doctor. This is… reassuring.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sasha. I'm glad I could help reassure you. The lab results should be back in a few days, and we can discuss them then. I'll also write a note for your primary care doctor, just to keep them in the loop. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. Socks and watch for bad stuff. And blood tests. I think that covers it. Thank you again, Doctor Polczynski. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sasha. I'm happy to help. Don't hesitate to call the office if anything changes or if you have any concerns at all. Here's the lab request and the prescription for the compression stockings. Have a good day, and enjoy your meals! .
