DOCTOR: Good morning, Sherion. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Lessie Solero. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's nice to meet you as well. Well, my chest... it's been hurting. Not all the time, but enough to worry me, you know? It feels… tight, sometimes. Like someone is squeezing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Chest pain is definitely something we want to take seriously. Can you tell me a little more about this tightness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It usually happens when I'm walking, or even just doing things around the house. Not when I'm resting. It doesn’t go all the way through to my back, if that makes sense. It’s mostly right here, in the middle of my chest. And it goes away when I stop what I’m doing. Usually pretty quick, like a minute or two.
DOCTOR: Alright, so it seems to be brought on by activity and relieved with rest, and localized to the center of your chest. That’s helpful to know. Does anything else bring it on, or make it worse?
PATIENT: Oh… now that you mention it… yes. Cold air, maybe? If I go outside when it's really chilly, it seems to bother it more. And… if I get upset, too. Like, if I’m arguing with my husband, or something. It feels worse when I’m stressed. Does that make sense? It's funny, my body tells me when I need to calm down!
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Sherion. Stress can definitely have a physical impact. And cold air can sometimes trigger chest discomfort as well. We’re gathering good information here. Now, how long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… it started… maybe six months ago? At first, it was just once in a while. I didn't think much of it. But it's been happening more and more lately. Maybe once a week at first, now it's… three or four times a week, I think. It's hard to keep track, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's been gradually increasing in frequency over the past six months. Three to four times a week is certainly something we should investigate. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the chest pain?
PATIENT: Hmm… other symptoms… let me think. No, not really. No shortness of breath, no dizziness. My arms don’t hurt. I haven’t felt sick to my stomach or anything like that. Just the chest pain. Oh! Wait. Sometimes… sometimes I get a little bit of heartburn. But I thought that was just from eating too much. Does heartburn count?
DOCTOR: It's good you mention that, Sherion. Heartburn can sometimes be related. We’ll need to consider that. Now, have you ever had this kind of pain before?
PATIENT: No, never. Not like this. I’ve had indigestion before, maybe, and a little bit of gas. But this is different. It’s… a squeezing feeling, like I said. It worries me because my father… he had some heart trouble when he was older. He had to go to the hospital a couple of times.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, especially with your father's history. We’ll definitely want to rule out anything serious. Let's go through some of your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Let me see… Well, I have high blood pressure. The doctor put me on a pill for it a few years ago. I take it every day. And… I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. That was… oh, maybe twenty years ago? Other than that, I don’t think so. I see my regular doctor for check-ups every year.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure managed with medication and a gallbladder removal twenty years ago. That's helpful. Are you currently taking any other medications, vitamins, or supplements besides the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: No, just the pill for the blood pressure. Nothing else. I don't really like taking a lot of pills, you know? I try to eat healthy and get some exercise when I can. I walk with my neighbor a few times a week, when the weather is nice.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I know of. Never had a bad reaction to anything. My husband always jokes I can eat anything! I’ve never had any trouble with penicillin or anything like that. I think I’m pretty lucky, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle a bit. Have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: Oh, no, never. Not even tried it. My mother always said it was very bad for you. And my husband doesn't smoke either, so I never got into it.
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Oh, just a little bit sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe once or twice a week. Nothing more than that. I don't really care for hard liquor.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a glass of wine occasionally. And finally, just to complete the picture, can you tell me about any major illnesses or surgeries anyone in your immediate family has had?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Like I said, my father had some heart trouble. He had to have a stent put in a few years before he passed away. And my mother… she had diabetes. She had it for a long time. And my brother… he had high cholesterol, but he's been managing it with diet and exercise. I don’t think anyone else had anything major.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Sherion. That’s a very helpful history. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your chest. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. That’s fine. Whatever you think is best. Just let me know if it's going to be cold. My skin gets chilly easily.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be mindful of that. Take a nice, deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Okay, your heart sounds regular, but I do hear a slight murmur. It's not overly concerning at this point, but we'll want to investigate further. Take another deep breath… and exhale. Your lungs sound clear. Any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not really. A little bit of… pressure, maybe, but not pain. It feels… the same as it usually does. It doesn’t feel any worse than before. It's hard to explain. It's just a tight feeling. Like someone is sitting on my chest.
DOCTOR: I understand. It sounds like you're experiencing some chest wall tenderness, but it’s not sharp. Your blood pressure is a little elevated at 145/90, which is something we'll want to monitor. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, there are a few possibilities we need to consider. It could be angina, which is chest pain due to reduced blood flow to the heart, especially given your father’s history. It could also be musculoskeletal pain, or potentially something related to stress or acid reflux. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order a few tests. I'm going to order an EKG to check your heart's electrical activity, a chest X-ray to rule out any lung issues, and some blood work to check your cholesterol levels, blood sugar, and rule out any inflammation. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds like a lot of tests! But… yes, if that's what you think is best, Doctor. I just want to know what's going on, you know? I don't want it to be something serious. Is it going to be expensive? I have Medicare, but…
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Sherion. It does seem like a lot, but these tests will give us a much clearer picture of what’s going on. And yes, it's important to rule out anything serious. Regarding the cost, Medicare should cover most of these tests, but there may be a small co-pay or deductible depending on your specific plan. Our billing department will be able to give you a more accurate estimate. I'll have them contact you after the tests are completed. Okay, let's get this process started. I'll have my nurse draw your blood and schedule the EKG and chest X-ray. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. Just… thank you, Doctor. I feel a little better knowing we're doing something to find out what's wrong. And thank you for explaining everything so clearly. It's nice to have a doctor who listens.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Sherion. I'm glad I could reassure you a bit. My goal is to make sure you feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. I’ll also recommend that you continue to monitor your symptoms and avoid strenuous activity until we have the results of the tests. If you experience any worsening chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. My nurse will be in shortly to assist you. Have a good day, and please don't hesitate to ask if anything comes to mind.
