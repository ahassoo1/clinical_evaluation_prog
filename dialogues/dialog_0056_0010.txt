DOCTOR: Hi Jahaad, welcome. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Amussen. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Um, well, to be honest, I’m not entirely sure what exactly brings me in. I’ve noticed some swelling… somewhere. It’s rather odd, and my memory isn’t the best, so pinpointing it has been difficult. I hope that doesn’t make things too complicated.
DOCTOR: Not at all! It's perfectly alright if you're not sure. We'll figure it out together. "Somewhere" is a good starting point. Can you tell me a little more about the swelling?
PATIENT: Certainly. It feels… soft, mostly. Not particularly painful, just… present. I first noticed it a few days ago, I believe. Perhaps around the beginning of the week? It's on my… …around here, I think. It’s hard to say exactly where, and whether it’s moved at all. It doesn't seem to be getting worse, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Okay, so soft swelling, noticed a few days ago, somewhere on your neck or face…not getting worse. That's helpful. Just to clarify, when you say “around here,” can you point to the most noticeable spot right now?
PATIENT: I believe it’s… here. Though, again, it's quite vague. Sometimes it feels a little higher, sometimes a bit lower. It's not a sharp pain, just… fullness. And it's not on both sides, it seems to be mostly just this one. Does that make any sense? I apologize for being so unclear; I wish I could describe it better.
DOCTOR: No apologies needed at all, Jahaad. It’s good you’re telling me all of this – we’ll get to the bottom of it. So, swelling mostly on the left side of your jawline, below your ear, soft, and not painful, just a feeling of fullness. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with this?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. Not that I’m aware of, no. No fever, no difficulty swallowing, no changes in my diet or appetite… I haven’t really felt unwell, just… concerned about the swelling. I suppose I've been a little more tired than usual, but I attributed that to the summer heat. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, no trouble swallowing, appetite is normal, maybe a little more tired than usual. The fatigue could be related to the heat, yes. Now, have you had any injuries to your face or neck recently?
PATIENT: No, I don’t believe so. I haven't had any falls or bumps that I can recall. I work as a speech-language pathologist, so I spend most of my days indoors, and I’m generally quite careful. Perhaps a small scrape a few months ago, but nothing significant. Nothing that would explain swelling like this, surely?
DOCTOR: Right, no recent injuries. Okay. And just to get a full picture, have you noticed anything else at all?
PATIENT: …Well, now that you mention it, I’ve been feeling… a bit off, generally. Just a vague sense of unease. And my sleep has been somewhat disrupted, though I wasn’t sure if that was related. I haven’t been dreaming as much, if that makes any sense. It’s very subtle, and it’s hard to articulate. I apologize for being so… imprecise.
DOCTOR: No, you’re not being imprecise at all, Jahaad. It’s helpful for me to get as much information as possible, even if it seems small. Vague sense of unease and disrupted sleep… okay. Now, let's talk a little about your medical history. Do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: To my knowledge, no. I’ve never had a serious allergic reaction. No food allergies, no medication allergies, no environmental allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve always been quite… resilient, I suppose. Although, my mother always said I was sensitive to strong perfumes. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: That’s good to know. Sensitivity to perfumes isn't typically a medical allergy, but good to be aware of. Are you currently taking any medications – prescription, over-the-counter, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, none at all. I prefer to avoid medication whenever possible. I try to maintain a healthy lifestyle, and I haven't had any medical conditions that require regular treatment. Just the occasional pain reliever for a headache, but nothing consistent. I do take a Vitamin D supplement during the winter months, as we don’t get much sunlight here, but I stopped taking it a few weeks ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, no medications currently, just Vitamin D seasonally. Let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I've been fortunate enough to enjoy good health my entire life, thankfully. I've had the usual childhood illnesses – chickenpox, measles – but nothing serious. No chronic conditions, no surgeries, no hospitalizations… I did have my tonsils removed when I was quite young, perhaps seven or eight years old, but that was a very routine procedure. Does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsils removed as a child, otherwise no significant medical history. Now, how about family history?
PATIENT: That’s a bit difficult. My mother passed away a few years ago, and I wasn't particularly close to my father’s side of the family. I know my mother had some… digestive issues, but I’m not sure of the specifics. No history of cancer, heart disease, or diabetes that I’m aware of. It’s possible there’s something on my father’s side, but I don’t have the information. I apologize for being so vague. My family isn't very forthcoming about such things.
DOCTOR: That's alright, Jahaad. It’s common for family medical history to be incomplete. Let’s move on. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of the above. I've never smoked a cigarette in my life. I occasionally have a glass of wine with dinner, perhaps once or twice a month, but I wouldn't consider myself a drinker. And I’ve never used recreational drugs. I lead a very… quiet life. I prioritize my health and well-being, and I avoid anything that could jeopardize that.
DOCTOR: Okay, no smoking, minimal alcohol, no recreational drugs. Alright. Now, I'm going to do a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your ears, nose and throat, and then palpate the swelling you've been describing. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, absolutely. That sounds perfectly reasonable. Please proceed. I trust your judgment, Dr. Amussen. I’ll do my best to remain still.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart and lungs sound clear. Your ears and throat look normal. The swelling is soft, non-tender, and there’s no noticeable redness or warmth. I do feel a few small, slightly enlarged lymph nodes in your neck on both sides, but they are not significantly enlarged or painful. Alright. Based on what you’ve told me and the initial exam, there are a few possibilities. The swelling and enlarged lymph nodes could be a sign of a mild viral infection, or a reaction to a recent, minor illness. However, because of the vague symptoms you’ve described – the fatigue, disrupted sleep, and general sense of unease – I'd like to order a few blood tests just to rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible, Dr. Amussen. I appreciate your thoroughness. I'd feel much more comfortable knowing we've ruled out anything concerning. Blood tests sound perfectly fine to me. Whatever you think is best. I trust your expertise.
DOCTOR: Excellent. I’ll order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel . These tests will give us a good overview of your overall health and help us identify any potential problems. The lab is just down the hall. They'll draw a small amount of blood, and the results should be back within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest and staying hydrated. If the swelling gets significantly worse, becomes painful, or you develop a fever, please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve explained everything very clearly, Dr. Amussen. Rest and hydration sound like a good plan. I suppose I'll just wait for the results of the blood tests then. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me, and for your patience. It's difficult to articulate these vague feelings, and I appreciate you taking me seriously. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for the blood tests, or any specific instructions I should follow?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Jahaad. It's perfectly alright to have trouble describing things, that’s what I’m here for. For the blood tests, you don't need to do anything special. You can eat and drink normally beforehand. Just try to relax. The phlebotomist will explain the process when you get there. I’ll have the lab requisition printed out for you now, and we’ll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results once they’re available. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfect. Thank you again, Dr. Amussen. I appreciate your help and guidance. I’ll head down to the lab now. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Jahaad. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment. Take care, and have a good day. .
