DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Auelua. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Auelua, is it? Yes, right. Well, it’s... something about a check-up. For... work, I think. Something to do with performing, maybe? Honestly, it’s all a bit fuzzy. They just sent me here, you see. A lot of paperwork involved, I recall. I hope this won’t take too long.
DOCTOR: Alright, a check-up requested by your workplace. That’s perfectly alright. We’ll get everything sorted out as efficiently as we can. “Performing” – are you a musician, actor, or something along those lines?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Um… yes, something along those lines. More… on the periphery, I suppose. Ushers, mostly. Lobby things. Sometimes tickets. It wasn't… a starring role, if you catch my drift. A long time ago, though. Really, a very long time. I wouldn't worry too much about it being complicated. I'm fairly… durable, for my age. Though my memory isn't what it once was.
DOCTOR: Okay, ushers and ticket sales. That’s helpful to know. It doesn't matter what the role is, we want to make sure you're fit to do what you need to do. And don’t worry about your memory – we'll take things at your pace. We can always double-check things. To start, could you tell me a little about your general health?
PATIENT: General health… hmm. Well, I… I eat, I suppose. Not a huge appetite, these days. And I try to walk when the weather’s good. Not much trouble with… major things, if that makes sense. No hospitals recently, thankfully. I had a bit of a cough last winter, but it cleared up on its own. Honestly, Doctor, I’m not one for complaining. I just want to get this over with so I can… well, so I can be done.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to hear. No recent hospitalizations, and a cough that resolved on its own. That's all useful information. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions that you're aware of, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That’s… a lot of medical terms. Let me think. I don't think so. The doctor years ago… he mentioned something about my cholesterol, perhaps? But I didn’t really pay much attention. I don’t take any pills regularly, if that helps. My ex-wife used to nag me about it, but… well, that was a long time ago. I mostly just get tired easily, if that counts as a condition.
DOCTOR: Okay, we'll definitely check your cholesterol levels today. And fatigue is something we should look into. Just to be thorough, have you ever been diagnosed with any allergies – to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. No, I don't think so. Never had any trouble with food, as far as I remember. No hives, no swelling… nothing like that. I used to dust a lot, back when I was married, but that didn't bother me. Perhaps a slight sniffle now and then, but nothing serious. I really think I'm fairly… unremarkable, Doctor.
DOCTOR: “Unremarkable” is perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. It's good to know what isn't going on just as much as what is. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Have you ever had any major illnesses, surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything other than the cough you mentioned?
PATIENT: Major illnesses… surgeries… Goodness. Let me think, really think. I broke my arm once, when I was a boy – climbing a tree, foolishly. Nothing major, just a cast for a few weeks. And… I had my tonsils out, I think. A long time ago. Other than that… no, I don’t recall anything serious. Nothing that required a long stay in hospital, certainly. I pride myself on being… resilient.
DOCTOR: Okay, broken arm as a child and a tonsillectomy. Good to know. Now, can you tell me about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Family… Oh, that's a tricky one. My parents… they’re both gone now, a long time ago. Mother had a weak heart, I think. Always complaining of palpitations. Father… he was a strong man, worked very hard. I don't recall him being ill much, but he always said he had “the constitution of an ox”. No siblings, I’m afraid. It’s just me. Honestly, Doctor, it’s a bit of a blur, if you don't mind. My memory just isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Mr. Krahn. It’s completely understandable that details are fuzzy. Knowing your mother had heart issues is helpful, though. Now, just a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not me. Never smoked a day in my life. Tried it once, back in college, but didn’t like it. Alcohol… maybe a glass of sherry with dinner, occasionally. Very occasionally. And recreational drugs? Absolutely not. Never been tempted. I prefer a quiet evening with a book, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Krahn. A quiet evening with a book sounds lovely. Now, before we move on to a physical exam, is there anything else you think I should know about your health or your reason for being here today?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. No, I don't think so. I just… I just want to get this done, honestly. I’m not sure why they sent me here, or what they’re looking for. It’s all a bit confusing. I just hope it doesn’t take too long. I have… things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. It sounds like you’re a bit unsure about the purpose of the check-up, which is perfectly fine. We'll do a thorough exam and try to figure out what your workplace might be looking for. It shouldn't take too long, I promise. To start, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath in and out for me?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Deep breath… Yes, I can do that. Is that alright? It feels a bit… tight, sometimes. But I suppose that’s just old age.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. I do hear a little bit of wheezing in your lungs. Nothing to be overly concerned about at this stage, but we’ll want to investigate that further. Now, I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse. Could you please extend your arm?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, of course. Blood pressure… That sounds serious. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright, your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. And your pulse is 88, which is within a normal range. Elevated blood pressure is something we'll want to monitor. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Could you lie back for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh… elevated. Is that bad? Yes, alright. I’m lying down.
DOCTOR: Your abdomen sounds normal, no unusual sounds detected. Now, I'm going to check your reflexes. Could you bend your knees and let your legs dangle freely?
PATIENT: Reflexes… alright. Do I need to do anything special?
DOCTOR: Alright, just relax. I'm checking your reflexes. And… okay, your reflexes are a little diminished, but that can be normal with age. Now, last thing, I’ll just take a quick look in your ears and throat. Please open your mouth and say “ah.”
PATIENT: Ah… Does it hurt? My throat feels a bit scratchy, actually.
DOCTOR: Alright, a little redness in the back of your throat, which could explain the scratchiness. Nothing too concerning at this point. Okay, Mr. Krahn, that completes the physical exam. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam, your elevated blood pressure, slightly diminished reflexes, and wheezing are what we need to investigate further. And the redness in your throat is likely a minor irritation. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Elevated… wheezing… it all sounds rather worrying. Investigate? What does that mean? More tests? I just want to know if I’m… if I’m alright. Is it serious?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be worried, Mr. Krahn, but let's not jump to conclusions. "Investigate" simply means we need to do some tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. The elevated blood pressure, wheezing, and diminished reflexes are things we want to understand better, but they aren't necessarily serious. We’ll start with a blood test to check your cholesterol levels, kidney function, and overall health. We’ll also do a chest X-ray to look at your lungs more closely and see what’s causing the wheezing. And a simple EKG to check your heart rhythm. These tests will help us determine if there’s an underlying problem that needs treatment. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Oh dear. Alright… alright, if you think it’s necessary. But will it take long? And will it be… painful? I’m not good with needles, you see.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Krahn. The blood test will just involve a small sample of blood taken from your arm – a quick pinch, and it’s usually over very quickly. It shouldn’t be too painful, and we’ll do everything we can to make you comfortable. The chest X-ray is completely painless – you’ll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds. The whole process should take about an hour or so. And the results will usually be available within a few days. In the meantime, I recommend you try to rest and drink plenty of fluids. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of before we proceed with the blood test?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, I don’t think so. As I said before, I’m fairly unremarkable. Though… there was that one time, many years ago, I had a bit of a rash after eating shellfish. But that was a long time ago, and I haven’t had shellfish since. But other than that, no. I’m fine. Let’s just get it over with, shall we? This is all very… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Alright, a shellfish allergy – good to know. We'll make a note of that. Okay, Mr. Krahn, let's get started with the blood test. I’ll just need to sanitize your arm. Please relax, and take a deep breath. The phlebotomist will be in shortly to draw your blood. Once that’s done, we’ll get you scheduled for the chest X-ray. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable while we wait?
PATIENT: No… no, I don’t think so. Just… hurry, if you could. This is making me rather anxious. A glass of water, perhaps? And please, try not to poke too much.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krahn. I’ll do my best to make this as quick and painless as possible. And the phlebotomist is very skilled, so you’re in good hands. I’ll leave you to it now, and I’ll be back to discuss the results once they’re available. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns during the process.
