DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Secondi. I’m Dr. Cumper. Welcome to the clinic. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Thank you. Um… it’s my pee. It’s… orange. I noticed it yesterday, and again this morning. It’s a little scary, you know? I drink water, I think enough. But it’s orange.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Orange urine can be a bit concerning, so you’re right to check it out. Let's try to figure out what might be going on. When you say “enough” water, roughly how much fluid are you drinking in a typical day?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Maybe… two liters? Sometimes a little more if it’s hot. I work outside a lot, so I try to drink when I feel thirsty. But two liters, I think. Is that not… good enough? I don’t really measure it, sorry.
DOCTOR: No, no apology needed. Two liters is… reasonable, but let's consider if that’s enough for you, given your activity level. Okay. And you mentioned you work outside. What kind of work do you do?
PATIENT: I… build things. Like… fences, small walls. Sometimes I help with roofing. It's physical work, lots of sun. I’m an engineering technician, that's what they call it. But mostly I’m building with my hands. Does that make sense? It’s hot work. Very hot.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense. That is physical work, and being out in the sun is definitely a factor. Okay. Besides the color change, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: No, no other things. I feel okay. A little tired, maybe, from the work, but I always feel a little tired. No pain, no… nothing else strange. Just the orange pee. It just looks… wrong. Should I be worried?
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain or other symptoms is good. It's good you're paying attention to it. Let's review some things. Have you noticed any changes in your diet recently?
PATIENT: No, not really. My wife does most of the cooking. We eat… normal things. Couscous, tagine, chicken, vegetables. Nothing different this week, I don't think. Maybe a little more sugar in my tea? But that’s it. It's not much.
DOCTOR: Okay, nothing major in the diet. Do you take any vitamins or supplements?
PATIENT: Um… my wife gives me one. A multivitamin. Every morning. She says it’s good for me. It's… a little orange pill, actually. Funny, yes? Orange pee, orange pill… I don't know what's in it, sorry. She buys it.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is potentially relevant. Okay. And just to be thorough, are you experiencing any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or any pain in your abdomen or back?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. Everything is… normal. I told you. Just the orange pee. No pain, no sick feeling, no… anything. I’m really not feeling bad, just a little worried about what is causing it. Is it the pill, you think?
DOCTOR: It’s certainly possible the multivitamin is contributing to the color change – some contain high doses of beta-carotene or vitamin C, which can cause this. Let’s do a quick physical exam, just to be safe, and then I’d like to order a simple urine test to rule out anything more concerning. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, okay. That sounds… good. I want to know what's going on. Exam and test, yes. No problem. I trust you, Doctor. What do you want me to do first?
DOCTOR: Great. Alright, if you could step over to the examination table and lie down, we'll start with listening to your abdomen, and then I'll check your reflexes. Then we'll take a urine sample.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. I hope it’s not anything bad. This is… a little scary, no? But I trust you. Okay. Let’s get it done.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your abdomen sounds normal, no unusual sounds. Now I’m just going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal as well. Now, if you could provide me with a urine sample, please. There's a cup in the bathroom. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample, if you can – that means start urinating, then collect a sample mid-flow. I'll be right outside.
PATIENT: Okay, yes. Mid-stream. I think I remember that from before. Bathroom, yes. I will try my best. Give me a minute, yes? I hope it’s just the pill. My wife will be angry if it’s not.
DOCTOR: Moroccan, 36, works outside... two liters of fluid... multivitamin… beta-carotene. Let's see what the urine test says.
PATIENT: Here you go, Doctor. I tried my best to do the… mid-stream thing. Hopefully that’s okay. It’s… still orange, you know?
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Secondi. Yes, I see the color. Alright, I’m going to step out to run this sample through a quick analysis. It should only take a few minutes. I’ll be right back with the results.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I will wait here. Please tell me if it is something serious. I worry a little, you know. My wife… she worries too. Is it the pill, you think? It's a little strange, an orange pill making orange pee. It doesn’t make sense.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Secondi, the urine test results are back. The good news is, there are no signs of infection, blood, or protein in your urine. Your kidney function looks normal as well. However, the test did show elevated levels of beta-carotene. This strongly suggests the orange discoloration is likely due to the multivitamin your wife is giving you. Some multivitamins contain a high dose of beta-carotene, which your body converts to vitamin A. Excess beta-carotene can cause harmless, temporary orange discoloration of the skin and urine – it’s called carotenemia.
PATIENT: Oh… the pill. So, it’s just the pill? Not something… bad? That’s good. Very good. My wife will be relieved, too. She worries a lot. But… why so much orange? And why does it make my pee look so… strange? It scared me, you know? Is it dangerous, even though it's harmless?
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand your concern. It's good it's nothing serious. The high amount of beta-carotene is likely the culprit. It's not dangerous in itself – your body will eliminate the excess beta-carotene over time, and the discoloration will fade. However, very high levels can occasionally cause a slight yellowing of the skin, particularly on the palms and soles of your feet, but that's rare. It’s more of a cosmetic issue than a health concern. I would recommend your wife check the dosage of the multivitamin, or consider switching to one with a lower beta-carotene content. It's always best to avoid unnecessarily high doses of any vitamin. Would you like me to write a note for her suggesting this?
PATIENT: Yes, please. A note would be very helpful. She listens to doctors better than she listens to me, you know? Always wants to do what’s best, but sometimes she overdoes it. So, I can go back to work now? And tell my wife about the note? Is there anything else I need to worry about? Any special things I need to do? Or eat? Or… not eat?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. Here’s a note for your wife, recommending a lower beta-carotene multivitamin. No, there’s nothing else you need to worry about or special things you need to do. You can return to work as usual. Just stay hydrated, especially given your physical activity. And if the discoloration persists for more than a few weeks despite switching multivitamins, or if you notice any other symptoms, please don’t hesitate to schedule a follow-up appointment. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Secondi?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything. You have been very helpful, Doctor. Thank you very much. I feel much better now. I will tell my wife, and she will be happy. Thank you again. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Secondi. I'm glad I could help. Get back to work safely, and give my best to your wife.
