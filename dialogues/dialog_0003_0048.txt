DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Lason. I'm Dr. Yackey. So, to begin, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s these… episodes. My wife, she’s the one who insisted I come. I get… lost, sometimes. Not lost lost, like wandering around. More like… I don’t know where I am for a bit. Or what day it is. It’s embarrassing, really. I’ve always been sharp as a tack.
DOCTOR: Episodes, you say. And how long has this been occurring, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. It's hard to say exactly. Maybe… three, four months now? It started subtly. I’d forget why I went into a room, that sort of thing. Now, it's… more noticeable. Last week, I was convinced it was still June. My wife had to tell me. She says it’s worrying. Frankly, I think she worries too much. But she booked the appointment, so here I am.
DOCTOR: Three to four months… and these periods of… disorientation, as you describe them, are they happening frequently?
PATIENT: Frequently? That’s… a good question. Not every day, no. Maybe… twice a week, on average? Sometimes it's just a few minutes, and then I snap out of it. Other times… well, last Tuesday I didn't recognize our grandson for a good five minutes. He was upset, naturally. My wife says it’s getting worse, and I suppose she’s probably right. It just… doesn’t feel like that long to me when it happens. Time gets… blurry.
DOCTOR: Blurry, you say. Are you experiencing any other symptoms during these episodes, Mr. Lason?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… not that I’ve noticed. I don’t feel sick, exactly. No dizziness or headaches. Just… confused. Like a piece of the puzzle is missing. Sometimes I stumble a little, but I figured that's just because I'm getting old. I’m 66, Doctor, things start to go wrong, you know? My wife keeps asking if I'm having trouble remembering things, but… I remember plenty. I can tell you exactly how to lay tile, what kind of grout to use for different stones. It’s just… these moments. These episodes. They’re frustrating, more than anything. And frankly, a little frightening for my wife.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you’ve noticed no changes in your vision, hearing, or speech?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Nothing like that. Eyes are fine, I get them checked every year. Hearing's a bit spotty, always has been, but hasn't gotten worse. And I haven’t noticed anyone telling me I'm mumbling or something. I can still yell at the TV during the football game just fine, if that counts. Honestly, if my eyesight or hearing were failing, then I'd be worried. This is just… odd. A strange sort of forgetfulness. It's not like I'm losing my mind, is it?
DOCTOR: We'll need to rule out a number of possibilities, Mr. Lason. Have you had any recent illnesses, even a cold?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses… let me think. Nothing major. I had a bit of a cough back in March, but that cleared up quick. Just a spring cold, I figured. And I had a touch of the flu two years ago, but I bounced back from that fine. Nothing that required a trip to the hospital, or anything like that. I generally stay healthy. Good diet, plenty of activity… well, as much activity as a man my age can have. I work with tiles all day, that’s good exercise, isn’t it? It keeps me on my feet. I don't understand why this is happening, frankly.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, either prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my arthritis, Doctor. Something my doctor gave me a few years back. Can’t remember the name of it, honestly. Little white pill. Takes the edge off the joint pain, mostly. And I take a multivitamin every day. My wife insists. Other than that… no. I’ve always been wary of putting too much stuff into my body. I prefer to let my body do its own work, if you know what I mean. I don't need a bunch of chemicals messing things up. But I'll ask my wife to bring the bottle next time. She keeps track of all that, much better than I do.
DOCTOR: Right. Well, I think we should do a brief neurological exam, just to get a baseline. And I'm going to order some bloodwork to rule out any deficiencies or underlying medical conditions. Is that agreeable?
PATIENT: A neurological exam? Bloodwork? Honestly, Doctor, it sounds like a lot of fuss over a little bit of confusion. But… if it'll put my wife’s mind at ease, I suppose. Yes, alright. Do what you need to do. Just… try not to keep me here all day. I have work to get back to. And she’s making my favorite Cambodian curry tonight. I don't want it to get cold.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you’ll just follow me, we’ll begin with the exam. Please sit here, and I’ll explain each step as we go. We’ll start with your reflexes.
PATIENT: Reflexes, huh? I haven’t had my reflexes tested since… well, probably when I got my driver’s license. Seems like a bit of overkill for a few forgetful moments, but… alright. Let’s get this over with. Just try to be quick about it, Doctor. I’m not a fan of hospitals, or doctors, to be honest. And that curry won't make itself.
DOCTOR: Alright. Just relax your leg. Now… and again. Good. And now the other leg. Now, could you please close your eyes and tell me when I touch your fingers?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. Don’t poke me, Doctor. Hurry up, will you? My leg’s starting to fall asleep. This is… undignified. And I’m pretty sure I could do this with my eyes open just as easily. I’ve always been a practical man. This feels like a waste of time, honestly. Just… touch my fingers already.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, can you follow my finger with your eyes, but don’t move your head?
PATIENT: I’m following your finger, Doctor. What am I looking for, exactly? This feels… strange. Like a test for something I’m not even experiencing. Honestly, I feel perfectly capable of laying tile right now. Perfectly capable. This whole thing is… unsettling. Just tell me when it’s over. I’ve got a curry waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. That will be sufficient for now. Let’s move on to some basic cognitive tests. I’m going to ask you a few questions. Just answer to the best of your ability. First, what is today’s date?
PATIENT: Today’s date… Now that is a tricky one. Let me think… It’s… August, definitely August. But what day? My wife tells me every day, but it never sticks. Is it the 3rd? No… I think it’s the 2nd. August 2nd. Yes. August 2nd, 2025. Is that right? Honestly, those dates all blend together. It’s just… a date. What does it matter? Let's just get this over with.
DOCTOR: August 2nd, 2025. Alright. Now, can you tell me the names of three objects, and then repeat them to me after a short delay?
PATIENT: Three objects… Honestly, Doctor, is this really necessary? Fine. Pen. Chair. Picture. There. Pen, chair, picture. Now what? Hurry up, will you? This is ridiculous. My mind is perfectly sharp. I just… have a lot on my mind. Work, family… a good curry to look forward to.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, repeat those three objects for me.
PATIENT: Three objects… Let me see… There was a… a pen, definitely a pen. And… And a chair… yes, a chair. And… something else. Something on the wall… a… a painting? No, not a painting. A… Honestly, Doctor, this is humiliating! I remember perfectly well, but it's just… stuck. Chair… pen… something on the wall… I can see it… It’s… escaping me. I know I can do this.
DOCTOR: Alright. We'll stop there. Bloodwork and a referral to neurology for further evaluation. I'll have my nurse draw blood before you leave. And I’ll get the referral paperwork ready. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: Neurology? You think I need to see a specialist? Honestly, Doctor, I just forget a few dates and stumble a little sometimes. I don’t need to be poked and prodded by a neurologist. Is this really necessary? And what exactly are we looking for? You haven’t explained anything. Is it something serious? I just want to know what’s going on, and if I can get back to my life… and my curry.
DOCTOR: It’s standard procedure, Mr. Lason. We need to rule out any underlying causes for your memory lapses. It could be something as simple as a vitamin deficiency, but it's best to be thorough. The neurologist will conduct a more detailed assessment. As for a definitive diagnosis, I cannot say at this time without further testing. However, based on what you've told me, we need to investigate the possibility of early cognitive decline. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Cognitive… decline? You mean… like… losing my mind? No. No, that’s not possible. I’m perfectly capable. I lay tile every day. I remember everything about my trade. I just… have a little trouble with dates, sometimes. It doesn’t mean anything. My wife worries too much. She always has. Is this something serious? Is this… reversible? Please, Doctor, just tell me what’s going on. And what am I supposed to tell her? She’s going to be beside herself. All this fuss over a few forgetful moments. I just want to go home.
DOCTOR: Mr. Lason, I understand your concerns. However, it is crucial to gather more information before drawing any conclusions. I have ordered the bloodwork and the referral to neurology. The neurologist will provide you with a more comprehensive evaluation and answer your questions. I cannot, and will not, speculate on the reversibility of any potential condition without proper diagnostic testing. I suggest you schedule the appointments as soon as possible. My nurse will provide you with the necessary paperwork and contact information. Do you have any further questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. No further questions. Just… Just get me the paperwork. And let me go home. I need to… talk to my wife. Thank you, Doctor. I think.
