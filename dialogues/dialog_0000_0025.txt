DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie, good to meet you. Eighty-five years young, that’s wonderful. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eh, hello Doctor. Yes, eighty-five. Long time, eh? I want… I want to know where my people come from. My grandfathers, and their grandfathers. I hear you can do that now? With… with spit, or something? My daughter, she tell me about it. DNA, she call it.
DOCTOR: DNA, yes. Your daughter is… partially correct. We can do some genetic ancestry testing. It’s not quite “spit,” though we do use a saliva sample. It's not a perfect science, Mr. Scobie. It gives us probabilities, an estimate of your ethnic origins. It won't tell you the names of your great-grandfathers, I'm afraid. More like… broad regions. And honestly, at your age, is knowing exactly which island your ancestors sailed from truly… necessary for your health?
PATIENT: Eh? Not necessary for health, no. Just… curious. Always been curious. My daughter, she very into this thing. She say I Marshallese, of course, but… before that? Before the islands? I just want to know. It okay if it not perfect. Even a little bit, good enough. Is not so expensive, she say? I have Medicare. Will it pay?
DOCTOR: Well, Medicare coverage for genetic ancestry testing is… limited. It’s generally only covered if it’s directly related to a medical condition, a specific diagnosis we’re trying to make. Simply satisfying curiosity isn't a covered benefit, I’m afraid. These tests, the ones that trace ancestry, are considered “elective.” They can be… quite pricey. Do you know the cost your daughter mentioned?
PATIENT: Elective… mean I have to pay? How much, you think? My daughter, she not say. She just say you can do it. I have… not much money. Just what little I get from the government. Is maybe… a hundred dollar? Two hundred? I not good with numbers anymore.
DOCTOR: Let’s see… a basic ancestry DNA test from a reputable lab, one that provides a reasonably detailed report… it’s closer to $99 to $199, yes, like your daughter said. But those are the starting prices. More detailed tests, with additional features and more specific regional breakdowns, can easily run $300 or more. And frankly, the cheaper tests aren't always the most accurate. I wouldn't want you wasting your money on something that gives you misleading information. Given your limited funds, it might be best to… reconsider. It seems rather frivolous, doesn’t it?
PATIENT: Frivolous…? I not sure what that mean. But… important to me. Not waste money, no. Maybe… maybe just the cheapest one then? The $99 one? Will that tell me something? Even a little bit about where my people… before Marshall? Is that okay? Can we do just that one? I trust you, Doctor. You seem like a smart lady.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Scobie. If you are certain, we can arrange for the basic $99 test. But I want to be very clear: it's unlikely to provide you with definitive answers about your ancestry beyond a broad continental origin. It will tell you percentages, estimates. It won’t give you names or specific tribal affiliations. And I strongly advise you not to make any major life decisions based on the results. We’ll need to draw a saliva sample. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Just… do it. Saliva, you say? Easy enough. I spit every morning, ha! Just… let me know if it cost more than $99, okay? My daughter, she will be mad if I spend too much. Just… want to know. Thank you, Doctor. You very kind.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse come in with the collection kit. It’s a simple procedure. She’ll explain everything. And I will ensure we stay within your budget, Mr. Scobie. Although, I still maintain this is… a rather unusual request for a medical visit.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. Maybe it will tell me something good. Something about my grandfathers. Maybe they were… sailors? Or chiefs? I don’t know. Just… hopeful.
DOCTOR: Let’s not get ahead of ourselves, Mr. Scobie. It’s a test, not a history book. We’ll see what the results show. Now, let’s get that sample collected. The nurse will be right in. And please, try not to get your hopes too high.
PATIENT: Okay. I try not to. But… a man can hope, eh? Thank you, Doctor. I wait for the nurse. .
DOCTOR: "Honestly, some people..."
