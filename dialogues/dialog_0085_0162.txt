DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Mr. Kristofik. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Lahn. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, I got…bloating, alright? It’s been happening. I don’t really…do details. Just feels full, you know? Like I ate too much, but I haven’t. Can we just get this sorted? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, bloating…feeling full even when you haven’t eaten much. I understand you’d like to get this sorted quickly, and I'll do my best to help. Just to get a better picture, could you tell me when it started?
PATIENT: Ugh, when? Honestly, I don’t know. A while ago. Weeks, maybe? I really don’t keep track of that stuff. It just…started. Is this going to take long? I swear, my wife always made me do all the remembering… it’s just easier if I tell you what feels wrong, not when it started.
DOCTOR: I understand. No problem at all. We can focus on how it feels right now. You said it feels like fullness, even when you haven’t eaten much. Can you describe that feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: Like…tight. My stomach’s just tight. And gassy. A lot of gas. It's uncomfortable, alright? I just feel…puffed up. Like a balloon that’s about to pop. Happy now? Is that detailed enough? I don't understand why this is important, honestly. Does it matter how tight?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's helpful, thank you. Knowing it feels tight and gassy is good information. And you’re right to ask why I ask these questions – it helps me figure out what might be going on. When you say “tight,” is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Definitely comes and goes. More often after I eat, I guess. Doesn’t matter what I eat, really. Could be anything. And it'll just…stick around for a few hours. Then go away. Look, I operate heavy machinery all day, I don’t have time to analyze every little burp and bubble. Just tell me what’s wrong, or if there’s a pill, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, comes and goes, related to eating, lasting a few hours. I understand your time is valuable, Mr. Kristofik. To help me narrow down the possibilities, could you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve noticed?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? What does that even mean? Like…am I coughing? No. Fever? No. Look, I told you, my stomach’s bloated and tight. That's it. I don't do…symptoms. Maybe it's just stress. I lost my wife last year, alright? Maybe I’m just…full of grief. Is that a symptom? Can I just get something for the bloating? Seriously.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I am so sorry for your loss. Losing your wife is a tremendous hardship, and it absolutely can cause physical symptoms. Grief can manifest in many ways. It’s good you brought that up. And you're right to ask about getting something for the bloating. Before we jump to that, I just want to rule out anything more serious, even if it's unlikely. It's part of my job. Would you mind if I just listen to your abdomen with my stethoscope?
PATIENT: Look, I really don’t like being poked and prodded. I operate a pile driver. I'm used to doing the poking and prodded. But… fine. Just get it over with. Quickly. And don’t tell me it's something awful, alright? I’ve had enough bad news lately. Just tell me if it's gas, or something I can take a pill for.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I’ll be as quick and gentle as possible. Just lie back on the table, and I’ll listen to your abdomen. It will just take a moment. Okay. I’m hearing some…increased bowel sounds, which isn’t unexpected with gas. Your abdomen is slightly tender to the touch, but no guarding or rigidity. No masses that I can feel. It doesn't sound like anything immediately concerning, but… Given your history of loss, and the fact that the bloating comes and goes, it could be related to stress and changes in your gut microbiome. However, bloating can also be caused by things like food intolerances or mild Irritable Bowel Syndrome. I'd like to run a few simple tests just to be sure. Would you be willing to do a stool sample and a basic blood test?
PATIENT: Stool sample?! Are you serious? Look, I'm a grown man. I don’t need to…do that. And blood tests? For gas?! This is ridiculous. You're telling me I need to give up my time and my bodily fluids for something that’s probably just…stress? I’m starting to think this whole thing is a waste of time. Just give me something for the gas and let me go. Please. I’m not doing a stool sample. Absolutely not.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration and I respect your wishes. I wouldn’t push you to do anything you're not comfortable with. Given that you're adamant about not doing any tests, and considering your recent loss, we can proceed with a plan focused on managing what might be stress-related digestive symptoms. However, I strongly recommend that if your symptoms worsen, or if you develop fever, vomiting, or significant weight loss, you come back immediately. Those would be signs of something more serious. For now, I can recommend an over-the-counter medication called simethicone. It helps break up gas bubbles and can provide some relief. I’m also going to recommend some dietary changes – reducing processed foods and increasing fiber intake slowly. And, if you’re open to it, exploring some stress-reduction techniques, like deep breathing exercises or mindfulness, could be helpful. Would you like me to print out some information on those topics?
