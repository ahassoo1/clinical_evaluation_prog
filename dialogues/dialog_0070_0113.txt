DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. My name is Dr. Abady. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you to the clinic?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Abady, you say? A fine name. Well, to be honest, it's... the waterworks. Been going a bit too often lately, if you catch my drift. It’s just… bothersome, that’s all. Not a serious thing, I don't think. Old age, probably. Though my wife, bless her heart, insisted I come get it checked. Women, always worrying.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. It's good of your wife to encourage you to come in – it's always best to get these things checked out, regardless of what we might suspect the cause to be. "Bothersome" is a perfectly valid reason to seek medical attention. To help me understand what's going on, could you tell me a little more about this increased frequency?
PATIENT: Frequency, you say? Hmm. Well, it's not like I'm running to the bathroom constantly, mind you. But... more often than I used to. Used to be able to go a good few hours, you know? Now, it seems like… shortly after I finish, I gotta go again. It’s a nuisance when I'm out working on the farm, that's for sure. Can't be running back and forth all day. Though, to be fair, the farm is getting bigger these days. My son's been adding a lot.
DOCTOR: I see. So it’s not a constant urge, but a noticeable increase compared to your usual pattern, and it’s impacting your activities on the farm. That's helpful to know. Do you find yourself needing to go more often during the day or night, or is it pretty consistent?
PATIENT: Oh, mostly during the day, I'd say. Nighttime's usually fine. I sleep like a log, thankfully. Though, I do get up once or twice, sometimes. But that’s just… old man stuff, isn’t it? I’m not blaming my age, but it’s a factor, I suspect. Not like when I was a young buck, running all over the fields. Everything worked perfectly then.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear that nighttime isn't significantly affected. And yes, changes do happen as we age – it's perfectly normal to experience some shifts in bodily functions. Now, aside from the increased frequency, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Changes… hmm. Let me think. Well, sometimes… sometimes it feels like I don’t quite… empty the bladder completely. Like there's a little bit left behind, you know? Not much, but enough to notice. And sometimes, when I start going, it takes a moment to get going. A little hesitation, if you follow. It's not painful, mind you, just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Yes, I understand. So, you're experiencing a sensation of incomplete emptying and a slight hesitancy when starting to urinate. That's useful information. Have you noticed any pain or burning sensation when you urinate, or any blood in your urine?
PATIENT: No, no pain or burning. Thank goodness for that. And no blood, either. Never had that trouble, knock on wood. Just… the frequency and that little bit of leftover, you know? Like a leaky bucket, almost. Not a bad leak, mind you, but a leak nonetheless. I’m not one for complaining, Doctor, but it's enough to be a bother, especially when I’m trying to get things done on the farm.
DOCTOR: That's good to hear there's no pain or blood. A "leaky bucket" is a very good way to describe it, Mr. Segretto. It sounds like we need to investigate this further. To get a better understanding of what's going on, I'd like to ask a few more general questions about your health history, if you don't mind. Have you had any previous medical problems, such as diabetes, prostate issues, or any surgeries?
PATIENT: Oh, surgeries… let me see. Had my appendix out when I was a young man, that was many years ago. And a bit of trouble with my knees, arthritis mostly. Got them replaced a few years back, that's why I walk with a bit of a limp. Other than that… not much, really. My wife keeps telling me I should see the doctor more often, but I'm a pretty sturdy fellow. Never been one for complaining about little aches and pains. As for diabetes… I don’t think so. Never been told I had it, but my wife is always worried about my sweets, says I eat too much honey.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy and knee replacements, and no history of diabetes that you’re aware of. That's helpful. And your wife is right to be mindful of your sugar intake – it’s always a good idea to be cautious. Now, does anyone in your family have a history of prostate problems, bladder issues, or any type of cancer?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. My father… he was a strong man, but he had some trouble… going to the bathroom, when he got older. Not sure what it was, exactly. Never talked about it much. My mother, she passed away when I was young, so I don’t know much about her medical history. As for cancer… I don’t think so. No one ever mentioned it, but families don't talk about these things, you know? Old-fashioned folk. Kept things to themselves.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for families not to openly discuss these things. So, your father had some urinary difficulties in his later years. That's potentially relevant. Now, let's talk about medications. Are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Oh, just a few things. I take a little something for my arthritis, helps with the pain in my knees. And a little something for my blood pressure, keeps it down. And sometimes, when I can’t sleep, I take a little something… just a little, mind you. Helps me get a good night’s rest. I can't remember the names of them, though. My wife handles all that. She keeps a list, I’m sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, medication for arthritis, blood pressure, and something for sleep. We'll definitely review those. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… well, I'm a farmer, Doctor. Been farming my whole life. Get up early, work hard all day. Lots of lifting, bending, walking in the fields. Not much sitting around, that's for sure. I drink a little coffee in the morning, sometimes a beer with dinner. I don't smoke, never have. And I try to eat healthy, mostly vegetables from the garden. Though my wife says I eat too much honey, like I mentioned before. She worries about everything, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very active lifestyle, Mr. Segretto, and that’s excellent. And it’s good to hear you don’t smoke and eat a healthy diet. Alright, now I'd like to perform a brief physical exam, if you don't mind. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your abdomen, and I’d also like to do a digital rectal exam to assess your prostate. This will give me a better understanding of what's going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A… a digital rectal exam? Oh. Well, I’ve heard things. Not pleasant things. Is that… necessary, Doctor? I mean, I understand you want to be thorough, but… it sounds rather invasive. Is there anything else we can do? Perhaps a urine test? My wife always says a good urine test can tell you everything. I’m not a fan of poking and prodding, if you catch my drift.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation, Mr. Segretto. It's perfectly normal to feel uncomfortable about a digital rectal exam. It is the most accurate way to assess the size, shape, and consistency of the prostate gland, and it’s an important part of evaluating urinary issues, particularly in men your age. A urine test will be helpful, and we will certainly order one. However, it won't give us the complete picture. A urine test can detect infection, blood, and other abnormalities, but it won't tell us about the prostate itself. We can start with the urine test and discuss the results, and then revisit the possibility of the exam. However, I want to be upfront and let you know that without a physical assessment of the prostate, it will be more difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Ultimately, the decision is yours, Mr. Segretto. We can proceed with the urine test only, or we can do both. I want you to feel comfortable and informed every step of the way. Let me know what you'd prefer.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Well, when you put it that way… it sounds like I should get it done, doesn't it? My wife would kill me if I refused, and you seem to know what you’re talking about. Still not pleasant, mind you, but… alright. Alright, let's get it over with. Just… try to be quick, Doctor. And gentle, if possible. I'm an old man, you know. Everything’s a bit… sensitive these days.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Segretto. I completely understand. We'll take it slow and be as gentle as possible. I will explain everything as we go, and if you feel any discomfort at any time, please let me know immediately. I’ll just need you to lie on your side with your knees bent. Now, if you'll excuse me for a moment, I’ll wash my hands and prepare. We’ll take our time, and I’ll do my best to make it as comfortable as possible.
PATIENT: Alright. Just… let me know when you're ready. And try not to poke too much, if you don’t mind. My wife always says I'm a delicate flower. Though I don't feel like a delicate flower, mind you. Just a tired old farmer, that's all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. I’m ready when you are. Just take a few deep breaths and try to relax. I’m going to apply a small amount of lubricant, and then gently insert a gloved, lubricated finger into your rectum. It may feel a bit of pressure or a slight urge to have a bowel movement, but it shouldn’t be painful. I’m just assessing the size, shape, and texture of your prostate. Okay, here we go. Just let me know if you feel any discomfort at all. Now, just breathe normally. I'm feeling your prostate now... It feels slightly enlarged, but not significantly. The texture is… somewhat firm, but there are no obvious nodules or areas of concern at this point. Okay, almost finished. Just a few more seconds... Alright, all done. That wasn't so bad, was it?
PATIENT: Oh, it wasn’t… pleasant, let’s put it that way. A bit uncomfortable, and frankly, undignified. But… I suppose it’s done now. You said it felt slightly enlarged? Is that… bad? And what did you mean by ‘firm’? I don’t like the sound of ‘firm’. My wife’s going to have a field day with this.
DOCTOR: It’s perfectly normal to feel a bit uncomfortable after that, and I understand your concerns. "Slightly enlarged" is a common finding in men your age, Mr. Segretto, and it doesn’t necessarily mean anything is seriously wrong. As we get older, the prostate gland tends to grow, which can sometimes cause urinary symptoms. "Firm" simply means it has a slightly harder texture than we’d ideally like, but it wasn't significantly hard or irregular. It’s not an immediate cause for concern, but it’s something we need to monitor. To get a more complete picture, I’m going to order a urine test to check for infection and other abnormalities. I’d also like to order a PSA test, which stands for prostate-specific antigen. It’s a blood test that can help us assess the level of prostate activity and potentially rule out any underlying issues. Do you have any questions about those tests, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: PSA test… another test. Seems like you just want to poke and prod me until you find something wrong. I suppose if it makes you happy. Urine test and… blood test. Alright. My wife will be pleased you're being thorough. Though she’ll probably insist I get a full body scan while we’re at it. But what will these tests tell me? Will they tell me if I need… surgery? I don’t want surgery, Doctor. I’m too old for surgery. And what if they find something… bad? I don’t want to think about that right now.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Mr. Segretto. It’s perfectly natural to worry about the possibility of something being wrong. I want to assure you that we’re not trying to scare you; we’re simply being thorough to get a clear understanding of what's going on. The urine test will check for infection, blood, and other abnormalities that could be causing your symptoms. The PSA test will give us a baseline level of prostate activity. A high PSA level doesn’t necessarily mean you have cancer, but it can indicate a higher risk, and we may need to investigate further. If the PSA level is elevated, we may recommend further testing, such as a more detailed imaging scan or, in some cases, a biopsy. However, that's not to say you’ll definitely need surgery. Many men with elevated PSA levels don't require any treatment at all, especially if they’re slow-growing and not causing any significant symptoms. We’ll discuss all the results with you in detail and explain all your options before making any decisions. I want you to feel informed and empowered throughout this process. Right now, let's focus on getting these tests done and seeing what they tell us. Would you like me to order those tests for you now?
PATIENT: Alright, alright. You've convinced me. Tests, then. Get them done, see what they say. But promise me, Doctor, promise me you won’t rush into anything. I’m an old man, I don’t need any unnecessary poking and prodding. And if it’s nothing serious… you owe me a good strong cup of coffee. My wife always says I deserve it.
DOCTOR: I absolutely promise, Mr. Segretto. We won’t rush into anything. We’ll take a conservative approach and only proceed with further testing if it’s absolutely necessary. Your comfort and well-being are my top priority. And you have my word – if everything turns out to be nothing serious, I’ll gladly treat you to a good strong cup of coffee. I’ll just have the nurse draw some blood for the PSA test and collect a urine sample. Do you have any questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No, I think that's all for now. Just… get it over with, please. And try to be gentle with the needle, alright? I’m not the biggest fan of needles. And tell your nurse I appreciate a kind hand. It makes all the difference, you know? A little kindness goes a long way.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Segretto. I’ll let the nurse know to be as gentle as possible. I’ll just step out and let her come in. She’ll explain everything to you before she starts. I'll be back shortly to discuss the results of these tests with you as soon as they are available. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
