DOCTOR: Good morning, Margret. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Finco. Now, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is nice to meet you too. I… I have been having some trouble with my breathing. It makes a whistling sound when I try to breathe, especially when I walk. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, trouble with your breathing and a whistling sound, particularly with walking. That is concerning, and it’s good you came to get it checked out. Could you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. It started maybe… two weeks ago? Not very long, but it is getting worse each day. At first, it was just when I climbed the stairs, but now… now it happens when I walk to the store, even on a flat street. It makes me tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s progressively worsened over the last two weeks, starting with stairs and now affecting even flat walking, and causing some fatigue. Do you notice it happening at any other times – like when you’re lying down, or perhaps when you’re exposed to cold air or dust?
PATIENT: That’s right. It is worse when I am outside if it is cold. And… yes, actually. When I clean my house, and there is dust, it gets much, much worse. It makes me cough a lot then, too. When I am resting… it is usually okay. Not much trouble.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s definitely triggered by cold air and dust, and improves with rest. Do you have a cough associated with this, specifically?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Like I said, when the dust is bad. It is a… a little cough, but when I breathe hard, it is a big cough. Sometimes it hurts my chest a little after. It is not every time, but often. Is that… is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s good you're telling me all of this, Margret. Chest pain with coughing warrants attention, so yes, it's good we're discussing it. Now, have you ever been diagnosed with asthma, or any other lung conditions?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I don't think so. I have never been told I have any trouble with my lungs before. I have been very healthy, mostly. Just the usual aches and pains of getting older, you know? My husband… he had some heart trouble, but I… no. Never asthma. I am not sure what that is, even.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Margret. Many people haven't been diagnosed with anything before. Asthma is a condition that affects the airways, making them narrow and causing breathing difficulties. Okay. Let's talk about your medical history a little more broadly. Do you have any other medical conditions I should be aware of – like high blood pressure, diabetes, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Let me think… I do have some trouble with my joints, my knees mostly. The doctor said it was arthritis. And… oh, yes! My blood pressure goes up sometimes. Not very high, but the doctor said I needed to watch it. He gave me a small pill to take when it gets too high, but mostly it is okay. I do not have… di-a-bee-tees? Is that right? No, never that.
DOCTOR: Okay, so arthritis in your knees and occasional high blood pressure, managed with medication. Good. And no history of diabetes. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Many years ago, I had my gallbladder taken out. That was a long time ago. And… my husband, he was very sick, and I stayed in the hospital with him for a long time, but I was not in the hospital for anything myself. Just… visiting him. I have never had any other surgeries, no.
DOCTOR: Okay, gallbladder removal many years ago, and hospital stays for supporting your husband. That’s helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any other medications besides the pill for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Just that one pill, Doctor. For my blood pressure. And sometimes I take a little something for my arthritis when my knees are very sore, but not every day. It is just a little cream I rub on my knees. I do not take any other pills regularly. Do you need to know what it is called? I think it is… Ibuprofen? Or something like that.
DOCTOR: Ibuprofen is good to know, yes. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I do not think so. I have never had a bad reaction to anything. I can eat all sorts of foods, and I have never had a problem with any medicines, as far as I can remember. Sometimes I get a little itchy when I am bitten by a mosquito, but that is not a medicine or food! Just a mosquito. I do not have allergies, I think.
DOCTOR: Alright, that's good to know. Now, let's move on to a quick examination, if you don't mind. I'd like to listen to your lungs and check your breathing. Then we can decide on the best course of action. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. I am a little worried about my breathing, so please… please let me know what you find out. I want to feel better soon.
DOCTOR: Of course, Margret. We will figure this out together. Now, if you could just take a few deep breaths for me while I listen to your lungs. I’m going to listen to your back and then your chest. Please just breathe normally. Okay… I’m hearing some wheezing in your lungs, which is consistent with some narrowing of the airways. Your breathing rate is slightly elevated, but otherwise, your lungs sound relatively clear. I'd like to check your oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter. Your oxygen saturation is 94%, which is within the normal range. Now, can you try to exhale as much air as you can?
PATIENT: Okay… I will try. I am trying, Doctor. Is that enough? It is hard to breathe deeply when I am worried. I feel a little dizzy now.
DOCTOR: Yes, that was good, Margret. It’s alright, you don't need to force it if you're feeling dizzy. That's understandable when you're concerned. Based on what you've told me and what I’ve heard during the examination, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of asthma, possibly triggered by dust and cold air. However, to be certain, and to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to order a simple breathing test called spirometry. It measures how much air you can inhale and exhale, and helps us assess your lung function. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: A breathing test… yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. If it will help you know what is wrong with me, then yes. I want to know what is going on. Is it a painful test? I am a little worried about having trouble breathing during it.
DOCTOR: It's not painful at all, Margret. It just involves breathing into a mouthpiece for a few seconds. It might feel a little tiring, but we can stop at any time if you feel uncomfortable. It won't cause any trouble breathing; it simply measures how you're breathing right now. The technician will explain everything before you start. I'm also going to prescribe a short course of an inhaler to help open your airways and relieve your symptoms in the meantime. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: An inhaler… yes, that sounds good. If it will help me breathe easier, then yes, please. What does it do, exactly? And will it make me feel… funny? I do not want to feel strange, Doctor. I just want to breathe normally again.
DOCTOR: Of course. An inhaler delivers medication directly to your lungs, helping to relax the muscles around your airways and make it easier to breathe. It's a very common treatment for asthma and other breathing problems. The medication is fast-acting, and most people don’t experience any significant side effects. Occasionally, you might feel a little bit of a racing heart or slight jitteriness, but that usually goes away quickly. The technician will show you how to use it correctly, and you can always call the clinic if you have any questions or concerns. Now, let me write you a prescription and get you scheduled for the spirometry test. It's usually done right here in the clinic, and it only takes about 15-20 minutes. In the meantime, avoid dust and cold air as much as possible, and if you feel your breathing getting worse, use the inhaler as directed. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds very good. Avoid dust and cold air… I can do that. I will try to stay inside as much as possible. And I will use the inhaler if I need it. Thank you, Doctor. You have been very kind. I feel better knowing what is going on, and that there is something I can do.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Margret. I’m glad I could help. We will get to the bottom of this, and hopefully, get you breathing comfortably again soon. The nurse will be in shortly to go over the discharge instructions and schedule your spirometry test. Here is a copy of the prescription and a brief summary of what we discussed today. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything else I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that is everything. You have been very thorough, and I feel much better informed. Thank you again for your kindness and patience. I appreciate it very much. I will see you later then, after the test.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Margret. Take care of yourself, and please do call if you need anything at all. We’ll see you soon for the spirometry test. Have a good day. .
