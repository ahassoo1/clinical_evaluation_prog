DOCTOR: Good morning, Ardelle. It’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor... Roseburrough, was it? It's about this tiredness. Just… awful tiredness. I feel like I could sleep for a week and still be worn out. It's been going on for… well, a while now. Honestly, I don't keep track of things like that anymore. My husband usually handles all that sort of business. He said something about blood tests? And… something being high? I didn't really pay much attention.
DOCTOR: Yes, Roseburrough. And that's perfectly alright, Ardelle. It's common to feel overwhelmed. Your husband mentioned blood tests – good, we can certainly look at those. And yes, it sounds like something was flagged. Let's try to get a clearer picture. Just to start, when you say tiredness, can you describe what that feels like?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not just… sleepy. It’s like all my strength is gone. Everything is an effort. Even getting out of bed feels like climbing a mountain. And my muscles… they ache, you know? Not a sharp pain, just… heavy and sore. It's… unpleasant. I used to be so active, always doing something around the house, in the garden… now I mostly just sit. It’s dreadful. I don’t recognize myself anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ardelle. That sounds incredibly frustrating and disheartening. It's good you're telling me all of this. It’s important to know how this is impacting your daily life. And when did you start noticing this loss of strength and tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a difficult question. It wasn't sudden, you see. It sort of… crept up on me. Perhaps six months ago? Maybe longer. Honestly, time just… blurs together. It was after I finished helping my daughter with the renovations, I think. A lot of lifting and carrying, then. But I always helped with things. I can't quite put my finger on when it started being this bad. It’s just… gotten worse, slowly but surely. My husband keeps telling me I need to slow down, but what's the point of slowing down when you have nothing left to give?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ardelle. It's common for things to develop gradually, and pinpointing an exact start date isn't crucial. It sounds like helping your daughter with the renovations might have been a factor, though. Now, besides the tiredness and muscle aches, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My husband says I've been a bit more clumsy lately. Dropping things, bumping into furniture. I hadn’t really noticed myself, to be honest. And… oh, yes. I've been feeling rather weak in my legs. Not like I can't walk, but they feel… shaky sometimes. Especially if I try to stand up quickly. And I suppose… I’ve been a little bit breathless lately, even with just gentle activity. Is that important? I don’t know. I used to be able to walk up the stairs without any trouble, but now… it takes me a few moments to catch my breath at the top. It’s nothing major, though. Just… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ardelle. Clumsiness, leg weakness, and breathlessness – those are all important things to know. It's good you’re telling me everything, even if it seems minor. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Now you’re asking me things I really don’t remember. My husband, he handles all that. I’ve… never been a sickly person, really. I think I had the flu a couple of times, and… oh, yes. I had my gallbladder removed years ago. That was… unpleasant, I recall. But other than that… I honestly don’t know. I’ve always been quite robust. My doctor, back home, he used to say I was a picture of health. I suppose I should have paid more attention, but… well, one doesn’t worry about these things when one is healthy, does one? I take a few vitamins, though. My daughter insists. Something for the bones, I think. And another one for… well, I can’t quite remember.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ardelle. We’ll do our best to piece things together. Knowing you had your gallbladder removed is helpful. And vitamins are good. Now, are you currently taking any prescription medications besides those vitamins?
PATIENT: No, dear, nothing at all. Never have, really. I don’t believe in taking pills unless absolutely necessary. My husband offered me something for my arthritis a few years ago, but I refused. I’d rather just… cope with it. He worries too much, you see. Always trying to fix things. I've always been a strong woman. I don't need pills to get by. Just a good night’s sleep and a bit of sunshine, that’s all I need. Though, admittedly, I haven’t been getting much of either lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ardelle. No current medications. That's good to know. Now, I’m looking at some blood tests that were done six months ago. It looks like your Vitamin D level was quite low, and your B12 was also on the lower side. Your hemoglobin was a bit low as well, which can cause tiredness. These results weren't flagged as immediately concerning at the time, but given your current symptoms, I want to investigate further. Would you be willing to let me do a quick physical examination today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Examinations? I suppose… if you think it’s necessary. I never was fond of doctors poking and prodding, but I understand you’re trying to help. Just… be gentle, alright? I'm not as spry as I used to be. And please don’t make me take off my shoes. I have terrible feet, you see. And I don’t like anyone looking at them. My husband always tells me I have strong ankles, though. He says I get it from my grandmother. She was a very strong woman too. Is it going to take long? I have a tea party with my daughter later this afternoon. I wouldn't want to be late.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ardelle. I’ll be as gentle as possible. No need to remove your shoes, and we’ll keep it as quick as we can. A tea party sounds lovely! First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Just breathe normally. Blood pressure is a little bit on the lower side, 100/60. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit faint. Lungs sound clear, but you're taking slightly deeper breaths than normal. Thyroid feels normal, no swelling. Now, let's check your reflexes. Can you extend your arms for me?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. My arms are a bit stiff, you see. I used to be quite good at gardening, but I haven't been doing much of that lately. It’s just… too much effort. And my joints ache, you see. Be careful, dear. Don’t pull too hard. I don't want to fall. My daughter would be terribly worried. She’s always fussing over me. A very sweet girl, though. She makes the most wonderful cakes. Would you like a cake? I could ask her to bake you one. She makes a lovely lemon drizzle cake. It’s her specialty.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ardelle. Your reflexes are a little slower than I'd expect, but they're still there. And your ankles are a little bit swollen. That can sometimes happen with reduced activity. Your muscles feel a little tender to the touch, especially in your legs. That’s consistent with the aches you’ve been describing. Okay, Ardelle. Based on your symptoms and the physical examination, and looking at your previous blood tests, it seems like you might be experiencing a few things contributing to your tiredness. Your low Vitamin D and B12 levels could be playing a role, and the diminished reflexes and muscle tenderness suggest some possible nerve or muscle issues. The slightly swollen ankles could be related to reduced activity. Given your age and symptoms, I think it's important to rule out a few potential causes. I'd like to order some more blood tests, including a complete blood count to check for anemia, a thyroid function test to rule out thyroid problems, and a Vitamin D and B12 level. I also want to check your kidney function. I might also recommend an electromyography, or EMG, which is a test that can assess the function of your nerves and muscles. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. More blood tests? And… electro-what-now? It all sounds rather frightening, dear. I don’t like tests. They always make me anxious. And what if something is… wrong? I don’t want to know if I’m… poorly. My husband always says I worry too much. He says I should just relax and enjoy my tea parties. Is it absolutely necessary? Could we not just… take some vitamins and see if that helps? I’ve heard vitamins are very good. My daughter insists. She buys me all sorts of vitamins. Perhaps a good night’s sleep would also help. And a nice cup of tea. A very strong cup of tea. It always makes me feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxiety, Ardelle. It's perfectly normal to feel worried about tests, and I wouldn't recommend anything unnecessary. However, these tests will help us understand why you're feeling so tired and weak. Knowing the cause is the first step to feeling better. We can start with the blood tests. They're relatively simple and painless. The electromyography, or EMG, is a more involved test, but it doesn’t cause any lasting harm. We can discuss it further after we get the results of the blood tests. If the blood tests are normal, we can explore other possibilities, and we may not need to do the EMG at all. Taking vitamins is a good idea, and it might help, but it's important to know what vitamins you're deficient in so we can ensure you're getting the right ones. I want to help you feel better, Ardelle, and these tests are the best way to do that. Would you like me to explain the blood tests in a little more detail?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Blood tests it is, then. But please, no poking and prodding. And no electro-what-you-call-it for now. My husband would be terribly upset if I came home all frazzled. He says I need to take it easy. Explain the blood tests, then. But keep it simple, dear. I don’t understand all the medical jargon. Just tell me what they’re looking for. And how long it will take? I have a bridge club meeting on Wednesday. I wouldn’t want to miss that. Mrs. Higgins always makes the most wonderful sandwiches.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ardelle. I'll keep it as simple as possible. We're going to take a small sample of your blood to check a few different things. First, we'll check your complete blood count, or CBC. This tells us how many red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets you have. Low red blood cells can cause tiredness, which is why we're checking for anemia. Then, we'll check your thyroid function, which tells us if your thyroid gland is working properly. Your thyroid gland controls your energy levels, so if it's not working properly, it can cause tiredness and weakness. We'll also check your Vitamin D and B12 levels, as low levels of these vitamins can also cause tiredness. Finally, we'll check your kidney function, as your kidneys help remove waste products from your blood, and if they're not working properly, it can also cause tiredness. The whole process usually takes about 15-20 minutes. The results usually come back within a few days. We can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results and create a plan. You’ll be able to make it to your bridge club meeting on Wednesday without any problem. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, that… doesn't sound too bad. As long as it doesn’t take too long. And you promise I can make it to bridge club? Mrs. Higgins would be terribly disappointed if I missed it. She’s been practicing a new recipe for cucumber sandwiches. Apparently, it’s a family secret. Anemia… thyroid… kidneys… It all sounds rather complicated. I suppose I trust you, dear. You seem like a nice young lady. Just… please be gentle. And tell me if anything is wrong. But not too much detail, alright? I don’t want to get all worked up. Alright, let’s get it over with. Where do I sit? And do I need to take off my shoes? I really don’t like taking off my shoes.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ardelle. We’ll get it over with as quickly and gently as possible. And absolutely no need to take off your shoes! You can keep them on. Just sit comfortably in the chair and relax. We'll just need a small sample of blood from your arm. I’ll use a small needle, and it will only sting for a moment. I’ll have a bandage ready to put on afterwards. Deep breaths, Ardelle. We'll be done in no time. I’ll let you know exactly what I’m doing every step of the way.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. But do be quick, dear. I don’t like needles. Not at all. My husband once had to get a… well, never mind. It wasn’t a pleasant experience. Just… tell me when it’s over, alright? And please, don’t poke too hard. I bruise easily, you see. It’s a family curse. My grandmother used to say… well, never mind. Get it over with, dear. Quickly, now.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ardelle. Just a little pinch now. Deep breath… Just a few seconds more… All done! See?
PATIENT: Oh! That wasn't… too bad. A little pinch, yes, but not dreadful. My husband always makes such a fuss about needles. He's a bit of a drama queen, you see. Is it bleeding? It feels a bit… sticky. And I think I’m a bit dizzy. Perhaps a cup of tea would help. A very strong cup of tea. So, what happens now? Do I need to lie down? Or can I go and have that cup of tea? I really could do with a cup of tea. And perhaps a cucumber sandwich. Mrs. Higgins makes the most wonderful cucumber sandwiches.
DOCTOR: Just a tiny bit of blood, Ardelle, perfectly normal. We can put a little more pressure on it if you like, but it should stop on its own in a few minutes. You’re feeling a little dizzy, you said?
PATIENT: Yes, just a little bit… wobbly, you see. And my stomach feels a bit… strange. Perhaps it’s the excitement. I haven’t had a needle in years. And I haven't had a proper cucumber sandwich in days. Perhaps a lie-down would be best. Just for a few minutes. And a cup of tea, when I feel up to it. A very strong cup of tea. With a biscuit, perhaps? I do love a good biscuit. My daughter makes the most wonderful biscuits. But that's beside the point. I need a lie-down. And a biscuit. And a cup of tea. Are we almost finished here, dear? I do have bridge club later. Mrs. Higgins will be terribly disappointed if I’m late.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ardelle. Let’s get you lying down. You’re perfectly safe, and we'll just take a few minutes to rest. I’ll let the nurse know you’re resting and ask her to bring you a cup of tea and a biscuit. And don’t worry about bridge club. We’ll make sure you’re feeling up to it before you go. Just relax, and breathe deeply. You've been very brave. I’ll be right back with the nurse. Is there anything else I can get you at the moment?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, dear. You're a very kind young lady. A blanket is lovely, thank you. And a cup of tea, yes, that would be wonderful. A very strong cup of tea. And a biscuit, perhaps a ginger biscuit? I do love a ginger biscuit. No, I don't think there's anything else, thank you. Just… let me rest for a few minutes. And please, tell Mrs. Higgins I’m terribly sorry I’m going to be late. She’ll understand, I’m sure. She’s a very understanding woman. And she makes the most wonderful cucumber sandwiches.
