DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Pipolo. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Just…my eyes. They feel real dry. Been that way a bit now. Don't like it much.
DOCTOR: Okay, dry eyes. I understand. And how long has this been going on, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… hard to say exactly. Maybe… a couple months? Maybe longer. Time goes fast when you're old, you know. I just noticed it getting worse lately. Especially when it's windy. We get a lot of wind here.
DOCTOR: Yes, I can imagine the wind doesn’t help. A couple of months, worsening recently… alright. And can you describe the dryness?
PATIENT: It's just… scratchy. Like sand in 'em, almost. And they get tired real quick. I work outside, you see. Cement work. Lots of dust. Could be that. Don't know.
DOCTOR: Okay, scratchy, like sand, and fatigue. And you work with cement, which means exposure to dust. That’s very helpful information. Do you notice any redness, blurry vision, or discharge from your eyes?
PATIENT: Redness… sometimes. Not all the time. Blurry vision, not really. Just when I squint real hard. Discharge? Nope. Nothing comin' out of 'em. Just… dry. Really dry. Can we hurry this up a bit? I got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Pipolo. I'll try to be as efficient as possible. No discharge is good to know. And no significant blurry vision. Let me ask a few more questions, then I’d like to take a quick look at your eyes, if that’s alright. Do you wear glasses or contacts?
PATIENT: Nope. Never needed 'em. Eyes were always good. 'Til now, I guess. Can we just… put some drops in 'em? That's what my neighbor does.
DOCTOR: I understand you’d like to try drops, and we certainly can discuss that. But before we do, I need to get a little more information to make sure we’re addressing the right issue. It’s important to rule out anything more serious. Have you noticed any pain in your eyes?
PATIENT: Pain? Not pain exactly. More like… irritation. Like somethin' is rubbin' on 'em. And if I don't blink for a bit, it gets worse. It's just… uncomfortable. Real uncomfortable. I'm a simple man, Doctor. Just want it to stop botherin' me.
DOCTOR: Alright, irritation, worse with dryness and not blinking. Okay. Have you tried any over-the-counter remedies at all?
PATIENT: Just… blinked a lot. Like I said. And I try to keep outta the wind when I can. That's about it. I ain't one for all them fancy things. Don't know what's even in those drops, anyways. Are you gonna poke me with somethin'? I don't like bein' poked.
DOCTOR: No poking, Mr. Pipolo, I promise. I just need to shine a light in your eyes and take a quick look to assess the surface. It doesn’t hurt. Before we do that, let me quickly review your medical history. I see here you're 83 years old and live locally. Do you have any known medical conditions – like diabetes, arthritis, or high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Nope. Nothin' much. Just… old. The doctor back home used to say I was a tough old bird. Arthritis, maybe, a little in my hands. But I worked through it. Never bothered me too much. High blood pressure… don't think so. Never took no pills for it. Mostly just ate good food and kept movin'. Don’t write too much down. I don’t like my business all over the place.
DOCTOR: Alright, a “tough old bird” with a little arthritis. I appreciate you sharing that. And I understand your concern about privacy - I will keep your information secure. Now, just to confirm, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: Nope. Just… coffee. Black. Strong. That's it. And sometimes a little whiskey, but not much these days. Old age slows you down, you know? Don’t need much to get goin'. Can we get this over with now? My back's startin' to ache.
DOCTOR: Okay, just coffee, occasionally a little whiskey. No other medications. I understand your discomfort, Mr. Pipolo. Let's take a look at your eyes then. Okay, looking at your eyes now… I do see some dryness on the surface of both eyes and a little bit of redness. Your tear ducts seem a little blocked. I don't see anything particularly concerning, but we need to address this dryness. It can cause irritation and even lead to some minor infection if left untreated. Your corneas look clear.
PATIENT: Blocked tear ducts? Is that bad? I don't want nothin' inside me messed with. Can we just try those drops, like my neighbor said? I just want some relief. This is takin' too long.
DOCTOR: Blocked tear ducts can sometimes lead to infection, but it doesn’t always mean anything serious. In your case, it looks mild. And we’re not talking about anything invasive at this point. Yes, we can definitely try lubricating eye drops. I think that's a good first step. We’ll start with preservative-free drops, as they are gentler on the eyes. I’m going to write you a prescription for Systane Ultra Preservative-Free. You’ll put one drop in each eye four times a day. Do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergies? Nope. Never had 'em. Not to pills, not to food, not to nothin'. I eat whatever's in front of me. Tough old bird, remember? Don't get sick easy. Is this gonna cost me much? I ain’t got a lot of money. Don’t like these doctors’ bills.
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about no allergies. And I understand your concern about cost, Mr. Pipolo. I’ll make sure to ask the pharmacy about the most affordable option for the drops. I’ll also write a note for you explaining the cost, if possible. Okay, so that’s a prescription for Systane Ultra Preservative-Free, four times a day. I also recommend avoiding rubbing your eyes as much as possible. And if your eyes don't improve within a week or if they get worse—if you experience any pain, blurred vision, or discharge—please call the clinic right away. Do you have any questions for me?
PATIENT: No questions. Just… get it over with. I got things to do. So I just put these drops in my eyes four times a day, and if they hurt, I call you? That about it? Can I go now? My back’s killin’ me. .
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Pipolo, that’s correct. Four times a day, and call if there’s pain or worsening vision. Here you go. And yes, you can absolutely go now. I'm glad we could address your dry eyes. Please take care and don't hesitate to call if you need anything. Have a good day, Mr. Pipolo.
