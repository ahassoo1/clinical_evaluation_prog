DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Abady. It’s nice to meet you. To begin, could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Is nice to meet you too. Um… my… my nose, it feels… bad. Like… stuffy. For… a little time now. I forget how long. It’s… a sinus problem, I think? My husband, he say I need to come.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Boham. “Stuffy nose for a little time now.” I understand. It’s often difficult to pinpoint exactly when these things start. “A little time now” is helpful, though. To clarify, would you say it’s been a few days, a week, or longer?
PATIENT: Oh… a week, maybe? Or… more? I work… a lot. The time… it goes fast. I don’t… I don’t keep track very good. It’s not… very bad all the time. Just… bothersome. Sometimes it’s hard to breathe when I lay down.
DOCTOR: Okay, a week or more, and it comes and goes. And it’s harder to breathe when you lie down, you mentioned. That's helpful information. Do you have any other symptoms along with the stuffiness and difficulty breathing?
PATIENT: Um… I think… my head, sometimes. A little ache. Not… big pain, just… feels heavy. And… maybe I cough a little. Not much. Just… when I wake up in the morning. I don’t know. It’s hard to say. Everything feels… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: "Fuzzy" is a good way to put it, Ms. Boham. We'll try to clarify things. So, a mild headache and a cough, mostly in the morning. Have you noticed any fever, chills, or body aches?
PATIENT: No… no fever. I don’t think so. And no chills. I work… outside. It’s hot, so I sweat a lot. Maybe that’s why I feel… achey sometimes? I don’t… I don’t usually get sick. My husband, he gets sick easy, but not me. I forget if I feel… cold or hot. Everything is… mixed up.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever or chills. You work outside, which accounts for some sweating and potential muscle aches. It's good you typically don't get sick easily. To get a better understanding, are you experiencing any facial pain or pressure, perhaps around your cheeks or forehead, in addition to the headache?
PATIENT: Facial pain… hmm. Sometimes. Yes, I think… around my cheeks, maybe. When I bend over. Not… all the time. It’s… hard to explain. Like… full. Not hurt, just… full. Like something is… pushing. Do you… understand? I'm sorry if I don't explain it good.
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Boham, I understand perfectly. “Fullness” around the cheeks, especially when bending over. That is very helpful. It sounds like we're leaning towards a sinus issue. Now, let's briefly go over some other things. Have you noticed any changes in your sense of smell or taste?
PATIENT: Smell…? Um… I… I don't know. I work with… machines. It smells like… oil and metal all the time. I forget what things smell like… before. Maybe my smell is not good? I don't pay attention. And taste… I eat what my husband cooks. It taste… normal. I think. Everything is… a little blurry, Doctor. I am sorry.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Ms. Boham. It sounds like the smells from work may be masking any changes in your sense of smell. Now, just to be thorough, have you had any recent cold or flu symptoms, even mild ones, before this started?
PATIENT: Cold…? Um… I don't… remember. Maybe? It was hot. And… dusty. Everyone coughs at work. So… I don't know if I was sick or just… coughing from the dust. I don't think I had a fever, but… everything is mixed up. I’m sorry. I’m not very good at this.
DOCTOR: You're doing just fine, Ms. Boham. It's completely understandable to have trouble remembering details, especially when you're not feeling your best. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, or asthma?
PATIENT: No… nothing. I… I never go to the doctor. My husband, he's healthy. I work… hard. I never have time to be sick. I think… I don’t have anything. Maybe a little ache in my back from work, but… that’s it. My husband, he say I need to be more careful. But… I don't know. Everything feels… okay. Just the nose.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions. And you haven't had any surgeries, have you?
PATIENT: No… never. I… I work with the machines. I fix them. Sometimes I get a little cut, but… nothing big. My husband, he fixes the car. He had a surgery, I think. But not me. Never.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Hmm. No, I don’t think so. I eat everything. My husband, he’s allergic to cats. But not me. I… I don’t remember anything bad happening when I eat or take medicine. I don’t take much medicine. Only… when I have a big headache. But that’s not often. Everything feels… fuzzy. I’m sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Ms. Boham. Just to confirm, what medications do you take, even occasionally, for those headaches?
PATIENT: Um… just… the little white pills. I buy them at the store. For the ache. I don’t know the name. My husband, he buys them. He say they are for headache. I take two, maybe three, when the ache is bad. But not often. Everything feels… mixed up. I am sorry. I forget everything.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Boham. Don’t worry about remembering the name. We can often figure it out later. Now, let's talk about your family. Do you know of any significant medical conditions that run in your family, such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer?
PATIENT: Um… My mama, she… she died when I was little. I don’t… I don’t remember. My papa, he… he worked hard. He was strong. I think he had… a bad heart, maybe? He coughed a lot. My husband, he say my family is strong. But… I don’t know. Everything feels… fuzzy. I am sorry. I forget.
DOCTOR: That's quite alright, Ms. Boham. It sounds like your father may have had some heart issues. Now, I’m going to ask a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No… no smoking. My papa, he smoked, but not me. And no alcohol. My husband, he drinks a little beer, but not me. And… no drugs. I work hard. I don’t have time for… those things. Everything feels… heavy. I’m sorry if I don’t explain it good. Everything is… mixed up.
DOCTOR: You’re doing perfectly fine, Ms. Boham. Everything you've told me is helpful. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your nose and throat. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes… okay. That’s okay. You listen to my heart. And… look in my nose. I hope… I hope I don’t have anything bad. My husband, he say I need to be careful. Everything feels… heavy. But… okay. Do what you need to do, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Boham. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale slowly. Okay, and now let me take a look at your nose… Hmm… there’s some swelling and redness inside your nose, and some mucus present. Your throat looks a little inflamed as well. Your lungs sound clear, though. Okay. Based on what you’ve told me, and what I’ve found during the exam, it sounds like you're likely experiencing a sinus infection, or sinusitis. The swelling and redness in your nose, along with your symptoms of stuffiness, headache, and facial pressure, are consistent with that diagnosis. Now, we need to determine if it’s a viral or bacterial infection. To do that, I recommend we do a few tests, including a basic blood count and potentially a CT scan of your sinuses, to get a clearer picture. Does that sound alright with you?
PATIENT: Tests…? A… CT scan? What is that? And… blood tests? I don’t like needles. My husband, he say I should be careful. Is… is it bad? I just want… the ache to go away. Everything feels… heavy. I don't know if I can… do those things. Everything feels… mixed up. What if it is… very bad?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Boham. It’s perfectly normal to feel anxious about tests. Let me explain. A CT scan is a painless imaging test that takes detailed pictures of your sinuses. It’s like a more detailed X-ray, and it helps us see if there’s any inflammation or blockage. As for the blood test, it’s a simple procedure where we take a small sample of blood from your arm to check for signs of infection. It's a quick pinch, and over before you know it. The tests will help us determine the best course of treatment. If it’s a viral infection, it will likely resolve on its own with rest and over-the-counter medications. However, if it’s a bacterial infection, we may need to prescribe antibiotics. I want to assure you, we're taking this very seriously, and we'll do everything we can to get you feeling better. We’ll start with the blood test. If the results are concerning, then we'll discuss the CT scan. Does that sound more manageable?
PATIENT: Blood test first…? Okay… just the blood test. But… is it very painful? My husband, he say I’m… I’m not strong. And… I don’t like needles. Everything feels… heavy. If it hurts… I might… faint. Everything feels… mixed up. Is there… anything else we can do? Maybe just… some medicine? Just to make the ache go away? I don't want the CT scan. Everything feels… heavy.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns completely, Ms. Boham. It’s perfectly reasonable to be anxious about the blood test and to want to avoid further testing if possible. Let’s do this: we’ll start with a very conservative approach. I will prescribe a decongestant and a mild pain reliever to help manage your symptoms. We'll see if those provide some relief over the next few days. However, if your symptoms worsen or don't improve within 5 days, it’s crucial we revisit the possibility of the blood test and potentially the CT scan. We need to rule out any serious complications, such as a more severe infection or blockage. In the meantime, I recommend getting plenty of rest, drinking lots of fluids, and avoiding close contact with others who are sick. Does that sound like a plan you're comfortable with?
PATIENT: Rest… and fluids… and… no close contact. Yes… that sounds good. That sounds… manageable. No blood test right now? No… CT scan? Just… rest and medicine? My husband, he will be happy. He say I need to take care of myself. Yes… that sounds good. Is… is there anything else I need to know? Everything feels… heavy. But… that sounds good. Just rest… and medicine. Thank you, Doctor.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Boham. Yes, just rest and medicine for now. I’m going to write you a prescription for a decongestant and a mild pain reliever. It’s important to follow the dosage instructions carefully. If you experience any new symptoms, such as high fever, severe headache, vision changes, or swelling around your eyes, please seek immediate medical attention. And remember, if your symptoms don't improve within 5 days, we’ll need to discuss further testing. I'll also give you a written summary of our conversation and the instructions for your medications. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. You explained everything very good. My husband, he will read the paper too. He’s… very careful. Thank you, Doctor. You are… very kind. Everything feels… a little less heavy now. I will… go home and rest. Thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Boham. It was a pleasure meeting you. Please don’t hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. Get some rest, and I hope you feel better soon. Have a good day, and take care of yourself.
