DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hainley. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Um, it’s this bruising. I’ve been getting bruises really easily lately, and it’s…well, it’s a bit worrying. I’m on a blood thinner, so I figured I should get it checked out, just in case.
DOCTOR: Okay, bruising easily, especially while on a blood thinner, is definitely something we should look into. To start, can you tell me a little more about these bruises?
PATIENT: Sure. They just…appear. Like, I haven’t bumped into anything, or at least not that I remember, and then there’s a bruise. Mostly on my arms and legs, but I think I noticed one on my tummy yesterday. They’re kinda big, bigger than usual, and they’re a really dark purple at first, then they turn…greenish, I guess? It’s been going on for maybe a couple of weeks now, getting worse each week, I think. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Dark purple initially, then greenish…and increasing in frequency over the past couple of weeks. That’s helpful. And you said you’re on a blood thinner—which one are you taking, and for what condition?
PATIENT: Oh, right. It’s…Warfarin, I think that’s how you spell it. The doctor put me on it after I had a blood clot in my leg last year. A deep vein thrombosis, that's what they called it. It was…not fun. I’ve been taking it ever since, regularly. I try to, anyway. Sometimes I forget, but I set alarms now. Honestly, that’s the only reason I remembered to mention it today. I’m usually pretty good with remembering things, but pills are hard!
DOCTOR: Okay, Warfarin for a deep vein thrombosis…and you're diligent about taking it, even with the occasional reminder. Good. We’ll definitely need to consider the Warfarin as a possible factor. Do you know your most recent INR level?
PATIENT: INR level? Oh, goodness. No, I don’t. I think they check it when I go for my regular blood tests, but I never write it down. I just ask if everything’s okay, and they tell me it is, and then I leave. I should probably start writing things down, huh? Sorry, I’m terrible with medical stuff.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all. It’s very common to not remember all those details. We can certainly check your INR today. It’s a simple blood test that tells us how well your Warfarin is working. Besides the bruising, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm…let me think. No, not really. No bleeding gums, no nosebleeds…nothing like that. I haven’t felt particularly tired, or weak, or anything. Just the bruising. Oh! Actually… now that you mention it, I have been getting a few headaches lately. Just mild ones, nothing too bad. They come and go. But I thought that was just…stress, you know? Things have been a bit hectic at work. Is that important?
DOCTOR: Headaches could be relevant, yes. Mild, intermittent headaches alongside the bruising…that's good information. We’ll want to explore that further. Now, let’s go over your medical history a bit more broadly. Do you have any other medical conditions besides the DVT?
PATIENT: Not that I know of. I had the usual childhood stuff – chickenpox, measles, things like that. My blood pressure's been a little high sometimes, but the doctor said it’s okay, just watch my diet. Oh! And I have…arthritis, I guess? In my hands. It doesn’t bother me too much, just a bit stiff in the mornings. That's about it, honestly. No major illnesses or surgeries or anything. I'm pretty healthy for my age, usually.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a history of childhood illnesses, borderline high blood pressure, and some arthritis in your hands. That's helpful. And no previous surgeries?
PATIENT: No, none. I've always been pretty lucky, haven't needed anything like that. Just the usual check-ups and things. I avoid hospitals if I can, honestly. They make me nervous.
DOCTOR: I understand completely. Let’s talk about your family history then. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm…that’s a good question. My mum had…diabetes, I think. And she had heart problems later in life. My dad was pretty healthy, actually. He lived to be 85. My brother has high cholesterol, but that’s about it. No one else that I can think of had anything major. It’s a pretty healthy family, all things considered. Does that help? I don’t really know much about my grandparents, to be honest. They both passed away when I was young.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes and heart problems on your mother’s side, and high cholesterol in your brother. That’s good to know. Now, let’s quickly touch on your social history. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, no! Not me. I don't smoke, never have. And I rarely drink. Maybe a glass of wine with dinner on special occasions, that’s it. Definitely no drugs. I work in information security, so I’m pretty cautious about everything, you know? I don’t need any extra risks.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to know. So, no smoking, minimal alcohol, and no drug use. And you work in information security. Now, just to complete the picture, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I haven’t had any bad reactions to anything. I eat pretty much everything, and I’ve never had a problem with any medications. I’m pretty lucky, honestly. Sometimes I wish I had something to tell you, so we could figure out what’s going on, but… I’m just a normal, healthy woman who’s suddenly bruising a lot. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Ms. Hainley, and you're not being unhelpful at all. It’s helpful to know what isn’t going on as well. Okay, with all of that information, I think it's time to do a brief physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, and take a closer look at the bruises. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to figure out what’s going on. I’m a bit worried, to be honest. It’s just…not normal for me to bruise like this.
DOCTOR: Okay. First, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in...and out...and another one... Good. Everything sounds clear so far. Now, I'm going to feel your abdomen. It may be slightly tender, but please let me know if you feel any sharp pain. No significant tenderness there. Now, let's take a look at these bruises. Could you please point to one on your arm?
PATIENT: Sure. Here. This one appeared about a week ago, I think. I don’t remember hitting it on anything. It’s…it’s a bit sore to the touch, but not terribly painful. Just…there. Like a shadow.
DOCTOR: Okay. It does appear to be a fairly significant bruise, and you're right, there's no immediate sign of trauma. The skin isn’t warm to the touch, and there's no swelling, which is reassuring. Now, let’s look at the one on your leg.
PATIENT: Okay. Here. This one’s a bit newer, maybe three or four days old. I noticed it after I woke up one morning. It’s a little bit itchy, actually. I haven’t done anything to irritate it.
DOCTOR: Okay. Similar presentation to the one on your arm. No warmth, no significant swelling. And you mentioned it’s slightly itchy?
PATIENT: Yes, just a little bit. Not terribly. It’s more of a… nagging itch. I haven't been putting anything on it, just leaving it alone. I figured it would go away on its own, but it hasn't really improved much. It’s just…staying there.
DOCTOR: Okay. Given your history of easy bruising while on Warfarin, the lack of any obvious trauma, and the mild itchiness, I'd like to order a complete blood count and a coagulation panel to assess your overall blood health and how well your Warfarin is working. We’ll also want to rule out any other potential causes for the bruising. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Whatever you need to do. I just want to know what’s going on. I don’t want this to be something serious. A blood test sounds fine. When will I get the results?
DOCTOR: Okay. The lab usually takes about 24 to 48 hours to process the results. We can schedule a follow-up appointment for early next week to discuss them. In the meantime, please continue taking your Warfarin as prescribed. Also, I'm going to give you a list of potential warning signs to watch out for, such as any unusual bleeding, severe headaches, or dizziness. If you experience any of these, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, that makes sense. Unusual bleeding, severe headaches, dizziness… I’ll keep an eye out for those. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you taking the time to look at this. I was starting to get really worried.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Hainley. It's my job to help, and I understand your concern. It’s always best to get these things checked out. Here’s the information about the blood test, and a list of signs to watch out for. If anything changes, or you become concerned, don't hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor Annesley. I’ll schedule the follow-up appointment. I really appreciate your help. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Hainley. Take care, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns. Have a good day.
