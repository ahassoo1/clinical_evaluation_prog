DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Miner, please have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Well, it's my face and legs, mostly. They’re… puffy. Been that way a bit now, I reckon. Not sure why though, never really bothered me enough to come in 'til now, but it’s gettin’ worse, see? Feels… strange.
DOCTOR: Puffy… yes, I see. And when did you first notice this puffiness, Mr. Miner?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Dates… always been terrible with dates. Let me think… It was after… after Agnes passed. Definitely after. Maybe… spring? No, wait. It was warmer than spring, so… summer, maybe? A few months back, I'd say. Hard to keep track when you’re… on your own, you know? Not much to mark the days with anymore.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s easy for time to slip away. Let’s just say a few months ago then. And has the puffiness been getting progressively worse, or has it been fluctuating?
PATIENT: Fluctuating… is that like… going up and down? It’s been… mostly worse, I think. Some days it’s a bit better, especially if I… put my feet up. But then it comes back. And it's not just my feet, it's… all over, really. Face, ankles… makes me look like a balloon, honestly. Not a good look for a man, you know? Especially one who used to be… well, never mind. It's just puffy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been gradually worsening over several months, with some days being better than others, especially with elevation. And you've noticed it in your face and your ankles. Any other symptoms along with the puffiness?
PATIENT: Symptoms… hmm. Let me think. I get a bit… winded, sometimes. Just walking to the mailbox. But I’m not as young as I used to be, so that's probably just… age. And I've been feeling a bit tired, but honestly, who doesn’t feel tired? No, I don't think so. Nothing else really. Just… puffy. It’s annoying, that’s what it is. Makes my rings tight, you see? Can't even take 'em off sometimes.
DOCTOR: Alright. Shortness of breath with exertion and fatigue… noted. And the rings feeling tighter is a good observation. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urine?
PATIENT: Urine? What do you mean, changes? It… goes in the toilet, same as always. Look, I’m a welder, not a doctor. I don’t pay attention to… that sort of thing. Is it supposed to look different? It's yellow, I guess. Sometimes darker, sometimes lighter. Depends on how much water I drink, probably. Honestly, I don't really look at it. It's just… waste, you know? Sorry. I'm not very helpful with this medical stuff.
DOCTOR: No, that’s perfectly alright, Mr. Miner. I understand. It’s not something everyone thinks about. Just trying to get a complete picture. Now, do you have any history of kidney problems, or has anyone in your family had kidney issues?
PATIENT: Kidney problems? Not that I know of. Agnes… she had her gallbladder out, I think. And her knees were bad. But kidneys… no. My father… he was a strong man, worked on the farm his whole life. Never a sick day. Mother… she was always a bit frail, but I don't recall anything about kidneys. No, I don't think so. We weren’t really the type to talk about… insides, you know? More concerned with keeping the roof over our heads and food on the table. .
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you currently taking any medications, Mr. Miner?
