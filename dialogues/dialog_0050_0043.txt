DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. My name is Dr. Paraskevopoulos. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, please tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, I've got this headache, right here at the back of my head. It’s been botherin’ me for… oh, I'd say a couple weeks now, maybe a little longer. Not terrible, but constant. It just… is there.
DOCTOR: A constant headache for a couple of weeks, localized to the back of the head. I see. And would you characterize this as a sharp pain, a dull ache, throbbing, or something else entirely?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not sharp, definitely not. It’s more of a… dull ache, I guess. Like a weight sittin’ there. And sometimes it feels a little tight, almost like a band around my head. It doesn’t pulse, if that makes sense. Just… there. Steady.
DOCTOR: A dull, steady ache, perhaps with a sensation of tightness, not throbbing. And has anything, to your knowledge, made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Well, nothin’ really makes it better, not that I've noticed. Layin' down doesn’t really change it, and neither does sittin' up. Seems the same either way. Now, I think maybe when I’m really stressed, it feels a little worse. But honestly, at my age, somethin’s always stressin’ me out! It's hard to tell, you know?
DOCTOR: So, no consistent alleviating factors. You suspect a correlation with stress, though difficult to quantify. I understand. Now, aside from the headache itself, have you experienced any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Let me think… No fever, no blurry vision, nothin’ like that. No dizziness. Sometimes my neck feels a little stiff, now that you mention it. But I figured that was just from sleepin' funny. I haven't been sick to my stomach or anything. Just the headache and the occasional stiff neck. I'm still eatin' okay, drinkin' plenty of water. Oh, and maybe a little tired lately, but who isn’t at my age?
DOCTOR: No fever, no visual disturbances, no nausea or vomiting. Occasional neck stiffness and some fatigue. I see. Now, let's move on to a bit more background. Do you have any significant past medical history I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Well, I had my appendix taken out when I was a young man, back in… oh, must be sixty years ago now. And I broke my wrist a few years back, fell off a ladder while trimmin' the apple tree. Apart from that, I've been pretty lucky, I think. No serious illnesses, nothin' major. I used to get really bad allergies when I was a kid, but those cleared up as I got older. Nothing else comes to mind, really.
DOCTOR: Alright. Appendix removed long ago, and a wrist fracture. No other significant medical history. Have you had any surgeries besides the appendix and the wrist?
PATIENT: No, sir. Just those two. I've always been pretty good about avoidin' the hospital, if I could help it. My mama always said fresh air and hard work were the best medicine, and I reckon she was right more often than not. I've had a few stitches here and there, scrapes and bruises mostly, but no full-blown operations.
DOCTOR: No other surgical history. Now, regarding family history—are there any medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. My mama lived to be eighty-five, and she was pretty healthy right up until the end, just… wore out, I guess. My papa had high blood pressure towards the end of his life. And my sister… she had some trouble with her heart, but that was a long time ago. She passed away when she was pretty young. Beyond that, I don't really know much about the family medical history. We didn’t really talk about it much when I was growin' up.
DOCTOR: Mother lived to eighty-five with good health. Father had hypertension. Sister had cardiac issues. Limited information beyond that. Now, could you tell me a bit about your current social habits?
PATIENT: Well, I live alone now, ever since my wife passed. I have a couple of kids, grown up and moved away, got families of their own. I see ‘em when I can, holidays and birthdays, mostly. I try to stay busy. I used to garden a lot, but my back ain’t what it used to be. I do a little bit of fishin’ when the weather’s nice. And I try to get out for a walk every day, just around the neighborhood. Mostly I just… keep myself occupied. I ain't much of a social butterfly, never was.
DOCTOR: Lives alone, children grown and living elsewhere. Some fishing and walking when able. Now, finally, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, and are you currently taking any medications at all?
PATIENT: No allergies that I know of. I've never had a bad reaction to anything. And no, I don’t take any medications right now. Haven’t needed any, knock on wood. I've always been one to avoid pills if I could, prefer to let nature take its course, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: Very good. Thank you for providing me with all of that information, Mr. Gibbel. Now, I'd like to do a brief physical examination to get a better understanding of what might be causing your headache. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, sir, that sounds fine. Whatever you think is best. I trust your judgement. Just let me know if somethin’ feels uncomfortable. I’m ready when you are.
DOCTOR: Alright. If you don’t mind, I'm going to check your reflexes, strength, and coordination. Also, I'll palpate your neck and scalp for tenderness. First, let’s start with your reflexes. Please relax your arms at your sides. Your reflexes are normal and equal on both sides. Now, I'd like you to squeeze my hands as tightly as you can. Good grip strength. And finally, I'm going to check your range of motion in your neck. Please turn your head slowly to the left, and then to the right. There’s some slight stiffness and tenderness in the muscles at the back of your neck, particularly when you extend your head. No tenderness in the scalp.
PATIENT: Okay. That all sounds… normal enough, I suppose. My neck has been a little stiff lately, so that doesn’t surprise me. Is that… bad? Is somethin’ seriously wrong? I'm startin’ to get a little worried now.
DOCTOR: Please don’t be alarmed, Mr. Gibbel. These findings are not necessarily indicative of anything serious. The mild stiffness and tenderness in your neck muscles could be due to muscle strain, possibly related to stress or simply age-related changes. However, given your age and the persistence of your headache, it’s important to rule out other possibilities. To do that, I’d like to order a simple blood test to check for inflammation and rule out any underlying medical conditions. Also, I recommend a CT scan of your head, just to get a clear picture of what's going on and ensure there are no structural abnormalities. Do you have any questions about these tests?
PATIENT: A CT scan… that sounds… serious. Is that somethin’ you really need to do? I’ve never had one of those before. I'm a little worried about all this radiation. And the blood test is fine, I suppose, but a CT scan… What are you lookin' for, exactly? Is it somethin' bad? And… how much will all this cost? I'm on a fixed income, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Gibbel, and they are perfectly valid. A CT scan is a relatively quick and painless procedure, and while there is a small amount of radiation involved, the benefits of ruling out any serious underlying causes for your headache far outweigh the risks in this case. We use the lowest dose of radiation possible. Regarding what we're looking for, we want to ensure there are no signs of a tumor, aneurysm, or any other structural abnormalities that could be causing your headache. We'll also be looking for any signs of inflammation or bleeding in the brain. As for the cost, that's a very important concern. I'll have the billing department contact you directly with a detailed estimate before proceeding with any tests. We can also explore options for financial assistance if needed. I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to make this as affordable as possible. Would you like me to explain the procedure in more detail, or would you like me to contact a financial counselor to discuss your options?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, that sounds a little better, knowin’ you'll tell me how much it costs. And explainin’ the scan a little more would be good, I suppose. What does it actually… feel like? Will it be loud? Will I have to lie still for a long time? I get claustrophobic sometimes, just thinkin’ about bein’ closed in. I don’t want to panic or anything. Just tell me what to expect.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I understand your concerns about claustrophobia, and we can definitely take steps to make you comfortable during the scan. The CT scan machine is a large, donut-shaped device. You'll lie on a table that slides into the opening of the machine. It’s a relatively narrow opening, but we can adjust the table to ensure you’re comfortable, and we can even provide a blanket or pillow if you’d like. During the scan, the machine will rotate around your head, taking a series of X-ray images. You’ll need to lie still for about 5-10 minutes to ensure the images are clear. It will be a little loud – it sounds like a whirring or clicking noise – but we'll provide you with earplugs or headphones to help minimize the sound. A technician will be with you throughout the entire procedure, monitoring your comfort and ensuring your safety. You'll be able to communicate with them at any time. We can also offer a mild sedative if you're particularly anxious, but that’s something we would discuss further before the procedure. Does that sound more manageable?
PATIENT: Okay… that actually doesn’t sound too bad. A little noisy, maybe, but manageable. I reckon I can handle ten minutes. And knowin’ someone’s there, watchin’ me… that’s good. And the earplugs are a good idea. Alright. Let’s go ahead and schedule the scan, then. And please, do make sure someone explains the cost to me beforehand. I don’t want any surprises. I just want to get this headache figured out.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Gibbel. I will schedule the CT scan for you right away. The scheduling department will contact you to confirm a convenient date and time. And I will personally ensure that the billing department reaches out to you with a detailed cost estimate before the procedure. In the meantime, I'm going to write you a prescription for a mild pain reliever to help manage your headache while we await the scan results. It’s not a long-term solution, but it should provide some relief. I also want you to monitor your symptoms closely. If you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as fever, vision changes, weakness, or confusion, please seek immediate medical attention. We’ll get to the bottom of this, Mr. Gibbel. And we’ll do it together. Is there anything else I can address for you today?
PATIENT: No, I reckon that’s everything for now. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate you takin’ the time to explain everything so thoroughly. It’s put my mind at ease a little bit, knowin’ what to expect. And thank you for writin’ the prescription. Hopefully, that’ll take the edge off until we get the scan done. I'll be sure to call if anything changes.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Gibbel. It was my pleasure. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns at all. I wish you all the best, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. Have a good day.
