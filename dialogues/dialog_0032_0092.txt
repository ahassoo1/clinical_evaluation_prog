DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. I’m Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you’re eighty-three years young. Welcome to the clinic. Now, to start, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Eighty-three, huh? Feels like yesterday I was… well, never mind. This breathin’… it’s been gettin’ worse. And my mouth feels like the Sahara Desert, you know? And my eyes… scratchy. Real scratchy. I don’t know what’s happenin’. It just… is.
DOCTOR: “Just is,” hmm. Well, that’s not terribly helpful, is it?
PATIENT: Hey now! Don't you get smart with me, young lady. What do you want me to say? I told you, I'm breathin' bad and feelin' dry. What more do you need? I ain’t a doctor, I fix traffic lights! I know how to keep cars movin’, not what’s happenin’ inside me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I understand your frustration. However, to provide you with appropriate care, I do need more information. Saying your breathing is “bad” and you feel “dry” is… imprecise. Let's start with the breathing. How long has it been getting worse?
PATIENT: Worse… hmm. A while now. Months, I guess. Maybe longer. It’s… gradual. Like a slow leak in a tire, you know? You don't notice it right away, but then suddenly you’re stuck on the side of the road. I used to be able to walk to the store, no problem. Now… I get winded just gettin' the mail. It’s a nuisance, really. And it's hot out. Makes it worse.
DOCTOR: So, months of progressively worsening shortness of breath, exacerbated by heat. And you mention difficulty walking even short distances. Do you experience any wheezing or coughing with this shortness of breath?
PATIENT: Wheezin’? Coughin’? Not much, no. Sometimes a little tickle in my throat. But no big coughin’ fits or nothin’. Mostly it's just… hard to get the air. Feels like I’m breathin’ through a straw. And it ain’t gettin’ better. That’s the problem! I don’t understand why it ain’t just… fixin’ itself. Things used to fix themselves.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, the human body is not a traffic light. It doesn’t simply… correct itself. Alright. Let's move on. Besides the breathing and the dryness, have you noticed any swelling in your ankles or feet?
PATIENT: Swelling? Now that you mention it… maybe a little. My shoes have been feelin’ kinda tight lately. I thought it was just my feet gettin’ old. You know, spreadin' out. Never thought it was… somethin’ else. I don’t pay much attention to my feet. It’s not important.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about your medical history?
PATIENT: Medical history? What’s to tell? I worked on traffic lights for fifty years, didn't break no bones, and I never been one for fancy doctors or hospitals. Maybe a cold now and then, a little flu… I take some pills for my pressure, somethin’ the old doc gave me. That’s about it. Not much to write home about. Honestly, I feel like I'm being interrogated here.
DOCTOR: It is necessary to understand your complete health picture, Mr. Guilds. You said you take pills for your pressure. Do you know the name of the medication, and what dosage you take?
PATIENT: Medication… name… Ugh. They just give me little white pills. I take ‘em every mornin’. How am I supposed to remember the name? They all look the same! The old doc, he just told me to take one a day. I think it started with a… with a “H”? Or maybe a “P”? I don't know! This is ridiculous. I just want somethin’ to help me breathe.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let me check your electronic medical record. Ah. It appears you are taking hydrochlorothiazide, 25 milligrams daily, for hypertension. And it also indicates a history of mild chronic bronchitis, though it hasn't been updated in several years. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hydro… whatchamacallit? See! That’s what I mean! Never remember those fancy names. And allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat just about anything. Used to be allergic to paperwork, workin’ for the city, but that ain’t a real allergy. I don’t go around sniffin’ flowers or nothin’. Just give me a steak and a cold beer, I’m happy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'd like to perform a brief physical exam. I’ll listen to your lungs, check your heart rate and blood pressure, and examine your extremities. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine, fine. Get it over with. I got things to do. But don't go pokin' around too much. I ain't a fan of bein' messed with. And be quick about it, will ya?
DOCTOR: Alright. Please take a deep breath for me, in through your nose, and exhale slowly through your mouth. Hmm. There are some mild wheezes in both lung fields, particularly at the bases. Blood pressure is slightly elevated at 148 over 92. Pulse is regular but a bit fast at 88. There is some mild pitting edema in both ankles, as you mentioned. And your oxygen saturation is 92% on room air, which is a little low. Now, based on your symptoms and this initial exam, it appears you may be experiencing a flare-up of your chronic bronchitis, potentially complicated by early signs of fluid retention. We need to run some further tests to rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a chest X-ray and a basic metabolic panel to check your kidney function and electrolyte levels. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: X-ray? Metabolic… what now? What's all this mess? Look, I ain’t a complicated man. I just want to be able to breathe without feelin’ like I’m drownin’. You stickin’ needles in me now? I don’t like needles. And I ain't payin' for fancy tests I don't understand! Is there somethin' simple you can just give me to make it stop? Like a good inhaler, maybe? I heard those work. Don't need all this… fuss.
DOCTOR: Mr. Guilds, I understand your reluctance, but I cannot simply guess at a diagnosis and prescribe medication without proper investigation. An inhaler might provide temporary relief, but it won’t address the underlying cause of your breathing difficulties. The chest X-ray and blood work are essential to determine the severity of your condition and rule out more serious problems like heart failure or pneumonia. The blood draw will only require a small sample, and it is a standard procedure. I strongly recommend proceeding with these tests. However, if you absolutely refuse, I can prescribe a trial of a bronchodilator inhaler. But please be aware that this is not a long-term solution and may mask a more serious underlying condition. Which course of action would you prefer?
PATIENT: Ugh. Fine. Fine! Do the blood work. But no pokin’ and proddin’ more than you have to. And get it over with fast. I’m not spendin’ all day in here. And I want that inhaler now. Just in case. Maybe that’ll fix it, and I won't need all those fancy tests after all. But make it quick. I got a lawn to mow. And no funny business.
DOCTOR: Very well. I will order the blood work and write a prescription for a bronchodilator inhaler, albuterol, two puffs every four to six hours as needed for shortness of breath. The lab technician will be in shortly to draw the sample. A nurse will also provide you with instructions on how to use the inhaler correctly. Please call the office if you experience any adverse reactions or if your symptoms worsen. Now, is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No. Just get it done. And make sure that nurse shows me how to use that thing properly. I ain't good with complicated gadgets. I think that's all. Finally. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Guilds. I'll have the nurse come in right away. And please, try to rest when you can. .
