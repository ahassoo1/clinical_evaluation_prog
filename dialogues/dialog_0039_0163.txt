DOCTOR: Hello, Mr. Vantine. It's lovely to meet you. I'm Dr. Kamahele. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good afternoon, Doctor. The pleasure is all mine, I assure you. Well, to put it bluntly, I’ve been…experimenting with my diet, shall we say. And I thought it prudent to have a professional opinion before I, ah, push it any further. It's become rather…restrictive, lately.
DOCTOR: Restrictive, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, quite. It began as a simple cleanse, really. A friend – a rather excitable young man involved in motion capture, actually – recommended a…a fruit-only regimen. Now, I’ve always been rather particular about my physique, you see. Years in special effects require a certain…discipline. But this has escalated. Now it's just grapefruit, three times a day. And a small black coffee. It’s…not sustainable, I suspect. And I'm starting to feel a bit…faint.
DOCTOR: Three grapefruits a day…and coffee. I see. And how long have you been on this, shall we say, grapefruit-focused diet, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… It began, properly, on the 17th of July, so… approximately two weeks and a half, now. Though I did have a rather small biscuit on the 21st. A digestive, with a little butter. For medicinal purposes, you understand. A touch of the nerves, with the awards ceremony looming. But apart from that, strictly grapefruit and coffee.
DOCTOR: And you've noticed feeling faint?
PATIENT: Yes, indeed. It began rather subtly, a slight dizziness upon standing. Now, it's… more pronounced. Particularly in the afternoons. And my hands… they tremble a bit. Not constantly, you understand. But enough to make holding a miniature in place for filming… challenging. It's most inconvenient, really. I had to have young Timothy assist me yesterday with the battle sequence. Not ideal, not ideal at all. He's a good lad, but lacks finesse.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Vantine. Let’s have a listen to your heart and lungs, and I'd like to check your blood pressure. Just to get a baseline. Then we can talk a bit more about what's going on. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Perfectly alright, Doctor. I’ve always been rather fond of the medical profession, you know. Remarkable advancements, truly. Though I did assist on a particularly gruesome alien autopsy scene back in '88. Rather unsettling, even with the prosthetics. Proceed, by all means. I trust your assessment implicitly.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a few deep breaths for me, Mr. Vantine. In… and out… Good. Blood pressure is a little low, 90/60. And your heart rate is… a bit fast, 95. Do you feel your heart racing often?
PATIENT: Racing, hmm? Not constantly, Doctor. But I have been aware of it… fluttering, perhaps, in the evenings. Before bed, mostly. I attributed it to excitement, you see. The awards ceremony is rather important. Best Practical Effects, you understand. A category I've dominated for… well, decades, now. But I suppose it could be related to this…grapefruit ordeal. Is that…bad?
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily bad, Mr. Vantine, but it's certainly something we need to address. A low blood pressure and faster heart rate, combined with your restrictive diet… it's likely causing some imbalances. Grapefruit itself isn’t inherently harmful, but eating only grapefruit for over two weeks…your body isn’t getting the nutrients it needs. Have you noticed any muscle weakness, or cramping?
PATIENT: Weakness… yes, actually. My grip isn’t what it used to be. I struggled with the rigging on the miniature spaceship yesterday. Timothy had to assist again. And cramping, a little. In my calves, mostly. Particularly after standing for extended periods. We were filming the desert sequence, you see, and the sand… it's terribly uneven. And my ankles have been a little swollen in the evenings. I dismissed it as the heat, naturally. It has been rather warm. But perhaps…Perhaps it’s more serious than I initially thought.
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Vantine, it sounds like your body is definitely signaling that it needs more than just grapefruit. The muscle weakness, cramping, and swelling… these are all signs of potential electrolyte imbalances and dehydration. Given your age and the length of this diet, we should run some blood tests to check your potassium, sodium, magnesium, and kidney function. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Blood tests… quite alright, Doctor. I suppose I was rather foolish, to be frank. I've always prided myself on my discipline, you see. A rigorous regime is essential for my work. But perhaps I allowed my enthusiasm to… overrule my common sense. Potassium, sodium, magnesium… yes, let’s examine these things. And the kidneys, naturally. A sound working constitution is paramount. Do you have a preference for which laboratory you use? I've had rather mixed experiences in the past. Some are… less discreet than others. It’s a sensitive matter, you understand. Award nominations and all.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, Mr. Vantine. We use a very reputable lab here, and I assure you, they are very discreet. Everything is confidential. I’ll write you a requisition form now. They'll just need a small blood sample. And while we're waiting for the results, I strongly recommend you stop the grapefruit-only diet immediately. It's okay to have some grapefruit, but you need to incorporate other foods – protein, carbohydrates, healthy fats – to restore your body’s balance. Perhaps some soup?
PATIENT: Soup! Excellent suggestion, Doctor. A light broth, perhaps? Chicken, ideally. And definitely stop the grapefruit… immediately. Yes, that sounds sensible. I’ve already begun to feel a little… weak, to be frank. A broth… and then, perhaps, a small piece of fish. Cod, ideally. And do you think… would a biscuit be permissible? A digestive, perhaps? For medicinal purposes, naturally. To stabilize the blood sugar. Just one. A small one.
DOCTOR: One small digestive biscuit wouldn't hurt, Mr. Vantine. We're not aiming for perfection here, just getting you back on track. Soup, fish, and a digestive… that sounds like a very good start. I'll write the requisition for the blood tests now, and we can discuss the results when they come back, usually within a couple of days. In the meantime, if you experience any severe dizziness, chest pain, or difficulty breathing, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any allergies I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve always been rather resilient, you see. A sturdy constitution, inherited from my mother’s side. Though I did have a rather unpleasant reaction to a synthetic latex prosthetic back in ’92. A minor rash, mostly. But nothing life-threatening. No, no allergies, to speak of. And thank you, Doctor. For your patience, and your…discretion. It’s a relief to have a professional opinion. I shall adhere to your recommendations. Soup, fish, and a small digestive. Excellent. Now, about these blood tests…are they terribly painful? I have a rather low tolerance, you see.
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mr. Vantine. It's a very quick prick of the finger, really. A tiny bit of discomfort, but nothing significant. The phlebotomist is very skilled. And we'll have you sitting comfortably the entire time. I'll write down the address of the lab, and a few instructions. Just a few milliliters of blood, that’s all. We're just checking to see what your body needs to get back to feeling its best. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I believe that covers everything, Doctor. You’ve been most thorough, and remarkably patient with my… eccentricities. I appreciate your discretion immensely. And the advice regarding the soup, fish, and digestive… sound. Yes, I think that’s all for now. Thank you again, Doctor Kamahele. I shall look forward to the results, and, of course, the restorative power of a light broth. .
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Vantine. It was a pleasure meeting you, and I’m glad I could help. Don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns. And enjoy your soup! .
