DOCTOR: Right. Well, Gedalya, welcome. So, you're 25...and a bit on the thin side, if I may say so. But, that’s neither here nor there. Let’s get to why you're here today. What brings you in?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Yes, well, it’s… it’s been a bit worrying, honestly. I’ve been feeling weaker, generally. And my eyelids… they’re starting to droop. It's not a huge thing, not yet, but it's definitely noticeable. It's been happening for a few weeks now, I’d say.
DOCTOR: Weakness and drooping eyelids... weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, a few weeks. It started gradually, I didn't really pay much attention at first. Thought I was just tired, you know? But it’s not getting better, and it’s starting to… impact things. Like, I manage a few buildings, facilities work, and it's becoming harder to… well, to do the physical parts, and even focusing is difficult sometimes.
DOCTOR: Facilities work… right. And this difficulty focusing – is that new, or has that been a long-standing issue?
PATIENT: It’s definitely gotten worse recently, Doctor. I wouldn't say it's always been this bad. Before, if I was tired, I’d just have a bit of trouble concentrating. Now… now it’s hard even when I’m rested. It's a little frustrating, to be honest. It feels like… like my brain is a little slow, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: "A little slow," hmm?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s the best way I can describe it. It’s hard to explain. Things don't… click as quickly as they used to. And the weakness... it's not like I can't do things, it’s just… everything takes more effort. Climbing stairs is harder, lifting things… even holding my head up feels tiring sometimes, if I’ve been looking down for a while. I haven't noticed any pain, though.
DOCTOR: No pain… alright. Now, let's go through some basics. Have you had any fever, any unexplained weight loss, any changes in your vision?
PATIENT: No fever, Doctor. And… well, yes, actually. I have lost some weight, I think. I haven't been tracking it exactly, but my clothes are a little looser than they used to be. It hasn’t been drastic, but I’ve noticed. And my vision… no, not really. Everything seems normal there. Maybe a little blurry sometimes, but I always thought I just needed new glasses.
DOCTOR: Unexplained weight loss… and difficulty focusing coupled with the weakness and drooping eyelids… alright. Do you have any family history of neurological problems, muscle weakness, or eye disorders?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. Let me think… My mother, she had some problems with her eyes as she got older, cataracts, I think. And my grandfather, on my father’s side, he had… I don’t know the exact name, something with his nerves, I think it caused some tremors. It wasn’t very bad, but he did have to use a cane later in life. I don’t know if it's relevant, honestly. It was a long time ago, and I wasn’t very close to him.
DOCTOR: Alright. And social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Oh. Um… I’m divorced, as you can see on the chart. I live alone. I don’t really have a lot of close friends. I mostly keep to myself, work a lot. I don’t smoke, I don't use drugs. I drink occasionally, a beer with dinner sometimes, but not much more than that. I haven’t traveled recently. Is there anything specific you’re looking for?
DOCTOR: Just trying to get a complete picture, Gedalya. Now, any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No known allergies. I haven’t really taken much medication in my life, to be honest. A painkiller for a headache now and then, but nothing regularly. I’m usually quite healthy, despite… well, all of this. It's just… concerning, you know? This weakness is starting to interfere with my work, and the drooping eyelids aren't exactly helping my confidence.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, let’s have a look. If you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I’ll check your reflexes, strength, and a basic neurological assessment. Then we’ll see what that tells us. Please sit up and relax.
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. That sounds fine. Relax... right. I will try. It's a little difficult when I'm worried, but I'll do my best. Just let me know if you need me to do anything specific.
DOCTOR: Alright. Look straight ahead. Now, follow my penlight. Good. And now the other eye... Now, I’m going to check your reflexes. Relax your arms. Taps Gedalya's knee with a reflex hammer. Good. And the other leg… Now, squeeze my hands. Tests Gedalya’s grip strength. Squeeze as hard as you can. And now… Tests resistance to shoulder and elbow flexion. Push against my hand. Don’t strain yourself, just resist my force. Observes Gedalya closely during each test, making notes on the chart. Hmmm. Not bad… but certainly some weakness present. Now, I want you to close your eyes and follow my instructions. Can you touch your nose with your index finger?
PATIENT: Yes, I can. There. Is that alright? It feels a little… strange, doing this with my eyes closed.
DOCTOR: Good. Now, quickly tap your fingers together like this. Demonstrates rapidly alternating movements. Keep going. Now, other hand... Observes Gedalya closely. Alright. Now, I’d like you to stand up. Observes Gedalya as he stands and assesses his gait and balance. Walk a few steps for me. Normal pace. Observes Gedalya’s gait. Hmm. Pauses, looking thoughtfully at the chart. It seems we have some notable weakness, particularly in your extremities. And the coordination isn't what it should be. Your gait is… slightly unsteady. Turns back to Gedalya. Now, given your symptoms and the preliminary exam findings, I’m concerned about a possible neuromuscular issue. It could be a number of things, frankly.
PATIENT: Neuromuscular issue… That sounds… serious, Doctor. A number of things? What kind of things? I mean, is it something… curable? Or is this something I’ll have to… live with?
DOCTOR: It’s far too early to say definitively, Gedalya. It could be something relatively benign, like a vitamin deficiency or nerve compression. But given the combination of weakness, drooping eyelids, difficulty concentrating, and the slightly unsteady gait, we need to rule out more serious possibilities. Things like Myasthenia Gravis, certain types of neuropathy, or even, though less likely given your age, a muscular dystrophy. We need to run some blood tests, and I’d like to order an MRI of your brain and spinal cord to get a clearer picture. And frankly, a referral to a neurologist is warranted. I'm not a specialist in neuromuscular disorders. This is beyond the scope of general internal medicine. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, I understand. Blood tests, MRI, neurologist… It sounds like a lot. Myasthenia Gravis… I think I’ve heard of that. Isn’t that… something autoimmune? And muscular dystrophy… that’s… very serious, isn’t it? I… I haven’t noticed any breathing problems or anything like that. Is there anything… anything I should be doing now? Anything to avoid? Should I stop working?
DOCTOR: Yes, you’re right, Myasthenia Gravis is an autoimmune disorder, and muscular dystrophy is a progressive muscle-weakening condition. However, don’t jump to conclusions, Gedalya. We haven't confirmed anything yet. The tests will give us the answers. As for now, yes, it would be prudent to avoid strenuous physical activity. No heavy lifting, no intense exercise. And if you find yourself feeling significantly more fatigued than usual, stop what you’re doing and rest. As for stopping work entirely… that’s a bit premature. But perhaps reduce your workload if possible. We need to get a diagnosis first, then we can discuss a long-term management plan. I'll write you a note for your employer, explaining that you're undergoing medical evaluation and may need to reduce your hours. I’ll have the lab requisition and MRI order ready for you. The MRI facility is located at… provides address and phone number. I'll also schedule a referral to Dr. Eleanor Vance, a highly respected neurologist. Her office will contact you to arrange an appointment. Do you have any questions before I finish this up?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that covers everything. Dr. Vance… I’ll write that down. Reduce workload, no strenuous activity, MRI… Thank you, Doctor. I… I appreciate you taking this seriously. It’s just… a bit overwhelming. How long will it take to get the test results? And the MRI… how long does that take? I just… I want to know what I’m dealing with as soon as possible.
DOCTOR: The blood tests should be back within 3-5 business days. The MRI usually takes a bit longer, as it needs to be reviewed by a radiologist – allow up to a week, perhaps a bit more. Once I have the results, I’ll contact you immediately to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. Dr. Vance will also likely want to repeat some of the tests to confirm the findings. I understand this is unsettling, Gedalya. It’s never easy facing uncertainty. But we’re taking the necessary steps to get to the bottom of this. And remember, a diagnosis isn’t a life sentence. Many neuromuscular conditions are manageable, and treatment options are available. Try not to panic, and focus on taking care of yourself in the meantime. Do you have any other concerns before you go?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s alright. Thank you again, Doctor. For everything. I’ll schedule the MRI and wait for the results. And I’ll try to… reduce my workload. I appreciate your help.
DOCTOR: Alright. Take care, Gedalya. And don't hesitate to contact my office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We'll get this sorted out.
