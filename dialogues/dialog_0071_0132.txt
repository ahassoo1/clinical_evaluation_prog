DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Coby. Welcome. I'm Dr. Galena. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. It's this heat, really. Can't take it like I used to. Used to be able to work all day in the sun, no problem. Now? I'm beat after a couple of hours. It's ridiculous, frankly. A man should be able to handle a bit of warm weather.
DOCTOR: Right, right. The heat… it does get to people. Especially as we get older, our bodies don’t regulate temperature quite the same way. So, you're feeling… more fatigued than usual in this warm weather?
PATIENT: Fatigued is a polite way to put it. I feel… wiped out. And it's not just tired, you understand? It's like… everything feels heavier. Moving is harder. Thinking is harder. It's just… unpleasant. And it’s getting worse every year, I swear. It's not like I’m doing anything different, mind you. Still the same work, still the same hours. Maybe a bit less, if I’m being honest, because I can’t do as much. It's a bit embarrassing, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're recognizing the changes, and it's certainly not something to be embarrassed about. It sounds like this is more than just being a bit tired from the heat. Can you tell me a little more about when this started?
PATIENT: Hmm. When did it start… that’s a good question. It wasn't sudden, you see. It sort of crept up on me. Maybe… five years ago? Six? I started noticing I needed more breaks during the day. Then the breaks got longer. Then I started… well, I started avoiding the hottest part of the day altogether. Just… common sense, really. But it's still happening, even with the precautions. And like I said, it's getting worse each summer. I just want to be able to get on with things, you know? I don't want to be stuck inside like some… some houseplant.
DOCTOR: Okay, so gradually worsening over five or six years, primarily in the warmer months. And avoiding the heat helps a little, but doesn't resolve it completely. Besides the fatigue and feeling heavier, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. I get a bit… lightheaded sometimes. Not enough to fall or anything, just a bit woozy. And I’ve been… thirstier than usual, I suppose. Always have a bottle of water with me now, which isn’t a bad thing, I guess. Oh, and my skin… well, it gets really flushed. Red as a beet, sometimes. But that could just be the sun, couldn't it? I mean, I am still working outdoors, despite trying to be careful.
DOCTOR: Lightheadedness, increased thirst, and flushing… those are all things we need to consider. Just to get a clearer picture, can you describe the lightheadedness?
PATIENT: It's not like a spinning feeling, if that makes sense. More like… everything dims a bit. And I feel a bit shaky. It usually happens when I've been working hard in the sun for a while. If I sit down and have a drink, it usually goes away pretty quickly. But it’s happening more often now, even when I am taking breaks. It’s… frustrating. I used to be able to push through things, you know? Now I feel like I’m always waiting for the next spell. It’s not a good feeling. Not good at all.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s a dimming sensation, shakiness, and it’s triggered by exertion, especially in the heat. And it’s becoming more frequent despite taking breaks. Now, have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Urination? What do you mean? More or less? It’s… normal, I suppose. I mean, I go when I need to go. Haven’t been running to the bathroom all night or anything. And the colour seems alright. No blood or anything alarming. Though I have noticed I’m drinking a lot more water, so I suppose I’m going more often. Does that count? Honestly, Doctor, I’m a practical man. I don’t spend a lot of time analyzing my… bodily functions.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. Increased frequency due to increased intake is good to know. Now, let’s talk about your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… hmm. Well, the doctor told me years ago my blood pressure was a little high, but he put me on some pills for it. I took them for a while, but then he said it was alright to stop. Said I was keeping it under control with my diet. And my knees… they ache, naturally. Working outdoors all these years, it does a number on you. But that’s just old age, isn’t it? Nothing serious. Other than that… I’ve been pretty healthy, all things considered. A few colds here and there, but nothing that put me in the hospital.
DOCTOR: Alright, so a history of elevated blood pressure, managed with diet, and some knee pain. Do you take any medications currently, even over-the-counter ones?
PATIENT: No, nothing. Stopped taking the blood pressure pills years ago, like I said. And I don't bother with those over-the-counter things. They never seem to do much good. If I get a headache, I just rest. If my knees ache, I just… ignore it. A man’s got things to do, Doctor, can’t spend all day popping pills. It’s all about willpower, really. And common sense.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, regarding allergies, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no. Not that I know of. I've eaten all sorts of things over the years, travelled a bit. Never had a reaction to anything. And I’ve never been bothered by pollen or dust or anything like that. My wife… well, she was allergic to everything, poor woman. But I seem to have gotten lucky in that department. No allergies. Not a one.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. Now, a few questions about your family history. Do you have any family members with conditions like heart disease, diabetes, or kidney problems?
PATIENT: Family history… that’s a tricky one. My father… he worked hard all his life, like I said. Died young, really. Heart attack, I think. But that was a long time ago, and they didn’t have the fancy tests they have now. My mother… she lived a long life, but she wasn't very healthy towards the end. Lots of aches and pains, mostly. She never went to the doctor much, didn't trust them. And I had a brother… he had problems with his feet, always complaining about swelling. But that’s about it, really. Not much in the way of serious illnesses in the family, if you ask me. Mostly just… hard-working people who lived long lives and didn’t bother with doctors.
DOCTOR: Alright, father with a heart attack, mother with aches and pains, and brother with swelling in the feet. And finally, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? Well, I work, as you know. Painter, construction, maintenance… keeps me busy. I live alone, have my own place. I cook for myself, mostly simple things. I don't drink much alcohol, maybe a beer with dinner now and then. Don't smoke, never have. And I try to get a bit of exercise, walking when I can. I used to go fishing more often, but haven't had the time lately. It’s a simple life, really. Not much excitement. But it keeps me going. It's a practical life. And I like it that way.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Coby. Thank you for that information. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam, just to get a better understanding of what’s going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, alright. Go ahead. Though I doubt you'll find anything. I’ve always been a strong, healthy man. But I suppose it can’t hurt. Just… don’t take too long, Doctor. I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Certainly. If you could just step over here, we’ll start with your blood pressure. Now, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs as well. Please try to breathe deeply and normally. Hmm. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. Not alarmingly high, but something we'll want to keep an eye on. Heart sounds are regular, but a bit… distant. Lungs are clear, though. Abdomen is soft, no tenderness. Pulses are a bit weak in your feet. Now, I'm going to check your skin’s elasticity. Skin turgor is a little diminished. That means your skin doesn't bounce back as quickly as it should. It's not a major concern, but it can be a sign of dehydration. Alright. That's all for the physical exam.
PATIENT: Dehydration? I drink plenty of water. Like I said, always have a bottle with me. Honestly, Doctor, I think you're looking too much into this. I’m a practical man. I know my body. I’m just feeling a bit worn down, that’s all. It’s the heat, probably. Or maybe I’m just getting old. What do you think is going on? And what do you propose we do about it? I haven’t got all day.
DOCTOR: I understand your skepticism, Mr. Coby. And you're right, it could be a combination of factors - the heat, age, and exertion. However, based on your symptoms and the physical exam findings - the elevated blood pressure, weak pulses, and diminished skin turgor - I’m concerned about possible dehydration and some underlying circulatory issues. The diminished skin turgor is a clue, even if you're drinking water, it indicates your body isn't utilizing it as efficiently as it should. Now, I'd like to order some blood tests to get a better understanding of your kidney function, electrolyte levels, and overall hydration status. We’ll also check your blood count. Additionally, I think an EKG would be a good idea to assess your heart rhythm. And, just to be safe, I’d like to rule out any underlying heart condition. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Blood tests, EKG… It's always something with doctors, isn't it? Look, I appreciate you taking the time, but I’m not keen on spending all day in a lab. I’ve got work to do. Alright, fine. Blood tests, I suppose. But no EKG. I don’t need to be poked and prodded with machines. I’m a practical man, Doctor. I know when something is wrong. And right now, I just feel a bit worn down. Can we at least get this blood test done quickly? And what about the dehydration? What do you recommend I do about that, besides drinking more water?
DOCTOR: Alright, we can skip the EKG for now. However, I strongly recommend reconsidering that in the future if your symptoms worsen. As for the dehydration, increasing your water intake is important, but it’s not always enough. You might also benefit from incorporating electrolytes into your diet – things like sports drinks, coconut water, or even just adding a pinch of salt to your water. Avoiding excessive caffeine and alcohol can help as well, as they can be dehydrating. And, crucially, it's important to avoid prolonged exertion in the heat. Take frequent breaks, seek shade, and listen to your body. I’ll write you a requisition for the blood tests. The lab is just down the hall. Once we have the results, we can discuss them and determine the best course of action. It usually takes a couple of days to get the results back. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, no questions. Just… get the tests done quickly, alright? And try not to find too many things wrong with me, Doctor. I haven’t got time for all that. I’ll see you when the results come back.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Coby. Take care of yourself. .
