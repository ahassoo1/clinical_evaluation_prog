DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Genard. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Quicksey. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello dear. It's... something down there. A little... wet. Not supposed to be, you know? I don’t know what it is. It’s embarrassing, really. Young men problems, I think. My nephew, he... well, never mind. It's just... icky.
DOCTOR: I understand it can be difficult to discuss these things, Ms. Genard, and you're not alone. Many women experience changes as they get older. It's good you came in to get it checked out. When you say “down there”, are you referring to your vagina?
PATIENT: Vagina? Is that what they call it now? It’s… no, not there. Lower. More… boy parts area. This is about a man. A young man, I tell you. It's his problem, not mine! Though… I might have touched it. Accidentally. While cleaning. Oh dear. This is silly.
DOCTOR: I see. So, you're concerned about a potential issue with a young man, and you may have had some contact with the area while cleaning?
PATIENT: Yes! That’s right. Cleaning. He… well, he’s not very good at keeping things tidy. And now something is leaking. It’s not right. Makes me worried he got something. I don't know what it is, but it’s… yellow. And smells funny. I don’t want to catch it! I’m too old for that nonsense.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Genard. It sounds like you’re concerned about a young man you know who has a yellow discharge, and you are worried about the possibility of a sexually transmitted infection. Is this young man your son, grandson, or another relative?
PATIENT: Oh, no, no. Not family. Just a... a helper. I hired him to do some work around the yard. Good boy, really. But not very bright. He probably picked it up somewhere. I don’t know where young men get these things. This is why you don’t trust anyone these days! It’s… irresponsible, that’s what it is. And now I’m worried!
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Ms. Genard. It's good you're being cautious. Since you've had some contact with the area, it's important to assess the situation carefully. Have you noticed any symptoms yourself, such as burning, itching, or unusual discharge?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, it is a little itchy. Down there. Not a lot, just a little… annoyance. I thought it was just from the heat. Guam is hot, you know. Always sticky. And maybe a little sore. But I mostly just worry about him. He’s probably too embarrassed to go to a doctor. Young men are like that, all proud and foolish. So I have to take care of it. This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you're paying attention to your own health as well. Since you're experiencing some itching and soreness, it’s important to rule out any potential infection in yourself. To do that, I’d like to ask you a few more questions, and then I'll need to do a quick examination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Examination? Oh dear. I don't like the sound of that. Is it… painful? And what if I have something terrible? I’m too old for terrible things. I just want to know if the boy is okay. Can’t you just tell me that? Is he going to be alright? And can you promise you won’t tell anyone? This is very private.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Ms. Genard. Let me assure you, the examination will be as gentle and comfortable as possible. We will only do what is necessary to get a clear understanding of what's going on. It's likely we'll just need to take a quick look and possibly take a swab for testing. As for the testing, it's standard procedure and will help us determine if there's an infection present. And absolutely, everything we discuss here is completely confidential. Your privacy is my utmost priority. Before we proceed with the examination, I need to ask a few more questions to get a complete picture. Then, we can discuss the best course of action. First, can you tell me when you first noticed the itching and soreness?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A swab? Like… taking something out? No, no, I don’t want anything taken out! It just started… a few days ago. Maybe three? After he was working in the yard. He was digging a lot, and… well, I was helping him clean up afterwards. I touched… everything. Honestly, I should have worn gloves. But I didn’t think… You know, young men and their messes. It wasn't much at first, just a little uncomfortable. Now it’s a bit more… noticeable. And I keep worrying.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Genard. The swab is very quick and gentle, it doesn't involve removing anything, just collecting a small sample for testing. It will help us identify what's causing the irritation. It sounds like the symptoms started a few days ago, after you were cleaning up with him in the yard. To clarify, when you say “irritation,” is it just the itching and soreness, or are you experiencing any burning, unusual odor, or discharge yourself?
PATIENT: Well… there is a smell. Not a very nice smell. Sort of… fishy. And it's getting worse, I think. And the discharge... yes, a little. It's not much, but it's definitely not normal. It's sort of… yellow-ish. Like… what he had. Oh dear. Am I getting what he has? This is terrible! I should have just left him alone in the yard! This is all my fault.
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Genard. It sounds like you may be experiencing a vaginal infection, possibly related to your contact with the young man. The discharge and odor you're describing are common symptoms. It's not necessarily your fault, and it's very common for these things to happen. The good news is, vaginal infections are usually easily treatable. To confirm the diagnosis and recommend the best course of treatment, I would like to perform a quick physical exam. This will involve a visual inspection and a swab to collect a sample. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. A visual inspection? Does that mean... looking down there? I'm too old for that. Too embarrassed. Really, I just want to know if he's alright. Is it something serious? Can you just tell me that? Maybe he just needs some soap and water. Young men are messy, you know. A little dirt never hurt anyone. But if it's serious… oh dear. I don’t want to go through with any of this. It's just too… invasive. .
DOCTOR: Ms. Genard, I completely understand your discomfort and embarrassment. Your comfort is my priority. If you're not comfortable with the physical exam, we absolutely don't have to proceed with it. However, to properly assess the situation and determine if either of you have an infection, it is best to have a sample for testing. I can offer a compromise. We can focus on getting information about the young man’s symptoms. If you can describe what you observed, and if he’s willing, perhaps he could come in for a consultation as well. We can assess his symptoms and determine the best course of action for him. Would you be comfortable with that approach?
