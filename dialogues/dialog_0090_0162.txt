DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I'm Dr. Kur. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, I don’t really have time for this. It’s… my stomach, I guess. Feels puffed up. Like I swallowed a balloon. It's been happening on and off, but it’s annoying. Honestly, I just want it to stop. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: “Puffed up,” alright. And how long has this “puffing up” been going on, Mr. Kristofik?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I don’t keep track of that stuff. Weeks, maybe? Months? It comes and goes, like I said. It’s not like it's a constant thing. Look, is it something serious? Because I got work to do, and I can’t be laid up. I drive a pile driver for a living, Doc, not… sit around complaining about my belly.
DOCTOR: Well, it’s important to understand why it’s happening, even if it’s not constant. “Weeks, maybe months” is a little vague, unfortunately. Can you describe when it tends to happen?
PATIENT: When? Seriously? I eat, I work, sometimes it happens. Other times it doesn’t. I don’t exactly chart my meals and then wait to see if I inflate like a… a tire. It's just there sometimes. Is this going somewhere, or are we just gonna play twenty questions about my digestive system? Look, my wife used to handle all this doctor stuff. I just… I don’t pay attention to details.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I understand you’re busy, and perhaps not accustomed to detailed medical questioning. But I need some information to get a sense of what’s going on. Let’s try this: Does anything specific seem to trigger it?
PATIENT: Specific? Look, I eat normal food. Burgers, fries, sometimes a steak if I'm feeling fancy. I drink water. I don't go around eating weird things, if that's what you're getting at. And I definitely don't drink milk, if that's a thought. Never liked it. Is that helpful? I'm honestly trying here, but I'm not a doctor. I operate heavy machinery. Big difference.
DOCTOR: Okay. And are you experiencing any other symptoms along with this… “puffing up”?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Like what? I don't know... I feel tired sometimes, but that's from the work. I haven't been... throwing up, if that's what you mean. No… aches or pains, really. Just… uncomfortable. Like I'm carrying around an extra person in my stomach. Is that a symptom? It feels like one. Honestly, I just want to be done with this. It’s a waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Alright. No nausea, vomiting, pain… Just bloating and fatigue. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Doc, are you seriously asking me about my… you know? Look, I go when I need to go. Sometimes it’s regular, sometimes it isn’t. It depends on what I ate, how much water I drank, and whether or not I’m busy driving a pile driver. I don't track it! Is this what doctors do all day? Asking people about their… that? This is ridiculous. I'm leaving.
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, please. I understand this isn’t pleasant, but it’s necessary. I need to rule out anything serious. Let's just try to be a little more specific. Has there been any change in the frequency of your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don't keep a log! One day it's fine, the next it's… not. It’s all over the place! I’m a construction worker, Doc, not a scientist. I don’t analyze my… output. Honestly, you’re making me feel worse just by asking these questions. My wife, she always knew what to tell the doctors. I just… I don't have the patience for this. I need to get back to work. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. Given your… reluctance to provide further details, and the description of bloating and fatigue, I’m going to order some basic blood work. It will help us rule out some common causes, and perhaps point us in the right direction. It will include a complete blood count and a metabolic panel. I’ll also need you to provide a stool sample. It’s a standard test to check for any abnormalities. The lab instructions will be printed out for you. If the symptoms worsen, or you develop any fever, severe abdominal pain, or notice blood in your stool, you need to go to the emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
