DOCTOR: Hi Terasa, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It’s nice to meet you too. Well, it’s… my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. It’s hard to explain, things just… go quiet sometimes, and I get really dizzy. It doesn’t happen all the time, but when it does, it’s quite frightening. My husband… he used to have something similar, I think. Though it was a long time ago, and my memory isn't what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, ears and dizziness. I understand. It is frightening when things feel off like that. Let’s try to get a better picture of what’s going on. When you say “go quiet”, does that mean you experience a loss of hearing, or more of a muffled sound?
PATIENT: Oh, um… a loss of hearing, I think. Like someone turned the volume right down. Not muffled, just… gone. And then it comes back, usually. Though sometimes it takes a while. It's very odd. It's been happening… well, I don't know exactly when it started. A few months, maybe? It’s hard to keep track, you see. Everything blends together these days.
DOCTOR: Right, a few months. Intermittent hearing loss, comes and goes. Okay. And how long does the hearing loss typically last when an episode happens?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a tricky one. Sometimes it’s just a few minutes, and then it’s back to normal. Other times… well, other times it’s hours. I remember one time it lasted nearly a whole day! I couldn’t hear a thing. It makes it very difficult to talk on the phone, of course. And I like to listen to the radio... But it's not every time. Honestly, it’s unpredictable. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense – unpredictable is a good way to put it. And you mentioned dizziness along with the hearing loss – does the dizziness happen at the same time as the hearing loss, or does it happen separately?
PATIENT: Yes, usually at the same time. Like a wave comes over me, you know? The hearing goes, and then everything starts spinning. Not always violently, sometimes it’s just… off-balance. Like I've had a bit too much to drink, but I haven't! It's very unsettling. It's worse when I try to walk, of course. I have to sit down quickly.
DOCTOR: Okay, so hearing loss and dizziness happening around the same time, worse with walking. Have you noticed anything that triggers these episodes – certain movements, stress, loud noises, anything at all?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… that’s a hard one. I don’t think so. It doesn’t seem to be anything specific. I've tried to think about it, you know? I haven’t noticed any patterns. Maybe when I'm tired? I do get rather tired easily these days. And sometimes when I bend over, but that could just be my age. I really wish I knew what brought it on. It’s rather worrying, not knowing.
DOCTOR: Right, so possibly related to fatigue, perhaps bending over. Let's talk a bit about your overall health. Do you have any other medical problems – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, anything like that?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… High blood pressure, yes, the doctor told me years ago. I take a little pill for it, every morning. And… I think I had a bit of a problem with my waterworks, but that’s been sorted now. Nothing major, really. I try to keep healthy, you know? Eat my fruits and vegetables. I don’t smoke, never have. My husband, bless him, he used to, but I always made him smoke outside!
DOCTOR: Okay, so high blood pressure, managed with medication, and a history of some urinary issues. And no smoking. Good. Are you currently taking any other medications besides the blood pressure pill?
PATIENT: Oh, um… let me think. Just the one, I believe. The little white one, for my blood pressure. Sometimes I take something for my aches and pains, when they're bad, but that's just ibuprofen, you know? Nothing regularly. I don’t like taking too many pills, if I can avoid it. Makes me feel… funny.
DOCTOR: Alright, just the blood pressure medication and ibuprofen as needed. And do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. Not that I’m aware of, anyway. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to eat all sorts of things when I was younger, nothing bothered me. Although, sometimes I get a bit of heartburn, but that's just from eating too much spicy food! Nothing serious. I don't have any allergies to animals either, we used to have a lovely cat.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Let's do a quick exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll take a look in your ears. Just need you to sit back in the chair, relax.
PATIENT: Alright, dear. That sounds sensible. Heart and lungs, yes. Just let me… settle back a bit. Oh, this chair isn't quite as comfortable as my usual one, is it? But never mind, I'll try to stay still. Go ahead, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Okay. Heart sounds are regular, lungs are clear. Now, looking in your ears... There’s some wax buildup in both ears, which can sometimes contribute to hearing issues. I also see a little bit of redness behind the eardrum in the left ear. No obvious fluid or perforation. Your blood pressure is 140/90 today, a little elevated, but not drastically so. Now, I want to do a few quick balance tests. Can you stand up for me, please?
PATIENT: Oh, wax, is it? I’ve always had trouble with wax. My husband used to try to clean them for me, bless him. And redness… oh dear. That doesn’t sound good, does it? A little elevated blood pressure… well, it's been a bit stressful lately, you know? All these appointments… Yes, I can stand up. Steady now, steady now…
DOCTOR: Alright, just stand still for a moment. Now, close your eyes. Okay, open your eyes. Now, can you walk a straight line for me, heel-to-toe, as best you can?
PATIENT: Oh, eyes closed… right. Oh dear, this isn’t very easy, is it? I’m a bit wobbly, I'm afraid. Open them now? Yes, please. Walking a straight line… Oh, it's harder than it looks, Doctor! I’m trying…
DOCTOR: Yes, it is a bit challenging. Okay, that’s enough of that for now. You do have some difficulty with balance. Based on what you've told me, and the exam findings, it sounds like you may be experiencing something called vestibular neuritis, which is inflammation of the inner ear. The wax buildup could be contributing, and the redness suggests some ongoing inflammation. We need to rule out other possibilities, of course. I’d like to order a hearing test, just to get a baseline, and possibly an MRI of your brain, to rule out any other causes for the dizziness. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh dear, vestibular neuritis… that sounds very complicated. Inflammation… well, I do feel rather inflamed sometimes, if I’m honest! A hearing test… yes, that makes sense. And an MRI… oh my. Is that… is that safe? I've heard things about those. But if you think it’s necessary, Doctor… yes, alright. Do what you think is best. I just want to get this sorted out, you know? It’s very unsettling, feeling like this.
DOCTOR: It is, thankfully, usually not serious, and often resolves on its own, but it’s good to rule things out. The MRI is very safe - it uses magnetic waves, no radiation. You’ll lie still for about 30-40 minutes. We'll go over all the precautions beforehand. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe you some anti-nausea medication, as dizziness can be quite debilitating. I'll also recommend some exercises called Epley maneuvers, which can help reposition the crystals in your inner ear. I'll give you a handout with instructions. I’m also going to refer you to an ENT specialist – an ear, nose, and throat doctor – for a more thorough evaluation. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Oh, crystals in my inner ear… well, that sounds rather peculiar! Anti-nausea medication… yes, that would be good. I do feel a bit queasy sometimes with the dizziness. And an ENT specialist… yes, alright. The more opinions, the better, I suppose. A handout… yes, that would be helpful. I do forget things easily, you know. This is a lot to take in, Doctor. But thank you. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Terasa. It is a lot, and we're taking it one step at a time. I'll have the nurse print out those handouts and get the referral paperwork started for the ENT. The nurse will also schedule your hearing test. I’m going to write you a prescription for meclizine, 12.5mg, one tablet twice a day as needed for nausea. Let’s check your blood pressure one more time before you go. Okay, still a little elevated, but not drastically so. Try to rest, stay hydrated, and avoid sudden movements. Do you have any questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: Oh, meclizine… yes. I'll remember that. Rest and hydration… yes, I can do that. Um… what about driving? Is it safe to drive if I’m feeling dizzy? That’s what my husband used to ask… And is this something that will go away completely? Will I be alright? That's what I really want to know.
DOCTOR: Those are very good questions, Terasa. Absolutely no driving while you're experiencing dizziness. It's not safe for you or anyone else. As for whether it will go away completely… most cases of vestibular neuritis do resolve over weeks to months, with or without treatment. The Epley maneuvers can be very effective, and the anti-nausea medication will help manage the symptoms in the meantime. However, some people do experience lingering balance problems, even after the acute episode is over. That's why seeing the ENT specialist is important – they can assess your individual situation and recommend the best course of action. I'll write a note for your primary care physician outlining everything we discussed today, and we’ll follow up with you in a couple of weeks to see how you're doing. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. No driving, that's good to know. And seeing the ENT specialist… yes, alright. Lingering balance problems… well, that's a bit worrying, but I suppose it’s better to know. Two weeks… yes. That gives me time to… to think about everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind. I think that's all my questions for now. I’ll let the nurse get started with everything.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Terasa. It was my pleasure. Remember, if your symptoms worsen or you develop a high fever, severe headache, or changes in your vision or hearing, please seek immediate medical attention. Get some rest, and I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
PATIENT: Thank you again, Doctor. I will. Rest and hydration… that's the plan.
