DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Skarbek. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Bacy. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s a pleasure to meet you. My name is Karry Skarbek. Well, to be frank, it’s about getting some shots. My granddaughter… she’s trying to get her husband here from overseas, and I understand there are requirements for vaccinations. I’m helping her with all the paperwork and making sure everything is correct, but I’m a bit lost on what he needs, and what I need to prove she's taking care of it all. I hope that makes sense.
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Mr. Skarbek. Navigating immigration paperwork and health requirements can be quite complex. So, you’re looking for information regarding vaccinations needed for your granddaughter’s husband to immigrate, and potentially documentation to show compliance?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s exactly right. Compliance… that’s a good word for it. I want to be sure we're doing everything by the book. He’s coming from… let me think… the Philippines, I believe. Is that going to change what he needs? I don't know much about what diseases are common there, or if he’s had the shots we give here.
DOCTOR: Okay, the Philippines does have some specific vaccination requirements and recommendations for immigration purposes, so it’s good you mentioned that. Before we get into specifics, let's start with a little background information. Have you or your granddaughter already started collecting any documentation regarding his vaccination history?
PATIENT: No, not yet. We haven't started anything. We were waiting to talk to someone who knows what we need before we start asking him to find records, or getting him appointments. It seems… rude to ask for a lot of things without knowing what’s truly necessary, you understand? He’s a bit nervous about all this already, coming to a new country and all.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Mr. Skarbek. That’s very considerate of you both. It's best to be prepared and avoid unnecessary stress. Okay, so for adults immigrating from the Philippines, the CDC generally requires proof of vaccination against measles, mumps, rubella , varicella , influenza, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis , and hepatitis B. There are some exceptions and waivers, but those usually require a physician's assessment. Do you know if he has a record of any prior vaccinations?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. He didn’t have a lot of opportunities for schooling growing up, and things are different there, I expect. It wasn’t like here with all the school requirements. He’s a strong, healthy man, but I doubt he has a little card like our grandchildren have. What does that mean for us? Does he have to have all of those shots, even if he doesn’t have proof he’s had them?
DOCTOR: That’s a good question, Mr. Skarbek. If he doesn’t have documentation, we’ll likely need to administer the vaccinations. However, we can perform a blood test, called a titer, to check his immunity levels for some of these diseases – measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. If the titer shows he has immunity, he may not need the vaccine for those specific diseases. To start, let’s do a quick review of his medical history. Have you or he experienced any serious illnesses or allergic reactions to vaccines in the past?
PATIENT: Well, he’s always been a healthy man, as far as I know. Never been seriously ill. As for allergies... I don’t think so. He might have a mild sensitivity to dust, sometimes sneezes a lot, but nothing that requires medicine. He’s never had a bad reaction to anything a doctor has given him. I’m not sure if that counts. He's not one to complain much, you see. I worry about him getting sick from the shots, more than anything. Is that a common worry?
DOCTOR: It's very reasonable to be concerned about potential side effects, Mr. Skarbek. Mild reactions like soreness at the injection site, a low-grade fever, or feeling tired are common and usually resolve within a day or two. Serious reactions are rare, but we take precautions to minimize risks and are prepared to manage any complications. To get a better picture, could you tell me his height and weight?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me think… he’s a bit shorter than me, I’d say. About five foot six, maybe five foot seven. And… he’s a solid man, but not overweight. I’d guess around one hundred and sixty pounds. He’s strong for his size, works hard with his hands. I’m not very good at guessing weights, I’m afraid. It’s been a long time since I’ve needed to know such things.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful, Mr. Skarbek. Five foot six to seven and around 160 pounds. Now, let's talk about his current health status. Does he have any ongoing medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. He’s a very active man, works outdoors a lot, farming mostly. He’s always been strong as an ox. He doesn’t take any medicine regularly, not even for aches and pains. He’s a bit stubborn, to be honest. Doesn’t like going to doctors unless absolutely necessary. But he’s willing to do what needs to be done for this, to come here and be with my granddaughter. That’s why we’re here today. He's a good man.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Mr. Skarbek. It sounds like he's generally quite healthy. Okay, based on what you’ve told me, it seems like we need to focus on getting him up-to-date on his vaccinations to meet the immigration requirements. We'll start with the vaccinations he most likely needs – MMR, varicella, influenza, Tdap, and hepatitis B. Then we can do the blood tests to see if he has immunity to some, and potentially avoid unnecessary shots. Would you like to proceed with scheduling those vaccinations today?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds like a good plan, Doctor. Let’s get it done. The sooner the better, really. It's just… how many shots will he need at once? I worry about him being too sore to work afterward. He’s a farmer, you see, and can’t afford to be laid up. Is there a limit to how many he can get at one time?
DOCTOR: That’s a very valid concern, Mr. Skarbek. We definitely don't want to incapacitate him. Typically, we don't give more than a few vaccines at one appointment to minimize discomfort and potential side effects. We can spread out the vaccinations over several appointments. For example, we could start with the influenza and Tdap today, and then schedule the MMR and hepatitis B for a week or two later. We’ll also draw blood today to check his immunity levels for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella. Does that approach sound reasonable to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds much better, Doctor. Spreading them out is a good idea. And the blood test first… that makes sense. It’s good to know if he already has some protection. What about the cost? My granddaughter has insurance, but I don’t know if it covers all of this. And I don’t want to surprise her with a huge bill.
DOCTOR: That’s a very responsible question, Mr. Skarbek. Let me check his insurance coverage for these vaccinations and blood tests. Okay, it looks like his insurance does cover the influenza and Tdap vaccines with a copay of $30 each. The blood tests will have a copay of $75. The MMR and hepatitis B vaccines are covered at 80%, with a copay of $40 each, depending on the administration fee. I can give you a more precise estimate after the appointment, and we can discuss any potential out-of-pocket costs. Are you comfortable proceeding with these initial vaccinations and blood tests today?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds alright, Doctor. Thirty dollars for each of those two shots, and seventy-five for the blood test... I can manage that. My granddaughter will be relieved. She worries a lot about money. Alright then, let's get started. Do you have his insurance card with you today? And do you happen to know if he’s had the chickenpox vaccine before? It's a long shot, I know. But sometimes they gave it at school, even if he didn’t go regularly.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. And no, he definitely didn’t have the chickenpox vaccine when he was younger. It wasn’t common where he grew up. Alright, Mr. Skarbek, if you could please follow me to the exam room, we can get started with the vaccinations and blood draw. I'll have a nurse assist us. We’ll document everything carefully, and I’ll explain each step as we go. Do you have any questions before we head back?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for being so patient and explaining everything so clearly. It puts my mind at ease knowing you're taking good care of him. Let's go ahead and get started then.
DOCTOR: Excellent. The nurse will be in shortly to start the process. While we wait, I'll just quickly review his health history one more time to ensure everything is accurate. And please, don't hesitate to ask if anything is unclear or if you have any concerns at any point.
