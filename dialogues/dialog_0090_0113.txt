DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Segretto. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Well, it’s… it’s this blasted bladder of mine. Seems like I’m going to the bathroom all the time. It's a nuisance, really. Used to be able to go hours, you know? Now… not so much. I don't rightly remember when it started, just… gradually, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Gradually, alright. And when you say "all the time," could you give me a rough idea?
PATIENT: Rough idea… hmm. Well, let's see… before, maybe three, four times a day? Now? Oh, I don’t know… six, seven, maybe more? It's hard to keep track when you're… preoccupied, you understand. It’s just… inconvenient. And it wakes me up at night sometimes. My wife doesn’t like that.
DOCTOR: Wakes you up at night, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. A few times a week, at least. It’s not like it’s a full stream, mind you. Just… enough to get me up. And then I have trouble getting back to sleep. Old age, I suppose. Everything stops working the way it should. Though, to be fair, I always had a sensitive bladder, even when I was a young man on the farm. It's just... worse now. Much worse.
DOCTOR: Sensitive bladder even when younger… alright. And do you experience any pain or burning when you urinate, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Pain? No, no, not really pain. A little discomfort sometimes, a little… pressure, maybe. But not pain. And burning… no, definitely no burning. It's just… frequent. That's the main trouble. It’s annoying, more than anything. Makes it hard to get a good day's work done, even just tending the garden. My wife does most of the heavy lifting now, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain or burning, just frequency and nocturia - waking up at night to urinate. Have you noticed any change in the color or smell of your urine?
PATIENT: Color or smell… Now you’re asking things I haven’t paid much attention to, Doctor. Honestly, I just go when I need to go. Never really looked at it, if you know what I mean. It looks like pee, I suppose. And smells… well, like pee, naturally! You doctors and your questions. Always looking for something complicated. I just want it to stop happening so much.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Segretto. Sometimes the simplest explanation is the right one. But we need to rule things out. Now, have you been drinking more fluids than usual lately?
PATIENT: More fluids…? Not that I recall. I drink my usual coffee in the morning, maybe a glass of water with lunch. My wife makes sure I stay hydrated, she's very good about that. But no, I haven't been deliberately drinking more. It’s been a hot summer, though, admittedly. We’ve been having to water the garden quite a bit, and maybe… maybe I’ve been having a bit more iced tea with dinner? But nothing excessive. Honestly, I don't keep track of such things.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any history of diabetes, Mr. Segretto?
PATIENT: Diabetes…? Now that's a question. Let me see… I don’t think so. My mother had something… a weakness, maybe? But I never had it. The doctor always checked me when I went for my yearly check-ups, and he never said anything about sugar. I ate a lot of sweets when I was a boy, I will admit that. Good Ukrainian honey cakes, the best you ever tasted. But diabetes… no, I don’t think so. Are you thinking I have diabetes, Doctor? Because that doesn't sound right.
DOCTOR: I'm not thinking you do, Mr. Segretto. It’s just a routine question, part of ruling things out. Now, let’s talk about your bowel movements. Have you noticed any changes in those recently?
PATIENT: Bowel movements?! Good heavens, Doctor, what is this, a full physical? I came in here about my bladder, not my… Well, they're regular enough, I suppose. A bit… less firm than they used to be, but that's to be expected at my age. No trouble going, thankfully. It's the frequency of the other thing that’s bothering me, not this! Are you always this thorough, Doctor? I feel like I’m being dissected.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Segretto. It's important to get a complete picture. Now, just a couple more questions, and then we can move on to a physical exam. Do you have any difficulty starting your urine stream, or is it weak or interrupted?
PATIENT: Interrupted… now you're asking about the force of the stream? Honestly. Well, it’s not as strong as it used to be, I’ll grant you that. Takes a little longer to get going, sometimes. And it… wavers a bit, I suppose. Not a solid, steady flow like when I was younger. It’s… dribbly, maybe? Is that the word? It’s not a powerful stream, if that's what you’re asking. But I can still go, mind you. It just isn't like turning on a tap anymore. This is very undignified, you know.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Segretto. It sounds like you're experiencing symptoms consistent with Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia, or BPH. Essentially, your prostate gland is enlarged, which is common as men age, and it's pressing on your bladder. That explains the frequency, urgency, nocturia, weak stream, and difficulty starting. However, to be certain, and to rule out other possibilities, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. It will involve a digital rectal exam - I'll need to check the size and texture of your prostate. It's not the most pleasant exam, I admit, but it’s important. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… a digital… what now? You want to… check my… there? Good heavens, Doctor, that sounds… highly unpleasant. And frankly, unnecessary! I’ve told you everything I’ve told you. It sounds like one of those… those problems that old men get, the one you just mentioned. Can’t you just… prescribe something? I don’t need you poking around there. No, Doctor. Absolutely not. I’m not having any of that. I’ll just… try drinking less water before bed, I suppose. Or maybe it'll just go away on its own. I’m not keen on this exam, not at all.
DOCTOR: Mr. Segretto, I understand your discomfort, but I cannot prescribe medication without a proper diagnosis. A digital rectal exam is a standard part of evaluating these symptoms, and it's essential to rule out more serious conditions, like prostate cancer. I respect your wishes, but refusing the exam limits my ability to provide you with the best possible care. If you are unwilling to proceed with the exam, I recommend you seek a second opinion from another physician. I am documenting your refusal in your chart. .
