DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Boham. I’m Dr. Nestingen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Um… my nose. It’s been… bothering me. Not good, you know? Like a… pressure. A lot of pressure. I don't remember exactly when it started, but a while now.
DOCTOR: “A while now” isn't terribly helpful, Ms. Boham. But alright. Can you describe this pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, I am sorry, Doctor. It’s… hard to say. It feels full, like when you have a bad cold, maybe? But… not exactly like a cold. It’s… constant. Not come and go. Just… there. And sometimes, it hurts behind my eyes a little. I don’t know if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Behind the eyes, you say. And you’ve had this constant pressure… for how long, approximately?
PATIENT: Hmm… weeks, maybe? Or… months? It’s hard to remember. My husband, he says I complain about it at night. He says I toss and turn. I don’t really… notice, you know? It just… is. I work long hours, Doctor. Maybe I am just tired.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything – anything at all – made it better or worse?
PATIENT: Oh… well. When I lay down, sometimes it feels a little better. But not much. And… when I bend over, it feels… worse. Like something is pushing. I don’t know. I mostly just take some… pills. For the headache, you know? But they don't help the pressure.
DOCTOR: Pills?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Just… over-the-counter. For headache. The red box kind. My neighbor, she said it helps her. But… it doesn't really do much for this. For the… nose feeling full. I don't know the name of them. I just get them at the store.
DOCTOR: Do you know the active ingredient in these pills, Ms. Boham?
PATIENT: Oh… no, Doctor. I… I don’t pay attention to that. Just look for the red box. It helps sometimes with the… throbbing. But not this. This is different. It’s just… pressure. I am sorry I can’t remember. My head… sometimes it feels like it doesn’t work right.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's move on. Any nasal congestion?
PATIENT: Congestion? You mean… stuffy nose? Sometimes. Not always. Mostly at night. And when it’s cold outside. It’s… hard to breathe then. But I just… blow my nose. Lots. I use the tissues. The soft ones. My face gets… sore, sometimes. But I don’t know what else to do.
DOCTOR: Do you notice any discharge when you blow your nose?
PATIENT: Discharge…? Oh. Um… yes. Sometimes. It’s… clear. Or… sometimes it’s a little yellow. But not… a lot. Just a little. I don’t think it smells, but… my husband might know. He has a better nose than me, I think. It’s just… normal nose stuff, Doctor. I don’t know. Is it bad?
DOCTOR: We'll determine that. Have you experienced any fever, chills, or facial pain besides the pressure you described?
PATIENT: Fever… no. Not that I remember. I feel warm sometimes, but that’s just the weather, you know? It’s very hot outside. And chills… no. No chills. Facial pain… maybe a little bit. Around my cheeks. But not… sharp pain. Just… uncomfortable. Like… pressure. Everything feels like pressure, Doctor. I am sorry I am not being helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any changes in your sense of smell or taste?
PATIENT: Oh… um… I don’t know. I eat food. It tastes… like food. Maybe not as good as before? But I work long hours, Doctor. I don’t have much time to… smell things. And my husband, he cooks. He uses a lot of spices. It’s hard to tell, you know? I haven’t noticed anything different, really. I think.
DOCTOR: Very well. Have you ever had any sinus infections, or any other problems with your nose or sinuses?
PATIENT: Oh… that’s a good question. I… I think so. A long time ago. When I was younger. I had to take… pills. And maybe get a shot? But I don’t remember. It was before I came to this country, I think. It was… very bad. But I don’t remember the details, Doctor. It was a long time ago. My memory… it’s not good.
DOCTOR: Alright. And do you have any allergies that you are aware of?
PATIENT: Allergies…? Um… no. Not that I know of. I live here a long time now. I get… dusty sometimes. From work. But everyone gets dusty, right? I don’t sneeze much. And I don’t get… rashes. I think. I haven’t noticed anything, Doctor. I am sorry. I wish I could tell you more. My head is… fuzzy.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s move on to your medical history. Do you have any current medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh… um… I work very hard, Doctor. That’s… hard on my body. Sometimes my back hurts. And my hands. From the drill. But… that’s just from work. I don’t have anything… serious. I don’t think. My husband says I am strong. He says I worry too much. I don’t know. I haven’t been to a doctor in a long time.
DOCTOR: And have you had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: Oh… um… yes. A long time ago. When I had the baby. A Cesarean. But that was… many years ago. And… I think I had my tonsils out when I was little. But I don't remember. It was a long time ago. Before I moved here. It was… very scary. But I am okay now. I think. Everything is… fuzzy. I am sorry.
DOCTOR: Alright. Do any medical conditions run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh… um… that’s a hard question, Doctor. My family… they live very far away. I don’t see them much. My mother… she had… problems with her heart, I think. But I don't know the details. And my father… he worked very hard, like me. He had… problems with his back. But that’s just from work, I think. Everything is… fuzzy. I am sorry. It’s hard to remember.
DOCTOR: Alright. And finally, do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh no, Doctor! No. I don't do any of those things. Never! I need to be strong for work. And my husband, he doesn't like those things. No, no smoking, no drinking, and definitely no… other things. I just work hard and try to take care of my family. That’s all.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Boham. I’d like to perform a quick physical exam now. I'll need to listen to your lungs and sinuses, check your throat, and perhaps take your temperature. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That’s okay. Whatever you think is best. I trust you. I just want to feel better, you know? I hope you can help me. My head… it feels a little bit better just talking, actually. But I am happy to do whatever you need. Please be gentle with my nose, though. It’s… sensitive.
DOCTOR: Very well. Please sit up straight, and I'll start with your lungs. Take a deep breath in… and out… good. Another deep breath… and out… Lungs are clear. Now, let’s check your sinuses… There is some tenderness to the frontal sinuses... and maxillary sinuses...Ears are normal. Now open your mouth… say “ahhh”…Throat is clear, no obvious signs of infection. Temperature is 98.6. Alright. It seems you have some inflammation of your sinuses. It's difficult to pinpoint the exact cause without further investigation.
PATIENT: Oh… inflammation? Is that bad, Doctor? What does that mean? And what kind of investigation? I don’t like… scary tests. I just want something to make my nose feel better. I have to work tomorrow, you know? I can’t be sick. What do you think is wrong?
DOCTOR: It could be a sinus infection, Ms. Boham, but we need to rule out other possibilities. A simple cold can also cause sinus inflammation. To get a clearer picture, I recommend a CT scan of your sinuses. It’s not invasive, but it will give us a detailed look at what’s going on. As for what’s wrong right now… it seems to be some congestion and inflammation causing the pressure you’re feeling. We can start with a nasal steroid spray to reduce the swelling and a decongestant to help clear your nasal passages. Would you be open to trying that?
PATIENT: A CT scan…? Oh… that sounds… scary, Doctor. Does it hurt? And what if it shows something… bad? I don’t know… I don’t like the sound of that. Maybe… maybe we could just try the spray first? And the… decongestant? Before the scan? I just want to feel better, you know? I don’t want anything complicated. I have to work. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Boham. We can try the nasal spray and decongestant first. However, if your symptoms don't improve within a week, we will need to reconsider the CT scan. I'm prescribing a nasal steroid spray—Fluticasone—to be used twice daily. And I recommend an over-the-counter decongestant—pseudoephedrine—but be aware it can raise your blood pressure, so use it cautiously if you have any heart conditions. Avoid strenuous activity and get plenty of rest. And drink lots of fluids. If you experience any fever, severe headache, or changes in vision, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh… Fluticasone… and… pseudoephedrine… Okay. I will try my best. No, I don't think I am allergic to anything. I haven’t taken much medicine in my life, you know? Just… headache pills. I will be careful with the… the other one, the one that raises blood pressure. I don’t want to fall down at work. Thank you, Doctor. I hope this works. Is there anything else I should do? Or know? I appreciate you taking the time with me. My head is still a little fuzzy, but it feels a little better just talking.
DOCTOR: Alright. Avoid irritants like smoke and dust. And if your symptoms worsen, or don't improve after a week, schedule a follow-up appointment, and we'll discuss the CT scan again. I'll give you a written summary of our discussion and the medication instructions. If you have any concerns in the meantime, you can call my office. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think that’s everything. Thank you so much for your time. And for explaining everything. I hope I didn’t ask too many silly questions. I just… worry a lot. I will try my best to follow your instructions. Thank you again. I think I should go now, before I forget something.
DOCTOR: Very well. You may go, Ms. Boham. And please, try to rest.
PATIENT: .
