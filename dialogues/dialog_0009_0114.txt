DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Vanderwiele. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Petrimoulx. It's lovely to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's… well, it's about my breathing. It's been trouble when I lie flat. It feels like… well, like it’s harder to get air. I don’t like it one bit. I hope we can get this sorted quickly, if you don’t mind.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Vanderwiele. Breathing difficulties are always concerning, and we'll definitely get to the bottom of this. It’s good you came in to get it checked out. When you say it's harder to get air, can you describe that feeling a little more?
PATIENT: It’s… a tightness, I suppose. In my chest. And I feel like I have to… work at each breath. It doesn’t hurt, exactly, just… uncomfortable. And it happens when I try to rest. When I'm sitting up, it’s alright. But lying down? No. It's not a good feeling at all. I used to sleep so soundly.
DOCTOR: I understand. A tightness in the chest that worsens when lying flat... that's helpful information. And it's not accompanied by pain, which is also good to know. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me roughly how long this has been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… It started… maybe three, four months ago? It was just a little thing at first. I thought it was the pillows, or maybe I ate something heavy before bed. But it’s gotten worse steadily since then. Now, it’s nearly every night. I've started sleeping in my armchair, it’s easier to breathe sitting up. Not comfortable, mind you, but easier.
DOCTOR: Three to four months, gradually worsening… and now requiring you to sleep in a chair for comfort. That tells me this isn’t likely something that will resolve on its own. Okay. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the breathing trouble?
PATIENT: Well… now that you mention it, my ankles have been a bit swollen lately. Not terribly, but I do notice them, especially at the end of the day. And I've been feeling rather tired, even after a good night's sleep… or, well, a night in the chair. I attributed it to my age, mostly. But maybe it’s connected?
DOCTOR: It’s excellent that you brought that up, Ms. Vanderwiele. Swelling in the ankles and fatigue could certainly be connected. To get a more complete picture, I'd like to ask a few more general health questions, if you don't mind. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, let's see... I had a touch of arthritis in my hands years ago, but it's mostly manageable with some cream. And I had my gallbladder removed, oh, must be twenty years ago now. Otherwise… no. Nothing major. I've always been fairly healthy, all things considered. I've always tried to eat well. And I've never been a smoker.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Arthritis and a gallbladder removal, no other significant medical history, and no smoking history. And what about any surgeries besides the gallbladder removal?
PATIENT: No, just the gallbladder. And a cataract in my left eye a few years back, but that wasn't really surgery, was it? Just a little procedure. Nothing like a proper operation. I’ve always been lucky, really, when it comes to needing things done. Mostly just the usual aches and pains that come with getting older.
DOCTOR: No, a cataract procedure isn't quite the same as major surgery. Now, can you tell me about your family's medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm. My mother… she had high blood pressure, towards the end of her life. And my father… he had a weak heart, I believe. He passed away quite suddenly, actually. And my brother… he had some trouble with his cholesterol, but that’s about it. Not a particularly sickly family, all things considered. Though I do worry about taking after my father, with the heart trouble.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Vanderwiele. That’s helpful information. High blood pressure in your mother, heart trouble in your father, and cholesterol issues in your brother. And what about any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, just the arthritis cream. And a little something for my eyesight, a mild prescription. Nothing serious, I assure you. Just the usual things for an older woman. I don't take a lot of pills, thankfully. I've always preferred a natural approach, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay, just arthritis cream and something for your eyesight. No other medications. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at your ankles. It will just take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Yes, that's fine, Doctor. Please, go ahead. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and get back to sleeping in a proper bed. The armchair is not ideal, you understand. It's very… upright.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Vanderwiele. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, 148/92. Your heart sounds are a bit… distant, and I do hear some crackling in your lungs, especially towards the bases. And, as you mentioned, there is some noticeable swelling in both ankles, with some mild redness. It's not severe, but it’s definitely present. I’m also noting some mild pitting edema when I press on your ankles. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound good, does it? Not good at all. No, I don’t have any allergies, thankfully. Never had a reaction to anything. Not to penicillin, not to anything. I've been very fortunate in that regard. But… what does all that mean, Doctor? Is it serious? I do hope it’s not my heart.
DOCTOR: It's good to know you have no allergies, Ms. Vanderwiele. And I understand your concern. The findings do suggest we need to investigate further, but I want to assure you we're going to figure this out. The crackling in your lungs and the swelling in your ankles, along with your breathing difficulties, could indicate a few possibilities. One of the most common is congestive heart failure, where the heart isn't pumping as effectively as it should, leading to fluid buildup in the lungs and extremities. But other conditions could be causing this too. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. An EKG to check your heart’s electrical activity, a chest X-ray to look at your lungs, and some blood work, including a BNP test, which can help rule out heart failure. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Heart failure… That is what I was afraid of. My father… Yes, yes, please do the tests, Doctor. Whatever you think is best. I just want to know what’s going on. And I want to be able to sleep in my bed again. I suppose… a chest X-ray and blood work… and the EKG. When can we do these? I’d like to get them done as quickly as possible, if you don’t mind. It's just… unsettling, not knowing.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety, Ms. Vanderwiele. It is unsettling not knowing. We’ll get these tests done as quickly as possible. I can order them right away, and the lab is just down the hall. They can likely do the blood work and EKG today. The chest X-ray can be scheduled for tomorrow morning. In the meantime, I’m going to recommend you limit your salt intake and fluids. And I'd like you to monitor your weight daily. If you notice any sudden weight gain or worsening shortness of breath, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: Limit salt and fluids… and watch my weight. Yes, I can do that. It’s just… I do enjoy my cooking, you see. And my tea. But I will try. Um… will these tests be… painful? And… how long will it take to get the results? I suppose that's the biggest question. I just want to know what I'm dealing with. And… is there anything else I should be doing? Anything at all?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question, Ms. Vanderwiele. The tests are not painful at all. The EKG involves placing small stickers on your chest, and the blood work is just a simple prick of the finger. As for the results, the blood work will likely be back tomorrow afternoon, and the EKG results should be available within a few hours. The chest X-ray will take a bit longer, perhaps a day or two, as the radiologist needs to review it. In the meantime, try to get as much rest as possible, and elevate your legs when you're sitting or lying down. That can help reduce the swelling in your ankles. And please, don't hesitate to call the office if you experience any new or worsening symptoms. I'm going to write down these instructions for you, and also include a list of symptoms to watch out for. Do you have any other questions for me right now?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. That's very kind of you. Instructions are always helpful, especially when one is feeling… flustered. No, I don’t think so. Just… please, hurry. I just want to get this sorted, and get back to my life. And my bed. Alright then. I believe that’s everything. Thank you for your time, Doctor. And for your patience.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Vanderwiele. I understand your anxiety, and we will get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. We’ll do everything we can to get you feeling better and back to sleeping comfortably in your bed. Please don’t hesitate to call the office with any questions or concerns that arise. I’ll see you soon. Have a good day, and try to rest. .
