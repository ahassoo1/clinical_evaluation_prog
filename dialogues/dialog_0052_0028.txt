DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Sadhu. My name is Dr. Shely. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for coming in today. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away. It’s been… oh, goodness, maybe a month now? It’s worse when I lie down, you know? Makes it hard to sleep.
DOCTOR: I see. A cough for about a month, that worsens when you lie down. Can you tell me a bit more about the cough itself?
PATIENT: It’s not a dry cough, exactly. It feels… wet, like something’s stuck. And sometimes, when I cough real hard, I get a little bit of… well, it’s bubbly, like soap bubbles. Not much, but it’s there. I mostly just try to ignore it, but it’s getting harder and harder.
DOCTOR: Okay, a productive cough—meaning you’re bringing something up—that sounds bubbly at times. And how much are you bringing up, roughly?
PATIENT: Oh, not a lot, really. A teaspoon, maybe, after a good coughing fit. It's not like I'm filling anything up, just… a little bit. Enough to bother me, that's for sure. And it's white, mostly. Sometimes a little grey. Does that make any sense? I try not to think about it too much.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Ms. Sadhu. White or grey mucus. And you mentioned it’s been going on for about a month now. Have you noticed anything else accompanying the cough?
PATIENT: Well, I get tired easier. I always liked to do a little gardening, you know, tomatoes, peppers… but now, after just a little bit, I have to sit down. And my ankles… they swell up something fierce by the end of the day. I thought it was just old age, to be honest. But then this cough got worse.
DOCTOR: I understand. Fatigue and ankle swelling along with the cough. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats with this cough?
PATIENT: No, no fever. Not that I’ve noticed, anyway. And no chills, no sweats. Just tired. And a little breathless, sometimes. Especially when I try to walk up the stairs. I used to zip right up, but now… I have to stop and catch my breath halfway. It’s embarrassing, really. I don't like bothering anyone.
DOCTOR: That’s helpful to know. So, no fever, chills, or night sweats, but you're experiencing shortness of breath, particularly with exertion. Now, Ms. Sadhu, let's talk a little bit about your medical history. Have you ever been diagnosed with any chronic conditions, like heart problems, lung disease, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Well, years ago, the doctor told me I had… congestive heart failure, I think that's what he called it. It’s been under control for a long time, with the pills. And I had pneumonia once, a long time ago, but I recovered just fine. Aside from that, just the usual aches and pains of getting old, I suppose. Do you need to know what pills I take? I have them written down somewhere...
DOCTOR: Yes, please, if you could share that list of medications with me, that would be very helpful. Knowing what you're currently taking will give me a clearer picture. And regarding the congestive heart failure, do you recall approximately when you were diagnosed?
PATIENT: Here it is… let me see. It was… oh, goodness, almost ten years ago now. 2016, I think. The doctor at the hospital told me to take these every day. Let's see… there's Lisinopril, 20 milligrams… and Furosemide, 40 milligrams… and… oh, and Digoxin, point two-five milligrams. Is that all you need to know about the pills? I always worry I'll forget something important.
DOCTOR: That’s excellent, Ms. Sadhu. Lisinopril, Furosemide, and Digoxin. Thank you for providing that information. Now, are you currently experiencing any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything, thankfully. I eat just about anything. My daughter always teases me about it, says I have an iron stomach. But no, no allergies. At least, none that I'm aware of. I’ve had a few mosquito bites lately, but that’s about it. Do you want to know about my family? My mother had high blood pressure...
DOCTOR: That’s good to know about the lack of allergies. And yes, if you’re comfortable sharing, a little information about your family medical history would be helpful. Specifically, have any close family members had heart problems, lung disease, or a chronic cough?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My mother, she had high blood pressure, like I said. And my brother, he had a bad heart. He needed a pacemaker, years ago. And… let me think. My aunt, on my father’s side, she always had a terrible cough. It just wouldn’t go away, even with the medicine. They said it was… emphysema, I believe. She spent most of her last years just trying to catch her breath. It was very sad. It’s probably nothing, but it always worried me, with my own heart trouble and this cough now.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Sadhu. That’s important information. Now, before we proceed with a physical examination, could you tell me a little about your social history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. What do you want to know? I live alone, since my husband passed away, oh, almost ten years ago now. I don't smoke, never have. My husband smoked for a while, but he quit years and years ago. I don’t drink much, just a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes, if I’m feeling fancy. And I mostly just stay home now, tending to my garden and watching the television. I used to go to church every Sunday, but it’s hard to get around these days. Is that what you needed to know?
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful, Ms. Sadhu. Thank you. Just a little bit of wine with dinner, no smoking, and mostly staying home. Alright. Now, I would like to conduct a brief physical examination to listen to your heart and lungs, and to check for any swelling in your legs. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. It’s just… I always get nervous when you listen to my heart. It feels like you can hear everything that’s wrong with me, you know? But go ahead, please. I’ll try to be still.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Sadhu. Just take some deep, slow breaths for me. Okay. I’m hearing some congestion in your lungs, and your heart rhythm is a little irregular. There is also some noticeable swelling in your ankles. I also notice some mild skin discoloration. Now, I'm going to check your oxygen saturation with this clip on your finger. It's reading 92%. That's a little lower than we’d like.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That doesn't sound good, does it? Congestion… irregular heart… swelling… 92%… What does it mean, Doctor? Is it bad? I feel a little lightheaded now, to be honest. And my chest feels… tight. Is it my heart?
DOCTOR: Please, try to remain calm, Ms. Sadhu. It’s good that you’re telling me about the chest tightness. Based on what I’m hearing and your history, it seems likely that your congestive heart failure is contributing to the fluid in your lungs and the swelling in your ankles. The irregular heart rhythm and lower oxygen saturation are also concerning. While this doesn't necessarily mean a crisis, it does indicate a need for further evaluation and potential adjustment of your medications. I want to order a chest X-ray and an EKG to get a clearer picture of what’s happening. We may also need to do some blood work to check your kidney function and levels of certain cardiac markers. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. X-rays… EKGs… blood work… It sounds serious. But yes, yes, of course, Doctor. If it will help, do whatever you need to do. I just want to feel better. I don't want to end up in the hospital, if I can avoid it. Will it take long? And will it hurt? I'm always so afraid of needles. And... will I be able to go home afterwards?
DOCTOR: It's understandable to be anxious, Ms. Sadhu. We'll take things one step at a time. The chest X-ray is quick and painless – you'll just stand in front of a machine for a few seconds. The EKG involves placing small stickers on your chest, arms, and legs, which may feel a little cool, but doesn’t hurt at all. The blood work will involve a small needle prick, but I’ll make sure the phlebotomist is gentle and quick. We should have the results within a few hours. Based on those results, we can determine the best course of action. It’s likely we’ll need to adjust your medications to better manage your fluid levels and heart rhythm. Most likely, you’ll be able to go home afterwards, but we will need to monitor you closely. Nurse, could you please assist Ms. Sadhu with getting an EKG and drawing some blood work?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Thank you, Doctor. And thank you, Nurse. I always get so nervous… I just… I don't like being poked and prodded. But I'll try to be brave. Just… be gentle, please. And tell me if it's going to hurt, okay? My heart is racing just thinking about it.
DOCTOR: “Of course, dear. We will take very good care of you. We'll take things slowly, and I’ll explain everything as we go. Don't hesitate to tell me if you’re feeling uncomfortable at any point. We’re here to help you feel as comfortable as possible.” .
