DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Hughston. I'm Dr. Murtic. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Um... well, it's about a test, I think. A screening? My husband... he used to handle all these things. It's for... something the clinic asked me to do. It has to do with... substances, I believe? I don't really remember all the details, honestly.
DOCTOR: Right. A screening… yes. The clinic does send out reminders for various preventative tests. Let's see if we can narrow it down. Was this a blood test, a urine sample, or something else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. I really can’t say. I think… I think it involved a cup? Yes, a cup! But maybe I had to give a cup to someone… It's all very foggy. It wasn't blood, I'm pretty sure. I don't like needles. I just got a notice in the mail, and it said I needed to come in. Medicare should be covering it, right?
DOCTOR: Okay. A cup… that suggests a urine test, most likely. And yes, Medicare should cover routine preventative screenings, but we’ll confirm that. It’s probably the annual urine analysis. It checks for things like infection, kidney problems, and diabetes. But just to be sure...do you have any problems urinating?
PATIENT: Oh, that sounds… sensible, I suppose. A urine test. No, no problems at all. Everything works… as well as can be expected for someone my age, I guess. I don’t have any pain or anything like that. It’s just… I wish I remembered why they wanted me to do this. Is it… is it something bad? I haven't been feeling unwell, if that makes a difference.
DOCTOR: It's not necessarily something bad, Ms. Hughston. Many screenings are done just as a precaution, to catch things early. And feeling unwell isn't always a requirement for a screening. Now, have you had any changes in your urinary habits recently?
PATIENT: Urinary… habits? Oh, dear. What do you mean? Like… how often? I… I don’t really pay attention to those things, if I’m honest. Probably the same as always. Maybe a little more at night? But that could just be the tea, I suppose. I like a nice cup of chamomile before bed. I really don’t know. This is all a bit confusing.
DOCTOR: Right. “Habits” simply means how frequently you urinate, whether you experience any burning or discomfort, and the color of your urine. You mentioned more at night – is that a recent change?
PATIENT: Oh, okay. Well, color... it’s usually… yellow, I think? Normal yellow. And yes, the more at night is fairly recent, maybe the last few months? It’s not bad, just… inconvenient. I get up once, sometimes twice. It wasn’t like that before. And no burning or anything unpleasant. Just… getting older, probably. Everything aches, you know? Is this test going to tell me about that?
DOCTOR: The urine analysis won't specifically address aches and pains, Ms. Hughston. It primarily looks for signs of infection, kidney disease, and diabetes. The increased urination at night, that's called nocturia. It could be a sign of something as simple as drinking too much fluid before bed, or it could indicate other issues. Let's proceed with the test. We'll need a sample, of course. Do you think you can manage to provide one now?
PATIENT: Oh. Yes, I suppose. I can manage. It's just… a little embarrassing, talking about all this. Where do I go? Is there a bathroom nearby? And do I… is there anything special I need to do? I really don't want to mess it up.
DOCTOR: Yes, the restroom is right through there. A clean catch midstream sample is preferred, meaning you start urinating, then collect the sample mid-stream in the cup provided. There are instructions inside. And don't worry, these things are perfectly routine. It's simply a matter of hygiene and accuracy. I'll give you a few minutes. Just let the receptionist know when you're finished.
PATIENT: Oh, okay. "Clean catch midstream…" Right. I'll try my best. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your patience. This is all… a bit much for me. .
