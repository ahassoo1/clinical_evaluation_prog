DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Way, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hi Doc. Thanks. Well, it’s this pain, you see… it’s been bothering me for a bit now. Mostly in my… well, it's hard to explain exactly where, but it's pretty painful.
DOCTOR: “Pretty painful” isn’t terribly helpful, Mr. Way. Can you be more specific?
PATIENT: You're right, sorry. It’s in my lower back, mostly. But it kinda… shoots down my leg sometimes, you know? Like a… a burning feeling. It's worse when I try to stand up straight or bend over. Just everyday things, really. It’s been getting worse over the last couple of weeks, I think.
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. And how long exactly is a couple of weeks, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: Oh, geez, a couple… maybe three weeks, now that I think about it. It started kinda mild, just a little ache after working in the garden, and then it just… kept building. I didn’t really think much of it at first, thought I just pulled something.
DOCTOR: And you garden regularly?
PATIENT: Yeah, I do. My wife and I, we have a small vegetable garden. Keeps us busy, you know? Tomatoes, peppers, some beans… nothing too fancy. I mostly do the digging and heavier stuff, she handles the… delicate plants. It’s just… lately, even bending over to pull a weed is a struggle.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any numbness or tingling in your leg, besides the burning?
PATIENT: Hmm… now that you mention it, yeah, a little. Mostly in my foot, on the outside edge. It's not constant, comes and goes. Sometimes it feels kinda… prickly. Hard to describe, really. Like pins and needles, but not as strong.
DOCTOR: And how is your bowel and bladder function?
PATIENT: Oh! Uh… good. Everything’s… normal. No problems there. Sorry, that’s a… personal question, right? I just want to make sure I answer what you need to know.
DOCTOR: It’s standard, Mr. Way. Important to rule things out. Any history of back problems before?
PATIENT: Not really. Just… occasional aches and pains, like most people, I guess. I used to do a lot of lifting at work when I was younger, but nothing serious. Never saw a doctor or anything for it. Always just… worked it out. But this… this is different. It just won't go away.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's have you lie down on the exam table. I’m going to check your reflexes and range of motion. Try to relax as much as possible.
PATIENT: Okay, sure. No problem. I’ll try to relax. Where's the table at?
DOCTOR: Over there. Just lie face up, arms at your sides. I'll be right over. Now, can you tell me about any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: Oh, right, medications… um. Let me think. Just a little bit of something for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I think it’s called. And sometimes I take ibuprofen when my arthritis flares up in my hands. That's it, I think. Nothing else regularly. My wife keeps track of all that stuff, honestly. I'm not always the best at remembering.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else for that matter?
PATIENT: Nope, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. We eat everything, pretty much. My wife’s the careful one about food, too. Makes sure everything’s safe, you know? I haven't had any problems with medications either, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's start with your reflexes. Just relax your leg.
PATIENT: Okay. Go ahead. Let me know if anything hurts, okay?
DOCTOR: Two plus. And now the left. Two plus. Good. Now, I'm going to check your range of motion. Can you lift your leg straight up, keeping it straight?
PATIENT: Okay, I'm lifting it now… It’s a little uncomfortable, Doc. Kind of a sharp pain in my back when I get it up this far. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Mm-hm. And how about bending your leg at the knee and bringing your heel towards your buttocks?
PATIENT: Oof, that's worse. Right in my hamstring, and the pain’s shooting down the back of my leg again. I can't get it all the way up, Doc. It just hurts too much.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and this quick exam… it’s likely you have a muscle strain or a pinched nerve. It’s hard to say for sure without imaging. But given your age and lack of other symptoms… we can start with conservative treatment. I'm not going to order an MRI right away.
PATIENT: Okay, that makes sense, I guess. Conservative treatment... what does that involve, exactly? I’m just hoping I don’t need surgery or anything. I really just want to be able to get back to gardening with my wife.
DOCTOR: Surgery is highly unlikely at this stage, Mr. Way. Conservative treatment means rest, ice, over-the-counter pain relievers – ibuprofen or naproxen. I’m going to prescribe you a muscle relaxant, cyclobenzaprine, to take at night. Physical therapy could also be helpful, but given your insurance situation… that may be difficult. I can give you some exercises to do at home. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Okay… rest, ice, pain relievers, muscle relaxant… and home exercises. No physical therapy, probably. Yes, I think I understand. And… how long should I try all this before I see you again? Is there anything I should avoid doing in the meantime? Like, is gardening completely out of the question?
DOCTOR: Avoid heavy lifting, bending, and twisting. Gardening is probably not a good idea right now. Try to get some walking in, just to keep your muscles loose. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment in four weeks. If the pain doesn't improve, or if it gets worse… then we’ll reconsider imaging. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Four weeks… alright. Um… what if the muscle relaxant makes me really tired? I drive a lot, you know? And are there any side effects I should watch out for with the other medications? I just want to be safe.
DOCTOR: Cyclobenzaprine can cause drowsiness, so be careful when driving or operating machinery. Don’t drink alcohol while taking it. As for the other medications, ibuprofen and naproxen can cause stomach upset, so take them with food. If you experience any severe stomach pain, black stools, or allergic reaction, stop taking them immediately and seek medical attention. I’m printing out a medication information sheet for you now. Any other questions, Mr. Way?
PATIENT: Okay… drowsiness, don't drink alcohol, stomach upset, black stools. Got it. No, I think that's it for now, Doc. Thank you for your time. I appreciate you explaining everything.
DOCTOR: Alright. Follow-up in four weeks. The nurse will schedule that for you. Try to take it easy, Mr. Way. And really, listen to your body. Next!
PATIENT: Okay, will do. Thank you again, Doc. .
