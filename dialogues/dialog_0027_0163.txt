DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Vantine. Or… is it Jarvis?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor… Fazzina, is it? Yes, Jarvis is quite alright. Though, most people these days simply call me Mr. Vantine. Do sit, if you would. It’s a pleasant enough clinic you have here, very… rural, as you might say.
DOCTOR: Yes, rural… right. Well, Mr. Vantine, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor, it's a bit of an… embarrassment, truth be told. I've been experimenting with diets, shall we say. Rather extreme ones, lately. I thought it best to have a professional opinion before I… well, before I did any further foolishness. I'm rather concerned I might be doing myself harm. It’s all a bit… much, really.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in. Many people try different things, and it's always best to be safe. So, you mentioned “extreme diets”. Can you tell me a little more about what those diets involve?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Where to begin… Well, first there was the, ah, the “Moon Diet”. Quite restrictive, only consuming foods allegedly favoured by lunar deities. Mostly white fruits and… well, it was rather bland, honestly. That lasted three days. Then, naturally, there was the “Breatharian” phase. I attempted to subsist solely on sunlight and… air. That was, predictably, even shorter. And most recently, I’ve been following a diet based entirely on foods mentioned in Shakespeare’s plays. Though, I confess, identifying precisely what constitutes a “sack of apples” is proving… problematic. I apologize for the rambling. It all seems rather ridiculous when spoken aloud.
DOCTOR: Right… Shakespeare, yes. And the others… Well, it sounds like you’ve been through quite a lot recently. To clarify, how long have you been experimenting with these diets in total?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… the Moon Diet was… February, I believe. So, roughly six months now. It's not been constant, mind you. There were periods of… normalcy, shall we say? Though even those included rather dubious "detox" regimes involving various herbal teas. I’m afraid I’ve always been prone to… enthusiasm. It’s the Breatharian one that troubles me the most, looking back. I realize now how utterly foolish it was. I was rather lightheaded, I recall. And quite irritable.
DOCTOR: Okay. Six months, with some breaks… and the Breatharian diet causing lightheadedness and irritability. Are you currently on any of these diets right now, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, thankfully not. I’ve ceased all active experimentation, as of… well, about a week ago. I felt quite dreadful, to be frank. And my housekeeper, Mrs. Higgins, threatened to resign if I attempted another “theatrical” menu. So, I’ve returned to a… more conventional diet. Toast and tea, mostly. Though I must confess, I do miss a good roast dinner. Do you think the lightheadedness requires further investigation? I do have a rather low blood pressure, generally.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It’s good you’ve stopped the diets. And Mrs. Higgins sounds like a wise woman. Regarding the lightheadedness… given your history of low blood pressure, it could be related to that. But, with the recent diets, we need to rule out some other possibilities. Before we go further, can you tell me about any other symptoms you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Let me see… Well, my energy levels have been… fluctuating, naturally. I tire rather easily, though I attribute that to my age, mostly. I’ve also been rather… cold, lately. Even in the summer! And my skin feels rather dry. Oh, and my hair… it’s been thinning for years, but it seems to have accelerated somewhat recently. I also find myself forgetting where I've placed my spectacles, quite frequently. Though, I've always had a somewhat… porous memory. It’s rather frustrating, I assure you. Do you think these are related to the diets, or simply… the ravages of time?
DOCTOR: Okay. Fluctuating energy, feeling cold, dry skin, hair thinning… and some memory issues. It's hard to say definitively whether it’s solely the diets, or age-related changes. However, extreme dieting can certainly exacerbate these symptoms. Let’s do a quick physical exam, and then I’d like to order some blood work just to get a clearer picture. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly sensible. A thorough examination and some blood work… quite right, quite right. I’m entirely at your disposal. I do hope it doesn’t involve too much… poking and prodding? I'm not particularly fond of needles, if I may be candid. Though, I understand it’s all in the name of good health. Shall we proceed?
DOCTOR: Certainly. We’ll keep it as comfortable as possible, Mr. Vantine. And the blood work is fairly minimal. First, let’s check your vital signs – your blood pressure, pulse, temperature, and respiration rate. Then I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick examination of your thyroid. After that, we'll just take a look at your skin and check your reflexes. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly reasonable. A standard examination, as it were. My vital signs… I imagine my blood pressure will be rather low, as I mentioned. And my pulse… well, it’s generally a bit… irregular. A family trait, I'm afraid. Though I assure you, I’m not particularly bothered by it. Do proceed at your leisure. I shall endeavor to remain as still as possible. Though, I may occasionally wander off in thought. Forgive me if I do.
DOCTOR: No problem at all, Mr. Vantine. Take your time. Alright, let’s see… Blood pressure is 110/70, which is on the lower side, as you suspected. Pulse is 72 and slightly irregular, but nothing too concerning at the moment. Temperature is normal at 98.6, and respiration is 16 breaths per minute. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs… could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. A deep breath… inhales deeply There we are. I do hope I’m not making a terrible racket? My lungs have always been rather… expansive. I was quite the swimmer in my youth. Though my form, I suspect, was atrocious. And the water… terribly cold, even in the summer months! Do continue with the examination. I trust you are detecting nothing untoward? exhales slowly
DOCTOR: No racket at all, Mr. Vantine. Your lungs sound clear, thankfully. A bit of diminished breath sounds on the periphery, but that’s not uncommon, especially with age. Now, let’s check your thyroid… Could you please tilt your head back slightly?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Tilting my head back… cranes neck slightly There we are. My thyroid… I believe my mother had some trouble with hers, years ago. Though I confess, I don’t recall the precise details. Something about… swelling, perhaps? It’s all rather vague, I’m afraid. I’ve never been particularly good with medical terminology. Do proceed. I trust you’re finding nothing alarming? holds head back steadily
DOCTOR: Your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, but there are no obvious nodules or tenderness. It's not immediately concerning, but we'll want to check it with the blood work to rule out any thyroid issues. Now, let’s just take a quick look at your skin and check your reflexes. Could you please extend your arms out in front of you?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Extending my arms… holds arms outstretched, palms upward There we are. My skin… rather dry, as I mentioned. And rather… papery, perhaps? I’ve always been prone to dryness. I use a rather expensive moisturizer, but it seems to have limited effect. Do check away. I trust you're not detecting any… unusual growths? I've always been rather careful in the sun, though I confess I did indulge in a rather reckless tan in my youth. flexes fingers slightly
DOCTOR: Your skin is indeed dry, and there’s some loss of elasticity, which is expected with age. No unusual growths or moles to be concerned about. Your reflexes are slightly diminished, but within normal limits for your age. Alright, Mr. Vantine, that completes the physical exam. Now, let's talk about the blood work. We'll check your complete blood count, thyroid function, electrolytes, kidney function, and vitamin levels, including Vitamin D and B12. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly comprehensive. A thorough examination of my inner workings… quite right. Complete blood count, thyroid function, electrolytes, kidney function, and vitamin levels… Yes, that covers everything, I believe. And you mentioned Vitamin D and B12? Good. I've always suspected a deficiency in those. I don’t get out much, you see. Mostly confined to the house with my books. pauses When would I be able to expect the results? And will I need to fast beforehand? I do enjoy my morning toast, you see.
DOCTOR: Yes, Vitamin D and B12 are important. You don't need to fast beforehand, Mr. Vantine. You can eat and drink as normal. The results should be back in about 3 to 5 business days. Once we have those, we'll schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them in detail. In the meantime, I'd recommend continuing with your normal diet, and perhaps try to get a little more sunlight if possible, even just a short walk outside. Is there anything else I can address for you today, Mr. Vantine?
PATIENT: Excellent. No fasting, that’s a relief. And a short walk… yes, I suppose I could manage that. Mrs. Higgins would be delighted. She’s always urging me to get more fresh air. pauses, considering I believe that covers everything, Doctor. Thank you for your thorough examination and your… patience. It’s comforting to know that someone is taking my… eccentricities seriously. You have been most helpful. I shall await your call with anticipation. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Vantine. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. And please, enjoy your toast. Have a good day.
