DOCTOR: Hi Mackenzi, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: It’s a pleasure to meet you as well, Doctor. Well… it’s about a surgery I’m considering. I need to make sure I’m… healthy enough for it, I suppose. It’s a bit difficult to explain, honestly. It was… a while ago when we first discussed it with the surgeon, and my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: Okay, no worries at all. We can definitely go over everything at your pace. It’s completely normal to not remember every detail, especially when it was some time ago. To start, can you tell me a little bit about what surgery you’re considering?
PATIENT: It’s… facial reconstruction. Or, well, that’s what the surgeon called it. It’s… to repair some damage. From an accident. A long time ago. I… I wish I could be more specific, but it’s all a bit… hazy. It involved my cheekbone, I believe. And… some other things. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It does, yes. Facial reconstruction after an accident. That gives me a good starting point. Okay. And roughly when did this accident happen, if you recall?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s… difficult. I believe it was… sometime after my husband passed. So… more than five years ago, certainly. Perhaps closer to seven? It was… before we moved to the countryside. I truly wish I could pinpoint the date. It feels like a lifetime ago. I apologize for being so vague, Doctor.
DOCTOR: No, don’t apologize at all, Mackenzi. Seven years ago is helpful. We'll get there. So, the surgery is being considered now, after seven years. Has anything changed recently that’s prompted you to revisit this now?
PATIENT: Well… yes, actually. The surgeon, he’s… he’s retiring. And another doctor is taking over his practice. He… reviewed my file, and he wants a full clearance before proceeding. He’s very thorough, which I appreciate. I suppose… it felt like a good time to finally… address it. It’s something I’ve put off for a long time, honestly. I didn't want to go through it without feeling completely ready, and now it feels like I have to.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense. A change in surgeons is a very valid reason to get a full check-up. Okay. So, let's talk about your overall health. Do you have any current medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. Not that I’m aware of. I’ve always been… relatively healthy. I take vitamins, of course, and I try to eat well… mostly. I did have some trouble with… dizziness, a few years ago, but it passed. It wasn’t anything serious, the doctor said. Just… inner ear issues, I think. Aside from that, I’ve been quite fortunate, thankfully. I do have… some anxiety, but nothing that requires medication. Is that something I should mention?
DOCTOR: Yes, anxiety is definitely something to mention, Mackenzi. It's important to have a full picture. And it’s good to hear you’ve been relatively healthy otherwise. Let's talk about that dizziness a little more. When did it happen?
PATIENT: It was… about three years ago, I think. It came on suddenly, a few times over a couple of weeks. It wasn't constant, just… episodes. It felt like the room was spinning. I went to see a doctor in town, and he said it was likely a virus affecting my inner ear. He recommended some exercises… and rest. It did get better on its own, thankfully. It hasn't bothered me since, but it was quite frightening at the time. I haven't had any issues with balance or anything like that.
DOCTOR: Okay. That’s helpful. So, dizziness about three years ago, resolved with rest and exercises, no recurrence. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications, over-the-counter medications, or herbal supplements?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I… I try to avoid taking anything if I can. I take a multivitamin every morning, and occasionally some ibuprofen for… aches and pains from the gardening work. But that’s it, truly. I don't have any regular prescriptions. I used to take something for… sleep, a long time ago, but I stopped that years ago. I prefer to… manage things naturally, if possible.
DOCTOR: Okay. Just the multivitamin and occasional ibuprofen. No past regular medications. Good. Now, let’s talk about allergies. Do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, latex, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm… not that I’m aware of. I've never had a serious allergic reaction. I'm a little sensitive to certain perfumes, sometimes they give me a headache, but that’s not an allergy, is it? I’ve never had any problems with food or medications. I did have a rash once, when I was a child, from poison ivy, but that doesn't count, does it? I apologize, I seem to be listing everything except actual allergies!
DOCTOR: No, no need to apologize, Mackenzi. Poison ivy doesn’t count! And sensitivity to perfumes isn’t an allergy either. It sounds like you genuinely don’t have any known allergies. Okay, that’s good to know. Let's talk a bit about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than the childhood incident, or had any major illnesses or surgeries?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I did have my tonsils removed when I was younger, but that was… a very long time ago. And… I was briefly hospitalized after the accident, of course. But that was mostly for observation and to stabilize things. Aside from that… no, not that I recall. I’ve been… quite fortunate, thankfully. I’ve never had any serious illnesses, like heart problems or diabetes or anything like that. I had the usual childhood illnesses, but nothing major. Is there anything specific I should be thinking about?
DOCTOR: No, you’re doing great. Just trying to get a complete picture. Tonsils out as a child, brief hospitalization after the accident. Okay. Now, regarding family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, or mental health conditions?
PATIENT: That's… a difficult question. My mother… she had high blood pressure, I believe, towards the end of her life. And my father… he had some heart trouble, but it wasn’t diagnosed until he was quite old. My grandmother, on my mother’s side, she had… dementia, I think. But aside from that… no, not that I recall. My family… wasn’t particularly prone to illness, thankfully. We weren't a very large family, so there weren't many people to… pass things down from, if that makes sense. It's… hazy, Doctor. I apologize for being so vague.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Mackenzi. No need to apologize at all. High blood pressure in your mother, heart trouble in your father, dementia in your grandmother. We can document that. Okay. Now, let's talk a little bit about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Absolutely not, Doctor. Never. I find those things… quite unpleasant, to be honest. I’ve always been very careful about my health. I enjoy a healthy diet, and I get plenty of exercise from the gardening work. I find peace and contentment in… simple things. I don't need anything else to… complicate things. I apologize, I’m being rather… verbose today, aren’t I?
DOCTOR: Not at all, Mackenzi. You're providing very thorough information, which I appreciate. No smoking, no alcohol, no recreational drugs. Very healthy lifestyle. Okay. And finally, let's just quickly cover your current living situation and support system. Do you live alone or with someone?
PATIENT: I live alone, Doctor. My husband… passed away several years ago. It’s just been me since then. I have a few… distant relatives, but they live far away. I have friends, of course, but… they all have their own lives. I manage on my own. I’m quite independent, and I enjoy my solitude. It’s… peaceful. But it can be… lonely, sometimes. But I’m okay. I truly am.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Mackenzi. I appreciate your openness. It's good to know you have friends, even if you manage on your own for the most part. Okay. Well, that covers a lot of important information. Now, let's do a quick physical exam. I'll just listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and take a look at the area of the previous injury, if you don't mind. It’s just to get a baseline, and to see how things are healing. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly alright. Please, proceed. I… I’m ready. Though, I must warn you, I’m not very good with medical instruments. They always make me a little… anxious. But I’ll try my best to remain still. I do appreciate you taking the time to do a thorough examination. It makes me feel… safer.
DOCTOR: Of course. And we'll go as slow as you need. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. First, let's check your blood pressure. Okay, your blood pressure is 128 over 76, which is excellent. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Your heart sounds regular and strong. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Good. Now, can you please sit up and turn your head slightly?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? It… sometimes feels a little stiff on this side. Especially in the mornings. But it doesn’t hurt, not usually. It’s just… a discomfort. I try not to move it too much.
DOCTOR: Okay. There is a slight tenderness when I press here, and I do notice a subtle asymmetry in your facial muscles, but nothing overly concerning. There’s no visible swelling or bruising. It appears the bone has healed well, but there may be some residual muscle tightness. Alright, that completes the basic physical exam. I'd like to order some blood work to get a more comprehensive picture of your overall health. It'll include a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, and a thyroid panel. It's just to rule out any underlying issues. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly sensible. Blood work is fine. Whatever you think is best. I… I trust your judgment. Is there anything I need to do to prepare for it? Fasting, or anything like that? I want to make sure I do it correctly. I apologize for being so… meticulous, but I do like to be prepared.
DOCTOR: No need to apologize at all, Mackenzi. Meticulous is good! For this blood work, you will need to fast for 12 hours beforehand. That means no food or sugary drinks – just water is fine. You can still take your regular medications, though. The lab will give you specific instructions when you go, but that’s the gist of it. I’ll send the order to the lab now, and they can schedule you for an appointment. We'll review the results once they come back, and then we can discuss the next steps regarding your surgery clearance. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That sounds… perfectly alright. Fasting for 12 hours is… manageable. I can certainly do that. Thank you for being so thorough, and for explaining everything so clearly. It… eases my mind considerably. I appreciate your patience, and your kindness. I suppose… there’s nothing else I need to do for now?
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mackenzi. I’m glad I could ease your mind. No, nothing else for now. Just schedule your blood work appointment when you have a chance. Once the results come back, my nurse will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to call the office. Is there anything I can help you with before you go?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. That’s… everything. You’ve been wonderfully helpful. Thank you again, for everything. I… I truly appreciate your time and your expertise. I suppose… I’ll be seeing you soon, then. Goodbye.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mackenzi. I look forward to seeing you at your follow-up. Take care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Goodbye.
