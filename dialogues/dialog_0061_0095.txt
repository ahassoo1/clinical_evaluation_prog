DOCTOR: Bula! Hello Stephane, it’s lovely to meet you. I’m Dr. Kimm. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly, I don’t have time for pleasantries. It’s… a problem. I woke up this morning and I can’t hear out of my right ear. And my face… it feels droopy on that side. It’s quite alarming, really. I suppose that’s why I’m here, though I’d rather be anywhere else.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. That is alarming, and you’re right to come in immediately. Sudden hearing loss and facial drooping are definitely things we need to check out quickly. To get a better understanding, can you tell me exactly when you first noticed the hearing loss and the drooping?
PATIENT: This morning. I told you. Around… seven o'clock, I suppose. I was getting ready for the day, and it was just… gone. The hearing, I mean. And then I looked in the mirror, and that side of my face… well, it wasn't right. Don’t you think that’s obvious? I don't understand why I need to repeat myself.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to be concerned, and I apologize for making you repeat yourself. It is obvious, and I just need to gather some details to help figure out what’s going on. It’s good you came in right away. Okay, so around seven this morning. Has anything like this ever happened before?
PATIENT: No, absolutely not. I’ve never experienced anything like this in my life. And frankly, I’m a very healthy woman. I eat well, I exercise… well, I used to exercise more before my husband passed, but still. This is… unsettling. And I really don’t have time for illnesses. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your husband. Losing someone is incredibly difficult. And I understand your frustration with this happening, especially when you're busy. Okay, so this is a new symptom for you, started this morning. Besides the hearing loss and facial drooping, have you noticed anything else?
PATIENT: No. Just… that. I haven’t felt unwell, no fever, no headache, nothing. Just this… this inconvenience. Look, are we going to find out what’s wrong or are we going to play twenty questions all day? I have an appointment with my accountant later.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your patience, Stephane. We are going to find out what’s going on, and I’ll be as efficient as I can. Okay, let’s do a quick exam. I'm going to check your ears, your eyes, and do a little neurological assessment to see how your facial nerves are functioning. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get on with it. The sooner this is over, the better. Honestly, I don't understand why you need to examine my eyes. What does my vision have to do with my ear? It feels like you're wasting my time.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Stephane. Checking your eyes helps me assess the nerves that control facial function, which are closely connected to the nerve affecting your ear. It helps rule out other possibilities and get a clearer picture of what's happening. It’s a standard part of the assessment for these types of symptoms. Okay, your ear canal looks clear, no obvious signs of infection or blockage. Now, I'm going to check your eyes, and then ask you to smile, frown, and close your eyes tightly for me. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, just hurry. I have important things to attend to. And be gentle, I don’t want any unnecessary discomfort. Honestly, young doctors these days… always so thorough. It feels like a waste of perfectly good time.
DOCTOR: Okay, your pupils are equal and react to light, and your eye movements seem normal. Now, if you could smile for me, please. And then frown. Okay… and now, could you close your eyes tightly for me?
PATIENT: There. Is that enough? Honestly, it's rather irritating trying to cooperate with all this. And my face feels… strange when I try to do that. You're probably just going to tell me it's stress, aren’t you? That's what everyone says.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you. I see what you mean about it feeling strange. And I understand your frustration. Based on what you've told me and what I’m seeing during the exam – the sudden hearing loss, the facial drooping, the difficulty closing your eye completely – I'm concerned about Bell’s Palsy. It’s a condition where the facial nerve becomes inflamed, causing weakness or paralysis on one side of the face. However, it's crucially important to rule out other possibilities, like a stroke. We need to do some further testing. I'm going to order a stat CT scan of your head to rule out anything more serious. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A scan? Honestly, all this fuss over… what was it called? Bell's Palsy? I suppose if you insist. But I expect this to be a quick process. I have a very busy schedule, as you know. And who pays for all this, anyway? I don't have insurance. This is just… dreadful. Is it contagious?
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Stephane. A CT scan is the best way to ensure we get the right diagnosis quickly. It will give us a clear picture of what's happening in your head. Bell's Palsy itself isn’t contagious. It’s not caused by an infection, so you don't need to worry about spreading it to anyone. Regarding the cost, let’s talk about that. Since you don’t have insurance, the clinic has a financial assistance program, and we can explore that option. We also have a social worker who can help you navigate potential resources. For now, let’s focus on getting the scan done. The radiology department is just down the hall. I’ll write the order for you now, and a technician will get you set up. It’s a quick, painless procedure. We’ll get the results back as quickly as possible. And we'll discuss treatment options once we have the scan results. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. Honestly, all this talk about financial assistance is just… embarrassing. I’ve always taken care of myself. A scan, then what? Will I be able to go to my appointment? This is just… incredibly inconvenient. And I really need to call my accountant. Can I at least make a phone call before I go down there?
DOCTOR: I completely understand your frustration and I apologize if discussing financial assistance felt embarrassing. It's simply a resource we offer to all our patients. You absolutely can make a phone call before you go down for the scan. Let me quickly write the order, and I'll bring you a chair near the window where you can make your call. Here's the order, and there’s a chair over there by the window. After the scan, we'll review the results together and discuss a treatment plan. Whether you'll be able to make your appointment will depend on the results and how you're feeling, but we'll do everything we can to accommodate you. Please let me know if you have any questions while you're waiting, and I’ll be right here. Take your time.
PATIENT: Fine. Thank you. Though I doubt it will be a pleasant experience. Honestly, I’ve never understood why doctors need to make everything so complicated. A simple ailment, turned into a whole ordeal. .
