DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. I’m Dr. Pitmon. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you. Dr. Pitmon, is it? Well, it's this tiredness, you see. Just… utterly draining. Been going on for weeks now, I think. Honestly, time blurs together these days. It's not like a normal tired, it's… deeper. Like all my strength is just gone. My husband keeps saying I need to rest more, but honestly, I am resting! It's just… there. And the young man at the lab said something about my… numbers being off. Something about my muscles? I don't really follow all that fancy talk.
DOCTOR: Right. “Deeper tiredness,” and your “numbers being off” from the lab. That’s helpful to know. And you said this has been going on for weeks… can you give me a rough estimate?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Weeks… well, let me think. Before the heat really started, I believe. So, July, maybe? Perhaps late June? It’s all a bit of a muddle. My memory isn't what it used to be, you know. Though I do remember being perfectly capable just… not long ago. It’s frustrating, really. I used to be so active, always puttering about. Now… barely enough energy to make a cup of tea.
DOCTOR: Alright, so roughly around late June, early July it started. A noticeable change in your energy levels, and it's impacting your daily activities. And you’ve noticed a decline in your memory as well. Just to clarify, when you say “memory decline,” are you having trouble with recent events, or more long-term memories?
PATIENT: Oh, it’s not that I’ve forgotten things, not entirely. More like… they don’t stick. I’ll be telling a story, and the next thing I know, I’ve lost my place. Or I’ll go to the shop for something, and completely forget what it was once I get there. It’s not like I don’t know what a teacup is, or who my husband is! It’s just… fleeting. And frankly, it’s making me feel quite foolish. It’s not the sort of thing a sensible woman forgets, is it?
DOCTOR: No, it’s not ideal, certainly. It’s good that you’re aware of these changes. So, primarily difficulty with recall – remembering things you’ve just done or said. Now, aside from the tiredness and memory issues, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Hmm. Well, my muscles ache a bit, sometimes. Not constantly, but… after I’ve been trying to do something, you know? Even simple things. And I've been a bit more… clumsy than usual, I suppose. Dropped a perfectly good plate just last week. My husband said it was just my age, but I’ve always been quite steady on my feet. Oh, and a bit of a cough, but that could just be the dust. We live near a building site, you see. It's always something.
DOCTOR: Right. Muscle aches, increased clumsiness, and a cough potentially related to dust exposure. Now, regarding your cough, is it productive – meaning do you cough anything up?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, sometimes. Mostly just… phlegm. A bit of a grayish color, if I'm being honest. Not much, mind you. Just enough to be bothersome. And it's worse in the mornings, naturally. It’s a nuisance, really. I don’t want to bother you with all these little complaints. It’s probably nothing, just old age catching up with me. You see so many of these things when you get to be my age. It's all going downhill, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Well, we need to rule things out, Ms. Oitker, and determine if this is just age-related changes or something else. Let's move on to your medical history. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a long list, I suppose. I had my gallbladder out, years ago. And arthritis, of course. Who doesn’t have arthritis at my age? Nothing too serious, nothing that needed constant attention. Oh, and high blood pressure, but it’s been managed with… with a little pill, I think. My husband handles all the medication, you see. I don't really pay much attention to those things. It's all just… a blur of pills and appointments. He says I'm very good at resting, which is probably true.
DOCTOR: Right. Cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal, arthritis, and hypertension. Do you happen to know the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking me something. It’s a little white pill, I think. Maybe pink? Or blue? Honestly, they all look the same after a while. My husband keeps them in a little container, labeled, of course. I wouldn't know which one it is. He's the organized one, you see. I just take what he gives me, when he tells me to. I’m quite hopeless with these things. It’s probably best you ask him directly, really. He has a much better memory than I do.
DOCTOR: Alright. We will verify the medication list with your husband. Now, any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? Oh, I don't think so. I’ve never really had a reaction to anything, not that I recall. Perhaps a slight rash once, years ago, but my husband said it was just the soap. He’s very good at diagnosing things, you see. I wouldn’t even know what an allergy feels like, to be honest. I just try to avoid things that make me feel unwell, which is mostly everything these days.
DOCTOR: Alright. No known allergies. Now, Ms. Oitker, I’d like to perform a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to check your reflexes, listen to your heart and lungs, and feel for any swelling. It will only take a few minutes.
PATIENT: Oh, very well. As long as it doesn't involve anything… invasive. I’ve never been fond of needles. And try to be gentle, please. My bones are rather fragile these days, you know. A bit of a bump and I bruise like a peach. My husband says I’m getting to be like an old teapot.
DOCTOR: Certainly. No needles today, I assure you. Just a simple assessment. If you could please sit up on the examination table, that would be great. I’m going to start by listening to your heart and lungs. …Heart sounds are regular, but slightly diminished. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally, though breath sounds are a bit coarse. I'm noting a slight cough, as you mentioned. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Could you extend your arms, please?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. As long as it doesn't take too long. My arms get tired very easily, you see. And try to be gentle, please. Everything feels so… achy these days. There. Is that alright? I hope I’m not making a fuss. It’s just… everything feels so fragile these days. A bit like an old porcelain doll, my husband says. Though I don’t think porcelain dolls cough, do they?
DOCTOR: …Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, a bit diminished, but within normal limits for your age. No clonus noted. Muscle strength is 4/5 in all extremities, slightly reduced, but not significantly. I'm noting some mild edema in your lower extremities. Alright, Ms. Oitker. That’s all for the physical exam. Now, based on your symptoms – the persistent tiredness, muscle aches, memory issues, slight cough, and the findings from the exam – I'd like to order some blood work. Specifically, a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and a vitamin D level. This will help us rule out several potential causes for your symptoms. We'll also need a chest X-ray to evaluate your lungs further, given the cough.
PATIENT: Oh dear. So many tests? It all sounds rather… involved. Are you sure it’s necessary? It's just… I don't like being poked and prodded, you know? And I get very nervous around hospitals. My husband says I’m a bit of a worrier. Is it something serious, Doctor? You can tell me, you know. I’d rather know the truth, however unpleasant it may be.
DOCTOR: Ms. Oitker, I understand your concerns, but these tests are necessary to determine the cause of your symptoms. It's premature to assume anything serious, but we need to rule out several possibilities, including anemia, thyroid issues, vitamin deficiencies, and potential lung problems. These are relatively common causes of tiredness and muscle weakness, especially in patients your age. The tests are not invasive – just a simple blood draw and a quick X-ray. I will personally review the results and discuss them with you in detail, and we will develop a treatment plan accordingly. Right now, I can’t tell you definitively what’s wrong, and I don’t want to speculate without concrete evidence. But it’s important to address these symptoms promptly to improve your quality of life. Would you like me to explain the tests in more detail, or perhaps have your husband here with you when we discuss them?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. You’re right, of course. It’s probably nothing, just a bit of a fright. I do worry terribly, you see. Yes, perhaps having my husband here would be best. He's much better at understanding all the… technical details. He always asks the right questions. I tend to get flustered easily. Could you explain it to him, then? He usually can make sense of everything. And… and could you write it down? He likes to have a list, you know. A nice, organized list. It helps him keep track of things.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I'll prepare a detailed list outlining the tests, their purpose, and what to expect. I'll also include my contact information should you have any questions. I'll need your husband’s name and contact number to schedule the tests. In the meantime, I’m going to prescribe a mild cough suppressant to help alleviate your symptoms. It’s just temporary, until we have the test results. And try to get as much rest as possible, Ms. Oitker. Now, can you please spell out your husband's full name and provide his contact number?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. His name is Arun Oitker. O-I-T-K-E-R. Arun, like… dawn. He’s a very early riser, you see. And his number is… let me see… 555-123-4567. Yes, that's it. 555-123-4567. He’s usually quite good with remembering numbers, but I’m afraid I’m a bit… forgetful, as you’ve probably noticed.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Oitker, here is the list of tests and a brief explanation for your husband. I’ve also included my contact information. The lab results will take approximately three to five business days to return. Once I have them, I will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or high fever, please seek immediate medical attention. Do you have any questions for me before you leave?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You've explained everything very clearly. Arun will handle all the… the details, you know. He always does. Thank you, Doctor Pitmon. You've been very kind. And please, don’t worry about me too much. I’m sure it’s nothing serious. Just… old age catching up, as my husband says.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Oitker. Please take care, and don’t hesitate to contact my office if you have any concerns. We'll get to the bottom of this. .
