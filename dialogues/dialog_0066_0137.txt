DOCTOR: Hi Lindra, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Condray. Thanks for coming in today. So, what brings you in to see me?
PATIENT: Hello Doctor. Is good to meet you too. My husband… he think I need to go to a… a place for old people? For live. He want me to… check first with you, yes? To make sure is okay.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your husband is concerned about whether a transition to a care facility might be a good idea, and he wanted you to get my opinion first. That's very thoughtful of both of you. To help me understand things better, can you tell me a little bit about what's been going on?
PATIENT: Hmm. Well… I live with my husband, Miguel, for many years. We have a big house, but is too much work for me now. I forget things sometimes… not big things, you know? Like where I put my glasses. Or what I eat for breakfast. But Miguel… he worry. He say I need help. He do everything… cooking, cleaning, the garden… is too much for him too. He want to relax a little.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it sounds like you're still living at home with Miguel, and he's taking on a lot of the household responsibilities. You've noticed some memory lapses – forgetting things like where you put your glasses or what you had for breakfast – and he's concerned about that. That's a very common concern, Lindra. It’s good that you're both talking about it. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me a little more about when you started noticing these memory issues?
PATIENT: Hmm… when? Is hard to say exactly. Maybe… six months ago? Or more? Is little by little. First, I forget where I put things. Then… I forget names sometimes. Not my husband’s name, no! But… the neighbor’s son’s name. Little things like that. Is not every day, you know? Some days is good, some days… not so good.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it’s been gradually happening over about six months, with some variability from day to day. That's helpful to know. And you said it's mostly with names and misplacing things?
PATIENT: Yes, mostly. And… sometimes I have trouble find the right words. When I speak… the words… they hide! But only for a little bit. My husband… he understand me. He have patience. But I worry. Is scary when the words no come.
DOCTOR: I understand that must be frustrating and concerning, Lindra. It’s good that Miguel is so supportive. So, difficulty finding the right words occasionally. To help me get a complete picture, let's talk a little bit more broadly. Have you noticed any changes in other areas, like your energy levels, sleep, or appetite?
PATIENT: Hmm. My energy… is not like before. I get tired easy. I used to walk in the garden all day… now I need to sit down after little bit. Sleep… is okay, mostly. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of night, but I go back to sleep. And eat… my appetite is good. I like to cook, I still cook for Miguel. But… I no eat as much as before. Maybe because I tired.
DOCTOR: Okay, so decreased energy levels, some trouble sleeping occasionally, and a slightly decreased appetite but still enjoying meals. Now, thinking about your medical history – have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. High blood pressure… yes, Doctor. Many years ago. I take the pills for that, every day. And… arthritis in my hands. Is why I no can do much gardening now. But that is old. The doctor give me something for that too. I think… that is all. I go to the doctor every six months for check-up.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you have a history of high blood pressure, which you manage with medication, and arthritis in your hands. That's helpful to know. And you see your doctor regularly for check-ups. Let me just pull up your records to confirm that… Okay, yes, I see the high blood pressure and arthritis here. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm... surgeries? No, not really. When I was young, I have my tonsils out. But that was very long time ago. Hospitalized… maybe when I have the baby? I think so. But that was long time ago too. No hospital since then. Nothing serious.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy as a child and hospitalized for childbirth many years ago, but no recent hospitalizations or surgeries. Good. Now, can you tell me about your family’s medical history?
PATIENT: Hmm... my mother… she have the sugar sickness, you know? Diabetes. And she forget things sometimes when she get old. My father… he have the heart problems. He die when he was young, from the heart. And my sister… she have the high blood pressure, like me.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a family history of diabetes, memory problems, and high blood pressure. That’s good to know. Now, just to be complete, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I no have allergies. I eat everything. I take the pills from the doctor… no problem with that. Never have any reaction. I’m lucky.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That’s good. Alright, Lindra. I’m going to ask you a few questions and do a quick physical exam. This will help me understand what might be going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is okay. You ask what you need. I want to know if I’m okay. Is good you check.
DOCTOR: Great. Let's start with some simple questions. First, can you tell me today’s date?
PATIENT: Hmm... Today is... August… two? August two, 2025, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s right. Good. And where are we right now?
PATIENT: Hmm… is the doctor’s office? Is Doctor Condray’s office. In the… rural place? Is a small town, yes?
DOCTOR: Yes, you're right, this is my office in the rural clinic. Excellent. Now, I'm going to do a brief physical exam. I’ll check your blood pressure, pulse, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a quick neurological exam. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. That is fine. Do what you need to do. I trust you.
DOCTOR: Okay, great. Blood pressure is 135/80. A little elevated, but not unexpected with a history of hypertension. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear. Reflexes are normal. Balance seems stable. I’m going to ask you to follow my finger with your eyes. Don't move your head, just follow my finger. Okay good. Now I will touch your face and hands to see if you can feel it. Can you tell me when I touch you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. I feel it. Here… and here… and here. I can feel it when you touch my hand. And my face… yes, I feel that too.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. Your sensation seems intact. Everything seems within normal limits for now. Your basic neurological function appears to be fine. Now, based on what you've told me and what I've found during the exam, it's difficult to say definitively what's going on. The memory lapses and mild fatigue could be related to a number of things – stress, medication side effects, vitamin deficiencies, or even normal age-related changes. However, given your family history, it's important to rule out other possibilities, such as early stages of cognitive impairment.
PATIENT: Hmm. Cognitive… what? Is that bad, Doctor? Is that like… forget things more? My husband… he worried about that. He say his mother… she have that.
DOCTOR: Cognitive impairment just means a decline in mental function, like memory, thinking, or judgment. It can range from mild to severe. And yes, it can be related to conditions like dementia, which is what your husband’s mother may have experienced. But it’s important not to jump to conclusions. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order some blood tests to check for vitamin deficiencies, thyroid problems, and other potential causes of cognitive changes. I also want to order a cognitive assessment – a short test that will evaluate your memory and thinking skills. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. If you think is good, then I want to do it. If the tests help me know what is going on, then I want to do them. I want to know why I forget things. And I want to make my husband happy, yes? If I am okay, then he will be happy.
DOCTOR: That’s a very good attitude, Lindra. And you’re absolutely right – getting to the bottom of this is the best way to ease everyone's mind. Okay, I'm ordering the blood tests and scheduling you for a cognitive assessment with our nurse practitioner, Maria, next week. She’s very good and will explain everything to you. In the meantime, I want you to continue taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed. And try to get plenty of rest and stay active. We’ll review the test results together once they come back. Does that sound good?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor. Is good. I will take the pills and rest. And I see Maria next week. Thank you. I feel a little better now, just knowing we are doing something. My husband will be happy to hear you are helping.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lindra. I'm glad I could help, even if it's just to start the process of figuring things out. I’ll have the receptionist schedule that appointment for you on your way out. Here’s a requisition for the blood tests. You can go to the lab at the hospital whenever it’s convenient for you. If you have any questions or concerns before your appointment with Maria, please don’t hesitate to call the office. Do you have any questions for me right now before you leave?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. I think you explain everything very well. I no have any questions. Just… thank you again for seeing me. You are very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Lindra. It was a pleasure meeting you. And remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Take care and I’ll see you next week.
PATIENT:
