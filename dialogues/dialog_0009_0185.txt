DOCTOR: Good morning, Zelina. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Petrimoulx. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Ugh, morning. Look, it’s my breath. It smells. Badly. Honestly, I don't have time for this, but my ex-husband kept complaining about it, so… here I am. Is that enough information?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly alright. It’s good you’re addressing it. It can be quite bothersome, and it's better to figure out what's going on. “Bad breath,” or halitosis, can have a lot of different causes. To get a better idea of what might be happening with you, could you tell me a little more about when you first noticed it?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't remember exactly. It’s not like I’m constantly sniffing my own breath. Probably a few months ago? It just… started being a thing. He'd pull away when we kissed, or make a face. It was embarrassing. Look, I just want a quick fix, if that’s possible. Do you have like… a spray or something?
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, and wanting a quick solution is perfectly reasonable. We can certainly explore some immediate options, but it's important to try and understand the cause of the bad breath to make sure it doesn’t indicate something else going on. A few months ago is helpful. Has anything changed in your routine around that time?
PATIENT: Routine? Not really. I mean, I got divorced, if that counts. That was… stressful. Does stress give you bad breath? I mostly just go to work, come home, sleep. Highway maintenance isn't exactly glamorous, so I wouldn't say I'm out socializing a lot. I eat… normal stuff. Nothing fancy. Look, I'm not one for dwelling on details, okay?
DOCTOR: I understand. A major life change like a divorce can definitely contribute to things, even something like breath. Stress can dry out your mouth, which can lead to bad breath. And highway maintenance… that sounds physically demanding. Just to clarify, when you say "normal stuff" with your diet, are you able to give me a typical day's worth of what you eat and drink?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Breakfast is usually just coffee. Black. Sometimes a pastry from the gas station, if I’m running late. Lunch is a sandwich, usually ham and cheese. And dinner… varies. Leftovers, frozen meals, sometimes I get takeout. I drink a lot of coffee throughout the day. And water, I guess. When I remember. Honestly, it's not like I’m a health nut. Is that what you want to hear?
DOCTOR: No, it’s good to be honest. That gives me a much clearer picture. The coffee is a good thing to know; it can definitely contribute to dry mouth and, therefore, bad breath. Now, let's talk about your oral hygiene. Can you tell me about your routine – how often do you brush, floss, and do you use any mouthwash?
PATIENT: Look, I brush… when I remember. Probably once a day. Sometimes twice, if I have time. Flossing? Not really. It's annoying. Mouthwash? No. I don’t have the patience for all that. I just… rinse with water. Is that terrible? I’m a practical person, okay? I fix potholes, I don't need fancy dental hygiene routines.
DOCTOR: Okay, thank you for being so open with me. It’s very helpful. It sounds like there are a few areas we can address. Now, I’d like to do a quick examination of your mouth and throat, just to rule out any obvious causes like infection or other issues. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever. Get it over with. I have a road to patch before five. Just… try not to poke around too much. I don’t like people messing with my mouth.
DOCTOR: Of course. I’ll be as gentle as possible. I’m just going to take a look at your teeth, gums, and the back of your throat with a light and a small instrument. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable. Okay, everything looks relatively normal, but I do see some mild inflammation of your gums and a bit of coating on your tongue. That can certainly contribute to bad breath. Your saliva glands also seem a little dry. I’m going to listen to your lungs quickly as well, just to rule out anything else. Your lungs sound clear. It seems most likely that your bad breath is related to a combination of gum inflammation, dry mouth, and potentially bacteria buildup on your tongue. I suspect the coffee is contributing to the dry mouth.
PATIENT: So… what now? Do I need surgery or something? I really don’t have time for appointments. Just tell me what I need to do. A spray, a pill… something quick.
DOCTOR: No surgery is needed at all. It's not that complicated, thankfully. It’s more about improving your oral hygiene routine and staying hydrated. First, let’s focus on brushing twice a day with fluoride toothpaste. And I highly recommend adding flossing to your routine – even just once a day. It removes food particles and bacteria that brushing misses. There are floss picks available if you find regular floss difficult to use. Second, let’s try to cut back on the coffee, or at least drink plenty of water alongside your coffee to stay hydrated. Third, I recommend using a tongue scraper daily to remove bacteria from your tongue. They are inexpensive and can make a big difference. You can find them at any drugstore. Finally, a mouthwash with cetylpyridinium chloride can help kill bacteria. I can write you a prescription for a cetylpyridinium chloride mouthwash. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Brushing, flossing, tongue scraper… it sounds like a lot. The mouthwash, okay, whatever. Just write the prescription. And look, if this doesn't work, I'm not coming back. I have real problems to deal with, not bad breath. Is that clear?
DOCTOR: Yes, that's perfectly clear. I understand your concerns. I’m confident that with these changes, you should see an improvement. Here is the prescription for the mouthwash. I also want to give you a pamphlet on proper brushing and flossing techniques, and another on dry mouth. Try these changes for two weeks. If you don't see any improvement, we can explore other possibilities – possibly a referral to a dentist to rule out any underlying dental issues. But often, this is enough. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No. No questions. Just… thank you, I guess. I have to go.
