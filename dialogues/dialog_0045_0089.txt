DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor Billman. It's… well, it’s this pain. Down low, in my abdomen. It comes and goes, but when it is here, it’s quite… disruptive. I believe my regular physician mentioned something about… well, a condition I have. Something with the letters S… and L… and E? It’s terribly difficult for me to recall things these days, you see. It's been happening for quite some time now, these episodes.
DOCTOR: SLE?
PATIENT: Yes, I believe that was it. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, perhaps? It sounds rather grand, doesn’t it? I apologize for my vagueness. I think that’s what Dr. Chen said. It’s… it flares up sometimes, and then it’s better for a while. But this pain… it feels a bit different this time, or perhaps more intense. I truly don’t recall. It’s all a bit muddled, I’m afraid.
DOCTOR: Right. Lupus. Okay. And when you say “different,” can you be more specific?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Specific… Let me see. Well, usually it’s just a dull ache, you understand? A discomfort. But this time… it feels more like cramping, a squeezing sensation. And it’s… well, it comes in waves, if that makes sense. It’s not constant, but when it arrives, it’s quite noticeable. I also feel… a bit nauseous, sometimes, when the pain is at its worst. Though, truthfully, I often feel a bit off these days, so it's hard to say if that’s connected. I hope that's… helpful. Is that what you were looking for?
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping, waves of pain, and nausea. How long have these specific episodes – the cramping and nausea – been going on?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a difficult question, Doctor. Time… it slips away from me. I believe… perhaps the last month or so? Maybe a little longer. It's hard to pinpoint. They weren't terribly frequent at first, just a few times, and I thought it was just… a bit of indigestion, perhaps. But they've become more regular recently, and more… insistent. I apologize for my inability to be more precise. It's most frustrating for everyone, I'm sure.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… Let me think. Well, I have been rather tired lately, more so than usual. But then, I’m always a bit tired, aren’t I? And my joints have been aching a bit, particularly my knees. But again, that’s… not uncommon for me. Oh! And I’ve noticed some swelling in my ankles, just a little. Is that relevant? It comes and goes, like everything else. I truly wish I could offer more clarity, but my memory… it’s simply not what it once was. It's like trying to grasp smoke, you see?
DOCTOR: Okay. Tiredness, joint pain, ankle swelling. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That’s… rather personal, isn’t it? Well… yes, actually. Now that you mention it, I’ve been… a bit irregular, I suppose. More frequent trips to the restroom, if you understand. And… not as solid as usual. It’s been… unsettling, to say the least. I hadn’t connected it to the pain, but perhaps it is relevant? I apologize for my hesitance, Doctor. It’s just… one doesn’t typically discuss such things so openly. But if it aids your understanding, I’m happy to share.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications for your lupus, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Let me see… I take Plaquenil, that’s for the lupus, Dr. Chen prescribed that. And a low dose of… prednisone, sometimes, when I’m having a flare-up. Just a moment… I keep a list, somewhere… Ah, here it is! It's a bit messy, I'm afraid. And I also take a medication for my blood pressure, Lisinopril, I believe it's called. Oh, and a vitamin D supplement, because Dr. Chen said my levels were low. Is that sufficient? I hope I haven't forgotten anything. My mind feels quite full, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright. Any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Allergies… let me think carefully. I don’t believe so. I’ve never had a reaction to any medication, thankfully. Though, I do sometimes get a bit of a stomach upset with the prednisone, but that’s just a minor discomfort, not a true allergy. I've never had a rash or difficulty breathing, or anything of that nature. I think I’m safe, but I suppose it’s best to be cautious. I’ll have to ask my regular physician just to be absolutely certain, if you’d like. It's difficult to remember everything, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. Let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. Then I’ll check your ankles, and maybe a quick blood pressure check. Just to get a better picture of what’s going on. Do you mind?
PATIENT: Oh, not at all, Doctor. That sounds perfectly reasonable. I trust your judgment completely. Please, proceed as you see fit. I’m happy to cooperate in any way I can. Just let me know if anything feels… uncomfortable. I appreciate you taking the time to examine me so thoroughly. It’s reassuring to know you’re being so attentive.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'm noticing some tenderness here, on your lower left side. Nothing drastic, but definitely some sensitivity. And some mild swelling in both ankles, as you mentioned. Blood pressure is a little elevated, 140/90. Now, lie back for me, please. I'm going to palpate your abdomen a little more thoroughly. Let me know if anything is particularly painful. Any pain here?
PATIENT: Oh, yes… that’s… a bit tender. Just there, on the left side. Not excruciating, but… noticeable. It feels like a dull ache, a pressure. It's more pronounced when you press down firmly. And… yes, a little bit higher up, too. It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly, but it’s definitely more uncomfortable in that area. Is that… concerning, Doctor? I apologize for my vagueness, but it’s hard to describe, and even harder to locate precisely. It all feels rather… muddled.
DOCTOR: Alright. Based on what you’ve told me, and the physical exam, it could be a lupus flare-up affecting your gastrointestinal system. However, the cramping and changes in bowel movements, along with the tenderness, are slightly atypical. We need to rule out other possibilities. I’m going to order some blood work: a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an inflammatory marker like CRP and ESR, and a stool sample to check for infection. Also, given your age and symptoms, I want to be cautious and rule out diverticulitis. I'm going to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Do you have any questions?
PATIENT: Oh, my. That sounds… extensive. A CT scan? Is that… necessary? I confess, I’m a bit apprehensive. Diver… diverticulitis? What is that, exactly? And what are these other tests for? I understand you want to be thorough, Doctor, and I appreciate that, but it all sounds rather… alarming. Will these tests be… painful? And how long will it take to get the results? I confess, I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed. Perhaps I should have brought someone with me.
DOCTOR: Diverticulitis is an inflammation or infection of small pouches that can form in the lining of the colon. It's common as people get older. The CT scan is the best way to rule it out, and it's a pretty straightforward procedure – you just lie on a table and a machine takes pictures. It's not painful, just a little uncomfortable. The blood work will give us a broader picture of your overall health and inflammation levels. As for the timing… the blood work should be back in a day or two, the CT scan will take a bit longer, maybe three to five business days depending on the lab. Look, Ms. Glymph, I understand your apprehension, but it's better to be safe than sorry. It's my job to rule out anything serious. We're just being thorough. And frankly, it's unlikely to be anything truly alarming, but we need to get those results first. Do you want me to write you a prescription for something to help with the cramping in the meantime?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. If you think it's best, Doctor. I suppose I trust your judgment. Three to five days… that does seem like a long time to wait, but if that's what's necessary… very well. A prescription for the cramping would be most welcome, yes. Anything to alleviate the discomfort. It’s been quite disruptive, as you can imagine. Will the results be sent to my regular physician, Dr. Chen? And… is there anything I can do in the meantime? Anything I should avoid? Perhaps a specific diet? I do try to eat healthy, but I’m not entirely certain what’s appropriate in this situation. This is all rather… unsettling.
DOCTOR: Yes, the results will be sent to Dr. Chen. As for what you can do in the meantime... Avoid anything that seems to aggravate the cramping - spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol. Stick to a bland diet – toast, rice, bananas, applesauce. And drink plenty of fluids. This is for hyoscyamine, it's an antispasmodic that should help with the cramping. As for a more specific diet… honestly, a lot of this is trial and error. You’ll have to see how you feel. I'm not going to get bogged down in dietary specifics right now. We need those test results first. If anything gets significantly worse – severe pain, fever, vomiting – go to the emergency room immediately. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Thank you, Doctor. Toast, rice, bananas… I can manage that. And I’ll be sure to avoid anything spicy or caffeinated. And I will remember to go to the emergency room if things worsen. Severe pain… is that likely? I confess, I’m a bit anxious about all of this. Diverticulitis… is that a serious condition? And what if the tests reveal something… worse? I apologize for my persistent questioning, Doctor, but it’s difficult to remain calm when one doesn’t know what to expect. I simply want to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Look, Ms. Glymph, I understand your anxiety, but you're getting ahead of yourself. Diverticulitis is usually treatable with antibiotics and diet changes. And honestly, the chances of it being something more serious are relatively low. But that’s why we’re doing the tests. I don’t have time to discuss every possible scenario right now. We need to get the tests done first, and then we’ll go from there. I’ve given you a prescription for the cramping, stick to a bland diet, and drink plenty of fluids. That’s all you can do right now. Do you have any other questions, or are we finished here?
PATIENT: Oh. No, Doctor. I believe that’s all. Thank you for your time. And… for the prescription. I suppose I’ll… see what the tests reveal. Goodbye, Doctor.
