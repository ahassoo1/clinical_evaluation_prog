DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Firestone. I'm Dr. Pipkorn. It says here you're with Medicare. Thank you for choosing our clinic. Now, could you please tell me what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, good morning to you. Honestly, it’s a bit of a bother having to come in, but… about a week ago I had a terrible cold. Just a regular cold, you know? Runny nose, sore throat. Nothing serious. But now… my legs just feel like jelly. It started a couple of days ago, and it's getting worse. It's… unsettling.
DOCTOR: “A regular cold,” you say. Hmm. And this… “jelly-like” sensation in your legs – can you describe that a little more precisely?
PATIENT: Precisely? Honestly, I don't do imprecise. It's like… they're not numb, exactly. More like… very weak. I feel like I could just… collapse. It's not a pain, it's just… nothing holding them up. Walking is becoming a real effort, and I certainly wouldn’t try running. Though, truthfully, I haven’t run in years. It’s just… worrisome. And inconvenient, naturally. I had plans, you know.
DOCTOR: “Inconvenient,” yes. Weakness, you say, beginning a few days ago. And it’s progressively worsening. Have you noticed any accompanying symptoms?
PATIENT: Accompanying symptoms? Let me think. No fever, thankfully. I hate feeling feverish. No tingling, no numbness – like I said, it's not that. My hands are fine. No pain anywhere, really. Just… the legs. Oh! Actually… maybe a little bit of fatigue. I've been sleeping a bit more than usual, but honestly, who doesn't enjoy a good nap? I suppose I haven’t had much energy for anything beyond that and… watching television. Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: No fever, fatigue, increased sleep… and weakness in both legs. You mentioned this followed a cold. Were you able to see your primary care physician for that cold, Ms. Firestone?
PATIENT: Honestly, no. It was just a cold. I don't bother the doctor for every sniffle, you know. They get so… booked up. I just dealt with it myself. Plenty of fluids, rest, the usual. I certainly didn’t expect it to lead to this. It feels rather dramatic, doesn’t it? A cold turning into… leg weakness. It hardly seems logical.
DOCTOR: Logical or not, we need to investigate. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me about any other medical conditions you have?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Well, let me see. I was diagnosed with… high blood pressure, several years ago. It’s… controlled, mostly. I take medication for it. A small dose, nothing to write home about. And… I had a hysterectomy, oh, almost twenty years ago now. That was… unpleasant. Other than that? No, I'm generally quite healthy. I watch what I eat, I don't smoke, and I hardly ever drink. Unlike some people. Are you writing all this down?
DOCTOR: Yes, Ms. Firestone, I am documenting everything. Hypertension, controlled with medication, and a hysterectomy twenty years ago. And you are currently taking medication for the blood pressure – can you tell me the name and dosage?
PATIENT: Oh, let me see… it's… Lisinopril. Ten milligrams, once a day. Usually in the morning, though I occasionally forget and take it at night. It doesn’t really matter, does it? As long as I take it eventually. My daughter keeps reminding me, you know. She worries too much. Honestly, she treats me like I’m incapable. It's rather… condescending. But, yes, ten milligrams. Lisinopril. Daily. If I remember.
DOCTOR: Consistency with medication is important, Ms. Firestone. Now, are you allergic to any medications?
PATIENT: Allergic? No, not that I'm aware of. I've taken plenty of antibiotics over the years, and I’ve never had a reaction. My daughter tried to get me to take some sort of allergy medication last spring, because of the pollen, but I refused. Honestly, all those side effects… no thank you. I’d rather suffer a little sniffle than risk feeling worse. So, no. No allergies. I’m quite robust, you know. It's probably just… a temporary weakness. A silly little thing. Though, admittedly, it's becoming rather bothersome.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's briefly discuss your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… well, my mother had… diabetes, I believe. Type 2, I think. She wasn't very good about taking care of herself, honestly. Always eating sweets. And my father… he had heart trouble, later in life. He was a smoker, you see. A dreadful habit. And… my aunt, on my mother's side, had something with her nerves, I think. She was always complaining about tingling in her hands and feet. Honestly, the details are a bit fuzzy. It was a long time ago, and no one really talked about it much. Is this important? Honestly, I don’t see what my relatives’ ailments have to do with my legs. It's just… a weakness. A temporary weakness, surely.
DOCTOR: Family history of diabetes, heart trouble, and a possible nerve condition – it's all relevant, Ms. Firestone. Now, finally, let's talk about your social history. Do you drink alcohol, use any recreational drugs, or smoke?
PATIENT: Honestly! You're asking a great deal of questions. As I said before, I don’t smoke. Never have. Disgusting habit. And recreational drugs? Heavens, no. I’m a respectable woman. As for alcohol… I might have a glass of wine with dinner, occasionally. A small glass, mind you. Usually red. Merlot, perhaps. It’s good for the heart, you know. A little bit of everything in moderation, that’s my motto. Honestly, I think you're making a mountain out of a molehill. It's just a weakness. And I'm starting to feel rather… tired. Could we please move things along? I have plans, you know. Though, admittedly, they’re becoming increasingly difficult to execute.
DOCTOR: Very well. To proceed, I’d like to conduct a brief physical examination. This will involve checking your reflexes, strength, and sensation in your legs, as well as listening to your heart and lungs, and checking your blood pressure. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh, now you want to actually examine me? After all those questions? Well, I suppose so. But please be gentle. And don’t take too long. I have a luncheon reservation, you know. And honestly, poking and prodding isn’t terribly enjoyable. Just… get it over with, quickly. And please, no surprises. I dislike surprises. Just… check whatever you need to check, and tell me what’s wrong. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious. This whole thing is rather inconvenient, you know.
DOCTOR: Please, lie down on the table. We will begin with your blood pressure and heart and lung sounds. Blood pressure is 140/90. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Now, please bend your knees and let your legs relax. I'm going to check your reflexes. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I'm going to assess your strength. Can you squeeze my hands as tightly as you can?
PATIENT: There. Is that alright? Honestly, I’m not very strong. Never have been. I’m more of a… thinker, you know? Not a doer. But I'm squeezing, aren’t I? Is that sufficient? Please hurry. This is… undignified. And frankly, I’m starting to feel a bit… anxious. I don’t like being prodded and poked. It’s… unsettling. Just tell me what’s wrong, quickly. Is it serious? Is it something that requires… hospitalization? Oh, dear. Don't tell me it’s something serious. I have plans, you know. Luncheon plans. And… other plans. Please, just tell me.
DOCTOR: Strength is 5/5 bilaterally, which is normal. Now, I’m going to check sensation in your feet and legs. Please close your eyes. I'll be lightly touching your skin with this. Tell me when you feel it. Sensation is intact bilaterally. However, I do note some mild edema—swelling—in both of your lower legs. It’s not significant, but it’s present. And, I also notice a slight coolness to the touch in your feet. Based on my examination, and considering your history, your symptoms are concerning. While a simple cold can sometimes be followed by weakness, the edema and coolness in your feet suggest a possible circulatory issue. It could be related to your hypertension, or something else entirely. I need to order some laboratory tests to get a clearer picture. We’ll need a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a D-dimer to rule out a blood clot. I also recommend an EKG to assess your heart function.
PATIENT: A blood clot? Oh, dear. That sounds… dreadful. An EKG? Laboratory tests? Honestly, this is escalating far beyond a simple cold. Are you saying I might need… hospitalization? And what about my luncheon? It's with… important people, you know. This is a complete disaster. A blood clot… Is it serious? Will I be able to walk? Oh, dear. I feel faint. And what about the medication? Could the medication be causing this? I told you I sometimes forget to take it! Honestly, this is all so… overwhelming. And the luncheon… It was supposed to be a pleasant afternoon. Now, this… This is simply dreadful. Please, tell me what I need to do. And quickly. Before I completely panic. And can you… can you prescribe something for the anxiety? Just in case?
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, please try to remain calm. We are gathering information. A blood clot is a possibility we need to rule out, but it's not a definitive diagnosis at this point. The tests will help us determine the cause of your symptoms. I am ordering the tests immediately. We’ll also need to check your ankle-brachial index to assess blood flow in your legs. In the meantime, I'm prescribing a low dose of Lorazepam to help manage your anxiety. This is a prescription for 0.5 milligrams of Lorazepam, to be taken as needed, up to three times a day. Until we have the results of the tests, I advise you to avoid strenuous activity. And, while it’s unlikely, if you experience any sudden chest pain, shortness of breath, or severe leg pain, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. As for your luncheon, I'm afraid you should postpone it. Your health is the priority at this moment. We will discuss the results of the tests as soon as they are available. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Postpone the luncheon… Of course. Everything is falling apart. Chest pain… shortness of breath… Emergency room… This is dreadful. Yes, I understand. Though honestly, I'm not sure what I don't understand at this point. It's all so… overwhelming. Lorazepam… Is that… habit-forming? And what about the tests? How long will they take? And what if… what if it is a blood clot? Will I be alright? Oh, dear. I feel… rather faint again. And my legs… they feel even weaker now. Please, tell me everything will be alright. Please. And… what about my luncheon? Is there any chance… any chance at all… that I could reschedule it for tomorrow? If the tests are negative? It's… very important. Really. Even if it's just for a few minutes. This is a complete disaster. A complete, utter disaster.
DOCTOR: Ms. Firestone, please, try to breathe. I understand your anxiety, and I will do everything I can to address your concerns. The Lorazepam is a short-acting medication, and when taken as prescribed, is not typically habit-forming. However, it's important to follow my instructions carefully. The laboratory tests should take approximately two to three hours to complete. The ABI will take about thirty minutes. We'll have results by this afternoon. Regarding your luncheon, let’s focus on getting the test results first. I cannot, in good conscience, advise you to attend any social engagements until we know what we're dealing with. It's a matter of safety. If the tests are negative, and you are feeling well, we can re-evaluate the situation. However, it's important to be realistic. Even if the tests are negative, your legs are currently weak, and you’ve expressed fatigue. Attending a social engagement in your current condition might not be wise. I'll have the nurse come in and take your blood pressure and temperature. Then, we'll get the tests started. Everything will be alright, Ms. Firestone. We are taking all the necessary steps to determine the cause of your symptoms, and we will develop a plan to address them. Please, try to relax. And please, let me know if you experience any new symptoms. .
