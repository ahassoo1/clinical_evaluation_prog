DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Gibbel. I'm Dr. Trestrail. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Percell. Well, I’ve got this headache, right here in the back of my head. Been bothering me for… oh, goodness, maybe a week now? It's not the worst pain, but it's there, you know? Just a constant ache.
DOCTOR: A week, you say?
PATIENT: Yep. Started last Tuesday, I think. August… the first? I remember because my grandson, little Kai, he had a baseball game that afternoon. I was trying to focus on the game, but this little throb kept distracting me. It hasn’t gone away since. Not getting worse, just… persistent.
DOCTOR: And would you describe it as a sharp pain, a dull ache, or something else entirely?
PATIENT: Hmm. Definitely a dull ache. Not sharp at all. Like… someone’s tightening a band around my head, but not too tight. It’s not the kind of headache that makes you want to lie down in a dark room, if that makes sense. More… annoying than debilitating. It just is. I can still do things, but I'm aware of it the whole time.
DOCTOR: So, a constant, dull ache in the back of your head for about a week now. Have you noticed anything that makes it better or worse?
PATIENT: That's right. And you know... now that you ask, I think it's a little worse when I'm looking at screens for a long time. I’ve been helping my daughter with some things online, paying bills and such. She’s got a good heart, but technology… it’s not her strong suit. Anyway, staring at that computer for too long seems to make it feel a bit heavier. Nothing makes it better, really. Just... time, I guess. It's the same all day.
DOCTOR: And have you experienced any other symptoms along with the headache?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. No dizziness, no nausea, thankfully. My vision's been fine, no blurry spots or anything like that. No fever, no stiff neck. I have been a little more tired than usual, but I figured that was just my age catching up with me. At 84, you get tired pretty easily. But no, nothing else really. Just the headache and a bit of fatigue.
DOCTOR: Alright. And are you currently taking any medications, Percell?
PATIENT: No, ma'am. Not regularly, anyway. I had some blood pressure pills a few years back, but the doctor took me off them. Said I was doing fine on my own. I take a little bit of ibuprofen sometimes for aches and pains, but I haven’t taken any for this headache. Didn't seem worth it, to be honest. It's just a little ache.
DOCTOR: Do you have any allergies to medications, or anything else, for that matter?
PATIENT: Nope. Never had any allergies, thankfully. My wife, God rest her soul, she was allergic to everything under the sun. Pollen, dust, cats… you name it. But I’ve always been pretty lucky that way. Nothing bothers me.
DOCTOR: Alright. I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Just checking your reflexes, vision, and feeling around your head and neck. It will only take a few moments. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds perfectly fine. Go right ahead. I don't mind at all. I’m happy to do whatever you think is best. Just let me know if it's going to tickle or anything. I’m an old man, I’ve been poked and prodded before.
DOCTOR: Alright. Reflexes are normal. Vision is a little blurry at distance, but you mentioned that previously. Palpation… there's some mild tenderness in the occipital region, right at the base of your skull. No swelling or masses. No stiffness in the neck. Neurological exam is otherwise unremarkable.
PATIENT: Well, that doesn't sound too terrible, does it? Glad to hear nothing's seriously wrong. That tenderness… that's probably where the ache is coming from, I suppose. I spend a lot of time hunched over things, working with numbers, helping my daughter… not the best for posture, I imagine. Old habits, you know?
DOCTOR: It’s likely a tension headache, given your description and the findings of the exam. The tenderness in the occipital region supports that. Spending a lot of time hunched over and working on detailed tasks can certainly contribute to muscle tension in the neck and head. However, given your age, and the persistence of the headache for a week, I would like to order a complete blood count, and a basic metabolic panel, just to rule out any underlying causes.
PATIENT: That sounds sensible, Doctor. I appreciate you being thorough. Rule out anything serious, that's always a good idea. Blood work… no problem. Where do I go to get that done? Is there a lab nearby? And will that take long? I have a little appointment with Kai, my grandson, on Saturday, I wouldn’t want to miss that. He's playing baseball again.
DOCTOR: Yes, we have a lab right across the street. I'll send the order electronically to them now. They should be expecting you. It shouldn’t take too long, perhaps 30-45 minutes. The results usually come back within 24-48 hours. In the meantime, I recommend over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, as you've used before, as needed. And try to take breaks when you're working, stretch your neck and shoulders, and maintain good posture. We'll discuss the results once they're available. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds perfect, Doctor. Across the street is very convenient, thank you. And I will definitely try to remember to stretch more. My daughter keeps telling me that too, but you know how it is. Old dogs and new tricks. I'll take some ibuprofen, and I'll make sure to take those breaks. Thank you for your time and help, Doctor Trestrail. I feel much better knowing we're checking things out.
DOCTOR: Very well. We'll be in touch once the results are back. Don't hesitate to call if anything changes. .
