DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Selbitschka. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Eriberto Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor Bakan. It’s a pleasure to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I’ve been… gaining weight. Quite a bit, actually, and rather suddenly. It’s… unsettling, to say the least. I haven’t changed anything in my diet or exercise routine, and yet… here we are. I just want to understand why.
DOCTOR: I understand, Ms. Selbitschka. Sudden weight gain, especially without changes in diet or activity, is something we should investigate. It’s good you’re addressing it. To get a clearer picture, could you tell me roughly how much weight you’ve gained, and over what period of time?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think… I stepped on the scale on June 1st, and it was 75 kilograms. Today, August 2nd… it’s 83. So, about 8 kilograms in just over two months. It’s… rather precise, actually. I do keep a rather detailed record of things, you see.
DOCTOR: Eight kilograms in two months is a significant change, Ms. Selbitschka. Thank you for providing such specific information; it’s very helpful. Now, beyond the weight gain itself, have you noticed any other changes?
PATIENT: Other changes… let me see. I’ve been feeling… more tired than usual, yes. And a little… breathless, even with just simple tasks like walking up the stairs. I always thought I was quite spry for my age, but lately… not so much. I haven’t been sleeping as well either, but I assumed that was just… well, life.
DOCTOR: Fatigue, shortness of breath, and disturbed sleep are all important details, Ms. Selbitschka. It sounds like these symptoms are impacting your quality of life, and we certainly want to address that. To help me get a more complete picture, could you tell me a little bit about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Past medical history… I haven't had any major illnesses, thankfully. A few colds, of course, the usual things. I had my tonsils removed when I was a child, and a rather nasty bout of the flu a few years back, but nothing… chronic. I don’t take any regular medication, and I haven’t been hospitalized since the tonsils, I believe. My husband, Tomas, might recall better dates, to be honest. He has a very good memory.
DOCTOR: That’s good to hear, Ms. Selbitschka. No chronic illnesses or regular medications is helpful information. And it’s perfectly alright that you aren’t certain of specific dates; your husband’s recollection is a good resource. Now, has anyone in your family—parents, siblings, grandparents—experienced similar symptoms, or had conditions like diabetes, thyroid problems, or heart disease?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My mother… she struggled with her weight for most of her life, actually. Never quite managed to keep it under control. And she developed… diabetes, I believe, later in life. Type 2, I think. My father… he had high blood pressure, and a rather bad heart, eventually. He passed away from a heart attack when I was quite young. And my grandmother, on my mother’s side… she had a goitre, I remember. A very large one. They had to… operate, I think. It wasn’t a pleasant experience, I recall.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Selbitschka. A family history of diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid issues is significant and certainly contributes to our understanding. Now, could you tell me a little about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle… Well, I work as an orderly at the local hospital, so I’m on my feet quite a bit during the day. It's… demanding work, but I enjoy it. I like being helpful. I’ve been married to Tomas for twenty-two years, and we live on a small farm just outside of town. We grow most of our own vegetables. I do a fair bit of cooking and gardening, and I try to get some walking in when I can. We don’t smoke, and we only drink alcohol occasionally, at social events. A glass of wine with dinner, perhaps, on a Saturday. Nothing excessive.
DOCTOR: That sounds like a very full and healthy life, Ms. Selbitschka. It's good to hear you're active and maintain a good diet. Now, to clarify, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies that I’m aware of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’ve… tested a few things over the years, just to be sure. My mother had a rather severe reaction to penicillin as a child, so I always make sure to mention that when I go to the doctor, but I don’t believe I inherited anything. I’m quite fortunate, in that regard, I suppose.
DOCTOR: That's very good to know, Ms. Selbitschka. It's always helpful to have a complete picture. Now, before we proceed with a physical exam, I'd like to ask about your current sleep habits. You mentioned not sleeping as well lately. Can you describe that a bit more?
PATIENT: Certainly. It's not that I can't fall asleep, exactly. It’s more… I wake up frequently during the night. Several times. And I have trouble getting back to sleep afterwards. I’ll lie there for ages, just… thinking. Worrying, perhaps. Tomas says I sometimes toss and turn, and he occasionally hears me sighing. It’s been… gradual, this change. It started a few months ago, around the same time I noticed the weight gain, actually. It’s not a restful sleep, that’s for certain. And I wake up feeling… tired, naturally. It’s rather frustrating, to be honest.
DOCTOR: That sounds very disruptive, Ms. Selbitschka. Frequent awakenings and difficulty returning to sleep can certainly impact your energy levels. Alright, with your permission, I would like to perform a physical examination. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and palpate your thyroid. I'll also take a look at your abdomen and listen to your bowel sounds. This will help me get a better understanding of what might be going on. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds… perfectly reasonable. Please, proceed. I understand it’s necessary. I just… I hope you find something. It’s unsettling, not knowing. But please, don’t rush. I have all the time in the world, more or less. I’ve cleared my schedule for the day.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Selbitschka. I appreciate your patience. I certainly won’t rush. Alright, if you could please sit back on the examination table. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. I do notice your respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 20 breaths per minute, which could be related to the fatigue or stress. Bowel sounds are normal. No tenderness to palpation. Now, your thyroid feels slightly enlarged, Ms. Selbitschka. It’s not dramatically so, but it’s definitely larger than I’d expect. I also feel a small nodule on the left lobe. It feels smooth and mobile, which is a good sign, but we will need further investigation. Your blood pressure is 140/90. That’s slightly elevated. And your pulse is 88. Based on my examination, Ms. Selbitschka, the slight thyroid enlargement with the nodule and your elevated blood pressure are concerning. Your weight gain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances, combined with your family history, raise my suspicion for a possible thyroid issue. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some blood tests. These will include a complete thyroid panel, including TSH, T4, and T3 levels. We'll also check your blood sugar and cholesterol levels. I would also like to order an ultrasound of your thyroid gland to evaluate the nodule further. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough. Absolutely acceptable. I trust your judgment, Doctor. I’d much prefer to know what we’re dealing with, rather than continue to… speculate. Blood tests, ultrasound… whatever you deem necessary. Is it… serious? The thyroid enlargement, I mean. Is it something I should be particularly worried about? I understand you can’t give a diagnosis yet, but… just a general sense, if you wouldn’t mind.
DOCTOR: It’s understandable to be anxious, Ms. Selbitschka. It’s good you’re asking these questions. While the thyroid enlargement is concerning, it doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious. Many thyroid nodules are benign – that is, non-cancerous. However, it is important to investigate them thoroughly to rule out any potential malignancy. The blood tests will give us a better understanding of how your thyroid is functioning. If the tests are abnormal, we may need to consider a biopsy of the nodule to get a definitive diagnosis. We'll take things one step at a time. I will order the blood tests and the ultrasound. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. We’ll be in touch as soon as we have them, typically within a week. In the meantime, I want you to focus on getting adequate rest and managing your stress levels as best you can. Do you have any questions for me right now?
PATIENT: No, I… I think that’s all, for now. One step at a time… that sounds sensible. Thank you, Doctor Bakan. You’ve been very… thorough and reassuring. And patient. I suppose I should schedule a follow-up appointment? Once you have the results?
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Selbitschka. Let's schedule a follow-up appointment for one week from today, same time, to discuss the results. That will give the lab enough time to process everything. Is August 9th at 10:00 AM convenient for you?
PATIENT: Yes, August 9th at 10:00 AM is perfect. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your time and attention. I feel… slightly less anxious, now. Although still worried, naturally. But… less panicked. Hopefully, it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Selbitschka. I’m glad I could ease your mind a little. I understand your worry, and we will do everything we can to get to the bottom of this. Please don't hesitate to call the clinic if you experience any new or worsening symptoms before your appointment. We are here to help. Have a good day, Ms. Selbitschka. I'll see you on August 9th. .
PATIENT: .
