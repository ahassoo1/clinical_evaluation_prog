DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Dr. Piet. It’s good to meet you as well. Well, I’ve been noticing a… a lump, I guess you’d call it, low down in my stomach. It’s been bothering me a little, so I thought I should get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. I see. And how long have you been noticing this lump?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. It’s hard to say exactly… probably about a month or so now. At first, I didn't really pay much attention to it, but it seems to be… well, not getting bigger, exactly, but more noticeable, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes sense. More noticeable is helpful information. And is it painful at all?
PATIENT: Not constantly, no. It’s not a sharp pain, more of a… discomfort, really. Like a dull ache if I’ve been on my feet a lot. Or if I, um… strain myself, you know? Nothing too bad, but enough to make me wonder about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, a dull ache with activity or straining. Good to know. Have you noticed any other changes along with this discomfort?
PATIENT: Let me think... not really, no. My appetite is normal, I haven't had any trouble with… going to the bathroom, or anything like that. No fever or weight loss. Just the lump and the occasional discomfort, like I said. It’s just… worrying, you know? It's not something I usually experience.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, Amy. It's good you came in to get it checked out. Now, I'm going to ask you a few more general questions, then I’d like to do a quick physical exam if that's alright with you. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: No, not that I'm aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I don’t take any medication regularly either, just over-the-counter pain relievers if I need them, but nothing prescribed.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. And do you have any significant medical problems in your past, or have you had any surgeries?
PATIENT: No major surgeries. I broke my arm when I was a child, and I had my tonsils out, but that was a long time ago. No other serious illnesses, or anything that I've been treated for long-term. My family… well, my father had high blood pressure, but that’s about it.
DOCTOR: Alright. And regarding your social history – do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: No, none of those, Dr. Piet. Never have. I try to stay healthy, you know? I do a lot of… well, I’m a choreographer, so I’m always moving. That's what I do for a living. Lots of physical activity.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's helpful information. So, choreographer - very active. Good. Now, I'd like to do a quick exam if you're comfortable with that. I’ll need you to lie down on the exam table. We'll start with feeling your abdomen. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. I trust your judgement, Dr. Piet. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable, okay?
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I will. Okay, let's get you lying down. I’m going to start by gently palpating your abdomen. Just relax as much as you can. Okay, can you tell me if you feel any pain or discomfort in any particular area as I press?
PATIENT: It’s a little tender… right about here. Not a sharp pain, but… noticeable. And… it feels a bit firm. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. I feel it as well - there is some tenderness and a firm mass in the lower left quadrant of your abdomen. It's approximately… ... about 2 centimeters in diameter. Is the pain constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: It definitely comes and goes, Dr. Piet. Like I said, it's worse when I've been active, or if I strain myself. When I'm just resting, I barely notice it at all. It’s not something that keeps me up at night or anything. It’s just… there. And now that I’m thinking about it, it feels a little… harder when I'm stressed. Does that sound strange?
DOCTOR: No, that doesn't sound strange at all. Stress can certainly affect your body in various ways. Okay, Amy, based on what you've told me and the physical exam, there are a few possibilities we need to explore. It could be a muscle strain, but the firmness of the mass and the fact that it’s been present for a month warrants further investigation. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a complete blood count and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. The CBC will help rule out any infection, and the CT scan will give us a detailed view of the mass and surrounding tissues. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… thorough, Dr. Piet. A CT scan and blood work sound good. I’d like to know what’s going on, so whatever you think is best. Will the CT scan require any special preparation? And… will the results take long to come back? I have a performance coming up in a couple of weeks, and I’m hoping it won’t interfere.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. The CT scan will require you to drink a contrast dye beforehand to help visualize the structures in your abdomen. We’ll provide you with detailed instructions when you schedule the appointment. It's important to stay hydrated before and after the scan. As for the results, typically it takes 24-48 hours for the radiologist to interpret the scan and send the report to me. I'll review the results as soon as they're available and contact you to discuss them. We can hopefully schedule the scan quickly so it doesn't interfere with your performance. In the meantime, if you experience any sudden, severe pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You've explained everything very clearly, Dr. Piet. I appreciate you taking the time to listen and not dismissing my concerns. Thank you. I’ll schedule the scan as soon as I can.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Amy. I'm glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to contact the clinic if you have any questions or concerns before your scan. We’ll get this figured out. .
