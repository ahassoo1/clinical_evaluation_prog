DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guilds. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka, and I'm an internal medicine physician. It's August 2nd. I see you're 83 years young. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Huh? Eighty-three, you say? Feels like yesterday I was… well, never mind. Dry… dry what now? My mouth feels like sandpaper, yeah, and my eyes too. Been happenin’ a bit lately. Don't know why, though. Just… dry. It's bothersome.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you're experiencing dryness in your mouth and eyes, and it's been happening more recently. That is bothersome, I can imagine. When did you first notice this dryness, Mr. Guilds?
PATIENT: Notice…? Oh, geez. Dates… Dates are trouble. A few weeks, maybe? Could be longer. Time kinda… blurs. I was fixin' the lights on my porch, I think, when I first really paid attention. Hard to swallow, you know? And everything just felt… scratchy. Like I been eatin' dust.
DOCTOR: Alright, a few weeks, potentially longer, and it started to become noticeable around the time you were fixing the lights on your porch. It sounds like it's causing difficulty swallowing and a scratchy sensation. Have you noticed this dryness occurring at specific times of day, or is it pretty consistent?
PATIENT: Consistent, I guess. Always feels a bit… parched. Mornings are worse, maybe? But honestly, it's not like it goes away. Just… there. Always. Makes talkin' a pain, too. Gotta sip water all the time.
DOCTOR: Okay, consistent dryness, potentially worse in the mornings, requiring frequent water intake. And it's making it difficult to talk. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the dryness?
PATIENT: Symptoms…? Hmm. Let me think. Everything's kinda slow these days, if that counts. Tired, mostly. And… wheezy. Sometimes when I walk, I gotta stop and catch my breath. Like somethin’s tight in my chest. Old age, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, so along with the dryness, you're experiencing fatigue and shortness of breath with walking, feeling tight in your chest. Those are important symptoms to mention, Mr. Guilds, and not necessarily just “old age.” Just to get a better picture, have you had any fever, cough, or recent weight loss?
PATIENT: Fever? No, no fever. Haven't felt sick like that in… well, a long time. Cough? Not really. Little tickle now and then, but nothin’ serious. Weight loss… maybe? Hard to say. I ain’t been weighin’ myself. Clothes feel a little loose, but that could be… the heat, you know? It's been hot.
DOCTOR: Alright, no fever or significant cough, and potentially some minor weight loss, though it's difficult to say for certain. Let me just take a look at your medical record here… Okay, I see you have a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. And you're currently taking lisinopril and atorvastatin. Do you have any allergies to medications?
PATIENT: Lisinopril and… what was the other one? For the pressure, yeah. I take 'em. Allergies? Nope. Never had a problem with any pills, thankfully. Doc gave me somethin' once for… arthritis, I think? Didn’t like it, so I stopped.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, currently taking lisinopril and atorvastatin for hypertension, and previously tried a medication for arthritis. I'd like to do a quick physical exam now, Mr. Guilds, if you don’t mind. Just to listen to your heart and lungs, check your mouth and throat, and assess your overall condition. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Exam, huh? Fine, fine. Do what you gotta do. Just don't poke around too much, alright? Old bones, you know. Everything creaks.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Guilds. I'll be as gentle as possible. Alright, your blood pressure is 142/88, pulse is 78, and your respiratory rate is 16. Your mouth appears dry, and your throat is a bit irritated. I see some mild redness, but no obvious sores or lesions. Okay, Mr. Guilds, everything seems generally okay, but I did hear some mild wheezing in your lungs, and your mouth is quite dry. This, along with your reported symptoms, leads me to suspect a few possibilities. One possibility is medication-induced dryness – lisinopril can sometimes cause dry mouth. Another is Sjögren’s syndrome, an autoimmune condition that causes dryness of the mouth and eyes. And we should also rule out any potential cardiac issues contributing to your shortness of breath.
PATIENT: Auto… what now? Sounds complicated. Look, doc, I just want to feel better. This dry feelin’ is awful, and I can’t walk to the mailbox without gettin’ winded. Can you just give me somethin’ for it? A pill, a drops… somethin’? Don't need fancy words or complicated names.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Guilds. You're right, you don't need fancy words. I want to help you feel better too. While I could potentially prescribe something to help with the dry mouth symptoms – like artificial saliva drops or a special mouthwash – I think it’s important to get a clearer picture of why you're experiencing these symptoms before we settle on a long-term solution. To help determine the cause, I'd like to order a few simple blood tests. These will check for signs of inflammation, assess your kidney function, and rule out Sjögren’s syndrome. I’d also recommend an EKG to evaluate your heart and see if that’s contributing to your shortness of breath. Would you be willing to have these tests done?
PATIENT: Tests… more tests. Just when I thought we were gettin’ somewhere. Look, doc, I'm an old man. I don't bounce back like I used to. And all these tests… they take time, don't they? And cost money. Can't we just try somethin’ for the dryness first? Like you said, those drops or somethin’? I’ll pay for 'em. Just want some relief.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Guilds. You're right, tests do take time and can be costly. And I appreciate you being willing to pay for treatment. However, prescribing something to simply mask the symptoms without knowing the underlying cause could potentially delay a more serious diagnosis. For example, if this is Sjögren’s syndrome, early treatment can help prevent complications. And if your shortness of breath is related to a heart issue, we need to address that promptly. I will be upfront: these tests are relatively simple and don’t require a lot of time or effort. The blood draw will only take a few minutes, and the EKG is a quick, painless procedure. Medicare should cover most of the cost, and we can verify your coverage before proceeding. Would you be open to considering these tests with the understanding that they will help us determine the best course of treatment for you?
PATIENT: Medicare… right. That… that might work. Still don’t like the sound of it, all this pokin’ and proddin’. But… alright, alright. If Medicare's coverin' it, and you really think it’s important, go ahead. But promise me, doc, if somethin’ seems wrong, you'll tell me straight. No fancy words, just the truth. And keep the pokin' to a minimum, alright?
DOCTOR: I promise, Mr. Guilds. I will absolutely tell you the truth, and I’ll keep the “pokin’” to a minimum. We’ll only do what’s necessary to get a clear picture of what’s going on. I'll have my nurse draw the blood for the tests and schedule you for an EKG. It's very good that you are being proactive. In the meantime, I'll write you a prescription for artificial saliva drops. These should help with the dry mouth. Use them as directed on the label. Once we get the test results back – which should be in a few days – we’ll discuss them and develop a plan together. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: Drops are good. Alright. A few days, you say? I’ll try to be patient. And you tell that nurse to be gentle, alright? Old veins, you know. Don't need any bruises. Sounds acceptable. Just… get me feelin’ better, doc. That’s all I want. .
DOCTOR: I will absolutely make sure the nurse is gentle, Mr. Guilds. And I promise we’ll do everything we can to get you feeling better. My nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and give you instructions. Thank you for coming in today, and please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your next appointment. I'll be in touch as soon as the results are available. .
