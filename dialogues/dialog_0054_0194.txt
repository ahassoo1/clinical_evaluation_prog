DOCTOR: Good morning, Terasa. My name is Dr. Dashevsky. It's nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s been a bit of a bother, this hearing thing. It comes and goes, you see. And makes me feel quite dizzy sometimes. My daughter, she said I really should come get it checked out. Family history, she said… something about my brother, but honestly, my memory isn’t what it used to be. It’s a bit fuzzy.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's good you came in, and it's very thoughtful of your daughter to encourage you to get this checked out. Hearing changes and dizziness can have a number of causes, so it's best we investigate. When you say it "comes and goes," could you describe a typical episode?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… well, it usually starts with a sort of… fullness in my ear, like when you’re on a plane, you know? Then it just… goes quiet. Not completely silent, but muffled. Everything sounds… distant. And then the room starts to spin. Not always, but often. It lasts… a few hours, maybe? Sometimes longer. It’s hard to say exactly. It's all a bit of a blur, to be honest. I mostly just lie down when it happens. Makes it a bit better.
DOCTOR: Okay, fullness in the ear, muffled hearing, and dizziness lasting a few hours – that gives us a good starting point. And it's helpful to know lying down improves it. Now, has anything specific seemed to trigger these episodes?
PATIENT: Trigger? Oh dear… not that I’ve noticed, really. I mean, I work at the… the gambling place, you know? Lots of noise there, people talking, machines beeping… maybe that? But it happens when it's quiet too. Sometimes I'm just… sitting, and it starts. I haven't been doing anything different lately, not that I can recall. It just… comes on. I really wish I could pinpoint something, for my daughter’s sake, but I’m afraid I just don't know.
DOCTOR: That's alright, it can be very difficult to identify triggers. Working in a noisy environment certainly could be a factor, but the fact that it happens when it’s quiet is important too. Let’s try to get a more complete picture. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the hearing changes and dizziness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. Sometimes I feel a bit… off balance, even when I don’t have a full-blown dizzy spell, just a little unsteady on my feet. And… now that you mention it, sometimes I get a bit of a headache with it, a dull ache behind my eyes. Not always, mind you. Just… occasionally. Oh, and I’ve been feeling a bit more tired lately, but that could just be my age, couldn’t it? Everything aches a bit more when you get older.
DOCTOR: It’s good you’re sharing all of this with me, Terasa. The unsteadiness and headache are helpful things to know. And you're right, fatigue can certainly come with age, but it’s good to be aware of it in case it’s related. Now, let’s talk a little bit about your medical history. Do you have any other medical conditions that you’re aware of?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… I have a bit of trouble with my blood pressure, the doctor told me years ago. I take a little pill for it. And… well, I had my gallbladder out a long time ago. That’s about it, I think. Nothing major. I’ve been pretty lucky, all things considered. I go to the doctor for check-ups when I need to, but I don't really… have a lot of health problems. I’m on Medicare, if that helps? Does that tell you anything?
DOCTOR: That's good to know about the high blood pressure and gallbladder removal. And yes, being on Medicare is helpful information. Could you tell me the name of the medication you take for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now you’re asking me something… I haven’t the foggiest. I just take the little white pill every morning. My daughter refills it for me. She knows all that stuff. I really am terrible with names. I'm sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. It's a small, white pill, that's all I know. I take it with my breakfast.
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright, Terasa. Don't apologize at all. We can often look that up in your records. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Hmm. Allergies… no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I eat pretty much everything. My daughter sometimes worries I eat too much, but… no allergies. Not that I've ever noticed. I've had a few mosquito bites in my time, but that's about it. Nothing serious. I can't think of anything I'm allergic to, honestly.
DOCTOR: Okay, good to know. No known allergies. And finally, before we move on to a quick physical exam, is there any family history of hearing loss, dizziness, or balance problems?
PATIENT: Oh, yes! My brother… he had terrible trouble with his ears. Always complaining about ringing and feeling dizzy. He had to see a specialist a few times. It was years ago, though. I can’t remember what they said exactly, but it was something about… his balance. And my cousin, on my mother’s side, she had trouble with vertigo, I think. Kept falling over. But that was a long time ago, too. My daughter mentioned it when she made the appointment, something about a family history. I really wish I could remember more details, but… my memory is just not what it used to be. It's all a bit hazy.
DOCTOR: That’s very helpful information, Terasa, thank you. Hearing loss and balance problems in your brother and vertigo in your cousin are important to know. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, just to check your ears, blood pressure, and balance. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I just want to get this sorted out, if you know what I mean. It’s just unsettling, this dizziness. Go ahead, Doctor. I'm ready when you are. I hope it doesn't take too long, though. I have a bit of a schedule, you see. Not a terribly busy one, but… still.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It won't take long, and I'll explain everything as we go. Let’s start with your ears. I’m going to use an otoscope to look inside them. This won’t hurt, but it might feel a little cool. Okay… Both ear canals appear clear. There’s some cerumen – that’s earwax – but nothing obstructing the view. The eardrums themselves look intact, a little bit dull in color, but no obvious signs of fluid or perforation. Now, let’s check your blood pressure. Your blood pressure is 148/85. That's a bit elevated, but not drastically so. We can keep an eye on it. Finally, I’m going to do a quick balance test. Just follow my finger with your eyes, and I'll ask you to stand with your feet together and close your eyes. Okay… You have a bit of sway when you close your eyes, and it takes a moment to regain your balance. Not alarming, but we should note it.
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Swaying, you say? Well, I am getting on in years, Doctor. Perhaps that's just me getting old! It does sound a bit worrying, though, doesn’t it? Is that… is that bad? I just want to know what’s going on, you see. My daughter will be terribly concerned if I come back with a long list of problems. Is it something serious? I hope it’s nothing too bad.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Terasa. It’s good you’re asking questions. The mild sway isn’t necessarily indicative of something serious, but it’s something we need to investigate further, especially given your history of dizziness and the family history. Based on what you’ve told me and the quick exam, it sounds like we’re dealing with a possible inner ear problem, potentially affecting your balance. It could be something like benign paroxysmal positional vertigo – BPPV – which is a common cause of dizziness, or it could be something else. To get a clearer picture, I’d like to order a few tests. I'd like to start with an audiogram – a hearing test – to assess your hearing levels. I also think it would be helpful to get a VNG test – a videonystagmography test – which measures eye movements to assess your balance function. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Tests… more tests. It all sounds a bit… overwhelming, Doctor. But if it will help figure out what’s going on, then yes, I suppose so. I just… I don’t want to be a bother. I know you’re busy, and I don’t want to take up too much of your time. But if you think it’s necessary, then yes, please. An audiogram and… what was the other one? VNG? Yes, whatever you think is best. Just tell me what I need to do. And how long will it take? I have a bit of a schedule, you see. Not terribly busy, but… still. I’d like to know roughly how long these tests will take, and if there’s anything I need to do to prepare.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Terasa. You’re not a bother at all. It’s my job to figure out what’s going on and get you the right care. The audiogram – the hearing test – will take about 30-45 minutes. You’ll be in a soundproof booth, and a technician will guide you through the test. You don’t need to do anything to prepare for that. The VNG test – the balance test – will take a bit longer, about an hour or so. For that one, you’ll need to avoid caffeine and alcohol for 24 hours beforehand. And it’s best if you haven’t taken any sedatives or medications that can affect your balance. The technician will also explain the procedure to you in detail, but it involves wearing goggles and following their instructions while lying down and moving your head. I’ll write the orders for both tests, and the receptionist will schedule them for you. They’ll also give you any specific instructions you need. Do you have any questions about the tests or the preparation?
PATIENT: No, I think that explains it all, Doctor. No caffeine, no alcohol… I can manage that. And an hour for the other one… yes, that's alright. I'll just have to rearrange a few things. I really appreciate you explaining it so clearly. It makes me feel a bit better, knowing what to expect. And… will I get the results right away? Or will I have to come back for another appointment? I just… I'd like to know roughly when I'll find out what's going on. My daughter is terribly worried, you see. She's the one who made the appointment, and she's very anxious. I'd like to be able to tell her something soon.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Terasa. I'm glad I could help ease your mind. The results of the audiogram usually come back within a few days. The VNG test takes a bit longer, about a week or so, as it needs to be interpreted by a specialist. Once I have both results, I’ll review them and schedule a follow-up appointment with you to discuss them in detail and come up with a treatment plan. I'll do my best to get everything sorted out as quickly as possible so you can reassure your daughter. Do you have any other questions for me today?
