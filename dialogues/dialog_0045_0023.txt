DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Bulaong, good to see you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. It's, um, my chest. It hurts a little. Not all the time, but... yeah, it hurts.
DOCTOR: Okay. "A little" can mean a lot of things. Can you tell me more about the pain?
PATIENT: It's... hard to say. It's not like a sharp pain, more like... a heavy feeling? And sometimes it feels like… like when you get really bruised, but I didn’t hit myself or anything. Mostly on this side. <points to left chest>
DOCTOR: Hmm. Okay, a heavy feeling and bruised-like pain… and localized to the left side. How long has this been going on?
PATIENT: Maybe... two weeks? I didn’t think much of it at first, you know? Just figured I slept wrong or something. But it keeps coming back. It doesn't stop me from work, but it's... annoying.
DOCTOR: Alright. And what kind of work do you do, Mr. Bulaong?
PATIENT: I’m a roofer. So… lots of climbing, lifting, and being in the sun. It's hard work. That's why I didn’t think too much about the chest thing at first. Maybe just sore muscles?
DOCTOR: Right, a physically demanding job. That makes sense. Does anything specifically make the pain worse?
PATIENT: Um… well, when I lift heavy stuff, it feels more. And when my wife and I… you know… when we hug, sometimes. Not always, but sometimes it hurts a bit then too.
DOCTOR: Okay. Pain with lifting and… affection. Noted. Now, do you feel any pain in your arm, neck, or jaw?
PATIENT: No, no pain there. Just my chest. Sometimes it feels like… a little bit under my armpit, but mostly just the chest. Nothing else. <rubs chest again>
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's take a quick look at your chart. I see you haven’t had a physical in… quite a while. No significant past medical history listed, and no allergies. Any medications you’re currently taking?
PATIENT: No, I don't take anything. Never really needed to. Just… over-the-counter stuff sometimes, for headaches. Nothing regular.
DOCTOR: Okay. Alright, Mr. Bulaong, I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, and then I’ll feel around a bit. Just to get a better idea of what’s going on. Okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that's okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. <slightly shifts in chair>
DOCTOR: Alright. Take a deep breath for me… and exhale. Good. Okay… and again. <pauses, listens again> Your lungs sound clear. Heart rate is a little elevated, but that could just be from talking. I'm feeling some tenderness when I press here <points to left chest>, but no obvious masses or anything concerning. Still, we need to rule some things out. Given your job and the nature of the pain, it could be musculoskeletal. But we can't ignore the possibility of something more serious.
PATIENT: Okay… What things? What more serious? I don't want to worry my wife. She gets scared easy. Is it… bad? Is it something I need to stop working for?
DOCTOR: Look, let's not jump to conclusions. It's unlikely to be something immediately life-threatening, but we need to be thorough. It could be costochondritis – inflammation of the cartilage in your rib cage, which is common with physical work. But we also need to rule out things like a muscle strain, or, less likely, something involving your heart. I'm going to order an EKG, just to get a baseline reading of your heart’s electrical activity. And I think a chest X-ray would be a good idea as well, just to rule out anything else going on in your lungs or around your heart. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: An X-ray… okay. An EKG… that sounds… complicated. Will it hurt? And how long will it take? I got some jobs lined up next week, and I need to know if I can still do them. I don't have insurance, so… how much will this cost?
DOCTOR: The EKG is very simple—it just involves sticking some stickers on your chest and arms. It doesn't hurt at all. As for the X-ray, that's just a quick snapshot. Neither one should take long, maybe 20 minutes total. Regarding the cost… I understand you don’t have insurance, which makes things difficult. The EKG will be around $150, and the X-ray roughly $200. We can discuss payment options with the front desk. Honestly, Mr. Bulaong, I'd rather be safe and get this checked out. We're not going to make any decisions about work until we have the results. A week off is better than… well, you understand. Let's get these tests done, and then we can talk realistically about what's going on. Does that sound like a plan?
PATIENT: Okay… okay, yeah. A plan. $350… that’s… a lot. But you're right. Better safe than sorry. I guess. Stickers and a picture… that doesn't sound so bad. Can we do it today? Right now? I wanna get it over with. My wife will be worried if I don't come home soon.
DOCTOR: Alright, good. I appreciate your willingness to get this checked out. The nurse can get you set up for the EKG right away. Then, we'll get you over to radiology for the X-ray. It shouldn’t take too long overall. I’ll have the nurse come in and explain everything to you in more detail. Just try to relax, Mr. Bulaong. We'll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. <nervously adjusts shirt> I hope it’s nothing serious. Really. <waits for nurse>
