DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krok. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Rakosky. It’s a pleasure to meet you. Now, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you as well, Doctor. Rakosky, you say? A… Chinese name, isn't it? Well, never mind that. I’m here because of… a rather unpleasant matter. Something of a… discharge. Yes, a discharge. It’s most bothersome, you understand. And frankly, a little embarrassing to discuss. I haven’t had this trouble in… oh, decades, I suppose. It’s just… appeared recently.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Krok. It is often difficult to discuss these sorts of things, and you’ve come to the right place. We’ll get to the bottom of this. To help me understand what’s going on, could you describe the discharge for me?
PATIENT: Describe it? Goodness. Well… it’s… fluid, naturally. And… yellowish, I believe. Not particularly… copious, but… persistent. It’s not painful, thankfully, just… damp. And… rather odorous, I’m afraid. A bit of a… stale smell. Though, perhaps that's just my imagination. It's been going on for… a week, perhaps? I really haven't kept precise track. My wife noticed it first, you see. She has a… keen sense of smell.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. That’s helpful. Yellowish fluid, not particularly copious, persistent, with a stale odor, and present for about a week. Is this discharge coming from anywhere specific?
PATIENT: Specific? Well, Doctor, where else would it be coming from? It's... down there, naturally. From the… the opening. I haven't examined it closely, you understand. I'm not a young man anymore, and contorting myself isn't as easy as it used to be. My wife… she also avoids looking too closely. She simply pointed it out and suggested I see a doctor. A sensible woman, my wife. Though she does tend to exaggerate things, sometimes.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Krok. It sounds like the discharge is coming from the urethral opening. To get a clearer picture of what might be causing this, I’d like to ask a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you noticed any burning or discomfort when you urinate?
PATIENT: Burning… hmm. Not precisely burning, Doctor. More of a… slight stinging, perhaps? And only at the very end, when I'm finishing. It’s not terribly bothersome, really. I’ve had much worse aches and pains over the years. But it is there, if you ask me. I wouldn't say it's painful, mind you, just… noticeable. I suppose a man my age is bound to have a few… sensitivities. Is this common, Doctor? Are other men… experiencing this?
DOCTOR: It's not uncommon, Mr. Krok. Many men experience changes as they age. A slight stinging at the end of urination can be associated with a number of things, and we'll explore those possibilities. Have you noticed any increased frequency or urgency in your urination?
PATIENT: Frequency… urgency… Let me see. I suppose I have been going to the lavatory a bit more often lately. Though that could simply be the tea, you know. My wife makes a very strong brew. And I do enjoy a good cup in the afternoon. Urgency… now, that’s a different matter. I wouldn't say I’m rushing to the toilet, but… perhaps I hesitate a little longer before going. A man doesn’t want to be caught short, you understand. It's a matter of dignity. Perhaps I'm being more cautious these days. Old age and all that.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Krok. So, increased frequency, possibly related to tea consumption, and a slight hesitation before urinating. Now, have you experienced any fever, chills, or lower abdominal pain?
PATIENT: Fever? Chills? Good heavens, no! I feel perfectly fine, otherwise. A little stiff in the mornings, perhaps, but that’s just the arthritis. And abdominal pain… well, I have a touch of indigestion now and then, but that’s from the spicy food my wife makes. She insists on using too much chili. No fever, no chills, no pain… just this… discharge. It’s rather frustrating, you know. I lead a quiet life, I don’t bother anyone… and then this happens. It's simply… inconvenient.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Krok. No fever, chills, or abdominal pain. Now, to get a better understanding of your medical history, could you tell me about any previous medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with?
PATIENT: Medical conditions… oh dear. Where to begin? I had a touch of pneumonia when I was younger, many decades ago. And arthritis, as I mentioned. In my knees, mostly. And my wife insists I have a touch of… high blood pressure, but I don't feel any different. I had my prostate checked years ago, back when Dr. Henderson was still practicing. He said it was… enlarged, but nothing to worry about. That was… oh, twenty years ago, perhaps? I've always been a reasonably healthy man, Doctor. I work hard, I eat well… mostly. I don't drink or smoke, never have. I suppose I'm just… getting old. Is that a medical condition?
DOCTOR: Getting older is certainly a part of life, Mr. Krok. Pneumonia in the past, arthritis, and a history of an enlarged prostate. We'll consider all of that. Now, have you ever had any surgeries?
PATIENT: Surgeries… hmm. Let me see. I had my appendix removed when I was a boy, a very long time ago. And I had a cataract operation in my left eye a few years back, that went well. Other than that… no, I don't believe so. Nothing major, thankfully. I’ve always been careful to avoid hospitals, if you know what I mean. Too many germs, too much… fuss. My wife convinced me to have the cataract done, said I couldn’t read the newspaper properly. A sensible woman, my wife, but she does worry unnecessarily sometimes.
DOCTOR: Appendix removal and cataract surgery. Thank you. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me think. Just the pills for my arthritis, Doctor. My wife handles those, mostly. I believe they’re called… naproxen? Something like that. A small white pill. And sometimes, when my arthritis is particularly bad, she gives me something stronger, a yellow one. But I don’t take them regularly, just when I need to. And I take a vitamin D supplement, the doctor recommended it because I don't get much sun. Other than that… no, nothing else. I prefer to rely on natural remedies, if possible. A bit of ginger tea, a warm bath… things like that.
DOCTOR: Naproxen, a stronger pain reliever occasionally, and vitamin D. Thank you. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else, such as food or environmental factors?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I’m aware of, Doctor. I’ve never had a reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I eat most foods, though I don't particularly care for shellfish. My wife makes me try it occasionally, but it doesn’t agree with me. And I get a bit of hay fever in the spring, but that’s just the pollen. Nothing serious. I’ve never had a severe allergic reaction, thankfully. I consider myself quite robust, all things considered. I've always been careful about what I eat and drink, and I avoid things that might upset my stomach. A sensible man, you see.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Mr. Krok. That’s very helpful information. Now, I’d like to perform a brief physical examination, if you’re comfortable with that. This will involve listening to your heart and lungs, checking your blood pressure, and a brief examination of your abdomen and, if you are comfortable, a genitourinary exam to assess the source of the discharge. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A… a physical examination? Well, I suppose it’s necessary. Though I must confess, I’m not particularly fond of doctors poking and prodding. The heart and lungs, blood pressure… that’s fine. But a… a genitourinary exam? That sounds… rather intrusive, Doctor. Is it absolutely necessary? Couldn't you perhaps diagnose the problem without… without going to such lengths? I’m an old man, you see. A bit… delicate. Perhaps we could try something else first? A blood test, perhaps? Or some sort of… scan? I'd rather not have that area examined, if you understand. It's a matter of… privacy, you see. And dignity.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your concerns, Mr. Krok. Your comfort and dignity are my utmost priority. A physical exam is the most direct way to assess the cause of the discharge, and it will help me to determine the best course of treatment. However, we can certainly start with less invasive tests first. We can begin with a urine sample to check for infection. And a blood test to rule out any other underlying conditions. If the results of those tests are inconclusive, then we can discuss the possibility of a more detailed examination at that time. Would that be more comfortable for you?
PATIENT: That… that sounds much more reasonable, Doctor. A urine sample and a blood test. Yes, I can certainly manage those. No poking and prodding, at least not yet. My wife will be pleased to hear that. She’s been urging me to see a doctor for weeks, but I’ve been hesitant. She's a practical woman, my wife, but she does tend to worry unnecessarily. A urine sample and a blood test… yes, that sounds perfectly acceptable. Where do I go to provide the sample? And will I need to fast for the blood test? It's all rather inconvenient, you see, but I suppose it's necessary if you insist.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Krok. The restroom is just through that door. There’s a sterile collection cup inside. Just try to collect a mid-stream sample – meaning, start urinating and then collect a sample mid-way through. As for the blood test, yes, you will need to fast for at least eight hours beforehand. That means no food or drink other than water. The nurse will draw the blood right here in the examination room after we collect the urine sample. She will explain everything to you. Would you like me to have the nurse come in and assist you with the urine collection now?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be most helpful, Doctor. I’m not as nimble as I used to be, you see. A little assistance with the… collection would be greatly appreciated. And please, tell the nurse not to rush me. I need a moment to… compose myself. It’s all rather embarrassing, you understand. But I suppose it's necessary. Tell her thank you in advance for her patience. And remind her to explain everything clearly. I don't like surprises. A little dignity, that’s all I ask. Now, where is this restroom? And should I… should I remove anything before I go? A sensible man always prepares, you see.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Krok. I will explain everything to the nurse. She is very kind and considerate. You don't need to remove anything for the sample. Just follow the instructions on the cup. The restroom is right through that door, just to your left. I will give you a moment of privacy, and I'll be right here when you’re finished. Take your time, and please don’t hesitate to call if you need anything at all.
PATIENT: .
