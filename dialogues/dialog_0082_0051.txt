DOCTOR: Good morning, Darl. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Iuzzolino. It’s nice to meet you. Now, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s… nice to meet you as well. Let me see… my memory isn’t what it used to be, you understand. My… a friend suggested I come in. Something about needing to know my blood type. Yes, that’s it! Just… knowing my blood type. It’s for… well, I can't quite recall why exactly, but it seemed important.
DOCTOR: Yes, knowing your blood type is always a good thing to know. It’s useful information to have on hand, just in case. And don't worry about not remembering the specifics, that happens. We'll get it sorted out. Before we do that, though, could you tell me a little bit about your overall health?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Overall health… Hmm. Well, I’m… 79 years old, if that tells you anything! I get around alright, mostly. A bit of creaking now and then, you know? And my eyesight isn’t what it used to be, as you can probably see. I had a bit of a fall last year, nothing broken, thankfully, just a bit bruised. Other than that… I mostly just try to take things easy. I used to be very active, you see. A rigger, I was. But that was… a long time ago.
DOCTOR: A rigger, that sounds like demanding work! It’s good you’re still getting around, despite everything. And taking it easy is a sensible approach. Now, about that fall last year… did you see a doctor for it at the time?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, I did. Down at the… well, it was a clinic, somewhere nearby. A young doctor looked me over. Said I was just bruised, thankfully. No broken bones, like I said. They… bandaged me up a bit and sent me on my way. I don’t remember much else about it, to be honest. They asked a lot of questions, I think, but my head was swimming a bit at the time. It all feels a bit hazy now.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, it’s not always easy to remember everything, especially after an injury. Do you recall if they did any scans, like an X-ray or a CT scan, to rule out anything more serious?
PATIENT: Oh, scans… hmm. I don’t think so. I remember a lot of poking and prodding, and someone shining a light in my eyes, but no big machines. It was all very quick, you see. Just a check-up to make sure nothing was broken. They definitely didn’t put me in one of those… tubes, if you know what I mean. I don’t like those things. Makes me feel quite claustrophobic.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s helpful to know. Now, are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Oh, yes! I take something for my… well, it’s for my blood pressure, I think. A little white pill. And sometimes, when my arthritis flares up, I take something for that too. A pink one, I believe. But that’s only when it’s really bothering me. I used to take something for my cholesterol, but the doctor said I could stop a while back. It's all a bit confusing, to be honest. I have a little bag with them, but it's somewhere in the kitchen, I think.
DOCTOR: That's alright, don't worry about it. We can sort through it all. Do you have any allergies to any medications, or to anything else for that matter, like foods or pollen?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. That's a good question. I don’t think so. I've never really had a bad reaction to anything, as far as I can remember. I used to get hay fever as a child, but that was a long time ago. And I’m not a big fan of shellfish, but that's more a matter of taste than an allergy, you see. My grandmother always said shellfish was bad for the digestion, so I’ve avoided it ever since.
DOCTOR: Alright, that’s good to know. Now, before we get to the blood type, let me just do a quick physical exam, just to get a general sense of how you’re doing. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I don’t mind a bit of poking and prodding, as long as it doesn’t take too long. I get a bit chilly easily, you see. And my bones creak, as I mentioned before. But I’ll try to be still.
DOCTOR: Certainly. It won’t take long, and I'll be as gentle as possible. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Can you take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. Like this? Is that alright? I used to be very good at holding my breath, you see. When I was a rigger, we had to do a lot of that. It’s a bit rusty now, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Good, that’s perfect. Your breathing sounds clear, no wheezing or crackles noted. Now, I’m going to take your blood pressure and pulse. Blood pressure is a little elevated, but not critically high. Pulse is good. Now, I'll just check your reflexes…
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Elevated, you say? Is that bad? I do worry a bit about my health, you see. My husband… he had a bad heart, you know. But I try not to dwell on it. It was a long time ago. Reflexes… alright, go ahead. Whatever you need to do, Doctor. I’m a very patient woman, you know.
DOCTOR: Your reflexes are normal, good. And don't worry too much about the slightly elevated blood pressure. It's not dramatically high, and we can monitor it. It’s good you’re mindful of your health. It’s important to be aware of these things. Now, before we proceed with the blood type, do you have any other concerns you'd like to discuss?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, I don’t think so. I mostly just wanted to know my blood type, as I said. My friend… oh, what was her name?… she said it was important. Perhaps for a… a card? Or something like that. I really can’t recall. My memory is just dreadful these days. I suppose that’s just part of getting old.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright. It’s very common to have some memory lapses as we get older. Alright, let's get that blood type checked for you then. I’ll just need a small sample of blood. Nurse will come in and take that for me, if that's okay. It'll just be a quick prick of the finger.
PATIENT: Oh, a prick of the finger, you say? That doesn’t sound too bad. Yes, that’s fine. As long as it doesn’t take too long. I get a bit faint sometimes, you see. But I’ll try to be brave. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Darl. It will be quick, and I'll be right here. I'll have the nurse come in right away. And don’t worry, we’ll take good care of you.
PATIENT: Oh, thank you, Doctor. That’s very kind of you. I appreciate it.
