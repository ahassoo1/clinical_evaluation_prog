DOCTOR: Good morning, Amy. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Glazewski. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, can you tell me a bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you as well. Well, I’ve noticed a… a lump, I guess you’d call it, in my lower abdomen. It’s been there for a little while now, and I thought it was best to get it checked out.
DOCTOR: Okay, a lump in your lower abdomen. I understand. And when you say “a little while,” could you be a bit more specific?
PATIENT: Hmm, let me think. Probably… about three months, maybe a little longer? It didn't bother me at first, so I didn’t really pay much attention to it. But it hasn’t gone away, and it feels… a bit bigger now, so I decided it was time to see a doctor.
DOCTOR: Three months, alright. And has it been consistently growing, or does it fluctuate in size?
PATIENT: That's a good question. I think it has been growing, slowly. It's hard to say for sure, because I don't check it every day, you know? But I feel like it’s definitely noticeable more often now than it was a month or two ago. It doesn’t seem to change much day to day, though. Just… gradually bigger over time.
DOCTOR: Okay, gradual growth over the past three months. And are you experiencing any pain or discomfort associated with it?
PATIENT: No, not really. That’s part of why I waited to come in. It doesn't hurt. Sometimes, if I’m being really active – like after a long dance rehearsal – I feel a bit of pressure, but it’s not pain, exactly. More like… an awareness of it. It’s not constant, though.
DOCTOR: Alright, no pain, just some pressure with activity. That’s helpful to know. Now, have you noticed any other changes in that area?
PATIENT: No, not that I’ve noticed. No redness, no changes in my bowel habits, nothing like that. Everything else feels… normal, I suppose. I mean, I haven’t had any fever or weight loss or anything worrying like that.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. No other associated symptoms. Now, just to get a more complete picture, can you tell me a little about your past medical history?
PATIENT: Sure. I'm generally pretty healthy. I haven't had any major illnesses or surgeries. I have Medicare, as you can see. I do see a physical therapist occasionally for some minor muscle strains from dancing, but that’s about it. My wife and I, we both try to eat well and stay active. I don’t really have any allergies that I know of.
DOCTOR: Okay, generally healthy, no major medical history, physical therapy for muscle strains, no known allergies. And are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: No, I'm not. Just the occasional ibuprofen if I really need it for a sore muscle, but I don’t take anything regularly. I try to avoid medication when I can. Is that important?
DOCTOR: That's fine, Amy. It’s always good to know. Now, just a couple more questions to get a full picture. Do you have a family history of any medical conditions, particularly anything related to the abdomen or digestive system?
PATIENT: Hmm. That's a tricky one. My mother had some stomach problems when she was older, but I don't know the specifics. It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about it much. My father was healthy as a horse, and my wife’s family… I don’t know their medical history very well. Nothing that immediately springs to mind, if that makes sense. It's not a topic we've discussed in detail.
DOCTOR: Okay, limited family history information. That's alright. Now, just to clarify, are you currently working?
PATIENT: Yes, I am. I’m a choreographer, so I’m on my feet a lot, rehearsing and teaching. It keeps me busy, but I enjoy it. I’ve been doing it for quite a while now. It requires a lot of physical activity, as you can imagine. Is that relevant to what’s going on?
DOCTOR: It is, yes. Physical activity can be a factor. Alright, Amy, I think I have a good preliminary understanding of your situation. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam to get a better look at the lump and assess your overall health. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that's perfectly alright. I was expecting that, to be honest. Please, go ahead. Just let me know if anything feels uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, I'm going to start by listening to your abdomen with my stethoscope. Then I'll gently palpate – that means feel – the area to assess the size, shape, and consistency of the lump. Please let me know immediately if you experience any pain or discomfort. Your bowel sounds are normal. Now, I'm going to gently feel your abdomen. I can feel a distinct lump in your lower abdomen, roughly… two centimeters in diameter. It feels firm, but not particularly hard. It’s not tender to the touch, which is good. There’s no rebound tenderness, and no guarding. I don’t feel any associated lymph node swelling in the area. I'm also going to check your reflexes and blood pressure. Your reflexes are normal, and your blood pressure is 128/76, which is within the normal range. Based on this initial exam, the lump is not acutely concerning, but we need to investigate further to determine its cause. It could be a number of things, such as a lipoma, a hernia, or, less commonly, something else. I'd like to order a complete blood count and a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: That sounds… thorough, which is good. A CT scan sounds a bit intimidating, but if you think it's necessary, then yes, that's alright. I trust your judgment, Doctor. What exactly will the CT scan show? And what about the blood count? What are we looking for there?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly reasonable to feel a little apprehensive about a CT scan, Amy. It's a very effective imaging tool, though. It uses X-rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of your abdomen and pelvis, allowing us to visualize the lump and surrounding structures. We'll be able to see its size, shape, location, and density, which can help us narrow down the possible causes. It can help rule out certain conditions and guide further investigation if needed. As for the complete blood count, or CBC, that’s a routine blood test that provides information about the different types of cells in your blood – red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. We're looking for any signs of infection or inflammation, which could indicate an underlying problem. It also gives us a general assessment of your overall health. It’s a good baseline test, really. I'm going to write up the orders for these tests now. The lab will draw your blood, and the CT scan can be scheduled at the imaging center down the hall. Do you have any questions about the tests or the scheduling process?
PATIENT: No, I think I understand everything you've explained. The imaging center down the hall is convenient. I'm a little worried, of course, but I appreciate you explaining everything so clearly, Doctor. It makes me feel better knowing what to expect. Will the results be sent directly to you? And how long will it take to get them back?
DOCTOR: I’m glad I could ease your concerns, Amy. It’s perfectly normal to feel worried, but we're taking all the necessary steps to get a clear understanding of what's going on. Yes, the results from both the blood work and the CT scan will be sent directly to me electronically. Typically, the blood work results come back within 24-48 hours. The CT scan results usually take a little longer, about 3-5 business days, as they need to be reviewed by a radiologist. I’ll contact you as soon as I have the results and we can discuss them in detail. In the meantime, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms – such as pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits – please contact the clinic immediately. Do you have any questions before we finish up today?
PATIENT: No, I don't think so. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. Thank you again, Doctor. I appreciate your time and your patience. I'll schedule the tests now and hope for the best.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Amy. I’m happy to help. And remember, we're being proactive here. It's often best to investigate these things, even if it turns out to be nothing serious. Please don’t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns. I’ll be in touch as soon as I have the results. Have a good day, Amy. And try not to worry too much.
