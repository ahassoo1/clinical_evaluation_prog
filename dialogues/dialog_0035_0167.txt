DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Stoegbauer. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Alzoubi. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. It’s nice to meet you. Well, my foot is… hurting. A lot. It’s got a sore on it that won't go away, and it’s making it hard to walk. I think it’s from the sugar sickness, you know? The diabetes.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. So, you’re having foot pain and a sore that isn’t healing, and you suspect it’s related to your diabetes. That’s a good thing to be aware of. Let’s get some more information about this. First, can you tell me where exactly on your foot the sore is located?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. It’s… on the bottom of my foot. Near my big toe. It’s hard to see, though. I’m not so good at bending over anymore. It's kind of red, and… well, it’s just not happy.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, the bottom of your foot near the big toe. And you said it’s red and doesn't seem to be getting better. How long has this sore been there?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That's a good question. It feels like… maybe a month? Or a little more? Time gets away from me, you know. It started small, just a little spot. I didn't think much of it at first. Now… well, now it hurts to put my shoe on.
DOCTOR: A month or so. Okay. And has anything specifically made it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm... Walking, definitely walking. And… standing for too long. I used to like garden, but I haven’t been able to do much of that lately. It really bothers it when I try. I think new shoes made it worse too, but maybe I'm wrong. It’s hard to say.
DOCTOR: Alright. So walking and standing aggravate it, and potentially new shoes. Do you notice any drainage or pus coming from the sore?
PATIENT: Drainage? Pus? I don’t know what that looks like. It’s… sometimes it gets a little wet, I guess? Not a lot. More like… a little bit of clear liquid. Sometimes it's a little… yellow. Is that the pus you mean? I try to keep it clean with soap and water, but… it’s hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, a little clear or yellow liquid. That’s helpful to know. And you’re doing the right thing by keeping it clean. Now, let’s talk about your diabetes for a moment. Do you check your blood sugar regularly?
PATIENT: Oh yes, I do. My daughter, Leilani, she helped me get one of those machines. I poke my finger every morning, like she tells me. It's… sometimes high, sometimes okay. I don't always understand the numbers, though. It’s a lot to keep track of, you know? What number is too high?
DOCTOR: I understand it can be overwhelming. What’s been the highest number you’ve seen recently?
PATIENT: Hmmm. Let me think… I wrote it down somewhere… Ah! Here it is. It says… 285, last week. That was a bad day. I had a little bit of guava cake, maybe that’s why. Leilani wasn’t happy.
DOCTOR: Okay, 285 is definitely high. Generally, we like to see blood sugars below 140 when fasting. Now, have you ever had any problems with your feet before – numbness, tingling, any previous sores or infections?
PATIENT: Numbness… yes, sometimes. In my toes, mostly. It comes and goes. Not all the time, but especially in the cold. And… I had a little cut on my heel a long time ago, maybe five years back? It took a while to heal, I remember that. Leilani took me to the doctor then too. It wasn't this bad, though. This one really hurts.
DOCTOR: Alright, so some numbness in your toes and a slow-healing cut on your heel in the past. That’s good information. Okay, Mr. Stoegbauer, I'm going to take a look at your foot now, if that's alright. Can you please remove your shoe and sock?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that is fine. It's not a pretty sight, I'm afraid. Be careful, it’s sensitive.
DOCTOR: Okay. I see the sore here on the bottom of your foot near your big toe. It appears to be about a centimeter in diameter, with some redness and some surrounding swelling. I do see some yellow discoloration in the center, which could indicate some infection. Your pulses are present, which is good, but I also notice some decreased sensation in your toes. I'm concerned about a possible diabetic foot ulcer with a potential infection. Given your history of diabetes, numbness, and slow healing, it’s important we address this quickly. I recommend we get some cultures done to identify any bacteria present and potentially start you on a course of antibiotics. I also want to get an X-ray of your foot to rule out any underlying bone infection.
PATIENT: Oh dear. That sounds… serious. Antibiotics and an X-ray? What if it’s bad, Doctor? Will I have to… get my foot cut off? Leilani always worries about that. She says the sugar sickness can do terrible things. I just want to be able to walk again. I miss my garden.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. Stoegbauer, and it’s good that Leilani is looking out for you. It's important to address this seriously, but let’s not jump to conclusions. Most diabetic foot ulcers do not require amputation. We are taking these steps now to prevent complications and promote healing. The X-ray will help us assess the bone and rule out any deeper infection. The cultures will tell us what, if any, bacteria are present so we can choose the right antibiotic. We'll start with these tests and then develop a plan together. I also want to refer you to a podiatrist – a foot specialist – for ongoing care and wound management. They can provide specialized treatment and help protect your foot. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: A foot specialist… that sounds good. And not… cutting it off right away? That’s good to hear. Yes, let’s do the tests and see the foot doctor. What do I have to do now? Will it hurt? I don’t want to cause too much trouble for Leilani. She's been so busy lately.
DOCTOR: No, we’re not talking about amputation at this point. The goal is to heal the wound and prevent any further complications. Okay, so first, the lab will draw some blood for the cultures and basic bloodwork. It will be a routine blood draw, and shouldn’t be too painful. Then, we’ll get an X-ray of your foot – you’ll just need to stand still for a few moments while the machine takes the picture. The technician will explain everything. I'm going to write you a referral to Dr. Keanu, a podiatrist here in town. They specialize in diabetic foot care. I'll also give you a prescription for a course of antibiotics to start today. As for Leilani, don’t worry about causing her trouble. We are here to help. We can discuss how to best manage this with her as well. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications?
PATIENT: No allergies, Doctor. I don’t think so. My daughter always asks me that, and I always say no. I did have a little trouble with some cream once, a long time ago, but I can't remember what it was. It just made my skin itchy. I’m not sure it was an allergy, though. It could have just been the sun. And… what about walking? Should I stay off my foot? I need to get to the market for guava. Leilani likes guava cake.
DOCTOR: Okay, a possible skin irritation in the past, but no known allergies. That’s good to know. As for walking, yes, it's best to minimize weight-bearing on your foot as much as possible to allow the wound to heal. Try to avoid long walks or standing for extended periods. I'm going to order you a walking boot to provide support and protection. We can discuss assistive devices, like a cane, if needed. I'll give you detailed instructions on wound care – how to keep it clean and dressed. It's very important to follow these instructions carefully. I'm also going to schedule a follow-up appointment with me in one week to check your progress. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: A walking boot… and a cane? That sounds like a lot. Wound care… Leilani will have to help me with that. She’s much better at things like that. One week… yes, that’s good. Will I be able to garden again, Doctor? That’s what I miss the most. I like to grow tomatoes. And hibiscus. It’s good for the bees.
DOCTOR: That’s a very important question, Mr. Stoegbauer. And I understand how much you miss your garden. It's difficult to say for certain right now, but with proper care and healing, there’s a good chance you’ll be able to garden again. We need to focus on getting this wound healed first. Once that’s done, and with the podiatrist’s guidance, we can work on a plan to get you back to your tomatoes and hibiscus. It may require some modifications – perhaps raised garden beds or assistive tools – but I don’t see why you couldn't enjoy gardening again. Here are your wound care instructions, the referral to Dr. Keanu, and a prescription for the antibiotics. The pharmacy number is on the paper if you have questions. And remember, if you notice any signs of infection – increased redness, swelling, pain, pus, fever – contact my office immediately. Do you have any other questions for me before we finish?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I think that’s everything. Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. And for not saying I’d have to cut off my foot. I’ll tell Leilani about the podiatrist and the wound care. She’ll be happy to hear we have a plan. And I’ll try my best to stay off my foot. Maybe I’ll just sit in the garden and watch the bees for now. Thank you again, Doctor Alzoubi. You’ve been very kind.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Stoegbauer. I'm glad I could help. And that’s a lovely idea – sitting in the garden and watching the bees sounds peaceful. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to support you. Have a good day, and I'll see you in one week.
