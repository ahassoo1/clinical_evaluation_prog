DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Bartok. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Dashevsky. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Dashevsky, you say? Yes, well, I’m here for… a check-up. For the team. A sports team. I think. It’s… for my body. To make sure it still works. You know? It's what the coach said.
DOCTOR: A check-up for the team, okay. That’s perfectly reasonable. So, the coach recommended you come in for a general assessment?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right. The coach. He's a young fella. Very… enthusiastic. He said something about making sure I wasn't too… broken. I don’t remember exactly. It's been a while since I had to do something like this. Back in my day… we didn't bother with so many checks. Just played. What kind of checks are you doing, anyway? It's not like I'm going to be running a marathon, you know.
DOCTOR: I understand. Things have changed a bit over the years, and it's good to be proactive. We’ll do a fairly standard check-up, just to get a baseline of your overall health. We’ll go over your medical history, do a physical exam – listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, things like that. And potentially some blood work, depending on what we find. Just to clarify, Mr. Bartok, what sport are you involved in with the team?
PATIENT: Sport… now that is a question. Let me see… It involves a… a ball? Yes, definitely a ball. And running. A little. Mostly… throwing. Or catching. Or maybe hitting. It's all a bit of a blur, honestly. It's with the… the Old Timers. That’s what they call the team. Old Timers… because we are old timers! I think it’s baseball. Or softball. Something with a diamond. Does that help? I'm terrible with remembering names these days.
DOCTOR: That definitely helps, Mr. Bartok! So, you’re playing with the Old Timers baseball team. That’s good to know. It sounds like a fun way to stay active. To get a better picture of things, could you tell me a little bit about your general health?
PATIENT: General health… well, I’m still here, aren't I? I get a little tired sometimes. And my knees… they make noises. Lots of noises. Like old doors creaking. I used to be able to run for days, but now… not so much. I get the usual aches and pains, you know? What kind of things are you asking about? Are you looking for anything specific? I don’t get sick much, if that helps. Mostly just… old.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s helpful to know. Tiredness, creaky knees, and general aches and pains, and generally feeling “old” – that’s all good information. We'll explore those a bit more. And yes, I’m trying to get a complete picture of your health, so we can see if there's anything that needs addressing. Now, have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions in the past – things like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart problems, arthritis…?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Doctors… I've seen a few in my time. There was that one time with my back… pulled something lifting boxes. And… I think I had a bit of a cough a few years back. The wife – my ex-wife – she used to drag me to the doctor for everything. As for those big names… high blood… something? No, I don’t think so. They never told me anything I could remember. She handled all that. I mostly just took the pills she gave me. Nothing serious, I’m sure. Arthritis… now that sounds familiar. Something about swollen joints… does that count?
DOCTOR: Okay, so a pulled back muscle in the past, a cough, and potentially arthritis. It’s understandable that it’s hard to remember details, especially if someone else managed your healthcare previously. Just to clarify, Mr. Bartok, do you currently have any pain in your joints – your knees, hands, or anywhere else?
PATIENT: Well, yes, actually. My knees, definitely. Like I said, they make noises. And sometimes they ache, especially when it's cold. Or damp. Or when I try to… you know, do something. And my hands… they're a little stiff in the mornings. Not terrible, but noticeable. I used to have strong hands. Could build anything. Now… not so much. It’s just old age, I guess. Everything gets a little… rusty. Do you need me to… show you? I can crack my knuckles, if you want. It's very satisfying. Maybe not.
DOCTOR: No, that's quite alright, Mr. Bartok. No need to demonstrate. It sounds like you’re experiencing some stiffness and pain in your knees and hands, which is what I suspected. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… now that’s a good question. Let me see… there was that one time with my tonsils. When I was a kid. A long time ago. They took them out. I remember being very sore afterward. And… I think I had my appendix out at some point? Or maybe someone else did. My memory's a bit… patchy. Hospitalized… yes, I was in the hospital once when I broke my arm. Playing baseball, of course. Always baseball. I don’t remember much else. It was a long time ago. It wasn’t serious, though. Just a broken arm. Nothing like some people have.
DOCTOR: Okay, tonsillectomy and appendectomy as a child, and a broken arm from playing baseball. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'm going to ask about your family history. Do you know if anyone in your family – parents, siblings, grandparents – has had any medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or arthritis?
PATIENT: Family… that’s another tough one. My family… wasn't much for talking about those things. My mother… she passed away a long time ago. I think she had… something with her heart? Or maybe it was her lungs. I don't really know. And my father… he wasn't around much. Never talked about health. My siblings… I have a brother, I think. Haven't seen him in years. And a sister… somewhere. No one ever talked about what they had. We just… didn't. It wasn't something we did. So, no. I don't know. Sorry. I wish I could be more helpful. It's just… a blur. A long, long blur.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bartok. Family medical history can be difficult to recall, especially if it wasn’t something openly discussed. It's not your responsibility to know all those details. Now, a few questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?
PATIENT: Smoke? No, never. Never touched the stuff. My mother hated smoking. She used to say it would ruin your lungs. And my ex-wife… well, she didn't allow it. She was very… particular. No, I don't smoke. Never have. Don't even like the smell of it. What about alcohol? Now that's a different story… but not much anymore. Just a glass of wine with dinner sometimes. Nothing crazy. Mostly just water, these days. Gotta stay hydrated, you know? Old age and all that.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Mr. Bartok. No tobacco use and only occasional alcohol. Now, I'm going to ask about any medications you're currently taking, including over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements.
PATIENT: Medications… let me see. Well, there are those pills the doctor gave me for my knees. A little white pill. I take them sometimes, when they really bother me. Can’t remember the name. And… I take a multivitamin, every morning. My ex-wife made me. She said it was good for my health. And… oh, there’s that aspirin I take when I have a headache. Just a regular aspirin. Nothing fancy. That's about it, I think. I don't take much. I try to stay away from those things if I can. Don't like feeling all… medicated.
DOCTOR: Okay, a medication for your knees that you take as needed, a multivitamin, and aspirin for headaches. Do you know the dosage of the medication you take for your knees?
PATIENT: Dosage? Now you're asking too much, Doctor. I just take one. Maybe two, if it's really bad. The little white pill. It's a small one. The bottle… it's somewhere in the kitchen. My ex-wife kept all the medications organized. She had a whole cabinet for them. I never paid much attention. I just took what she gave me. I don’t know numbers, Doctor. I'm not a mathematician. Sorry. I wish I could tell you more. It's just a little white pill. I take it when my knees hurt. That's all I know.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Bartok. Don't worry about it. It sounds like it's a small white pill you take as needed for your knee pain. We can look it up based on what it looks like later. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmm. Let me see… Not that I know of. I’ve always been pretty good with food. I eat just about anything. And I’ve never had a reaction to any medications, at least not that I remember. I’ve never been stung by a bee, thankfully. My ex-wife always told me to be careful around flowers. She was very cautious. I don’t think I’m allergic to anything. But I can’t say for sure. It’s been a long time since anyone asked me about allergies. I’m pretty lucky, I guess. No allergies. Hopefully.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That's good to hear. Now, Mr. Bartok, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. Just a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and reflexes, and take a look at your knees. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: A physical exam? Oh. Well… alright. If you think it’s necessary. Just… please be gentle. My knees aren't what they used to be. And I don't like being poked and prodded. But… yes. Go ahead. But gently, Doctor. Very gently.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Bartok. I will be very gentle. It won't take long. <stage>I wash my hands and put on a stethoscope. I begin by checking your blood pressure. "Just relax your arm for me." After taking your blood pressure, I listen to your heart and lungs with the stethoscope, noting the sounds. "Take a deep breath in... and out..." I then ask you to sit forward as I listen again. "Normal heart sounds, good breath sounds bilaterally." Finally, I ask you to extend your legs. "Now, let's take a look at your knees. Any pain when I move them this way?
PATIENT: Ooh, that's… a little uncomfortable. Not terrible, but… yes, a little pain. Right there. Like a dull ache. And when you bend it all the way… yes, definitely pain there. Like something’s clicking. It’s always been like that, though. My knees have been clicking since… well, for a long time. It's just old age, I guess. Be careful, Doctor. They're fragile, you know. Fragile.
DOCTOR: Okay, Mr. Bartok. Based on what I'm feeling, it sounds like you have some osteoarthritis in your knees, which is very common with age and activity. The clicking and pain are consistent with that. It doesn't seem to be anything acutely severe. We may want to get an x-ray to confirm the extent of the arthritis, but for now, we can start with some conservative management. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Arth-what-itis? Is that… bad? I’ve never heard of that. Like something’s broken? Conservative… what does that mean? Like, just… ignore it? I don't understand. I just want my knees to stop hurting. Is this going to stop me from playing baseball? That's all I care about, really. Is this going to stop me?
DOCTOR: No, no, Mr. Bartok, it’s not like something is broken. Osteoarthritis is a wear and tear on the cartilage in your joints. It’s very common as we get older, and it’s usually manageable. Conservative management means we’ll try things like physical therapy, over-the-counter pain relievers, and potentially injections to help relieve the pain and improve your function before considering more invasive options like surgery. And no, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have to stop playing baseball. We’ll work together to develop a plan to help you continue playing as comfortably as possible. We may need to modify your activity level, focus on strengthening exercises, and use pain relief strategies to keep you on the field. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: So… not surgery right away? That's good. I don't like doctors poking around. Physical therapy… that means exercises, right? Like stretching? I can do stretching. And over-the-counter… those pills I take for headaches? Is that what you mean? So… I can still play baseball, as long as I take pills and stretch? That doesn’t sound so bad. As long as I can still play. But what about the injections? What are those? And do they hurt?
DOCTOR: Exactly! No surgery right away. We’ll start with the simplest things first. Stretching is a good start. And yes, over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or naproxen can help manage the pain. And yes, the injections are a steroid injection. They can help reduce inflammation and pain in the knee joint, giving you more relief. It’s a shot directly into the knee, and there is some mild discomfort associated with it – a little pinch – but it’s generally well-tolerated. The effects can last for several months. We can also discuss further imaging like an X-Ray to assess the joint to help with the diagnosis. Now, let's create a plan. I want you to start with some gentle stretching and strengthening exercises for your knees. I’ll give you a handout with some examples. And try taking ibuprofen or naproxen as needed, following the instructions on the bottle. If your pain isn’t improving after a week or two, we can consider the injection. Does that sound good to you?
PATIENT: Stretching… I can do that. A handout… good. I like pictures. And ibuprofen… yes, I know that one. My ex-wife always had that in the cabinet. Pictures and pills… yes, that sounds manageable. But… what if it doesn’t get better? What if the pills don't work? Will I have to stop playing? I just want to keep playing, Doctor. That's all I care about. It's the only thing that keeps me going.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Bartok. You want to keep playing, and that’s a very good goal. If the pills and exercises don’t provide enough relief, we can discuss the injection. If that doesn't help we can discuss referral to an orthopedist. It’s important to remember that there are many treatment options available. I'll also see you in a week to see how you're doing. And in the meantime, if your pain suddenly worsens, or you experience any new symptoms, please don’t hesitate to call the office. I want to make sure we explore all options to keep you on the field as long as possible. I'll write you a prescription for an anti-inflammatory, as well as a handout with stretching exercises for your knees. And I'll give you the number for a good physical therapist in the area. Do you have any other questions for me today?
PATIENT: No, I think that's everything. You’ve explained everything very well, Doctor. Pictures, pills, and stretching… yes, I can manage that. Thank you. Thank you very much. I feel much better now. Just… promise me I can still play baseball. That's all I want. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. Bartok. I understand how important baseball is to you, and I promise we’ll do everything we can to keep you playing. Here are those handouts and the prescription. Take care, and please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And good luck on the field!
