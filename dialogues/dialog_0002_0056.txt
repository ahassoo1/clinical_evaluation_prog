DOCTOR: Hi Erle, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Ranjan. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor… Ranjan, is it? Yes. It’s… troublesome, really. I’ve been a teacher for… a very long time. A long time. And things… aren't as they were. Frankly, the students these days… it’s exhausting. I believe someone suggested I come. To… alleviate stress, they said. Though I hardly see how talking will change anything.
DOCTOR: It sounds like you’re feeling quite worn down, Erle. It's admirable that you've dedicated so much time to teaching. And it's completely reasonable to feel exhausted after so many years. It’s good you came in – sometimes just talking things through can help us figure out what's going on and how to best manage things. When you say “things aren’t as they were,” could you tell me a little more about what specifically is troublesome?
PATIENT: Troublesome? Everything, Doctor. Everything is troublesome. The… disrespect, for one. No one appreciates the value of knowledge anymore. They’re all glued to those… devices. And the questions! Utterly… simple things they could find out themselves. Honestly, it’s like teaching a room full of… well, never mind. It’s a waste of my time, explaining things readily available. And the administration… don’t even get me started on them. A constant parade of… new initiatives. Utter nonsense. Is this really necessary, Doctor? I've been doing this for decades.
DOCTOR: It sounds incredibly frustrating, Erle. Dealing with disrespect, students who aren’t engaged, and administrative changes all at once… that’s a lot to handle. It's understandable why you’re feeling worn down. It sounds like this isn't a new feeling, but something that's been building up over time. When did you start noticing these feelings becoming particularly difficult to manage?
PATIENT: Difficult to manage… hmm. Oh dear. That’s a good question. Everything… blurred together after… after my wife left. Yes, that was… 2018, I believe? Perhaps a bit earlier. Around then. It all became rather… pointless, after that. The job… the students… It just… continued. One long, monotonous… continuation. I suppose it's been getting worse steadily since then. Though I don’t recall specifics. Specifics are… unimportant. It’s the feeling of… exasperation. That’s what matters. Is this going to take much longer, Doctor? I have… arrangements to make.
DOCTOR: I understand, Erle. Losing your wife must have been incredibly difficult, and it makes perfect sense that would have a significant impact on how you feel about everything else. It's okay that specifics are unimportant – focusing on the feeling of exasperation is very helpful. Just to get a clearer picture, and to rule out anything else contributing to how you’re feeling, could you tell me if you've noticed any changes in your sleep, appetite, or energy levels since 2018?
PATIENT: Sleep? Adequate. I sleep. Appetite? I eat when I must. Energy levels… dwindling, naturally. One doesn’t have the same… vigour at my age. It’s perfectly normal. Honestly, Doctor, these are… basic observations. I'm not a child. I assure you, I’m perfectly aware of the effects of aging. I'm a Library Science teacher; I deal with… deterioration of materials all the time. It’s rather analogous, really. Are we nearing the end of this, Doctor? I have a very important… book club meeting.
DOCTOR: You’re right to point that out – it’s very insightful of you to draw that analogy. And you’re perfectly right, those are basic observations, but they are helpful. Just a few more questions, and then we can discuss some options. Have you experienced any feelings of sadness, hopelessness, or loss of interest in things you used to enjoy?
PATIENT: Hopelessness… well, isn't that the natural state of affairs these days? The world is… declining. And sadness? Naturally. My wife… and the state of modern education. A dreadful combination. Loss of interest? Absolutely. Book clubs are… less stimulating than they once were. The choices! Utterly pedestrian. Honestly, Doctor, you’re asking a man who has devoted his life to the preservation of knowledge if he finds enjoyment in contemporary… novels. It's rather… insulting, frankly. I believe that’s enough questioning, don’t you think? I’m a patient, not a… specimen. I'd like to discuss… solutions. Quickly, if you please.
DOCTOR: You're absolutely right to feel that way, Erle. And I apologize if my questions felt intrusive or insensitive. It sounds like you're carrying a great deal of sadness and frustration, and it's completely understandable that you're feeling overwhelmed. Based on what you’ve shared, it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of depression. It’s important to remember that depression isn’t a sign of weakness, and it’s very common, especially after a significant loss like losing your wife. It’s also understandable that the stresses at work are exacerbating how you’re feeling. Before we discuss solutions, I’d like to do a very brief assessment – just a few questions to help me get a clearer picture. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Assessment? More questioning? Doctor, I assure you, I’m perfectly capable of self-diagnosis. A lifetime of reading has equipped me with a far superior understanding of the human condition than… well, than most. Honestly. But… if it will expedite the process… very well. But make it brief. I have a book club meeting, you know. A rather important one. And I do believe I've explained myself quite adequately. Get on with it, then. Quickly.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Erle. I respect your self-awareness and extensive knowledge. This is just a standard tool to help me ensure I'm considering all possibilities and providing you with the best possible care. It should only take a few minutes. The first question is: Over the last two weeks, how often have you been bothered by little interest or pleasure in doing things?
PATIENT: Little interest or pleasure… Doctor, you might as well ask a fish if it enjoys breathing air. Of course, I've experienced little interest or pleasure. The world is a dismal place. The students are… uninspired. The administration… let's not even begin. And the book club… well, the less said about the current selection, the better. It’s… constant. A perpetual state of… disappointment. Almost every day, I would say. Yes. Almost every day. Is that what you wanted to know? A profoundly depressing answer? Because that’s precisely what you’ll get. Now, can we move on? I really must be going. This is… tedious.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Erle. That’s helpful. The next question is: How often have you been bothered by feeling down, depressed, or hopeless?
PATIENT: Hopeless… Doctor, is that even a question? A lifetime of witnessing the decline of civilization, the erosion of knowledge, the… the sheer banality of modern literature… naturally, I feel hopeless. It’s… pervasive. Constant, I would say. Yes. Every single day. Is this what you do, Doctor? Probe the depths of human despair? It's… rather grim, isn’t it? Honestly, I came seeking… relief. Not an inquisition. Can we conclude this… assessment? I have commitments, you know. Important ones. And frankly, I’m beginning to feel… rather unwell. All this negativity… it’s draining.
DOCTOR: Erle, thank you for answering those questions with such honesty. It sounds like you’ve been carrying a very heavy burden for a long time. Based on what you’ve shared, and the responses to the questionnaire, it’s likely you’re experiencing symptoms of major depressive disorder. I want to assure you this isn’t your fault, and it is treatable. There are several options we can explore, including therapy and medication. Before we discuss those options, I want to rule out any underlying physical causes for how you're feeling. Would you be willing to have a brief physical exam and some blood work?
PATIENT: Physical exam? Blood work? Doctor, I assure you, my physical condition is irrelevant. This is a matter of… the soul. A profound sense of… ennui. Not some deficiency in my… iron levels. Honestly. But… if it will expedite the process… very well. But make it quick. And gentle. I'm an elderly man, you know. Easily… frazzled. Though I highly doubt a physical examination will reveal anything of… significance. This is… existential, Doctor. Not physiological. But… proceed, then. Quickly. And gently. I have a book club meeting, you know. And frankly, I'm dreading it. It's… a dreadful selection. Utterly dreadful.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Erle. We'll proceed gently and quickly. I understand your concerns, and I'll focus on a brief exam to rule out any potential physical contributing factors. First, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs. Could you please take a deep breath for me?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor. This is… rather unnecessary. My heart is… weary. A lifetime of disappointment will do that to a person. And my lungs… well, let's just say they've witnessed a great deal of… banality. But… proceed, then. Get it over with. Quickly. And please, be gentle. I'm an elderly man, you know. Easily… agitated. Though I doubt you'll find anything of… significance. It's… existential, Doctor. Not physiological. Honestly, this entire process is… rather tiresome. And I have a book club meeting, you know. Utterly dreadful selection. I'm dreading it.
DOCTOR: Okay. I do hear a little wheezing in your lungs, which could be related to several things, but we’ll investigate further with the blood work. Your heart rate is a bit elevated, but that's not uncommon when you’re feeling stressed or anxious. Now, I'm just going to check your blood pressure. Could you please relax your arm?
PATIENT: Blood pressure… honestly. As if a numerical value can quantify the weight of a lifetime of… ennui. But… proceed, then. Get it over with. Quickly. And please, be gentle. I'm an elderly man, you know. Easily… agitated. This entire process is… rather demeaning. Honestly. And the book club meeting… Utterly dreadful. A complete and utter waste of time. I’m dreading it. I really must be going. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. A reputation for… discerning taste. Though, frankly, my discerning taste is being sorely tested these days. Utterly dreadful selection. Honestly, Doctor… it’s appalling.
DOCTOR: Okay, your blood pressure is a little elevated, which is also common with stress. Now, I’m going to listen to your abdomen. Just relax for me. And finally, I’m just going to check your reflexes. Could you please let your arm fall limp?
PATIENT: Reflexes? Doctor, honestly. As if a simple neurological response can capture the… ennui of a lifetime. But… proceed, then. Get it over with. Quickly. And please, be gentle. I'm an elderly man, you know. Easily… agitated. This entire process is… utterly degrading. Honestly. And the book club meeting… Utterly dreadful selection. I’m dreading it. I really must be going. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. A reputation for… intellectual rigor. Though, frankly, my intellectual rigor is being sorely tested these days. Utterly dreadful selection. Honestly, Doctor… it’s appalling. A complete and utter travesty. I feel… faint. Perhaps it’s the anticipation. Or the appalling book selection. Honestly… it’s just too much.
DOCTOR: Okay, Erle. That’s all for the physical exam. Your reflexes are a little slower than they should be, but that’s not uncommon at your age. Based on the exam, everything seems physically okay, but it’s important to get some blood work to rule out anything else contributing to how you’re feeling. Before we order that, though, I want to talk about how you’re feeling emotionally. You’ve mentioned feeling a great deal of ennui, disappointment, and dread. I also noticed you’re feeling a lot of stress about the book club meeting, and it sounds like that’s exacerbating things. Have you considered talking to someone about these feelings?
PATIENT: Talking to someone? Doctor, honestly. Who would understand? The modern world… it’s… appalling. The book club… a complete and utter travesty. No one appreciates the value of knowledge anymore. They’re all… shallow. Utterly shallow. And talking to someone… about feelings? Preposterous. I'm a Library Science teacher, Doctor. I deal with… the preservation of knowledge, not… emotional venting. Honestly, it's… degrading. And the book club meeting… Utterly dreadful selection. I really must be going. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. A reputation for… intellectual rigor. Though, frankly, my intellectual rigor is being sorely tested these days. Utterly dreadful selection. Honestly, Doctor… it’s appalling. A complete and utter travesty. And I'm beginning to feel… quite ill. Perhaps it’s the stress. Or the appalling book selection. Honestly… it’s just too much. I think I need… a strong cup of tea. And a very, very good book. Preferably one not selected by… them.
DOCTOR: I understand, Erle. And I respect your decision. It sounds like you have a lot of coping mechanisms already – a love of reading and intellectual pursuits – and those are very valuable. Given your reluctance to therapy, let’s focus on other options. I can prescribe an antidepressant medication that might help lift your mood and reduce your anxiety. It's something you could try, and if it doesn’t help, we can always reassess. I also want to make sure you have some resources for support. I can give you some information on local support groups, even if you just want to attend and listen. And I want to remind you that you’re not alone. Many people experience these feelings, especially after a significant loss. Before we proceed with the medication, would you like me to order the blood work to get a baseline assessment?
PATIENT: Medication? Doctor, honestly. I'm not a… invalid. I’m a Library Science teacher. I’ve devoted my life to… the preservation of knowledge. I don’t need… artificial assistance. But… if it will expedite the process… very well. But I want a very low dosage. And I want to be assured of minimal side effects. I'm an elderly man, you know. Easily… frazzled. And blood work… very well. But make it quick. And gentle. I really must be going. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. A reputation for… intellectual rigor. Though, frankly, my intellectual rigor is being sorely tested these days. Utterly dreadful selection. Honestly, Doctor… it’s appalling. A complete and utter travesty. And I'm beginning to feel… quite ill. Perhaps it’s the stress. Or the appalling book selection. Honestly… it’s just too much. And please, do hurry. I have a book club meeting, you know. And I dread it. Utterly dread it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Erle. We'll start with a very low dosage of an antidepressant, and I'll explain all the potential side effects in detail. I’ll also order the blood work – it's just a routine assessment to get a baseline and rule out any other contributing factors. Here’s a lab requisition for the blood work. You can take this to the lab just down the hall. And here’s a prescription for a low dosage of sertraline. I'll schedule a follow-up appointment for you in two weeks to see how you're doing. In the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns. And please, try to be kind to yourself. I wish you all the best with your book club meeting. And hopefully, the next selection will be a bit more… palatable.
