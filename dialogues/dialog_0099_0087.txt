DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Croonquist, is it?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s right. Croonquist. Look, doc, I just need some… some tests done, if we could get right to it? I don’t really… well, I don’t remember what tests, exactly. The lady on the phone said something about lab work. Just whatever I need for Medicare, I guess.
DOCTOR: Right. "Whatever you need for Medicare." That’s… not particularly helpful, Mr. Croonquist. Medicare requires a reason for testing. We can’t just… run random labs. It’s a waste of resources, and frankly, a little irresponsible. Now, can you tell me why you think you need these tests?
PATIENT: Irresponsible? Look, I’m not trying to be difficult. Honestly, I barely remember making the appointment. My… someone told me I should get checked. It was… the hospital, maybe? Or the clinic? I just feel… old, I suppose. Tired. Is that enough? I don’t… I really don’t know why they scheduled it, doc. It was a long time ago. Can’t you just look it up?
DOCTOR: "Feel old and tired." Yes, well, many people do as they get older, Mr. Croonquist. That doesn’t automatically necessitate a battery of tests. Let me see… clicks mouse several times. Ah. Here we are. It appears you were discharged from St. Joseph’s Hospital three months ago following a bout of pneumonia. The discharge summary recommends a follow-up with primary care for… "assessment of persistent fatigue and possible anemia." There. A reason. Still, "persistent fatigue" is vague. What exactly does this fatigue feel like?
PATIENT: Pneumonia… right. That rings a bell, faintly. Terrible cough, I think. Spent a week in there. Anemia… is that… low blood? Look, doc, I just get winded easily. Walking up the stairs, even. And I feel… weak. Like I haven't slept in days, even when I have. It's… just generally feeling rotten, okay? I don’t know medical terms. It's just… ugh. Can we please just get the tests done so I can go home? I’ve got things to do, or… I think I do. My memory's not what it used to be.
DOCTOR: “Generally feeling rotten.” Yes. Very descriptive. Alright, Mr. Croonquist. We will get some tests done. But I need to ask a few more questions, for your own good, and frankly, to satisfy the insurance company. Now, this weakness… is it all over, or more in certain areas?
PATIENT: Everywhere, I think. But mostly in my legs. Makes it hard to get around, like I said. Especially first thing in the morning. It’s… like trying to wade through molasses. And sometimes my hands feel… numb. Not all the time, but… yeah. Look, is this going to be a long process? Because honestly, I'm starting to feel a little… overwhelmed. It's a lot to remember, even just telling you this. And I've got to get back before… before what was I saying? Oh, nevermind. Just… tests, right?
DOCTOR: “Like wading through molasses.” Fascinating. Alright. Numbness in the hands, fatigue, weakness… we’re getting somewhere, slowly. Now, have you noticed any changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: Appetite? Not really. I eat… when I remember to. Which isn't as often as I used to. Food doesn't really… taste like much anymore, either. Everything's kind of bland. But I haven't lost my appetite, if that makes sense. I just don't… crave anything, I guess. Can we just skip the food questions? This is making my head spin. I just want to know when I can get the blood drawn, that’s all. .
DOCTOR: "Skip the food questions?
