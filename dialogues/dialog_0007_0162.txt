DOCTOR: Hi Lawton, good to meet you. I'm Valerie Hernandez, one of the internal medicine doctors here. So, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Look, I don't have a lot of time, okay? It's… my stomach. It feels puffed up. Bloated. Like I swallowed a balloon. Honestly, it’s been happening for a bit now, and it’s just annoying. Is that all you need to know?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you're short on time, and we can definitely focus on getting this sorted out. "Bloated" is a good start. Just to get a clearer picture, how long exactly has this been going on?
PATIENT: Ugh, time… See, that's the problem. It feels like… weeks? Months? Everything’s kinda blurring together since… well, since my wife passed. I really can't pinpoint it, Doc. It just is. It's uncomfortable, alright? And it happens after I eat, usually. Big meals, small meals… doesn’t seem to matter. Is there a quick fix for this, or…?
DOCTOR: I'm very sorry to hear about your wife, Lawton. That must be incredibly difficult, and it absolutely explains why pinpointing timelines might be harder right now. It’s completely understandable. Okay, so it's been happening for weeks to months, consistently after eating. Besides uncomfortable, can you describe the discomfort?
PATIENT: Discomfort? It's… full. Like I ate too much, even when I haven't. And gassy. A lot of gas. Not… pleasant. Sometimes it feels tight, kinda like a band around my stomach. Look, it's just… a nuisance, okay? I work hard, physical job, pile driving. I don’t have time to be waddling around feeling like a beach ball. You know? Is it something serious? Because I really can't afford to be laid up.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, and you're right to want to get this checked out if it's interfering with work. “Fullness,” gas, and a tight sensation… that gives us a little more to work with. Just to be thorough – and again, I appreciate you being patient with me – have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Hmm… Let me think. Not really. Maybe a little tired, but that's just the job, right? Long hours, sun… No pain, no… nothing else I can think of. No changes in my… bathroom habits, if that's what you're asking. I eat pretty normally. Burgers, fries, sometimes Somali food when my sister cooks. Nothing fancy. Look, I’m not one for complaining, Doc. Just want this bloating to stop. Is this something I need tests for? I've got a job to do.
DOCTOR: Okay, no pain, no changes in bowel habits, normal diet… and you're feeling generally tired, but attributing that to work. That's helpful. Let's do a quick physical exam, just to listen to your abdomen and feel around. It won't take long. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. I’ve got a shift starting in a few hours. But don't go poking around too much, alright? I bruise easily. And, honestly, I’m not a fan of doctors, if I’m being frank. Just tell me what’s wrong and what I need to do to fix it. No long explanations, please.
DOCTOR: Absolutely, I understand. No poking around, and I'll keep it quick and focused. Just going to listen with my stethoscope and gently feel your abdomen. Please lie down on the exam table for me. Okay. I'm hearing some normal bowel sounds, though a little bit of gurgling, which isn't necessarily concerning. Your abdomen is a little bit tender to the touch, but no sharp pain with pressure. No masses that I can feel. Your weight is 144 pounds, height 177cm, so your BMI is 24.5, which is in the normal range.
PATIENT: Okay, good. Normal, normal… so what does that mean? Is it something I ate? Am I gonna need pills? Look, Doc, I'm a simple guy. Just give it to me straight. I don't want a lecture about fiber or anything like that. Pile driving doesn't leave a lot of room for fancy eating. Is there a medication for this? Or do I just need to deal with it? I'm really not looking to spend a fortune on a doctor's bill for something minor.
DOCTOR: Okay, I hear you. Straight to the point. Based on what you've told me and the exam, it could be a few things. Given the timing related to eating and the gas, it’s likely some form of indigestion, possibly some trapped gas. It could be related to your diet, but honestly, it's very common, even with a relatively normal diet. Before we jump to medication, I'd like to try a simpler approach. Have you ever tried an over-the-counter simethicone?
PATIENT: Simethicone? Is that one of those gas pills? My sister keeps telling me to take those, but honestly, I don’t like taking anything if I don’t have to. Is that really going to fix this? I mean, it feels… bigger than just gas, you know? It's a constant pressure, not just little bubbles. And I work outside all day, it’s hot, could it be something to do with that? I really don't want to spend my money on something that won't even work. Is there anything else I can try?
DOCTOR: You're right to be cautious about medications, and it's good you're questioning it. Simethicone helps break up gas bubbles, so it can provide some relief, but it won’t address everything if there’s something else going on. And yes, heat can definitely contribute to bloating. Given your concerns and the fact that it’s been going on for weeks to months, and it’s causing you discomfort, I'd recommend a simple blood test to rule out a couple of things. It’s a complete blood count and a basic metabolic panel . It can help rule out any underlying inflammation or electrolyte imbalances. Would you be okay with that?
PATIENT: Ugh, blood tests… fine. Whatever it takes to get this over with. But I'm telling you, Doc, I feel fine. Perfectly healthy, just a bit bloated. And if it comes back normal, I don't want you sending me to a specialist or something. I’ve got a job to do, and I don’t have time for endless tests. Just tell me if it's serious, and if not, give me something to get rid of the gas. Please. And can I get this over with quickly? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We'll get the blood test done, and I promise, if it comes back normal, we won’t jump to specialist referrals. We’ll discuss some over-the-counter options to manage the gas. I will also put in an order for a stool test. I'll write the orders now. The lab is just down the hall, and they're usually pretty quick. Once we have the results – usually within a couple of days – we can discuss next steps. In the meantime, I can suggest avoiding carbonated drinks and potentially trying a smaller, more frequent meals. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Fine. Smaller meals, no fizzy drinks… I can try. But honestly, I don’t drink that much soda anyway. Just get the tests done, and let me know if it's something serious. And please, don't bother me if it's just gas. I can deal with a little gas. I’ve dealt with worse on the job site. Just… let me know when the results are in. And can I go now? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Absolutely. I'll have the lab results sent to me, and I’ll call you as soon as they’re in. And I promise to keep it concise and focus on what's relevant. You go ahead and get back to work, and take it easy. Here's my card with the clinic number, in case you have any questions before then. Take care, Lawton. .
