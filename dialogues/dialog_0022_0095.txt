DOCTOR: Good morning, Stephane. My name is Dr. Tosca. It's nice to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Honestly? I wish I didn’t have to be here. It’s rather inconvenient, you know. But, fine. I woke up yesterday and I just… couldn't hear out of my left ear. And my face feels… droopy on that side. It’s quite alarming, really.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. It is alarming when something like that happens suddenly. Not being able to hear and facial drooping… those are definitely things we need to investigate. To get a better understanding, can you tell me exactly when you first noticed these symptoms yesterday?
PATIENT: Yesterday morning. Before breakfast. I was… well, I was trying to listen to the news, actually. It was just… muffled. And then I realized I couldn’t hear anything at all. I thought the radio was broken, to be honest. Then I went to brush my teeth and that’s when I noticed my face wasn’t quite… right. It's rather distressing.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it started yesterday morning, with muffled hearing that progressed to complete loss in your left ear, and you noticed facial drooping while brushing your teeth. That's helpful. Has anything like this ever happened before?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. I’ve never experienced anything like this in my life. And I assure you, I have a very good memory. I would remember if it had. It's quite unsettling, frankly. I've always been perfectly healthy. Until yesterday, that is.
DOCTOR: Alright, good to know this is a new issue. And I understand your concern – sudden changes like this are unsettling. Now, besides the hearing loss and facial drooping, have you noticed any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. No dizziness, no headache. My vision is fine. Taste… yes, actually. Everything tastes a bit… off. Like metal, perhaps? It’s subtle, but it’s there. And… I’ve been a little more tired than usual, but honestly, who isn’t these days? Is that relevant?
DOCTOR: Okay, so no dizziness or headache, vision is good, altered taste – you describe it as metallic – and a bit more tired than usual. Yes, all of that is relevant. The altered taste is particularly interesting. Now, let's talk about your medical history. Do you have any ongoing medical conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Absolutely not. As I said, I’ve been perfectly healthy. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything. I eat well, I exercise – well, I used to before this… inconvenience. And I certainly don’t have anything like diabetes or high blood pressure. I find that rather insulting you’d even ask. My late husband was a doctor, you know. We took excellent care of ourselves.
DOCTOR: I apologize if my question came across as insulting. It’s standard procedure to ask about medical history to get a complete picture, and I certainly didn’t mean to imply anything about your health or lifestyle. I understand your late husband was a doctor, and I appreciate that you and he prioritized your health. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. I’ve always been incredibly lucky, I suppose. A few minor illnesses, the usual colds and flu, but nothing requiring a hospital stay or… cutting. Honestly, the thought of surgery makes me quite queasy. It’s… barbaric. Is this really necessary? I just want to know what’s wrong and how to fix it. Quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your anxieties about surgery, and I assure you, we’ll explore all options before considering any invasive procedures. We're just gathering information at this point. Now, let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like stroke, heart disease, or neurological problems?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don’t really know. My family is… complicated. We’re Nigerian, you see, and keeping track of family medical history is… difficult. There were illnesses, certainly. Things people died from. But no one ever wrote it down. My mother didn’t believe in doctors, and my father… well, he was rarely around. It’s not something we ever discussed. So, no. I can’t really tell you. Is that satisfactory?
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Stephane. Family history can be difficult to obtain, and it’s not always possible to have that information. Let's move on to medications. Are you currently taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely none. I prefer to keep my body as natural as possible. I find all those pills and potions… unnecessary. My late husband always said prevention is better than cure, and that meant a healthy diet and plenty of exercise, not filling yourself with chemicals. Though, I did take a vitamin D supplement last winter, as the days were so short. But that was just for a few weeks. Does that even matter? It's hardly relevant, is it?
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally you don't take medications, but you did take a vitamin D supplement briefly last winter. That's good to know. Finally, do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: No. None that I’m aware of. I’ve always been very careful about what I consume. I don’t eat anything processed, and I avoid anything with artificial ingredients. I certainly haven’t had any allergic reactions in my life. Honestly, I think people exaggerate allergies these days. It’s… fashionable, isn’t it? Now, can we please get to the matter at hand? What’s wrong with me? I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Alright, Stephane. I understand your frustration, and I'll do my best to get to the bottom of this as quickly as possible. Now, I'd like to do a quick physical exam. I'll check your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs, and do a neurological exam to assess your facial muscles, reflexes, and coordination. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Fine. Just get it over with. But please be gentle. I don’t like being poked and prodded. And try to be quick about it. Honestly, this is a complete waste of my time.
DOCTOR: Okay, Stephane, can you please close your eyes and stick out your tongue?
PATIENT: There. Happy? It's perfectly normal. As I said, I’m perfectly healthy. This is all rather unnecessary, don’t you think?
DOCTOR: Okay, and now can you try to wrinkle your forehead?
PATIENT: There. See? It’s… it’s harder on this side. As I said, my face is drooping. It’s quite obvious, isn’t it? You don’t need to make me do silly exercises to prove it. Honestly, this is degrading.
DOCTOR: Okay, and can you push against my resistance with your arms and legs?
PATIENT: There. See? It’s… weaker. Everything is weaker on this side. Honestly, I’m starting to feel quite anxious. Is it… is it something serious? Please just tell me what’s wrong. I can’t stand this uncertainty.
DOCTOR: Okay, Stephane. Based on the physical exam, I’m concerned about possible facial nerve palsy, affecting the left side of your face, and some weakness in your left arm. The altered taste sensation is also consistent with a nerve issue. The blood pressure reading is a little elevated, but that could be due to anxiety, or a separate issue. To get a clearer picture, I would like to order a few tests. An MRI of your brain will help us rule out any structural issues, and a blood test will check for inflammation and other potential causes. Would you be comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Fine. Whatever it takes. Just get it over with. But I don’t want to be kept waiting for days. And I want a clear explanation of the results, in plain English. No medical jargon. And I expect you to take this seriously. I don’t have time for incompetence. Honestly, this is a complete disruption to my schedule. But fine, MRI and blood tests. Get it done. Quickly.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Stephane, and I assure you I’m taking this very seriously. I'll expedite the orders for the MRI and blood tests. The lab is just down the hall, and we can schedule the MRI for tomorrow morning. In the meantime, I'm going to prescribe a course of antiviral medication. Early treatment with antivirals can improve the chances of recovery in some cases of facial nerve palsy. It's a precaution, of course, until we have the results of the tests. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Antivirals? For… what exactly? I thought you said this was nerve-related. What do viruses have to do with it? Honestly, this is sounding increasingly complicated. And I don’t like taking medication unless it’s absolutely necessary. But… fine. If it might help, I suppose. But I want to know the potential side effects. Everything. I don't want any surprises. And I expect a follow-up appointment to discuss the results of those tests. Tomorrow. Don’t tell me it will take weeks. I have things to do. Now, where do I go for these… tests? And can someone please explain the cost? I am not insured, you know. This is becoming quite expensive.
DOCTOR: The antiviral medication, Acyclovir, is often prescribed as a precaution in cases of suspected Bell's Palsy, which is a common cause of facial nerve paralysis. While the exact cause of Bell's Palsy is unknown, some believe it may be triggered by a viral infection. It’s also known to sometimes work to help with some viral-related nerve issues. The potential side effects are generally mild, including nausea, headache, and fatigue. We’ll monitor you closely for any adverse reactions. The lab is just around the corner, and it should take about 30 minutes for the blood tests. We've scheduled your MRI for tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM. Regarding the cost, I understand your concern about being uninsured. I will have our billing department contact you to discuss the costs of the tests and explore potential financial assistance options. We also have a social worker who can assist you with finding resources. Here are your prescription and referral slips. Please take them to the pharmacy and the lab as soon as possible. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for tomorrow afternoon to discuss the results. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No. I think that's enough for now. Just… get me out of here. I need to go home and lie down. This has been incredibly stressful. And please, make sure someone calls me with the results of those tests. Don't leave me waiting. Honestly, this whole experience has been… deplorable. .
DOCTOR: I understand. I'll make sure you're contacted as soon as the results are available. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any questions or concerns. And please, get some rest. Take care, Stephane. And we'll talk tomorrow. .
