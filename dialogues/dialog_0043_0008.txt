DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolopez. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Kalinski. It's a pleasure to meet you. Now, to begin, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor. Uh… right. Well, my ear feels… blocked. Like something’s stuffed in it, you know? It’s been… a while now. Honestly, I can’t really say how long. Time just… slips away. It's just… full. And a little uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: I understand. A feeling of fullness and discomfort in your ear. And you mentioned it’s been going on for a while, though pinpointing the exact duration is difficult. That's perfectly alright; we can work with that. To get a clearer picture, could you describe the discomfort a little more?
PATIENT: Um… it’s not painful, exactly. More… pressure? Like when you go up too fast in an airplane. Only, it doesn't go away. And sometimes… it feels like I’m hearing muffled sounds. Everything’s a bit… distant. I don't know if that makes sense. It’s probably nothing, really. Just old age, I suppose.
DOCTOR: It makes perfect sense, Mr. Guerrerolopez, and it’s good you’re here to get it checked out, regardless of what you suspect. Pressure, muffled sounds… those are helpful details. And feeling a bit distant is certainly something we should investigate. Now, has this been constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Oh, it comes and goes, I think. Or… maybe it changes. Sometimes it's barely noticeable, just a slight stuffiness. Other times, like today, it’s more… prominent. I can’t really say what makes it worse or better. I haven’t paid that much attention, to be honest. Life just… keeps moving, you know? It’s hard to focus on one thing for too long.
DOCTOR: I appreciate your honesty, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It's quite common for things to get overlooked when life is busy. So, it fluctuates in intensity, and you haven’t noticed any particular triggers or relieving factors. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with this ear fullness?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… hmm. Let me think. No… not really. I haven’t had any dizziness, or pain in my jaw or face. No fever, no… drainage from the ear. Just… the fullness. And maybe a little… ringing sometimes? Very faint, though. I barely notice it unless it’s very quiet. I used to think it was just the house settling. Old houses do that, you know. A lot of creaks and groans.
DOCTOR: Good. No dizziness, jaw pain, fever, or drainage – those are all helpful. And you mentioned some very faint ringing in your ear, which you’ve attributed to the house settling. We’ll keep that in mind. Now, I’d like to ask a few questions about your medical history. Have you ever had any ear infections, or any problems with your hearing before?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s… a difficult question. I had something as a child, I think. Maybe an ear infection? But it was so long ago, I can’t really remember the details. My mother handled all that. And… I used to work with machinery, on a farm. So, there was a lot of noise. But I don't… recall ever having any serious hearing problems. Just… the usual ringing after a long day. Nothing that required a doctor.
DOCTOR: Alright. A possible childhood ear infection, and exposure to noise from farm work. That’s useful information. Have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. No, I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. I broke my arm once, when I was a boy. But that was just a simple fracture. And… my wife, she… she had a lot of medical problems. I spent a lot of time in hospitals with her. But I wasn't the patient, you understand? It’s all a bit… blurry, to be honest. It was a long time ago. And… I don't like to dwell on it.
DOCTOR: I understand completely, Mr. Guerrerolopez. No need to dwell on anything you’re not comfortable with. Just confirming – no surgeries or hospitalizations for you personally. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… no, not that I know of. I’ve never had a bad reaction to anything. I eat pretty much anything, and I've taken all sorts of over-the-counter remedies over the years. Nothing ever bothered me. My wife was the one with the allergies. Pollen, dust… all sorts of things. I always had to be careful with the flowers.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. That’s good. And lastly, are you currently taking any medications, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, not really. Just a little vitamin D in the winter, when it’s cloudy. But that's it. I prefer to eat a good diet, and get my nutrients from food. And… I don't like taking pills, if I can avoid it. Too many bad memories, I suppose.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Guerrerolopez. That gives me a good starting point. Now, I'd like to do a quick examination of your ears, just to get a better look. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. Just… try not to poke around too much, alright? My ears are a bit… sensitive. And please, be quick. I have a few things I need to get done this afternoon. A leaky faucet, and the tomatoes need staking.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Mr. Guerrerolopez. I'll be as gentle as possible. I understand about the tomatoes; a man's got to tend to his garden. Alright. I’m looking… the ear canal appears clear, no signs of infection or fluid. The eardrum itself appears… slightly retracted, and a little dull. And the right ear is similar. A little retraction and dullness to the eardrum. No obvious signs of infection here either. Based on what you’ve told me, and the examination, it sounds like you may have some mild Eustachian tube dysfunction, causing some pressure build-up and fluid in the middle ear. This can happen for a number of reasons, and it's often temporary. Do you feel any discomfort when I gently wiggle your earlobe?
PATIENT: Eustachian… what now? And temporary, you say? That's good. I guess. Wiggle my ear… oh, alright. Yes, that’s… a little uncomfortable. Not painful, exactly, but… noticeable. A sort of… pressure. Like a tiny pinch. Is that normal? And… what does it mean? Is it serious? The tomatoes… they really need staking.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s perfectly normal to feel some discomfort with that maneuver, Mr. Guerrerolopez. It helps me assess the mobility of your eardrum. The slight discomfort you’re experiencing supports the possibility of Eustachian tube dysfunction. To put it simply, the Eustachian tube is a small passage that connects your middle ear to the back of your throat, and it helps to equalize pressure. When it doesn't open and close properly, it can cause fluid to build up, leading to the fullness and muffled sounds you’re experiencing. It’s generally not serious, and often resolves on its own within a few weeks. However, we can try a few things to help it along. We’ll start with some conservative measures. I recommend trying over-the-counter decongestants for a few days, and chewing gum or sucking on hard candies to encourage your Eustachian tubes to open. Do you have any allergies that would prevent you from taking decongestants?
PATIENT: Decongestants… hmm. No, I don’t think so. Like I said, I haven't had any reactions to anything. I usually just ignore it, and it goes away on its own. But… a few weeks, you say? The tomatoes will be overgrown by then! And… chewing gum? Sucking on candies? That seems… a bit silly, doesn't it? But alright. If it helps the tomatoes, I’m willing to try. Is there anything else? Anything… stronger? Something that will fix it right away?
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about the tomatoes, Mr. Guerrerolopez. And yes, it may sound a bit unconventional, but chewing gum and sucking on hard candies can actually be quite effective in stimulating the Eustachian tube to open. For now, let's try the conservative measures for a week or so. We typically don't jump to stronger interventions unless they're not effective. I want to avoid unnecessary medications if possible. However, if your symptoms don’t improve after a week, or if they worsen, we can consider a referral to an Ear, Nose, and Throat specialist for further evaluation. They may recommend a steroid nasal spray or other treatments. Do you have any questions about the decongestants, or how to take them?
PATIENT: An ENT… oh dear. That sounds… serious. And more waiting. I suppose I can try the gum and candies. And the decongestants. But… what kind of decongestants? There are so many. And… do they have side effects? I don’t want to feel drowsy. I have a lot to do. The tomatoes, you know. And the leaky faucet… it’s been dripping for days.
DOCTOR: It’s not necessarily serious, Mr. Guerrerolopez. A referral to an ENT is simply an option if the initial measures aren’t effective. It’s always best to have all the options available. As for the decongestants, I recommend pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine – those are available over-the-counter. Pseudoephedrine is generally more effective, but you may need to ask the pharmacist for it, as it’s kept behind the counter. Both can sometimes cause mild side effects like increased blood pressure or restlessness, but drowsiness is not typically one of them. I would advise you to read the package label carefully and follow the instructions. If you have any underlying health conditions, such as high blood pressure, it's best to check with your pharmacist before taking them. Here are the names. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… thank you. Pseudo… phenyle… I’ll have to ask my neighbor to read the label. He’s good with things like that. I’m not very good with small print anymore. I think… no. That’s all for now. Unless… will this affect my gardening? Or… my ability to fix the faucet? I really need to get those tomatoes staked. They’re starting to bend over.
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Guerrerolopez, these measures shouldn’t affect your gardening or your ability to fix the faucet. As long as you’re feeling well, you should be able to continue with your normal activities. Please don't hesitate to call the office if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen. And I hope you have success with the tomatoes! Have a good day, and please let us know how things are progressing.
