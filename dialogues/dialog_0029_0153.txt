DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Krahn. I’m Dr. Chora. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning, Doctor. Uh... right. They said something about a check-up? For… work. A performance thing. Honestly, it’s all a bit foggy. I mostly just show tickets and help people find their seats these days. Been doing that a long time. Is that what this is about?
DOCTOR: A work-related check-up, yes. And to clarify, this is for continued employment at the theater?
PATIENT: Yes, the theater. That’s it. The Grand Majestic. Though… I don't really perform, if that makes sense. I’m… front of house, you know? Ushers and such. Lobby stuff. It’s been a while since I actually did anything on stage. A very long while. Hopefully, this won’t take too long? I have a shift later.
DOCTOR: Right, front of house. No problem, Mr. Krahn, we’ll try to be quick. Just need to get a baseline assessment for your employer. Let's start with a little bit of your medical history. Have you been seeing a doctor regularly, and if so, when was your last check-up?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Regularly? No, not really. It’s been… years. Probably before the divorce, honestly. That was… a long time ago. I mostly just try to avoid getting sick. A little cold now and then, but nothing serious. I can’t quite recall the last actual check-up… maybe ten years ago? Or more? I really don't keep track of those things. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It's not ideal, Mr. Krahn, but not uncommon. We'll just gather what we can today. Okay. Do you have any major medical problems that you're aware of – things like diabetes, heart trouble, high blood pressure, things along those lines?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. My back sometimes aches, from standing all day. But I think that’s just old age. And… I get a little winded climbing the stairs at the theater, but those stairs are steep. My ex-wife always said my blood pressure was a bit high, but she said a lot of things. Honestly, I don't think I've ever been officially diagnosed with anything. Nothing that required regular visits, at least. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Okay, back pain and some shortness of breath with exertion. We can certainly look into both of those. Have you ever had any surgeries, or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: Surgeries… no, I don’t think so. Nothing major, anyway. I think I had my tonsils out when I was a little boy, but that was ages and ages ago. Hospitalized… maybe for the flu once, a long time ago? It’s all very hazy. I mostly just try to tough things out. Honestly, Doctor, I'm not very good at remembering these sorts of things. I apologize. Is it alright if we just… get through this quickly? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: We'll try to be as efficient as possible, Mr. Krahn. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, or supplements?
PATIENT: No, no medications. Not regularly, at least. Sometimes I take an aspirin for a headache, but that’s it. And… maybe some vitamin C when I feel a cold coming on. But nothing prescribed, nothing consistent. I prefer to just… drink a lot of tea. Helps with everything, or so I’ve always believed.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Now, do you have any allergies to anything – medications, foods, insects, anything like that?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. I eat pretty much anything. I used to love shellfish, but my ex-wife said I was getting too much cholesterol, so I stopped. But that wasn’t an allergy, just… her nagging. I don’t recall ever having a bad reaction to anything. Bees bother me, like they bother everyone, but I haven’t been stung in years. Does that count? Honestly, I'm drawing a blank.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Now, can you tell me a little bit about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Family history… that's a tough one. My parents… they passed away a long time ago. Both of them. Heart trouble, I think. My father, definitely. My mother, maybe? It was a long time ago, I wasn't very close to either of them. I don’t really know much about what they had, to be honest. They weren’t the… talking type. And I don't have any siblings. It’s just me, really. I apologize for being so unhelpful. I really don’t have a good memory for these things.
DOCTOR: That’s alright, Mr. Krahn. We’ll make do with what we have. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, or have you ever smoked?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. My ex-wife hated it, and she was very… persuasive. I did try it once, when I was young and foolish, but it made me cough so much I decided it wasn't for me. And I’ve always been a bit wary of anything that’s bad for my lungs. With all the standing at the theater, I need to keep those working properly. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: Just a little bit, sometimes. A glass of wine with dinner, maybe? Or a beer on a hot day. Nothing excessive, I assure you. I'm not a… drinker. Never have been. Mostly just to relax, after a long shift. It helps with the aches and pains, a little bit. Nothing more. Is that okay?
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, let's move on to a quick physical exam, if that’s alright with you. I'd like to check your blood pressure, pulse, and listen to your heart and lungs. It won’t take long. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: Yes, yes, that’s fine. Get it over with quickly, if you could? I really do need to get back to work. Hopefully, everything is alright. I mostly just want to make sure I can still stand for eight hours without collapsing. Alright, let's do it.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. If you could just sit here and relax. I'm going to take your blood pressure first. Blood pressure is a bit elevated, 150/90. Pulse is 78 and regular. Now, let’s listen to your heart and lungs. I hear some mild crackling in your lungs, and your heart sounds a bit… distant. It could be nothing, but we should investigate further.
PATIENT: Oh. Elevated? Distant? That doesn’t sound good, does it? Crackling… is that serious? Honestly, Doctor, I haven’t felt particularly unwell. A little tired, maybe, after a long shift, but that’s just part of the job. Is this going to require… tests? Because I really don't have time for tests. I have a performance review next month, and I need to be on top of things. What does this mean?
DOCTOR: Mr. Krahn, let’s not jump to conclusions. Elevated blood pressure and mild crackling in the lungs could indicate a few things. It doesn’t necessarily mean anything serious, but it does warrant further investigation. We need to rule out things like early signs of heart failure or lung congestion. I'd like to order a chest X-ray and an EKG – that’s a simple test that checks your heart's electrical activity. We’ll also do some blood work to check your cholesterol and kidney function. It will take about an hour, and the results should be back tomorrow. Are you able to stay and get those tests done now?
PATIENT: An hour? Tomorrow? Oh, goodness. A performance review… and tests… This is terrible timing. My shift starts in… well, nevermind. I suppose I have no choice, do I? But what if something is wrong? What if I can’t work anymore? I’ve been at the Grand Majestic for twenty years! I… I don't know. Fine. Do the tests. But please, hurry. And try not to tell me anything too… alarming. I don’t think my heart can take it. Is there a waiting room?
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Krahn. We'll get everything done as quickly as possible. I’ll have the nurse take you to the lab for the blood work and the radiology department for the X-ray and EKG. There is a waiting room just down the hall. I will review the results as soon as they come in and let you know what we find. And, to be clear, we are just gathering information at this point. It doesn't mean anything is definitely wrong. I'll have the nurse come in with the paperwork for the lab. Do you have any questions for me before she arrives?
PATIENT: No… no questions. Just… please hurry. And try to be optimistic, if you can. I need to get back to work. My life is at the Grand Majestic, and I can’t afford to lose it. Is there… is there any chance this is just… stress? Twenty years of showing tickets, you know? It takes a toll on a person. Just please tell me it’s not too serious.
DOCTOR: It's possible it could be stress, Mr. Krahn, absolutely. We’ll explore all the possibilities. Let’s just get these tests done and see what they tell us. I'll explain everything clearly once we have the results. Nurse, could you please come in here and assist Mr. Krahn with the lab paperwork and guide him to radiology?
