DOCTOR: Hi, Mr. Drahota, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Hernandez. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmm. Yes, well. It’s… it’s my skin. It’s been… darkening. And I feel quite tired, you see. Though, truthfully, I don’t recall exactly when it started. A long while, I suspect. Honestly, I haven't much time for these things. Is this going to be a lengthy examination?
DOCTOR: Okay, darkening skin and fatigue. We’ll try to be as efficient as possible. “A long while” is a bit vague, but we can work with that. Just to clarify, is the darkening all over, or in specific areas?
PATIENT: Specific areas, I believe. Though, I must confess, I don’t spend a great deal of time examining myself. It’s… on my hands, mostly. And perhaps my face? It’s difficult to say. Really, it's not something I've bothered with until now. My wife pointed it out, naturally. She has a keen eye for these… imperfections.
DOCTOR: Okay, hands and possibly face. And has this darkening been getting worse gradually, or did it seem to appear suddenly?
PATIENT: Gradually, I suppose. Though, everything seems to happen more quickly as one gets older, wouldn’t you agree? I’ve been a reinforcing iron and rebar worker for… well, a very long time. Perhaps it’s something to do with that? The sun, the elements… I don’t know. I simply want to know if it’s something serious. And quickly, if you please.
DOCTOR: That's a very reasonable question, and a good thought about your work – sun exposure can definitely cause skin changes. We’ll need to take a closer look, and I’ll ask a few more questions to get a better picture. Have you noticed any itching, pain, or blistering on these areas?
PATIENT: Itching? No, not particularly. Pain, certainly not. I’ve had far worse injuries on the job, I assure you. Blistering… no, I don't recall any blisters. Honestly, I’ve a better memory for steel grades than skin ailments. Are we nearly finished? I have a rather important appointment this afternoon.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. Just a quick look at your hands and face then. It shouldn’t take long. If you could just extend your hands, palms up. Okay… I’m seeing some hyperpigmentation on the backs of your hands and a bit on your cheeks. The skin texture seems normal, no obvious lesions or thickening. Do you use any creams or lotions on your hands regularly?
PATIENT: Creams? No. A worker doesn't have time for such things. Perhaps a bit of oil now and then to keep the skin from cracking in the winter, but nothing more. My hands are tools, you see. One doesn't coddle tools. It sounds as if you’re making a great deal of fuss over nothing. Is this a sign of a serious condition? Please, just tell me straight. I haven't got all day.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota. Given your occupation and the gradual onset, the discoloration is likely a form of hyperpigmentation due to sun exposure and chronic irritation. It's not necessarily serious in the sense of being immediately life-threatening, but it's worth investigating a bit further to rule out other possibilities. To be on the safe side, I’d like to do a quick check of your lymph nodes to see if there’s any swelling. It's a very simple procedure. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Lymph nodes? Honestly. Is this truly necessary? I've been working with iron and rebar for sixty years! If anything was amiss, wouldn't it have shown itself by now? Look, I appreciate your diligence, Doctor, but I strongly suspect this is a waste of both our time. I'm a practical man. If it doesn't affect my work, I don't concern myself with it. Is there anything you can prescribe to… lighten the discoloration, if that's even possible? Otherwise, I believe I’ll be on my way. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Drahota, I understand your concerns. Given your history and preference, we can skip the lymph node exam. There are some topical creams that can help lighten hyperpigmentation, though results are often slow and may not be dramatic. They usually contain ingredients like hydroquinone or retinoids. However, given your years of sun exposure, they may have limited effect. I can write you a prescription for a mild hydroquinone cream if you'd like. It’s important to use sunscreen diligently, even on cloudy days, to prevent further darkening. And if you do notice any changes - any new lumps, itching, pain, or rapidly growing areas - please come back immediately. Does that sound acceptable?
