DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kochubey. I'm Dr. Sieh. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It's nice to meet you too. Um... well, I'm here about getting surgery. For my weight, I mean. It's...bariatric surgery, right? That's what they told me at the other clinic. I don't really remember all the details, though. It was a while ago.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You’re interested in discussing bariatric surgery as an option for weight management. It’s perfectly alright if you don’t remember all the details from the other clinic – that's what I’m here for. Before we get into specifics, let's just go over some things to get a better understanding of your overall health. I see here you're 38 years old. And your height is listed as 5’1”, and your weight is 139 pounds. Is that all correct?
PATIENT: Um... 5’1”... yeah, I think so. And 139... that sounds about right, give or take a few pounds. I haven't weighed myself exactly recently, but yeah, that seems accurate. It fluctuates, you know?
DOCTOR: I understand. Weight can definitely fluctuate. Okay, good. So, to clarify, you're considering bariatric surgery. Can you tell me a little bit about why you're interested in pursuing this option at this time?
PATIENT: Well... it's just... things have been hard. It's not easy to talk about. I feel tired a lot, even when I sleep. And... I want to be able to do more with my kids, you know? Play with them without getting so winded. It’s been tough keeping up. And honestly, I worry about my health. I just... I want to feel better. I want to be better. I don't really know what else to say. It's just... a lot.
DOCTOR: I understand, Mr. Kochubey. It sounds like this is something you've been thinking about for a while, and it’s impacting your quality of life. It takes courage to come in and talk about these things, and I appreciate you sharing that with me. Let's talk about your medical history a bit. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions – things like diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or sleep apnea?
PATIENT: Hmm... let me think. I don't think so... not that I know of, anyway. I haven't really been to the doctor much in the last few years. I had some problems with my stomach a long time ago, but it wasn’t anything serious, I don't think. Just... indigestion, mostly. Nothing they ever really wrote down. Does that count? I really don't remember the details. My wife usually handles all that stuff.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s alright. It sounds like you haven't had a lot of regular medical care recently. No worries about not remembering details – we’ll work through it. And what about any surgeries you’ve had in the past?
PATIENT: No, I haven't had any surgeries. Not ever. I’ve broken a bone or two when I was a kid, but that’s it. Nothing major. Just… a cast for a little while. My wife would know for sure, but she isn’t here. She usually remembers these things better than me.
DOCTOR: Okay, no surgeries. That's good to know. Let’s talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family – things like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, or obesity?
PATIENT: Um... that's a tough one. My mom... she had some heart trouble, I think. And my dad... he was always a bit bigger, you know? He had problems with his weight, but I don’t really know what kind. Just… overweight. And I think my grandmother had something with sugar… maybe diabetes? It was a long time ago, and we didn’t talk about it much. I'm not really sure. It's hard to remember all that stuff. I didn’t really pay attention when I was younger. Sorry.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly alright, Mr. Kochubey. Family history can be difficult to track down. It’s helpful to know that there’s a history of heart trouble and weight issues, and potentially diabetes, on your mother's side. Now, let's talk a little about your lifestyle. Do you smoke or use tobacco products?
PATIENT: No, never. I don’t smoke. And I don't use any other tobacco products either. My wife doesn't smoke either. We both try to stay healthy, when we can. It’s just… hard, you know? With work and the kids… things get busy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good. And how about alcohol?
PATIENT: I have a beer sometimes, maybe on the weekend. Nothing regular, though. Not every week, definitely not every day. Just… a beer with dinner sometimes. My wife might have a glass of wine. But we don't drink much. It’s not a big part of our life. I don't really like it that much, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Okay, occasional alcohol use. Now, finally, are you currently taking any medications – prescription or over-the-counter?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. I take a multivitamin sometimes. That’s it. Nothing else. I used to take something for heartburn, but it didn’t really help, so I stopped. I just try to avoid spicy food now. I don’t think I’m on anything else. I really don’t. My wife usually handles the medicine stuff too. I think that’s it. I’m pretty sure.
DOCTOR: Okay, just a multivitamin occasionally. Thank you for sharing that information with me. So, to summarize, you’re considering bariatric surgery for weight management, experiencing fatigue, and want to improve your ability to play with your kids. You have a family history of heart trouble and weight issues, potentially diabetes, and you occasionally have a beer. You’re not currently taking any regular medications. Now, I’d like to ask a few more questions about your current symptoms and then perform a physical exam, if that’s alright with you. Are you experiencing any other symptoms besides fatigue – things like shortness of breath, joint pain, or sleep problems?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds right. Um… shortness of breath, sometimes. Especially when I try to do something active. And my knees… they bother me a lot. They ache, especially after I’ve been on my feet all day. And sleep… yeah, I don’t sleep very well. I wake up a lot during the night. It’s hard to get comfortable. But I think that’s just… getting older, you know? I don’t know. It's hard to say what's normal anymore. A physical exam sounds fine, yeah. Whatever you think is best.
DOCTOR: Okay, shortness of breath, knee pain, and sleep disturbances. Those are all things we need to consider. And you’re right, it can be hard to know what’s normal. Alright, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure and pulse, and take a look at your knees. I'll also do a basic abdominal exam. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Yeah, that’s fine. Sounds good. Just… don't mind if I fidget a little. I don’t really like being poked and prodded, but I know it’s important. Just… let me know if you need me to do anything.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll let you know what I’m doing every step of the way. No need to worry. Okay, breathing sounds are a little diminished on both sides, but no wheezing or crackles that I can hear right now. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs. Blood pressure is 140/90. Pulse is 88. Your knees have some tenderness on the inner side of both joints, and a slight range of motion restriction. There’s no significant swelling or redness. Your abdomen is soft, with no tenderness or masses. Okay, that’s all for the physical exam. Your blood pressure is a little elevated, and your knees show some tenderness and restriction of motion. Your lungs sound clear, and your abdomen is normal. Given your weight, fatigue, shortness of breath, and elevated blood pressure, we need to run some tests to get a better understanding of what's going on. I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, a lipid panel, and an EKG to check your heart function. Would you be able to get these done at the lab down the street?
PATIENT: Yeah, I think so. I’ve been there before with my wife. She takes me sometimes when I’m not feeling well. A complete blood count… a comprehensive what-now? And a lipid… panel? Okay. It sounds like a lot. But yeah, I can get those done. Is there a form I need or anything? And when do you want me to do them? I work tomorrow, but I could probably go after work.
DOCTOR: Okay, good. It does sound like a lot, but these tests will give us important information. A comprehensive metabolic panel checks your kidney and liver function, electrolytes, and blood sugar levels. A lipid panel checks your cholesterol levels. Here’s the form. You'll need to take this to the lab. They'll draw some blood. You can go anytime tomorrow after work. Fasting is required for the comprehensive metabolic panel and lipid panel, which means you shouldn't eat or drink anything except water for 8-12 hours before the test. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: 8-12 hours… no food? That's a long time. I usually eat breakfast pretty early. Okay, I can skip breakfast, I guess. Water is okay, right? Just water? That's... manageable. I think. Is there anything else I need to know about the tests? Will they be expensive? I don’t have insurance, so… I worry about the cost.
DOCTOR: Yes, just water. And you’re right to ask about the cost. I understand not having insurance is a concern. The lab does offer a self-pay discount. The estimated cost for these tests without insurance is around $250 - $300. I’ll also see if we can connect you with any local resources that may offer financial assistance for lab work. In the meantime, let's discuss your interest in bariatric surgery. It's a significant decision, and requires a thorough evaluation. These tests are the first step in determining if you're a good candidate. Once we have the results, we can talk about the risks and benefits, and if it’s the right option for you. Do you have any questions about the surgery itself at this point?
PATIENT: $300… okay. That's… a lot. But I guess I can manage it if I have to. I really want to see if this surgery could help. I just… I don't know much about it. I know it involves cutting into my stomach, but I don’t know why they cut it. And I worry about complications. And will I be able to eat anything afterwards? That’s a big concern. I like food, you know? I don’t want to be stuck on a liquid diet forever. Are there different kinds of surgery? Is one better than the other? I guess I just… have a lot of questions. It's scary, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Those are all excellent and very important questions, Mr. Kochubey. It's perfectly normal to be scared, and it’s good that you're asking these things. Let's start with why we cut the stomach. There are different types of bariatric surgery, but the most common is Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. Gastric bypass involves creating a small pouch from the upper part of your stomach and connecting it directly to the small intestine, bypassing a significant portion of your stomach. Sleeve gastrectomy involves removing a large portion of your stomach, leaving a smaller, tube-shaped stomach. Both procedures reduce the amount of food you can eat and can affect your hormones to help you feel fuller faster. As for complications, like any surgery, there are risks involved. These include infection, bleeding, and blood clots. There’s also the possibility of nutritional deficiencies and dumping syndrome, which causes nausea and diarrhea. We take precautions to minimize these risks, and we provide ongoing support after surgery to help you manage any potential complications. And you’re right to ask about eating after surgery. You will be able to eat solid food eventually, but your diet will need to be modified. You'll start with liquids, then progress to pureed foods, and eventually to solid foods. You'll need to eat smaller portions and make healthy choices to maintain your weight loss. There are different types of surgery, as I mentioned. Gastric bypass is more effective for weight loss but has a higher risk of complications. Sleeve gastrectomy is less invasive but may not be as effective for long-term weight loss. The best option for you depends on your individual health and goals. Once we have your test results, we can discuss these options in more detail and determine which one is right for you. Does that help clarify things a little?
PATIENT: Yeah, that… that actually helps a lot. Cutting the stomach… it makes more sense now, why they do it. And the different kinds… sleeve gastrectomy sounds… less scary, maybe. But if gastric bypass is more effective… I don’t know. I guess I need to wait for the test results. And the diet… smaller portions, I can do that. I just… I don’t want to feel like I’m starving all the time. So, I get the tests done tomorrow, then I come back… and we talk more? What if I decide it’s not for me? Is that okay? I don’t want to feel pressured into anything. This is a big decision, and I want to make sure I’m comfortable with it.
DOCTOR: Exactly. You get the tests done tomorrow, then you come back, and we discuss the results and your options in more detail. And absolutely, it is perfectly okay if you decide it’s not for you. This is your health, and you make the decisions. There’s no pressure whatsoever. I’m here to provide you with information and support, and to help you make the best choice for your individual needs. If you decide it’s not the right time or not the right option, that is completely fine. We can explore other weight management strategies if you’re interested. I’ll also give you some information on weight loss resources and support groups that you can explore while you wait for your test results. Here's some information on local support groups and healthy eating guidelines. Do you have any other questions for me today, Mr. Kochubey?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s all for now. You’ve answered all my questions, and you’ve made me feel a lot better about everything. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I’ll go get the tests done tomorrow and call to schedule a follow-up.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Kochubey. I’m glad I could help. Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. I look forward to seeing you then. Have a good day, and try not to worry too much.
