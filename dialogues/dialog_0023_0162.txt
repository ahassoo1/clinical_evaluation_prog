DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Kristofik. I’m Dr. Versace. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Look, Doc, I don’t really have time for this. Just…bloating, alright? My stomach’s puffed up. It’s been happening for a bit now. Honestly, I don’t know why I’m even here. The insurance lady insisted.
DOCTOR: Insurance often has… requirements. Bloating, you say. And how long has this “bit now” been, exactly?
PATIENT: Ugh, weeks, I guess? Maybe a month? It all kinda blends together, you know? Look, I work long hours. Pile driving isn’t exactly a job where you sit around making notes about your digestive system. It just…started. And it hasn't gone away. Is that good enough? Honestly, I'm not sure. It's uncomfortable, but I’ve had worse.
DOCTOR: A month of bloating. Alright. And is it constant, or does it come and go?
PATIENT: Comes and goes. Mostly after I eat, I think. Big meals, definitely worse. But sometimes it's just…there, even if I haven't eaten much. It’s hard to say. I eat when I can, Doc. Not a lot of time for fancy meal schedules when you're swinging a hammer all day. What is this about anyway? Is this going to take long? I got a job to get back to.
DOCTOR: Right. So, bloating, primarily after meals, sometimes present even with limited intake. Any particular foods seem to trigger it more than others?
PATIENT: Look, I eat what's available, alright? Fast food, leftovers… whatever keeps me going. I don't sit around analyzing my lunch. Honestly, Doc, I don't think it's food. Maybe it's the stress? This job...it's not easy. And, well, things haven’t been the same since… my wife. But I don’t see how that affects my stomach. So, no, no particular foods. Just…bloating. Can we just get this sorted? I really don't have time for this.
DOCTOR: Stress can certainly manifest physically, Mr. Kristofik, but we need to rule out other possibilities. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel… habits? Seriously? Look, I go when I go, alright? Is that what you want to know? I haven't been keeping a log! I’m a pile driver operator, not a gastroenterologist! I don't know. Normal-ish, I guess? Sometimes a little… loose, sometimes a little… not. Happy now? Is this going somewhere or am I wasting my time? It's just bloating, Doc! Can’t you just give me something for it?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration, but dismissing symptoms without investigation is… unwise. Changes in bowel habits, even perceived ones, are relevant. Any nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Blood? No! Absolutely not! Look, I’m telling you, it’s just bloating. I feel uncomfortable, alright? I get full faster. Sometimes it hurts a little, but it's nothing I can't push through. I don’t know what you want me to say! I'm not throwing up, I'm not bleeding, I just look like I swallowed a beach ball sometimes. And frankly, Doc, I'm starting to feel like you're not listening to me. This is a waste of time. I need to get back to work. Are you going to help me or not?
DOCTOR: Alright. Let's do a quick physical exam, then. I need to listen to your abdomen and palpate it. It will help me get a better idea of what's going on, and then we can discuss possible causes and a plan. If you’ll just lie back on the exam table. I’ll need you to point to any areas of specific discomfort.
PATIENT: Seriously? You want me to lie down? I'm a grown man. Look, I’m not thrilled about this, but fine. Get it over with. Just…try to be quick, alright? I have things to do. And don't expect me to be able to pinpoint anything specific. It's just…generally uncomfortable. Gestures vaguely at his stomach There. The whole thing.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Kristofik. I’m going to listen to your abdomen with the stethoscope, then I’ll gently press on different areas to check for tenderness. Please let me know if anything feels particularly painful. Bowel sounds are present, though somewhat…hypoactive. Any discomfort here?
PATIENT: Yeah, a little. It’s not…sharp, just…full. Like something’s…stuffed in there. Not that bad, honestly, but yeah, that’s a bit uncomfortable. Hurry it up, Doc. This is weird. Honestly, I don’t like being poked and prodded. I’m used to swinging a hammer, not lying here like a…like a sick person.
DOCTOR: Some mild resistance in the lower abdomen, particularly in the left lower quadrant as well. No rebound tenderness, no guarding. No acute signs of peritonitis. Your abdomen is distended, as you mentioned. Given your symptoms and the physical exam, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific cause without further investigation. It could be related to diet, stress, or something else entirely. We need to rule out some possibilities. I'd like to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool sample analysis. These tests will help us assess your overall health and look for any signs of infection or inflammation. Does that sound acceptable?
PATIENT: More tests? Seriously? Look, I don't have time for a whole battery of tests, Doc. I got a job, alright? Can’t you just give me something for the bloating and be done with it? Something to… calm things down? I’m not trying to be difficult, but this is ridiculous. I’m a working man, I don't have time for all this. Honestly, what's the point of all this if you're just going to run a bunch of tests anyway?
DOCTOR: Mr. Kristofik, I understand your frustration, but prescribing medication without a proper diagnosis is… irresponsible. It could mask a more serious underlying condition, and potentially delay appropriate treatment. I can offer you some temporary relief with an antispasmodic medication to help with the bloating, but it is essential that we proceed with the blood work and stool sample analysis to rule out anything serious. Consider it a precaution. It’s a relatively simple procedure. I'll also give you a list of dietary changes that may help alleviate your symptoms in the meantime. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: Fine. Fine. But if it means I have to take time off work, I’m sending you the bill. Antispasmodic, alright. And a list… great. Just… get it over with. Where do I go for these tests? And how long is this going to take? I swear, if this screws up my schedule… Let’s just get this done. I got a job to get back to. .
DOCTOR: Here you are. The requisition is for the lab down the street – 123 Main Street. They're open until 5 PM today. The dietary sheet outlines some foods to avoid and others to incorporate. It should take about 15-20 minutes at the lab. The results will take 2-3 business days to come back. Once we have those, we can schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and determine the next steps. I'll also write you a prescription for dicyclomine for symptomatic relief of the bloating. Do you have any questions before you go?
