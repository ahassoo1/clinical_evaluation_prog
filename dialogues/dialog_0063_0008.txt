DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. I am Dr. Jules. Now, please, tell me, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, good morning to you too, Doctor. It's… my ear. Feels blocked, you know? Full. It’s been… a while now, I think. Honestly, the days sort of blend together. It’s just… annoying, more than anything.
DOCTOR: “A while now.” Yes, well, that’s not terribly helpful, is it?
PATIENT: Right, sorry. Not my best trait, remembering things. Maybe… a couple of months? Three, perhaps? It’s hard to say exactly. It just… gradually got worse. Not sudden, thankfully. Just… there. Is that… helpful?
DOCTOR: Slightly. And is it one ear, or both?
PATIENT: Oh, just the left one. The right one’s fine, as far as I can tell. It’s… mostly just a feeling of pressure, like when you’re flying, but it doesn’t go away. And sometimes, it feels… muffled. Like someone turned the volume down. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Muffled. Yes, I understand. And have you experienced any pain with this blockage?
PATIENT: No, thankfully not pain. Just… the fullness. And a bit of… well, it’s hard to describe. Like a faint ringing, sometimes. Not constant, though. It comes and goes. Mostly when it’s quiet, I think. Honestly, I mostly just try to ignore it. It’s… bothersome, but not debilitating.
DOCTOR: Ringing, you say?
PATIENT: Uh, yes. A faint ringing. It’s not… loud, or anything. More like… a high-pitched hum, maybe? Very quiet. I wouldn’t even mention it, but you asked. It’s probably nothing, really. It just… adds to the general unpleasantness. Look, is there anything… serious it could be? I’m not a fan of worrying, you see.
DOCTOR: Well, “nothing” is rarely the case, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. It could be a simple blockage due to wax, but the ringing… that warrants investigation. Have you noticed any dizziness, or hearing loss?
PATIENT: Dizziness… no, not really. I’m a bit clumsy, always have been, but that's just me. Hearing loss… I haven’t noticed anything significant. Things sound a bit quieter in that ear, maybe? But I put that down to the fullness. I’m not exactly known for my sharp ears, if you know what I mean. I tend to miss things anyway. It's… probably just getting old, truthfully. But I suppose it's good to check, if you think so. Do you need to… look in my ear? Is that what’s next?
DOCTOR: Yes, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez, that is what is next. Please recline. It’s a simple otoscopic examination. And try to remain still; I haven’t the patience for a struggle.
PATIENT: Right. Recline. Yes, okay. Just… let me know if it’s going to be unpleasant. I don’t handle poking and prodding particularly well. And… is there anything I need to do? Like, hold still, or…?
DOCTOR: Simply remain still, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. And try not to breathe so heavily. It interferes with the examination. Hmm. Yes. I see… cerumen impaction, naturally. But also… some mild erythema of the tympanic membrane.
PATIENT: Erythema? Is that… bad? Look, I'm not a doctor, you see. If you could… translate, that would be appreciated. Is it something serious? And what about the… cerumen? Is that just wax? I do use cotton swabs, I admit. My wife… well, she used to tell me not to, but… old habits, you know? Is it causing the problem? I really just want it fixed, if possible. This is… unsettling.
DOCTOR: “Unsettling?
PATIENT: Well, yes. A doctor poking around in my ear, telling me words I don’t understand… it’s a bit unnerving, to be honest. And the thought of something being wrong… I just want to get back to normal, you see? I don’t… dwell on these things. But… yes. Unsettling. Look, is it treatable? Will I need… medicine? Surgery? Please just tell me what’s going to happen, in plain English. I'm not good with medical jargon, if you haven't noticed.
DOCTOR: The cerumen is, as you correctly surmised, earwax. And yes, using cotton swabs pushes it further in, exacerbating the problem. The erythema indicates some inflammation of the eardrum. It's not… life-threatening, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. But it requires attention. We’ll start with cerumen removal—simple irrigation, nothing drastic. We’ll assess after that. If the inflammation persists, then we discuss further options. I’ll write you a prescription for a ceruminolytic. Use as directed, and schedule a follow-up appointment in one week. If your symptoms worsen before then, come immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Ceruminolytic… yes. That’s… a mouthful. And a follow-up… one week. Right. Use as directed. So… no surgery? Not immediately, anyway? That's… good. And… what does "use as directed" mean, exactly? Is it drops? Pills? Do I need to… tilt my head? Honestly, I get confused easily. And what if it doesn’t work? Will I need… a specialist? This is… a lot to take in. Look, is there anything I should avoid doing? Like, loud noises, or…?
DOCTOR: It's ear drops, Mr. Guerrerolo Lopez. Tilt your head to the side, as instructed on the packaging. And avoid getting water in your ear. As for a specialist… let’s see how the irrigation goes first. Worrying about specialists now is… premature. Do you have any further questions, or shall we consider this concluded?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all. Ear drops, no water… and try not to worry. Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your… patience. I know I’m not the easiest patient. I’ll… schedule the follow-up. .
