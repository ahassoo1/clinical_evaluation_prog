DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Durig. I'm Dr. Pitmon. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. It’s… well, it’s my skin, you see. It’s gotten awfully yellow. My niece, she’s the one who insisted I come. Something about my… liver, I believe? I don’t quite recall all the details, truthfully. It’s been a bit of a blur lately.
DOCTOR: Yellow skin, alright. Jaundice, potentially. And your niece mentioned concern about your liver. Hmm. It is good she encouraged you to come in. “A bit of a blur lately” – can you elaborate on that?
PATIENT: Oh, dear. Jaundice… yes, that sounds right. It’s just… everything feels a bit distant. I get tired very easily, and I haven’t been eating much. Not like I used to, certainly. It’s hard to explain. My memory… it comes and goes. I used to be so sharp with numbers, you see. I worked with… well, never mind. It's difficult to remember precisely what I did work with. It's just… foggy.
DOCTOR: Right. Fatigue, decreased appetite, and some memory issues. Foggy, you say. Has this been a sudden change, or has it been building up over time?
PATIENT: Oh, building up, definitely building up. It wasn’t sudden, no. Perhaps… six months, maybe? It’s hard to pinpoint exactly. It started slowly, just feeling a little more tired than usual. Then the appetite went. And… well, the memory has been going for longer, I suppose. It’s… unsettling. I mostly just try not to think about it. But my niece, she worries.
DOCTOR: Six months of progressive symptoms. Alright. And has anyone else in your family had similar issues?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a good question. Family… let me see. My mother, she was… very strong. Never sick a day in her life, as far as I recall. My brother… he lived in the city, quite a bit of a drinker, I believe, but I haven’t seen him in years. I truly couldn't say if he had anything like this. We weren't close, unfortunately. I’m not sure about my father’s side… it’s been a very long time.
DOCTOR: Alright. No immediate family history that springs to mind. Now, let's talk about what you do remember. Any recent illnesses?
PATIENT: Recent illnesses… oh, dear. I had a bit of a cold last winter, I believe. Nothing serious, just a cough and a sniffle. And… I had my gallbladder removed, years ago. Perhaps ten years, maybe more? The doctor said it was inflamed. Apart from that… I can’t really recall anything significant. I'm usually quite healthy, or I was, at least. I’m afraid my memory is letting me down. It's so frustrating.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal ten years ago, noted. And a cold last winter. Alright. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, medications… No, not regularly. The doctor took me off everything after the gallbladder surgery. I don’t think I’ve needed anything since then. Just some… over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally for my knees, perhaps. But nothing consistent, I assure you. I try to avoid taking pills whenever possible. They never sit well with me.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I’m going to need to do a quick physical exam. Just the basics – listen to your heart and lungs, feel your abdomen, things like that. And I'd also like to check your reflexes. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor, that’s perfectly alright. Do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment. Just… please be gentle with my knees, if you could. They ache something awful these days. I appreciate you looking into this. I just want to feel better. And to stop worrying my niece, of course. She means well, bless her heart.
DOCTOR: Of course. I'll be as gentle as possible. If anything feels uncomfortable, please let me know immediately. Alright, if you could just lie back on the table for me… Breathing is a little diminished on the lower left lobe. Not alarming, but we’ll keep it in mind. Abdomen is… somewhat tender in the upper right quadrant. And I do detect some enlargement of the liver. Definitely consistent with what your niece mentioned. Reflexes are… slightly diminished. All right. Now, I’m going to need to order some blood work. It'll give us a clearer picture of what’s going on with your liver function, your red and white blood cell counts, and a few other things. It’s standard procedure.
PATIENT: Oh, blood work, yes. That sounds… sensible. My liver, you say? Enlarged? That doesn’t sound very good, does it? I suppose… it’s best to know, even if it's not what I want to hear. The less information, truthfully, the better. But I understand. Do whatever tests you think necessary, Doctor. Just… please hurry, if you can. I have a hair appointment on Friday, and I’d hate to miss it. It's one of the few things I still look forward to.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand your concern, and I assure you we'll move as quickly as possible. The lab results should be back within a couple of days. The blood work will help us determine the cause of the liver enlargement. It could be a number of things - anything from a simple infection to something more chronic. I won’t speculate at this point, as we need the results first. While we wait for the lab results, I recommend avoiding alcohol, even the occasional glass of wine, and any over-the-counter medications that aren't absolutely necessary. It’s best to give your liver a rest. And… I'm also going to schedule an ultrasound of your liver just to get a clearer image of what's going on. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Oh, no alcohol… that won’t be a problem, Doctor. I haven’t touched a drop in years. And no unnecessary medications, certainly. I’ve always been cautious about those. An ultrasound… yes, that sounds… thorough. Whatever you think is best, I’ll agree to. I just want to get to the bottom of this, and hopefully, it’s nothing too serious. Is there anything I should be looking out for? Any symptoms I should tell my niece to watch for, while we’re waiting for the results? I wouldn’t want to worry her unnecessarily, but… I suppose it’s better to be prepared.
DOCTOR: Alright. The most important thing to watch for is any worsening of your fatigue, or any sudden changes in your skin color – a deepening of the yellowing, or any new bruising. Also, pay attention to your urine – if it becomes very dark, or if you notice any abdominal pain that's severe and doesn't go away. But honestly, try not to dwell on it. Worrying won’t help anything. Let me worry. Your niece can certainly keep an eye on you, but I wouldn’t have her jump to conclusions. I’ll be in touch as soon as the lab results come back, and we’ll discuss the next steps then. In the meantime, just rest, and try to take things easy. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… I see. No sudden changes, dark urine… I’ll try to remember all of that. And I’ll tell my niece not to… jump to conclusions. She does tend to get a bit… anxious. No, I don't believe I have any other questions at this time, Doctor. Thank you for your time and… your patience. I'm afraid I haven't been the easiest patient. Perhaps… perhaps we're done here? I really must be going. My hair appointment… and I’ve a luncheon scheduled with some old friends. I wouldn’t want to keep them waiting.
DOCTOR: Alright. Very well. I’ll have the lab orders sent to the front desk, and they’ll schedule your ultrasound. If anything does change, don’t hesitate to call my office. Have a pleasant day, Ms. Durig. And enjoy your luncheon.
