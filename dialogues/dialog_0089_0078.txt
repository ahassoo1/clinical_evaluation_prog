DOCTOR: Hi Aeisha, welcome. I'm Dr. Roseburrough. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It’s very nice to meet you as well. Well, to be frank, I feel…stuck. Like I need a bit of a reset, a jumpstart, if you will. I’m not sick, exactly, but I don’t feel my best, and I’d like to get back to feeling more…vital.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. “Stuck” and not feeling “vital” – that’s a good way to describe it. It’s good you're coming in to address it before it becomes something more serious. To help me understand what’s going on, can you tell me a bit more about how you're feeling stuck?
PATIENT: Hmm. That’s a good question. It’s…difficult to put into words. It's not a physical pain, not usually. More like…low energy, I suppose. And a bit of…a lack of motivation. Things feel harder than they used to. Even getting through the day can be a bit of a struggle sometimes. I used to have so much more…drive. Does that make any sense?
DOCTOR: It absolutely makes sense, Aeisha. Low energy and lack of motivation are definitely things we can explore. And it's helpful to know it’s not primarily physical pain. When did you start noticing this feeling?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That’s a tricky one. It wasn’t a sudden thing, you see. More…gradual. I’d say, maybe… six months ago? Perhaps a little longer. It started with just feeling a little more tired than usual, and then it sort of…snowballed. I attributed it to the weather at first, then to being busy with work, but…it hasn't gone away. If anything, it’s gotten a little worse.
DOCTOR: Okay, six months, gradual onset… that’s useful information. And it’s good you’ve tried to identify potential causes already. To get a clearer picture, let’s go through a bit of a routine check-in. Are you experiencing any changes in your sleep?
PATIENT: Yes, actually. I haven’t been sleeping as well as I used to. It takes me a long time to fall asleep, and I wake up several times during the night. Not every night, but…often enough that I’m usually tired when I wake up. I don’t feel rested, even after eight hours. Does that sound familiar?
DOCTOR: Yes, that definitely sounds familiar. Difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep is common with what you’re describing. Any thoughts on why your sleep might be disrupted?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. I do worry a bit, you know? About work, about family… general life things, I suppose. My husband and I have been busier lately with the grandchildren, which is lovely, of course, but…it does add to the stress. I don’t think it’s anything major, but it’s definitely on my mind when I try to sleep. I haven't been drinking coffee later in the day, trying to help, but it doesn’t seem to be making a huge difference.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some stress and worry contributing to sleep disruption. We can definitely address that. Let's move on to diet. Has your appetite changed recently?
PATIENT: Not drastically, no. I still eat three meals a day, mostly. Though… I don’t enjoy food as much as I used to. It feels more like…fueling up, rather than a pleasure. And I find myself reaching for simpler things, you know? Less cooking, more…convenience foods. I know that’s not ideal. I used to love to cook elaborate meals for my family, but…I haven’t had the energy or the inclination lately.
DOCTOR: Okay, a decrease in enjoyment of food and a shift towards convenience foods. We'll note that. Now, let's talk about your physical activity levels. Have those changed recently?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. Quite a bit, I’m afraid. I used to walk every day, a good long walk, for at least an hour. But with feeling tired and…unmotivated, it’s become harder and harder to get out there. Now, I’m lucky if I manage a short stroll around the block a few times a week. It feels like a chore, rather than something enjoyable. My husband tries to encourage me, but…it’s just difficult. It’s a vicious cycle, isn’t it? Feeling tired, so you don’t exercise, and then feeling more tired because you don’t exercise.
DOCTOR: It is a vicious cycle, Aeisha, and you're very insightful to recognize that. Okay. Let's quickly go through a bit of your medical history, if you don't mind. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure a few years ago, but it's been well-controlled with medication for a while now. And I had my gallbladder removed maybe ten years ago, but that was a one-time thing. Otherwise…no, I’m generally quite healthy. I’ve been very lucky, I think. I have Medicare, if that's helpful.
DOCTOR: Okay, well-controlled hypertension and a cholecystectomy ten years ago. Good to know. And Medicare is helpful for billing. Are you currently taking any medications, other than the blood pressure medication?
PATIENT: Yes, just the Lisinopril for the blood pressure. I take 20 milligrams every morning. And… occasionally, an ibuprofen for a headache, but that's not regular. Perhaps once or twice a month, if that. Mostly, just the Lisinopril.
DOCTOR: Okay, Lisinopril 20mg daily, occasional ibuprofen. Do you have any allergies to medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I’m aware of. I've never had a reaction to anything. My husband always jokes that I could eat anything! I don’t take any vitamins or supplements, either. I always figured a good diet was best. Though, as we were just saying, that hasn’t been the easiest lately…
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies, no vitamins or supplements. Last question for now - are there any major illnesses or conditions that run in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm. Let me think. My mother had diabetes, type 2, later in life. And my father had heart problems. He had a heart attack when he was in his seventies. And… my sister has arthritis, but that's about it, I think. Nothing too major on either side, really. Though, I always worry about the diabetes, just because it runs in the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, family history of type 2 diabetes and heart problems. Thank you for that information, Aeisha. It gives me a good starting point. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam, if that’s alright. Just to check your vitals and listen to your heart and lungs. It will be very quick, and nothing invasive.
PATIENT: Yes, of course. That sounds perfectly fine. I understand. Please, go ahead. I’ll just…sit here and try to relax.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Your blood pressure is 132/80, pulse is 78 and regular, respiration is 16, and your temperature is 98.6. Heart sounds are regular, no murmurs noted. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally. Your abdomen is soft, non-tender, and non-distended. I'll also quickly check your reflexes and a basic neurological assessment. Reflexes are 2+ bilaterally. No obvious neurological deficits detected. Everything seems physically normal at this point, which is good. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you’re experiencing symptoms consistent with fatigue and possibly some mild depression or low mood. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical causes, however. I’d like to order some blood work, including a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and a vitamin D level. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds very sensible. Ruling things out is a good idea. Absolutely, please go ahead and order the blood work. I trust your judgement, Doctor. I'm just hoping to get to the bottom of this and feel like myself again. What will happen next? Will I need to come back for another appointment?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab will contact you to schedule an appointment, or you can schedule it directly through their website. Once the results are back, typically within a few days, we can review them and discuss the next steps. Depending on the results, we may need to explore other possibilities or consider a trial of medication or therapy. I'd like to see you back in about a week, even if just to discuss the results. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly fine. A week is good. I’ll be sure to schedule the blood work and then follow up for an appointment next week. Thank you for listening to me so carefully, Doctor. I already feel a bit better knowing we have a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Aeisha. I’m glad I could help. Remember, it's important to be patient with yourself. These things take time to resolve. In the meantime, try to prioritize getting some gentle exercise, even just a short walk each day, and focus on eating nourishing foods as much as possible. And if you start to feel significantly worse, or experience any new symptoms, don’t hesitate to contact the office. Do you have any questions for me before we finish up?
PATIENT: No, I don’t think so. You’ve covered everything very thoroughly. I appreciate your kindness and attention, Doctor Roseburrough. I feel much more hopeful now. Thank you again. I’ll go and schedule the blood work right away.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Aeisha. I'm glad I could help. Have a good day, and I’ll see you next week. Don’t hesitate to call if anything comes up. .
