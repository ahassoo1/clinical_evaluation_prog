DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Wrye. Welcome to the clinic. I’m Dr. Piet. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you too, Doctor… Piet, was it? Honestly, it’s a bit of a blur why I’m here. Something to do with a… a letter? For a pet, I think. My daughter, Ifiok, she insisted I come. Said something about needing official paperwork. Honestly, I barely remember the details. It’s probably one of those small dogs she's always getting. They all look the same to me.
DOCTOR: Okay. So, Ifiok brought you in for… paperwork related to a pet?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right! Paperwork. She made it sound very important, something about… rules and regulations. Honestly, I don’t pay attention to those things. I just want whatever needs signing, signed, so I can get on with my day. Is it a long process? I have a hair appointment later. A very important appointment.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s see if we can figure out what this paperwork is for then, and how quickly we can get it done. Do you recall anything specific about why Ifiok thought a doctor’s visit was necessary for a pet?
PATIENT: Ugh, don't ask me to recall things. It's just… gone. She said something about needing proof I'm… capable? Of owning a pet? Honestly, it was insulting. I've had pets my whole life! Cats, dogs, even a parrot once. But she was very insistent. Something about a new rule the city made up. You know how they are, always changing things. Is this going to take all day?
DOCTOR: Okay, Ms. Wrye, I’m pulling up your daughter’s notes here… ah. It seems Ifiok is concerned about a recent dog bite she reported to Animal Control. She’s requesting documentation of your… cognitive function to ensure responsible pet ownership, given the incident. It's a new requirement in some cases. So, it wasn’t about a general pet rule, but specifically related to this bite. Does that sound familiar?
PATIENT: A bite? Oh… oh dear. That little Winston… yes, he did nip someone, didn’t he? A postman, I think. Honestly, it was barely a scratch! Ifiok makes everything into such a drama. Cognitive… what now? You’re saying I need to prove I’m… thinking properly because a tiny dog had a little… disagreement with a mail carrier? This is ridiculous! Is this what they do now? Make people jump through hoops for a little nibble? I swear, this city…
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Wrye. It does sound… excessive. However, Animal Control is requiring this documentation to assess the situation and ensure public safety. To comply, I’ll need to do a brief cognitive assessment. It’s just a few simple questions and tasks. It shouldn’t take long. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: A few simple questions? Honestly, you'd think they'd ask Ifiok if I'm a responsible owner. She's the one who's always fussing over these dogs! But fine, whatever. Get it over with. I have better things to do, you know. Just… don't make me draw any pictures or anything. I haven’t done that since primary school. And please, keep it brief. My hair won't style itself, you know.
DOCTOR: No pictures, I promise. Just a few questions to assess your memory and orientation. First, can you tell me today's date?
PATIENT: Ugh, dates… honestly, they all run together. Let me think… is it still July? No, Ifiok said something about August… the second? Yes, the second of August. 2025, I think. Is that right? Honestly, I lose track so easily these days. It's all just a blur. Are we done yet?
DOCTOR: Okay, August 2nd, 2025. That’s good. Now, can you tell me what city we are in?
PATIENT: Oh, honestly? I should know this. Ugh. It’s… it’s one of those big cities, isn’t it? Lots of traffic… and noise. Is it… New York? No, that’s too far. Chicago? No, I was just there last year… is it… Los Angeles? Honestly, they all look the same to me. I travel so much, it all blends together. Just tell me, doctor, what is the city? I'm getting a headache trying to remember.
DOCTOR: Okay. We are in… Baltimore, Ms. Wrye. Now, can you repeat after me: “The sky is blue, the grass is green.” Just to assess your speech and memory.
PATIENT: Ugh, are we doing this now? Alright, fine. "The sky is… blue, the grass is… green." Honestly, it’s a perfectly obvious statement. What kind of test is this? I’m perfectly capable of saying simple sentences. I used to be a performer, you know! I had to memorize lines for days! This is just… insulting. Can we please get this over with? My hair appointment is looming, you know. It’s a very important stylist.
DOCTOR: Alright. Ms. Wrye, I'm going to ask you a few more questions now, but I want to be upfront. Based on your responses so far, I have some concerns about your cognitive function. It's important we understand what's going on. Do you ever feel confused about where you are, or what day it is?
PATIENT: Confused? Honestly, who doesn't sometimes? This city is a maze, and days just blend together when you're constantly traveling. It's just… a bit of a blur, you know? Sometimes I have to ask Ifiok what day it is. And occasionally… I forget where I parked the car. But that happens to everyone, doesn't it? I'm a busy woman, I have a lot on my mind. It doesn’t mean anything is wrong. Honestly, it’s just… life. Are we done yet? I really need to go. This is all very stressful.
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand your frustration, but these are important details. Given your responses, and the concerns raised by your daughter, I recommend a more comprehensive neurological evaluation. It’s best to rule out any underlying issues causing these memory lapses and confusion. I’m going to recommend a referral to Dr. Anya Sharma, a neurologist specializing in cognitive disorders. Would that be acceptable?
PATIENT: A neurologist? Are you serious? A neurologist? Honestly, this is ridiculous! I'm perfectly fine! I just… have a busy life, and sometimes I forget things. It doesn't mean I need to see a… a brain doctor! Ifiok is always overreacting to everything. This is just… absurd. No. Absolutely not. I am not seeing a neurologist. I'm going to my hair appointment. And then I'm going to have a very serious talk with my daughter about interfering in my life. This is… this is outrageous! .
DOCTOR: Ms. Wrye, I understand you’re upset, but I am concerned for your wellbeing. While I respect your decision, I strongly advise you reconsider. I will document our conversation and your refusal of the referral. I will also send a letter to Ifiok outlining my concerns. Is there anyone else I can contact regarding your health?
