DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Glymph. My name is Dr. Giganti. It's a pleasure to meet you. Could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. It is a pleasure to meet you as well. Oh, goodness… where to begin? Well, it’s this pain. In my lower abdomen. It comes and goes, you see. Quite severe when it does come, though. I believe that’s what prompted the appointment. It’s… difficult to recall precisely when it started, truthfully. It feels like it's been flaring up more recently, if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense. Flaring up is a helpful way to describe it. So, the pain is in your lower abdomen, comes and goes, and has been more noticeable lately. Could you describe the pain itself?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness, describing it… It’s… a cramping, twisting sort of pain. Not a sharp pain, exactly, more like… a deep ache that builds. And it feels… full? Like something is… pressing. It’s quite uncomfortable, I must say. It radiates a bit to my back sometimes, too. But mostly, it's right here, in the lower part of my belly.
DOCTOR: Okay, cramping, twisting, a deep ache that builds, and a feeling of fullness in your lower abdomen, sometimes radiating to your back. And you said it’s mostly localized to the lower part of your abdomen. On a scale of zero to ten, with zero being no pain and ten being the worst pain imaginable, what would you rate it at its worst?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me think… At its worst… I’d say… a seven, perhaps? Maybe an eight on a bad day. It doesn't come often enough to be a constant ten, thankfully. But when it arrives, it certainly makes itself known. It's enough to… well, to stop me in my tracks, you see. And sometimes it makes me a little… lightheaded, if I move around too much.
DOCTOR: Alright, a seven to eight out of ten at its worst, stopping you in your tracks, and sometimes causing lightheadedness with movement. Thank you for that information, Ms. Glymph. Now, have you noticed anything that seems to trigger this pain, or make it worse?
PATIENT: That's a good question, Doctor. Honestly, it's quite unpredictable. I haven't been able to pinpoint anything specific. I thought perhaps certain foods, but then I’d eat the same thing a different day and be perfectly fine. Stress, perhaps? But I live a fairly… relaxed life, all things considered. I suppose… activity sometimes makes it worse, if I’ve been on my feet for a long time. Though, simply sitting for too long doesn’t seem to help either. It’s… frustrating, really.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Glymph. It's difficult when the pain is unpredictable. Let's try to get a more complete picture. Have you experienced any changes in your bowel habits recently – such as constipation, diarrhea, or blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh my. That’s… a rather personal question, Doctor. Well… I have been a bit more… regular, shall we say? Perhaps a bit too regular, if you understand my meaning. No blood, thankfully. Just… a little more frequent. And sometimes… a bit of discomfort, even when I'm not experiencing the abdominal pain. It's not severe, mind you, but it's noticeable. I hadn’t thought to mention it before, as it seemed… separate from the main issue.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Ms. Glymph. It's helpful information, even if it feels separate. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying the pain or changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Let me think... Oh! Yes, actually. I've been… rather tired lately. More so than usual. I always assumed it was just… getting older, you see. But it's a persistent fatigue, a sort of bone-deep weariness. And I've had a few… skin rashes. Small, red, and a little itchy. They come and go, mostly on my arms and face. Nothing terribly noticeable, but… bothersome, nonetheless. I also get a bit of a fever sometimes, low-grade, nothing to write home about.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue, skin rashes on your arms and face, and low-grade fevers. That's a lot of information, Ms. Glymph, and I appreciate you sharing everything with me. Before we proceed, let's briefly review your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Now that's a tricky question. My memory isn't what it used to be, you see. I believe… yes, I was diagnosed with something… Lupus, I think? Systemic Lupus Erythematosus. It was quite a long time ago, though. I see a rheumatologist periodically for it, but… I’ve been rather lax with appointments lately. It's… difficult to keep track of everything. And I believe I have… high blood pressure, yes. It's managed with medication, thankfully.
DOCTOR: Thank you for that information, Ms. Glymph. Lupus and high blood pressure are important to know. Do you recall the name of the medication you take for your high blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… Let me see… It’s a small, white pill… I believe it starts with an ‘A’… Amlodipine? Yes, I think that’s it. Amlodipine. I take one… no, two, I think, every morning. Though, truthfully, Doctor, sometimes I forget. I have a terrible time remembering these things. It's not a regular occurrence, but… it happens.
DOCTOR: Okay, Amlodipine, and sometimes you miss doses. Thank you for being honest about that, Ms. Glymph. Now, have you had any surgeries or been hospitalized for any other reasons?
PATIENT: Let me see... Oh, goodness. Years ago… quite a long time ago, I had my gallbladder removed. Routine surgery, nothing dramatic. And… I was hospitalized once, many years ago, when I was first diagnosed with the… Lupus, I believe. A bit of a flare-up, I recall. That's all I can think of, truthfully. It was quite a long time ago, you see, and my memory is… unreliable, at best.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Glymph. That’s helpful. Now, could you tell me about your family medical history?
PATIENT: Oh, my… that’s a bit of a sprawling topic, Doctor. My mother… she had arthritis, I believe. And my father… he passed away from a heart condition, I think. It was quite sudden, I recall. My sister… she's healthy as a horse, thankfully. No major illnesses, to my knowledge. And… on my maternal side, I believe there was a history of… diabetes? Yes, I think so. It's a bit hazy, you see, and I wasn't terribly close to that side of the family.
DOCTOR: Okay, arthritis, heart condition, and diabetes in the family. Thank you. Now, just a few more questions about your lifestyle. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness no! Absolutely not. Never have, never will. I find those things… rather unpleasant, truthfully. I enjoy a quiet life, you see. A cup of tea, a good book… that's my idea of a good time. I do enjoy the occasional glass of sherry, perhaps during the holidays, but that's about it. Nothing excessive, mind you.
DOCTOR: That's good to know, Ms. Glymph. Now, regarding allergies, do you have any known allergies to medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness... Let me see... I believe I'm allergic to penicillin. I had a rather unpleasant reaction to it when I was younger, I recall. A rash, and some difficulty breathing. Nothing life-threatening, but enough to make me steer clear of it. As for foods… no, I don't believe I have any specific food allergies. I enjoy a fairly varied diet, you see. Although, I find shellfish a bit… disagreeable, if you understand my meaning. Not an allergy, per se, just a matter of personal preference.
DOCTOR: Thank you, Ms. Glymph. That’s helpful. Now, let’s do a quick physical exam. Could you please lie down on the examination table for me?
PATIENT: Certainly, Doctor. Just let me know if I need to adjust anything. It’s a bit firm, isn't it? But I suppose it will do. I'm quite comfortable, though. Whatever you need, just ask.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Glymph. I’m just going to press gently on your abdomen. Please let me know if anything feels particularly tender. Hmm. I'm noting some mild tenderness in the lower quadrants, especially on the left side. No guarding or rebound tenderness at this time. Your abdomen is soft, though slightly distended. Bowel sounds are present, but slightly hypoactive. Tympanic to percussion throughout. I'm also going to check your vital signs now. Blood pressure is 142/88, pulse is 78, respiratory rate is 16, and temperature is 99.1 Fahrenheit. Okay, Ms. Glymph. You can sit up now when you’re ready.
PATIENT: Oh dear. Was that… normal, Doctor? It all felt a bit… poking and prodding, if you don’t mind my saying so. The vital signs… is my blood pressure a bit high? I thought my medication was supposed to keep that under control. And what did you mean by ‘hypoactive’? It all sounds a bit… concerning, if you understand my meaning. I do hope it’s nothing serious.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Ms. Glymph. It is normal to feel a bit poked and prodded during an abdominal exam, and I apologize if it was uncomfortable. Your blood pressure is slightly elevated, and you are right to be concerned. We will need to address that. "Hypoactive" means your bowel sounds are quieter than they should be, which can indicate a slowing of digestive activity. Given your symptoms – the lower abdominal pain, fatigue, skin rashes, low-grade fever, changes in bowel habits, and history of Lupus – along with the slightly elevated blood pressure and hypoactive bowel sounds, I have a few possibilities in mind. It could be a Lupus flare-up, although the bowel symptoms are somewhat atypical. Another possibility is a gastrointestinal issue, such as diverticulitis or colitis. To get a clearer picture, I'd like to order some lab work. This will include a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein to assess inflammation, a urinalysis, and a stool sample to rule out infection. I’d also like to order a CT scan of your abdomen and pelvis to visualize your digestive organs. Would that be acceptable to you?
PATIENT: Oh my. A CT scan… that sounds rather… extensive, Doctor. And all those tests… it all feels a bit overwhelming, if I’m being honest. But… if it’s necessary to find out what’s going on, then I suppose I have no choice. Lupus flare-up… that would certainly explain the fatigue and rashes, wouldn’t it? But the bowel trouble… you said that was unusual? And diverticulitis… is that serious? I do hope it’s nothing too dreadful. Perhaps… could we start with just the blood work? Just to see what that reveals before proceeding with the more… invasive tests? I’m a bit anxious about the CT scan, if you understand my meaning.
DOCTOR: I completely understand your anxiety, Ms. Glymph. A CT scan is more involved, and it’s perfectly reasonable to want to start with less invasive tests. We can absolutely start with the blood work. That will give us a good baseline and help narrow down the possibilities. The blood work will help us look for signs of inflammation, infection, and any abnormalities in your organ function. The results will give us a better idea if a Lupus flare-up is likely, or if we need to investigate other potential causes for your bowel symptoms. Diverticulitis can range from mild to severe. In mild cases, it can be treated with antibiotics and dietary changes. In more severe cases, it can require hospitalization and even surgery, but that is less common. We will know more once we have the results of the lab work. I will write the orders for the blood work now. The lab technician will contact you to schedule an appointment. Once the results are back – typically within a few business days – we will review them together and discuss the next steps. Do you have any questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, Doctor, I believe that’s all quite clear. Thank you for explaining everything so thoroughly. And for being so patient with my… anxieties. I do appreciate it. Just… please let me know if the results are… concerning. I’d rather be prepared, if you understand my meaning. And thank you again for your kindness. I feel a bit less overwhelmed now, knowing we have a plan.
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Ms. Glymph. It’s my pleasure to help. And you are right to want to be prepared. I will certainly let you know immediately if the results are concerning, and we will discuss them in detail. I’m glad you feel a bit less overwhelmed. Please don't hesitate to contact the office if you experience any worsening of your symptoms – such as increased pain, fever, bleeding, or nausea – before the lab results are back. Here’s the lab requisition form. The office will also provide you with instructions on how to prepare for the blood draw. I wish you all the best, Ms. Glymph. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
PATIENT: .
