DOCTOR: Hi Laury, nice to meet you. I'm Chriselda Morenomartinez, but you can call me Chriselda. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hello Chriselda. Nice to meet you too. I want to... how you say... find out where my family come from. Long, long time ago. I hear you can do that with... the spit, yes? DNA. I want to know more about that.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. You're interested in learning about your ancestry through a DNA test. That's something we can definitely discuss. To clarify, you're hoping to use a DNA test to trace your family's origins, specifically looking back a long time ago?
PATIENT: Yes, that is right. My people, we from the Marshall Islands. But before that... before that, I don't know. Maybe this test can tell me. Is it... hard? I not good with… computers and things.
DOCTOR: No, it’s not hard at all! It's actually quite simple. The test involves providing a saliva sample – spitting into a tube, as you mentioned – and then sending it off to a lab. They do all the complicated work! We can go over the process step-by-step. Before we talk about the test itself, though, I want to make sure I understand what you’re hoping to gain from this information. Are you interested in learning about potential health risks, or are you more focused on the geographical origins of your ancestors?
PATIENT: Hmm. Not so much the sickness stuff. Just… where my family really come from. Before the Islands. I like to know the stories. My grandfather tell stories, but he gone now. I want to finish the stories, you know?
DOCTOR: I completely understand. You want to connect with your family history and learn more about your roots, especially since your grandfather passed. That's wonderful. So, primarily, you’re interested in the ancestral origins revealed by the DNA test, for cultural and personal connection. Before we move forward, let's quickly review your medical history. It's standard procedure. Have you been diagnosed with any medical conditions?
PATIENT: No, not really. Old age, that's all. Sometimes my bones ache, but that is just getting old. I have Medicare, if that matters. I see Doctor Keoni sometimes, for checkups, but nothing serious. He say I just need to take it easy.
DOCTOR: Okay, that's good to know. And you haven’t been hospitalized or had any surgeries in the past?
PATIENT: No, never. I stay home. I make little boats, you see? From wood. Keep my hands busy. No time for hospital!
DOCTOR: That’s wonderful! Keeping busy is very important. Now, are you currently taking any medications, including over-the-counter drugs or supplements?
PATIENT: Just a little something for my water, sometimes. For my joints. I buy it at the store, you know? Not a doctor's medicine. And… maybe a vitamin, sometimes when I remember. Old age…forgetful, you know?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly alright. So, just a store-bought supplement for your joints and a vitamin occasionally. Now, one last thing before we discuss the DNA test. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. I eat everything. My grandfather always say, "Eat everything! Life is too short!" He was a good man. I think I'm okay with everything.
DOCTOR: Okay, that’s good to hear. So, no known allergies, no regular medications, just a little joint supplement and a vitamin occasionally. Now, let’s talk about the DNA test. There are a few different companies we can use. They typically require a small saliva sample, and you send it off in a prepaid envelope. The results usually take a few weeks to come back. They’ll give you a breakdown of your ancestral origins, showing you what regions your ancestors likely came from. Does that sound alright to you?
PATIENT: That sounds good. A few weeks, yes? Not too long. What if… what if it say I come from… a place I not know? Somewhere far away? Will it tell me stories about that place? Will it be… complicated?
DOCTOR: That's a very good question. It is possible the test could reveal origins you’re not familiar with, and that’s perfectly normal! Ancestry is often more complex than we realize. The tests won’t necessarily tell you complete stories, but they will give you geographical regions, and often links to resources like historical information, migration patterns, and even potential connections to living relatives. It can be complicated, but we can go through the results together, and I can help you find reliable resources to learn more. We can also discuss your findings with Doctor Keoni, as he knows your overall health background. Does that sound manageable?
PATIENT: Okay. With you helping, yes, that sounds good. I don’t want to do it all by myself. And maybe Doctor Keoni too. So… how much does it cost? My money is not so big now.
DOCTOR: Okay, let's look at some options. The costs vary depending on the company and the level of detail. This company, for example, offers a basic ancestry test for $99, and a more comprehensive one with health insights for $199. This one is $79, but the results are a little less detailed. We can start with the basic one if you prefer, and you can always upgrade later if you're interested. They all offer payment plans as well. Would you like me to print out some information on these companies for you to review at home?
PATIENT: Yes, please. Print the information. I need to think about it. $99 sounds okay… maybe. I need to ask my daughter. She helps me with things. Thank you, Chriselda. You explain very well.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Laury. I’m glad I could help. Absolutely, take your time, and talk it over with your daughter. There's no rush at all. Here's my card with the clinic's number. Please don’t hesitate to call if you have any questions. We can schedule another appointment to discuss the results if you decide to go ahead with the test. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that is all. Thank you very much, Chriselda. You are very kind. I will call my daughter now.
