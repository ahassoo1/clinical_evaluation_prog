DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Hartness. I’m Dr. Versace. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning. Yeah, hi. It’s… for the army thing. The exam. Gotta get this done, you know? They want me to take it. Seems important. Don’t really understand why they need a doctor's okay, but, here I am.
DOCTOR: The army, yes. A pre-placement physical, I presume?
PATIENT: Physical? Is that what you call it? Sounds fancy. Look, I build things. Engines, mostly. Good with my hands. Don't see what that's got to do with running around in the dirt, but… they said I need to be checked out. Is that all you need to know? Don’t got time for a lot of questions.
DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Hartness, a thorough medical examination is standard procedure for anyone entering military service. It ensures both your safety and the safety of others. Even if you are “good with your hands”, as you say, underlying medical conditions could pose risks. It’s not about doubting your capabilities, it’s about responsible healthcare. Let's start with a history of present illness. Are you experiencing any current symptoms – anything at all that’s bothering you right now?
PATIENT: Symptoms? Like… a cold? No, I’m fine. Never been sick a day in my life, practically. Except for that time with the… never mind. Look, I just want you to sign the paper or whatever and tell them I’m good to go. This is August 2nd, right? I gotta get this done before the deadline. What kinda symptoms are you even talking about? Is this gonna take long?
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your time is valuable, but I need to ask some questions to properly assess your health. "Properly assess" meaning I need to know what's going on with your body. It's not just about signing a paper. When you say “that time with the…” could you elaborate?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. It was… a long time ago. When I was younger. Working on a boat engine. It exploded. Not a big explosion, but enough. Burned my arm pretty bad. Got patched up, local doctor said it was fine. Didn’t bother me much after that. Just… sometimes it aches when it's cold. Or when I’ve been working hard. It's on my right arm, above the elbow. Look, it’s old news. Really. Does that count as a “symptom”? Because I’m telling you, it's barely noticeable. I don’t need it written all over a form.
DOCTOR: An explosion resulting in a burn to your right arm... that is important, Mr. Hartness. And “barely noticeable” is subjective. A burn of any significant degree can leave lasting effects. Let's move on to a more general review of systems. Have you experienced any chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations?
PATIENT: Palpitations? What are palpitations? You’re using big words again. Look, I build engines, remember? I lift heavy things, I get hot, I sweat. My heart beats faster sometimes! That’s normal. No chest pain, no… dizzy spells or anything. I get a little tired at the end of the day, but that's from work. I haven’t been… fainting or anything dramatic. It's a right arm burn, that's the important thing. Are you going to ask me about my toes next? This is ridiculous.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I am attempting to gather a comprehensive medical history. "Comprehensive" meaning all parts of your body, not just your right arm. Palpitations are a feeling of a racing or fluttering heart. Alright. Let's skip the detailed questioning for now. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies? No. Never had ‘em. Eat anything, take anything. Tough Swede, you know? My wife… she's a bit picky, but I don’t have allergies. Don't waste time with that. Seriously, what's with all these questions? It’s just a pre-army check, not… I don't know, a space mission. Can we just get this done? It’s August 2nd.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I assure you, this is a serious medical assessment. Ignoring potential health concerns for the sake of expedience is irresponsible. I need to know your current medications, if any. Are you taking anything – prescription drugs, over-the-counter pills, vitamins, supplements, herbal remedies?
PATIENT: Look, I told you, I don't take anything! Except… well, my wife gives me a multivitamin sometimes. One of those cheap ones from the grocery store. She says I need it. It’s a little orange pill. That’s it! Just a cheap multivitamin. Don’t make a big deal out of it. And can we please stop talking about pills? It’s making my head hurt. I built a whole engine last week, I don’t need a doctor telling me I’m falling apart! This is August 2nd! Are you going to poke me with needles next?
DOCTOR: Alright. A multivitamin. Noted. Now, let’s briefly touch on your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for anything other than a minor injury?
PATIENT: Hospitalized? No. Never. Not even when I was a kid. I broke my arm once, climbing a tree, but they just put a cast on it. Local doctor did it. That was… a long time ago. No major illnesses, no surgeries… nothing. I told you, I’m a tough Swede! I don’t get sick. Are you writing all this down? Because it’s a lot of "no's", isn't it? Just sign the paper and let me get on with my day. This is August 2nd, and time is wasting. Seriously. I need to call the recruiter after this.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I am documenting everything. Your insistence on downplaying potential medical issues is concerning. While you may consider yourself “tough,” medical history is crucial, even for seemingly minor events. Very well. Let’s move on. Family history. Are your parents or siblings alive?
PATIENT: Ugh, finally a simple question. Yeah, my mother is still alive. She’s… old. Lives in Sweden. My father… he passed away a few years back. Heart problems. Always smoked too much. My sister… she’s fine, lives in Gothenburg. That’s it. Normal family. Nothing exciting. Are we getting anywhere with this? It's August 2nd, and I’m starting to lose patience. Are you going to actually examine me, or just ask questions all day?
DOCTOR: Your father had heart problems… that is relevant. Alright, Mr. Hartness. Finally, let's talk about social history. Do you currently smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No. Never touched a cigarette. My father did, obviously. Didn’t do him much good. Drink? A beer with dinner sometimes. Nothing fancy. Maybe two. A glass of wine with my wife on special occasions. Don’t get drunk. Recreational drugs? Absolutely not! Are you serious with these questions? I’m a married man, a hardworking builder. I don’t have time for… that sort of thing. This is August 2nd, and frankly, I’m insulted. Now, can we please finish this? Are you going to poke me with needles, or give me a quick once-over? I need to go.
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Hartness. Let’s proceed with a physical examination. Please step onto the scale. I need to verify your height and weight, and then we’ll move on to auscultation, palpation, and a basic neurological assessment. This will take approximately fifteen minutes.
PATIENT: Finally! About time. Just get it over with. I’ve got things to do. 187 centimeters, like I said. And… I don’t know, 53 kilos? Something like that. I don’t really weigh myself. As long as my clothes still fit. Let’s just hurry up. August 2nd, you know? Time is valuable.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, the scale indicates your weight is 53 kilograms and your height is 187 centimeters. That yields a Body Mass Index of approximately 15.1. That is significantly underweight. This is… concerning. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs. Please remove your shirt and lie back on the examination table. This will allow me to perform a more thorough assessment. We need to investigate this further before signing any paperwork.
PATIENT: What?! 53 kilos? That can’t be right! I’m a strong man! I build engines! Well, I haven't been eating as much lately… been busy with work. But I feel fine! Perfectly healthy. Fine. But don't expect me to lie here all day. August 2nd, remember? I need to get this done! It’s just a formality, isn't it? I told you, I'm good to go. This is ridiculous. Hurry up.
DOCTOR: Your heart rate is slightly elevated, and there’s a faint murmur I’m detecting. Not alarming, but requires further investigation. Your abdomen is… quite thin. I’m also noting some muscle wasting in your upper arms and legs. Your reflexes are present, but diminished. And your grip strength is weaker than expected. Mr. Hartness, based on this preliminary examination, I am unable to clear you for military service. Your significantly underweight status, muscle wasting, diminished reflexes, and the heart murmur require a comprehensive medical workup, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, an EKG, and a chest X-ray. I’m also referring you to a cardiologist for evaluation. I’m concerned about potential malnutrition and underlying cardiac issues. This is not a simple formality. Your health is at risk.
PATIENT: What?! Are you serious? A cardiologist?! Malnutrition?! This is… this is insane! I just need a signature! I build engines! I’m a strong man! Look, I don’t need a doctor telling me I’m falling apart. I feel fine! A little tired, maybe, but that’s from work! I haven’t been eating as much lately, okay? But I’m perfectly healthy! This is August 2nd, and I’m wasting my time here! Look, can’t you just… overlook it? I need this job! I have responsibilities! I can’t afford to spend weeks going to doctors! This is ridiculous. Utterly ridiculous! You're trying to tell me I'm sick? After all these years? No. Absolutely not. I’m leaving. And I need a written statement saying you refused to sign off on my exam. This is a waste of my time. This is August 2nd! And I'm not playing games.
DOCTOR: Mr. Hartness, I understand your frustration, but I have a professional and ethical obligation to prioritize your health. Signing off on an exam when I have serious concerns would be irresponsible and potentially dangerous. I am not “playing games”. I am attempting to prevent a potential medical crisis. I will document my findings and provide you with a written statement outlining my concerns and the reasons for declining to clear you for military service. However, I strongly urge you to reconsider my recommendations and pursue a full medical workup. While I respect your autonomy, please understand that ignoring these concerns could have serious consequences. I can provide you with referrals to affordable clinics and specialists if you wish. I will need you to sign this release form acknowledging you were informed of my findings and declined further evaluation. I will also document that you requested a statement declining clearance for the military exam. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Fine! There! Happy now? I don't need your fancy clinics or specialists. I just need a signature. Look, I’m wasting my time here. You’re wasting my time. August 2nd, remember? I have things to do. And don’t bother calling me. I don't need your concern. Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. A healthy man… and they treat me like I’m falling apart. .
