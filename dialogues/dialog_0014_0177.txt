DOCTOR: Good morning, Jimmi. I’m Dr. Osterholm. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Hmm… well, it’s… down there. Something’s… leaking. It’s not good. I don’t like it. Been happening a few days now, I think. Honestly, I don't pay much attention to things like that. It's embarrassing, you know?
DOCTOR: “Down there,” alright. And you said a few days?
PATIENT: Yeah, a few. Maybe three? Four? Time just… goes. It’s kinda sticky, and… smells funny. Not like flowers, that's for sure. I cleaned it up a couple times, but it keeps coming back. It's really bothering me, even if I don't usually worry about these things.
DOCTOR: Right. Sticky and… not a pleasant odor. Okay. Is there any pain, burning, itching… anything else you've noticed besides the leakage and the smell?
PATIENT: No burning. No itching, really. It's just… wet. And the smell. Makes me feel… dirty. That's all. I haven’t noticed anything else. I just want it to stop. You know? It’s… unladylike.
DOCTOR: “Unladylike.” I see. Alright. Let's try to get a better idea of what’s going on. Have you noticed any changes in your urination?
PATIENT: Urination? Like… peeing? It feels normal. Same as always, I guess. I go when I need to, and it doesn't hurt. I don’t have to go more than usual, if that’s what you mean. I always drink plenty of water, so… everything goes through, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, normal urination. No increased frequency. Good. And has there been any… discharge, besides what you described as “leaking”?
PATIENT: Discharge… is that different than leaking? It’s kinda all the same to me. It’s just… stuff. Coming out. I haven't seen anything… different. It’s always just that sticky… stuff. I try not to look at it too close, to be honest. It's gross.
DOCTOR: Alright. Well, we’re going to need to take a look. It's important to determine the source and cause of the leakage. I’m going to do a quick pelvic exam, if that’s alright with you. We'll need to rule out a few things.
PATIENT: A… what now? A pelvic… exam? What does that mean? You want to… look at it? Really? I don’t know… I’ve never had one of those before. Is it… painful? And what if you don't find anything? I don't like the sound of this one bit.
DOCTOR: It’s a standard procedure, Jimmi. It allows me to examine the external and internal structures of your pelvic area. We use a speculum – it gently opens the vaginal canal so I can get a better view. Most women find it a little uncomfortable, but it shouldn't be painful. We can go slowly, and you can tell me to stop at any time. As for finding nothing... well, that's important information too. It helps rule things out. It's the only way to know for sure what's going on. We need to check for infection, skin irritation, and other possibilities. It's quite necessary, really.
PATIENT: Necessary? Hmph. Well, I suppose if you have to. But I don't like being poked and prodded. And a speculum… sounds awful. Is it… cold? You're sure it won't hurt? I’m an older woman, you know. Things aren't as… resilient as they used to be. I've heard stories…
DOCTOR: It’s not “poking and prodding,” Jimmi. It’s a medical examination. The speculum is warmed before insertion, and we use lubricant. And yes, I am aware you are an older woman – that’s why it’s more important to investigate this. We need to rule out anything serious. We’ll be very gentle, I assure you. Do you have any… sensitivities down there?
PATIENT: Sensitivities? Like… allergies? I don't think so. I use regular soap, always have. And… no, nothing feels especially itchy or irritated unless this leakage stuff is there. Honestly, the thought of someone messing around down there is making me nervous. You're sure you’ve seen this before? A woman my age? What if it's just… old age?
DOCTOR: Jimmi, I've been a doctor for twenty years. Of course I’ve seen this before. Many things can cause leakage and odor, and age is certainly a factor in some of them. But we need to determine the cause to ensure it's not something more serious. We'll start with the external exam. Then, if you're comfortable, we'll use the speculum. If it becomes too uncomfortable at any point, we can stop. Alright?
PATIENT: Alright… alright. But you promise to be gentle? And explain everything? I don’t want any surprises. And if it’s something awful… just tell me straight. I've lived a long life, you know. I can handle it. Just… don’t dawdle. I don't like being on the table any longer than I have to.
DOCTOR: Very well. I promise to be as gentle and efficient as possible. We’ll start with an external examination. I need to check for any signs of irritation or infection. Could you please lie back on the examination table, and I’ll explain each step as I go?
PATIENT: Alright… here I am. Just… get it over with, please. Don’t poke around too much, and tell me if you see anything… bad. Honestly, this is all very undignified.
DOCTOR: Alright, Jimmi. I'm just going to take a look at the external area now. I’m gently lifting your labia to get a better view. Just relax, and breathe normally. I see some mild redness and a slight discharge. It doesn’t appear to be a severe infection, but there is some inflammation. Now, I’m going to insert the speculum. It may feel a little cold at first, but I’ve warmed it up. It’s important to get a good view of the vaginal walls and cervix. If you feel any discomfort, let me know immediately.
PATIENT: Ooh! Cold! That is cold! And… it feels… strange. Not painful, yet. But it's… intrusive. Are you sure you warmed that thing up enough? It's making me feel very uncomfortable. And what are you looking at down there? Just tell me what you see, don't just poke around! Hurry up!
DOCTOR: Alright, alright. I apologize for the initial discomfort. I’ll try to be more gentle. I’m examining the vaginal walls and cervix for any signs of inflammation, lesions, or abnormal discharge. I do see some mild inflammation of the vaginal walls, and the cervix appears slightly irritated. The discharge is thin and grayish-white, with a slightly fishy odor. It doesn’t appear to be anything immediately alarming, but we need to send a sample to the lab to rule out an infection like bacterial vaginosis or a yeast infection. Okay, I’m going to remove the speculum now.
PATIENT: Finally! That was… unpleasant. A fishy odor? Oh dear. That doesn’t sound good at all. Bacterial… what now? Is that serious? And what does that mean? I just want it to go away! Is it something I caught from… something?
DOCTOR: Bacterial vaginosis – BV for short – is a common infection caused by an imbalance of bacteria in the vagina. It's not sexually transmitted, thankfully. It's often caused by a disruption of the natural vaginal flora. It's not usually serious, but it can be uncomfortable and cause odor and discharge. We’ll send a sample to the lab for confirmation, and then we can start treatment with antibiotics. Now, I just need to collect a small sample of the discharge to send to the lab. It will only take a moment. Alright, that's all done. It should be back within a few days.
PATIENT: Antibiotics… hmph. I don't like taking pills. They always make me feel sick. And a few days? I have to walk around with this… fishy smell for a few days? Is there anything I can do in the meantime? Some kind of… wash? A cream? I don't want everyone knowing my business.
DOCTOR: Unfortunately, there isn’t a quick fix. Douching is not recommended, as it can actually worsen the imbalance of bacteria. There are some over-the-counter creams that may help with the odor temporarily, but they won't treat the underlying infection. It’s best to wait for the lab results and start the antibiotics. I can prescribe a short course, and they usually have minimal side effects. I'm going to write you a prescription for Metronidazole. Take it as directed, and if you experience any nausea or stomach upset, let me know. I'll also give you some instructions on hygiene to help manage the symptoms in the meantime. Here's the prescription and some aftercare information. Avoid scented soaps and douching, and wear cotton underwear. We’ll follow up once the lab results are back. Do you have any other questions for me?
PATIENT: Metronidazole… sounds awful. Cotton underwear… I already wear that. Honestly, it all sounds like a lot of trouble. I suppose I don’t have much choice, do I? And the results will be back in a few days? What if it's… something serious? Something I can't get rid of? I don't want to be sick forever.
DOCTOR: It’s highly unlikely to be anything serious, Jimmi. BV is very common and easily treated. If the antibiotics don’t resolve the issue, then we’ll investigate further. But I assure you, it’s most likely just an imbalance of bacteria. I’ll schedule a follow-up appointment for a week from today to discuss the lab results and ensure the antibiotics are working. In the meantime, if you experience any severe pain, fever, or unusual bleeding, please contact the office immediately. Do you have any other concerns before you leave?
PATIENT: Severe pain… fever… Oh dear. You're scaring me now. Well, I suppose if I get any worse, I’ll call. A week… That feels like a long time to walk around like this. Very well. Thank you, Doctor. I suppose. I just want it to be over with.
DOCTOR: Alright. Get dressed, and I’ll see you in a week. And try not to worry too much. It's likely to be a simple fix.
