DOCTOR: Right, Mrs. Sciarrotta. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Well, Doctor Osga, it’s about getting a card... for driving. You know, like for those ride-share things, or if I ever wanted to drive a taxi, or… something commercial. I need a medical card for that, and I figured I should get it sorted out. It’s August 2nd, right? Been meaning to do this for a while now.
DOCTOR: A…commercial driving license?
PATIENT: Not a license exactly. More like a card that says I’m healthy enough to get one. My daughter explained it. She said they need proof from a doctor, and... well, here I am! It's all very new to me, these apps and things. I mostly just want to be sure I can still do what I need to. Is that what you need a card for, too? Sometimes I forget things, but I remember what she told me pretty clearly.
DOCTOR: Right. So, a DOT physical… Department of Transportation. Yes, yes. Well, let's get this over with. I'll need to go through some standard questions and a basic exam. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, DOT… that’s right. My daughter said that too. Let me think… Hmm. Well, I had my gallbladder out years ago, maybe twenty years? And my knees aren't what they used to be, you know, from all the logging work. It’s a little stiff sometimes, especially in cold weather. Nothing a bit of stretching doesn't help, usually. And I take something for my blood pressure, but it’s been stable for ages. Does that count as a condition? I usually see Dr. Tanaka for that, but he's on vacation.
DOCTOR: Gallbladder removal… knees…blood pressure. Okay. And what medication are you on for the blood pressure?
PATIENT: Let me see… it’s… Lisinopril, I think. Yes, Lisinopril, 20 milligrams every morning. I’ve been on it for, oh… about ten years now? I get it refilled at the pharmacy, and I always make sure to take it. My daughter reminds me, just in case. She’s very good at keeping me organized. Do you need the exact name of the pharmacy, too? I can tell you that, if you like.
DOCTOR: No, that’s alright. Do you have any allergies to any medications or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. I used to work outside a lot, you know, with logging equipment, and I was stung by a few bees and bitten by a mosquito or two, but nothing serious. Just a little swelling. My husband used to tease me about being tough as nails, he said I didn’t even flinch. He passed away a few years back, but... never had allergies, no. I can’t think of a single thing.
DOCTOR: Alright. Let’s have a quick listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes and a few other things. Just step up on the scale, please.
PATIENT: Oh, alright. Scale first, you say? Here we go… I hope it’s not one of those fancy ones that tells you too much. I just want the card, really. Don't need any surprises.
DOCTOR: 139 pounds. And your height is on file as 155 centimeters. Okay. Blood pressure and pulse now.
PATIENT: Yes, that’s right, 155. It's funny, I always felt a bit shorter than everyone else. Though, working around those big logging machines, nobody really noticed a few inches difference. I try to stay calm, but my blood pressure always goes up a bit at the doctor’s office. Old habit, I suppose. It's usually much better at home.
DOCTOR: 148 over 82. Not terrible. Now, let's listen to your heart and lungs. Breathe deeply.
PATIENT: Alright. There... is that alright? It's a little dusty here, maybe? Sometimes my lungs feel a little tight when the air isn't so fresh. Used to be so much cleaner up in the mountains where I worked, but… here in town, it's different. Are you hearing anything unusual? I try not to worry about things, but…
DOCTOR: Clear, with some mild age-related changes. Nothing concerning. Can you follow my finger with your eyes?
PATIENT: Yes, of course. There… up and down, left and right… I hope I’m not too shaky. It's hard to hold perfectly still sometimes, especially after a long day. My hands aren't as steady as they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Stand up and walk a few steps for me.
PATIENT: Like this? Just a few steps? I’m trying to be careful, doctor. Don't want to fall. My knees make a little noise when I walk, sometimes. It's just old age, I guess. Is that alright?
DOCTOR: Gait is slightly slower than average, knees crepitus noted, but no apparent instability. Alright. Do you have any vision or hearing problems?
PATIENT: No, not really. I wear reading glasses sometimes, for small print, but my distance vision is fine. And my hearing… well, my daughter says I don't always hear her when she calls from the other room, but that's probably because I’m busy! Seriously though, I can hear perfectly well when people are talking directly to me. I never had any problems with my hearing, not that I know of. Do you need me to read something from a chart or something?
DOCTOR: No, that's alright. Based on this brief exam, and assuming no significant changes in your medical history, I can sign off on the DOT medical certification. Here you go. This should be sufficient for your commercial driving card. Do you have any other questions?
PATIENT: Oh! Wonderful. That was quicker than I thought. Thank you, Doctor Osga. No, I don't think so... Just one. Will this last for a long time, or will I have to come back again soon? I really don't want to have to deal with all this paperwork again if I can avoid it.
DOCTOR: It’s good for one year. Then you’ll need to be re-evaluated. And honestly, I probably won't be the one doing it. I mostly see family medicine patients, not commercial drivers. Now, is there anything else?
PATIENT: Oh… one year, then. Alright, well, that’s not too bad. No, I think that's all, Doctor. Thank you very much for your time. I appreciate you getting this sorted out for me. And thank you for not making me do too many… tests. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You too. .
