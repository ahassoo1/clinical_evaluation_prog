DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Oitker. I’m Dr. Trestrail. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good morning to you, Doctor. Well, it’s this… tiredness. Just awful tiredness. It comes and goes, but when it’s here… I can barely lift a thing. My husband, he’s been fussing over me something fierce. Says I need to get it checked. Honestly, I just thought I was getting old.
DOCTOR: "Getting old" is a rather… broad diagnosis, Ms. Oitker. It’s good your husband is concerned, and you're right to address this. Can you tell me more about this tiredness?
PATIENT: Oh, don’t you start with me about diagnoses. I’ve lived eighty-one years, I think I have a good idea what’s going on with my body. But fine. It’s not just… sleepy tiredness. It’s like… every muscle just aches. And I feel weak. Really weak. I used to be able to… well, never mind what I used to be able to do. It doesn’t matter now. It just comes on suddenly, then goes away. Mostly. It’s just… bothersome. And makes everything difficult.
DOCTOR: “Difficult” is a useful description, Ms. Oitker. And I understand you’ve lived a long life and have a good sense of your body. However, “sudden” weakness and muscle aches do warrant investigation. When did this start?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. When did it start… Honestly, Doctor, it feels like… a while now. Maybe… six months? A year? Time just blurs together, you know? It wasn't constant at first, just little spells. Now it's... more frequent. And a bit worse, I suppose. It’s not like I haven't been busy, either. Still helping with the diving business, you know. Though not as much as I used to.
DOCTOR: A “diving business”?
PATIENT: Oh, yes. My husband and I… we run a commercial diving business. Well, he does most of the actual diving now, of course. I handle the paperwork, the scheduling, the… important things. It's a family business, really. Has been for generations. Though, nowadays… it’s mostly salvage work, inspections… not the glamorous stuff you see in the movies.
DOCTOR: Commercial diving is… physically demanding work, even on the administrative side. And you said this coincided with a change in the type of work you were doing?
PATIENT: Well, I wouldn’t say coincided exactly. We always did a bit of everything. But yes, now it's mostly the… paperwork, the talking to people, the arranging. Less… hands-on, you see? Honestly, I miss the hands-on. It kept me moving. Though my hands aren't what they used to be, either.
DOCTOR: Alright. And aside from the tiredness and muscle aches, are you experiencing any other symptoms?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Not really… I mean, I get a bit winded sometimes, but that’s just… age. And my knees ache, always have. Oh! And sometimes my muscles… feel a bit… sore after I’ve been sitting for a while. Like they’re stiff. But that’s probably from not getting around enough. No, nothing major, Doctor. Honestly, I don’t see what all the fuss is about.
DOCTOR: Ms. Oitker, dismissing symptoms as “just age” isn’t a diagnosis. Let’s go through a quick review of systems, just to be thorough. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight recently?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Very well. Appetite… not much change. I eat when my husband puts food in front of me, of course. As for weight… I don’t really weigh myself. He does. Says I’m… maintaining. Which is good enough for me. I don’t need to be losing weight.
DOCTOR: The chart indicates a weight of 108 pounds. And have you experienced any difficulty with breathing, chest pain, or palpitations?
PATIENT: One hundred and eight? Heavens. He must be mistaken. I'm... sturdier than that. And no, no trouble breathing. A little short of breath when I climb the stairs, but who doesn't get winded these days? No chest pain, no palpitations. My heart’s always been strong. Perfectly strong.
DOCTOR: Very well. Any fever, chills, night sweats, or unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: Oh, absolutely not. No fever, no chills. Night sweats? I sleep quite soundly, thank you very much. And I told you, no weight loss. My husband keeps a close eye on that. Honestly, Doctor, are you even listening to me? It’s just… tiredness. A bit of weakness.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Oitker. Let’s proceed with a physical exam. It will allow me to better assess your condition. I'll need to listen to your heart and lungs, check your reflexes, and examine your muscles. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Oh. Well, I suppose. As long as it doesn't take too long. I have things to do, you know. Paperwork. Important paperwork. And my husband will be wondering where I am. But yes, go ahead. Just… be gentle. My bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please take a deep breath for me. Lungs are clear bilaterally, though slightly diminished breath sounds in the bases. Heart rate is regular, but slightly slow at 62. No murmurs, rubs, or gallops noted. Reflexes are 2+ and symmetric bilaterally. There’s some mild tenderness to palpation in the proximal muscles of the upper and lower extremities. No visible muscle wasting. Muscle strength appears 5/5 in all extremities, though with some subjective weakness reported.
PATIENT: Subjective weakness? I told you. Honestly, Doctor, what did you expect? It’s not like I’m pretending. It’s just… difficult to do things. Lifting things, carrying things… even getting out of a chair takes effort now.
DOCTOR: Alright. Given your reported symptoms and exam findings, I’d like to order some blood work. A complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid function tests, and a vitamin D level. We'll also check your creatine kinase levels, to assess for any muscle inflammation. Do you have any allergies to blood draw or latex?
PATIENT: Allergies? Good heavens, no. I've had plenty of blood drawn in my life. It's just… a nuisance. And latex… I don't think so. I haven't paid much attention to such things. My husband handles all the medical… details. But no, I don't believe so. Can we hurry this up?
DOCTOR: Alright. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood. While we're waiting, let’s discuss your diving business in a little more detail. What exactly does your role entail, on a typical day?
PATIENT: Oh, don't you start with the business. Honestly, it’s… paperwork mostly. Scheduling appointments, answering the phone, making sure my husband has everything he needs. Sometimes I go to the dock and… oversee things. Make sure everything is running smoothly. But I haven't been going as much lately. It’s mostly done from home now.
DOCTOR: And how long have you been primarily handling the administrative tasks, rather than being more actively involved at the dock?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… maybe a year or so? Since my… back started acting up. It's not a serious injury, just… aches sometimes. And I get tired easily, you know? So, it's easier to manage things from home. My husband understands. He doesn't want me straining myself. It's just… not as satisfying, being stuck behind a desk all day.
DOCTOR: Okay. While we await the lab results, I’m concerned about the possibility of vitamin D deficiency, given your limited sun exposure. Also, the combination of fatigue, muscle weakness, and administrative role suggests a possible deconditioning or underlying metabolic issue. I will order an EKG to rule out cardiac abnormalities, and a urine analysis to check kidney function. I also want to discuss the possibility of a referral to a physical therapist for an evaluation. Would you be open to that?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake! Now you’re talking about physical therapists and urine analysis? Honestly, Doctor, are you sure you’re listening to me? I just have a bit of tiredness! I don't need all these tests and specialists. A bit of rest, that's all I need. A bit of sunshine… when we have any. But a physical therapist? Really? My husband will be furious. He thinks I'm perfectly capable of managing things myself.
DOCTOR: Ms. Oitker, I understand your frustration, but I am obligated to rule out any potential underlying medical causes for your symptoms. While rest may be helpful, it is not a diagnosis. The tests I’ve ordered are standard procedures for evaluating fatigue and muscle weakness, and can help guide appropriate treatment. Given your weight and reported fatigue, I remain concerned about potential vitamin deficiencies or underlying metabolic issues. I strongly recommend at least considering the referral to physical therapy. It can help assess your strength and endurance, and develop a customized exercise program. Refusing appropriate medical evaluation is your right, but it may delay accurate diagnosis and treatment. We’ll await the lab results, and then discuss the next steps. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood.
PATIENT: Oh, honestly. You're just like all the others. Always poking and prodding and running tests. Fine. Do your tests. But don't expect me to go traipsing off to a physical therapist. My husband will hear about this, I can assure you. He's very protective, you know. Very sensible. And just… don't bother me with the results unless it’s something serious. I have paperwork to do.
DOCTOR: Very well, Ms. Oitker. The nurse will be in shortly. Please let me know if you experience any worsening of your symptoms in the meantime.
PATIENT: .
