DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tomassoni, have a seat. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor Fourney. Well, it’s…difficult to explain precisely. I’ve noticed some swelling, and it’s been…present for a little while now. I don’t recall exactly when it started, unfortunately. It's frustrating, as I can't pinpoint a cause.
DOCTOR: Hmm. Swelling, you say. Okay. And where exactly are you noticing this swelling?
PATIENT: It seems to be…both, actually. My neck feels a bit…full, and my ankles are puffy, especially at the end of the day. It’s not consistently painful, more…uncomfortable, if that makes sense. I apologize for the vagueness; my memory isn’t what it used to be.
DOCTOR: It's alright, we'll get to the bottom of it. Vague is fine, we'll narrow things down. So, neck and ankles. Has this swelling been getting progressively worse, staying the same, or fluctuating?
PATIENT: Fluctuating, I believe. Some days it’s barely noticeable, and others…well, like today, it’s quite prominent. I don’t think it’s been rapidly worsening, thankfully. More…up and down. It’s quite peculiar. I haven’t changed anything in my routine recently, so I’m unsure what might be causing it.
DOCTOR: Okay, fluctuating. That’s helpful. Now, let's talk a little bit more about this neck swelling. Is it all over your neck, or is it localized to a specific area?
PATIENT: I believe it’s more on this side, actually. Not a large lump, just…fullness. And it feels…softer, rather than hard. It's difficult to describe the texture, honestly. I haven’t noticed any redness or warmth, if that’s relevant.
DOCTOR: Good, good. Not hard, not red, not warm. That's all useful information. Now, let's move on to your ankles. Does anything make the ankle swelling worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… standing for long periods, definitely. And…warm weather seems to exacerbate it. I work indoors, thankfully, but if I’m out on a particularly hot day, it becomes quite noticeable. I don’t recall any injuries to my ankles, if that helps. It just…appears. I apologize for being so unclear.
DOCTOR: You're not being unclear, Mr. Tomassoni. It takes time to figure these things out. Standing and warm weather. Alright. Now, have you noticed any other symptoms accompanying this swelling?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… let me think. I have been feeling…a bit more tired lately, I suppose. But I attribute that to the summer heat, mostly. And perhaps a little…short of breath when I exert myself, but nothing alarming. I wouldn't say it’s constant, just…noticeable during physical activity. I apologize if this isn’t very helpful; I wish I could be more precise.
DOCTOR: Okay, fatigue and some shortness of breath with exertion. We're getting there. Now, let's go through a bit of your medical history. Do you have any existing medical conditions that I should be aware of?
PATIENT: Not that I’m aware of, Doctor Fourney. I’ve generally been quite healthy, thankfully. I haven't been diagnosed with anything significant. I did have a bout of…the flu, a few years ago, but that was it. I don’t have any allergies that I know of, either. I apologize, I truly wish I could provide more detail, but my memory is…fragmented.
DOCTOR: That's alright, we'll work with what we have. Have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Fourney. Never. No surgeries, no hospitalizations. I've been fortunate in that regard. I did have my wisdom teeth removed when I was younger, but that was a simple outpatient procedure. Nothing major, certainly. I apologize for being so vague; it feels frustrating not to be able to recall more details.
DOCTOR: Alright. No surgeries, no hospitalizations. Good. Now, what about your family?
PATIENT: My family…that’s a bit complicated. My mother…she passed away a few years ago. She had…heart problems, I believe. And my father…he lives in Morocco, and I haven’t seen him in many years. I don't have much information regarding his medical history, unfortunately. I apologize; I wish I could be more helpful. I know he was generally healthy when I last saw him, but beyond that, I’m unsure.
DOCTOR: Okay. Mother with heart problems, father's history unknown. That's helpful to know. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Do you smoke?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Fourney. I’ve never smoked. And I rarely drink alcohol, perhaps a glass of wine with dinner occasionally. I try to maintain a healthy diet, mostly fruits and vegetables, and I walk regularly. I apologize; I’m trying to recall everything accurately. It's just…difficult.
DOCTOR: Alright, no smoking, minimal alcohol. That's good. Now, any medications you are currently taking?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Fourney. I don’t take any medications regularly. I occasionally take ibuprofen for headaches, but that’s it. Nothing prescribed, just over-the-counter pain relief when needed. I apologize for my lack of clarity. My memory is…a constant source of frustration.
DOCTOR: Alright, no regular medications. Okay. Now, I'm going to perform a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, and take a look at your neck and ankles. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor Fourney, that is perfectly alright. Please, proceed at your own pace. I apologize in advance if I seem…distracted. I’m simply trying to recall any relevant information that might be helpful.
DOCTOR: Alright. Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs detected. Lungs are clear. Your neck…I can feel some fullness, as you described, but no lymphadenopathy. It's soft and non-tender. Your ankles…yes, there is some pitting edema present, about +1 bilaterally. Now, I'd like to order some blood work to get a better understanding of what's going on. We’ll check your kidney and liver function, your thyroid levels, and a complete blood count. Also, an EKG just to be safe. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor Fourney, that sounds…reasonable. Blood work and an EKG. I trust your judgment. I apologize for being so vague throughout this process; I truly wish I could provide more details. I’m simply…uncertain as to the cause of all of this. I hope the tests provide some clarity. What is the next step after the tests?
DOCTOR: Alright. The lab technician will come in shortly to draw your blood. The EKG will be done right here in the examination room. Once we have the results, we'll review them together and discuss the next steps. Depending on the results, we may need to consider further testing, such as an ultrasound of your kidneys or a referral to a cardiologist. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. We'll start with these initial tests and see what they reveal. Do you have any questions for me at this point?
PATIENT: No, Doctor Fourney, I don’t believe so. You’ve explained everything very clearly. I appreciate your patience with my…fragmented recollections. I simply hope we can determine the cause of this swelling and find a solution. Thank you for your time and expertise. Is there anything I should do or avoid before the tests?
DOCTOR: No, nothing specific. Just try to relax and stay hydrated. Avoid strenuous exercise for the rest of the day. The lab technician should be here any moment. I’ll have the results sent to me as soon as they’re available, and my office will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment. In the meantime, if your symptoms worsen – if you experience any chest pain, severe shortness of breath, or dizziness – please go to the nearest emergency room immediately. Do you understand?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor Fourney, I understand. Relax, stay hydrated, avoid strenuous exercise, and seek immediate medical attention if my symptoms worsen. Thank you again for your time and attention. I truly appreciate your thoroughness. I’ll await your call regarding the test results. Thank you.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Tomassoni. You take care. And don't hesitate to call if you have any concerns before your follow-up appointment.
