DOCTOR: Hi Dawnetta, good to meet you. I'm Dr. Amussen. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Well, good to meet you, I suppose. Look, I don't have all day. It's my… well, it's my stool. It's black. Been taking these pain pills for years, you know, for my arthritis, and now this. It's probably something serious, knowing my luck.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Black stool can definitely be concerning, and it’s good you’re getting it checked out. We'll figure out what's going on. Just to clarify, when did you first notice the change in your stool?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't know exactly. A few days, maybe? It all looks the same to me after a while, if you catch my drift. It's not like I stare at it, you know. Is it the pills? It has to be the pills. I take them religiously, every four hours. Good pills, though, the doctor back home prescribed them.
DOCTOR: I understand. A few days is helpful to know. And yes, pain medications can sometimes cause changes in stool color. But we need to rule out other possibilities just to be safe. Can you tell me what the pills are called, if you remember?
PATIENT: Oh, for goodness sake. Let me think… the bottle's at home, of course. Little white ones... no, yellowish. No, wait... they're… Naproxen? Is that it? Yes, Naproxen, 500 milligrams. Take two every four hours when the pain flares up. I've been on them for… oh, I don't know, seven, eight years now? Longer, maybe. They help, mostly.
DOCTOR: Okay, Naproxen, 500 milligrams, taken as needed. That's good information. Now, besides the black stool, have you noticed any other changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Oh, you want the details now, do you? Honestly. No, not really. It's all… normal, I suppose. Goes in, comes out. Sometimes a bit harder than usual, but that’s probably the pills too. I drink enough water, I think. Not as much as some people, but enough. Look, is this going to take long? I have a pot roast in the oven.
DOCTOR: Okay, so generally normal, maybe a little harder. And you're keeping up with fluids. Good. We’ll try to be as quick as possible, Dawnetta. Just a couple more questions, then I’ll want to do a quick physical exam, okay?
PATIENT: Ugh, a physical exam? Really? What for? It's my stool, not my insides! But fine, get it over with. As long as you don't poke around too much. This is ridiculous. A pot roast is going to be ruined at this rate.
DOCTOR: Alright. I understand your frustration. It's just a quick listen to your abdomen and a general check. First, have you noticed any abdominal pain, cramping, or bloating along with the change in stool color?
PATIENT: A little cramping, maybe? Hard to say. I get aches and pains all over, you know, being my age. It's just… old age creeping in. Nothing specific to the stool, if that makes any sense. And no, not bloated. I try to watch my salt. Don't want to swell up like a balloon. Honestly, I think I'm wasting my time here. It's probably just the pills. Can’t we just change the dosage?
DOCTOR: Okay, so some general aches and pains, but no specific abdominal pain related to the stool. I understand your thought that it might be the pills, and we can discuss adjusting the dosage. However, black stool can sometimes indicate bleeding in the digestive tract, and it’s important to rule that out. Just to be thorough, have you experienced any fatigue, weakness, or dizziness lately?
PATIENT: Fatigue? Aren't we all fatigued? I'm 73 years old! I get tired just walking to the mailbox. Weakness? Well, my hands aren't as strong as they used to be, but that's just arthritis. Dizziness? Not really. Though I did feel a bit lightheaded this morning, but that was probably just from getting up too fast. Look, are we getting anywhere with this? I really need to get home. The roast! It's a good roast.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. We’ll move quickly. Just a few more questions, then we’ll do a quick exam. Have you had any nausea, vomiting, or changes in your appetite?
PATIENT: No, none of that. Appetite's fine. Always hungry, if anything. And no, haven't been sick to my stomach. I eat whatever my husband puts in front of me, and I haven't had trouble keeping it down. Honestly, I think this whole thing is a waste of perfectly good afternoon. Can we just… finish this? I’m starting to feel anxious about the roast. It needs basting.
DOCTOR: Alright. No nausea, vomiting, or appetite changes. Okay. Now, have you noticed any blood in your stool—even a small amount—or have you had any rectal bleeding?
PATIENT: Blood? Good heavens, no! If I saw blood, of course I'd say something! Do you think I'm an idiot? No blood. Not a drop. Just black stool. And probably because of those darn pills! I swear, doctors these days… asking all sorts of ridiculous questions. Can we please get this over with? My roast is calling my name.
DOCTOR: Okay, no blood in the stool. Alright. One last quick question before the exam. Have you had a colonoscopy or any other screening tests for colon cancer recently?
PATIENT: Colonoscopy? Oh, lord. That was… years ago. Maybe ten years? More? I don't keep track of these things. It was… unpleasant. They poked around, told me everything was fine, and that was that. I haven't been back since. Honestly, I don’t like thinking about it. It was awful. Can we just skip the exam and write it off as the pills? Please? I’m getting a headache just thinking about it. The roast… the roast…
DOCTOR: Okay, a colonoscopy about ten years ago, and everything was normal then. Alright. Given the change in stool color, and to be thorough, I do need to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. It won’t take long, okay?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Get it over with. But be gentle! And don't take too long. That pot roast is not going to baste itself. Honestly, I've had better afternoons. You're a very thorough doctor, I'll give you that. But also very…slow. Just get on with it.
DOCTOR: Alright. I will be as quick and gentle as possible. If you feel any discomfort, please let me know immediately. Please lie back on the exam table, and I'll start listening to your abdomen with the stethoscope. Okay, just breathe normally for me. I'm listening for any unusual sounds. Any pain or discomfort when I press here?
PATIENT: No, not particularly. A little tender, maybe? But that's just…old age. It all aches. Don't poke too hard. Honestly, you're making me nervous. I can practically smell the roast burning. Just hurry up, please. And what if it is just the pills? Are you going to admit you wasted my time?
DOCTOR: Okay, just relaxing your belly for me. I'm checking for any tenderness or masses. A little discomfort is okay, just let me know if it's sharp pain. Okay, and just one more quick thing. I'm going to check your pulse. Okay. Your pulse is a little elevated, but nothing too concerning. Abdomen is soft, mild tenderness in all quadrants, no rebound tenderness. It could be the medication, as you suspect, but we need to rule out other possibilities. I'm going to order a simple stool test to check for blood. Would that be okay?
PATIENT: A stool test? Really? More poking and prodding. Fine, whatever. Just get it over with. But if it comes back negative, you owe me a pot roast. A good pot roast. Honestly, this whole thing is ridiculous. I could have been basting my roast for the last half hour. Is it going to take long to get the results? And do I have to bring a sample? Because I'm not going back in there.
DOCTOR: Okay, a stool test to check for blood. I understand your frustration, and I apologize for the inconvenience. You do need to bring a sample, unfortunately. We'll give you a collection container and instructions at the front desk. It shouldn’t take more than a few days to get the results. In the meantime, I recommend we slightly reduce your Naproxen dosage and see if that helps. Perhaps take one tablet every four hours instead of two, and see if the stool color improves. Does that sound reasonable?
PATIENT: Reduce the dosage? Finally, some common sense. Yes, that sounds perfectly reasonable. One tablet every four hours. And I expect to see some improvement. Honestly, it's probably all this stress. Doctors these days… causing all sorts of problems. Just get me the container and the instructions. And tell them to hurry. I have a roast to finish. Is there anything else? Because I really need to get home.
DOCTOR: Alright. I’ll have the front desk staff give you the collection container and instructions for the stool test. And I’ll make a note to reduce your Naproxen dosage in your chart. So, to recap: we're reducing your Naproxen dosage to one tablet every four hours, and you'll bring in a stool sample for testing. If the stool color doesn't improve after a few days, or if you experience any abdominal pain, fatigue, or dizziness, please call the office immediately. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No. None. Just get me out of here. And try not to cause any more stress to your patients, alright? A little common sense goes a long way. Honestly. This whole thing has been… a waste of time. But fine. One tablet. Stool sample. Goodbye. .
DOCTOR: Okay. You have a good day, Dawnetta. And I hope your roast turns out perfectly. .
