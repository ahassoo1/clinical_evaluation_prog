DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Ferneding. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It's good to meet you. Could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Good morning, Doctor. Nice to meet you too. Well, it's this itching, really. Everywhere, almost. It's been going on for… hmm, maybe a month now? Not terrible at first, just annoying. But it’s gotten worse the last week or so. It keeps me up at night sometimes.
DOCTOR: I see. Itching all over, and it's been progressing over the past month, worsening recently. That sounds quite uncomfortable. To get a better understanding, could you describe the itching?
PATIENT: It's… hard to describe. Not like a bug bite, not raised or bumpy. Just… a constant irritation under the skin. It's not always in the same place, you know? It moves around. And sometimes it feels more like burning, other times just… a really bad dryness. It’s just… there. Does that make any sense? I'm not very good at explaining these things.
DOCTOR: Yes, that does make sense, Mr. Ferneding. It sounds quite frustrating when it's not localized and changes in sensation. So, it's a generalized itch, sometimes feeling more like a burn, sometimes like dryness, and it's been present for about a month, worsening in the last week. Now, has anything specific seemed to trigger it or make it worse?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. I haven’t noticed anything specific. I changed laundry detergents a while back, maybe around the same time it started? But I switched back to the old one a couple weeks ago, and it didn't help. I haven’t been in any new places, haven’t eaten anything unusual… I wish I knew! It just started. It's driving me a little crazy, to be honest. I haven’t slept well in days.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Mr. Ferneding. It's incredibly difficult when you can't pinpoint a cause. Changing back to your original detergent was a good step to rule that out. Let's go through a bit of your medical history, if you don’t mind. Do you have any existing medical conditions that you're aware of?
PATIENT: Not really. I had high blood pressure for a while, but it’s been well-controlled with medication for years now. Otherwise, I’m pretty healthy. I take a little something for my knees, arthritis, you know, old age creeping up. Nothing else, really. Oh! And I had my gallbladder out, oh, must be twenty years ago now. But that's it. I’m on Medicare, if that helps.
DOCTOR: Thank you, that's helpful. So, well-controlled hypertension, arthritis managed with medication, and a cholecystectomy – gallbladder removal – about twenty years ago. And you are covered by Medicare. And what medications are you currently taking for your blood pressure and your arthritis, if you recall the names?
PATIENT: Let me think… for the blood pressure, it’s… lisinopril, I think. Yes, lisinopril, 20 milligrams, once a day. And for the knees… oh dear, the names. It’s a little white pill… I have to look at the bottle. It’s this one, right here. Meloxicam, 15 milligrams. Take one a day. Does that help? I’m terrible with names, always have been.
DOCTOR: Yes, that’s very helpful, thank you. Lisinopril 20mg daily for hypertension and Meloxicam 15mg daily for arthritis. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, not that I know of. Never had a reaction to anything. My wife… bless her, she was the one who remembered all those things. I just always took what the doctor gave me. I haven’t had anything new, though, in years. She passed away a few years ago, so… it’s just me now, trying to keep track of things. But no, no allergies.
DOCTOR: I’m very sorry for your loss, Mr. Ferneding. It’s understandable that remembering details can be challenging. Now, let’s talk a bit about your family history. Are there any skin conditions, like eczema or psoriasis, or any history of allergies in your family?
PATIENT: Hmm… my mother had dry skin, always complaining about it, but I don’t think it was anything serious. Just… dry. And my sister, she had some kind of rash as a kid, but I don’t remember what it was. Nothing major, really. My father, he was healthy as a horse. Never sick a day in his life. So, not that I know of. Nothing like… constant itching, like this. We weren’t really big on talking about medical history, if you know what I mean.
DOCTOR: I understand. It’s common for those details to not be well-documented. Okay, and just a few social history questions, if you don’t mind. Do you smoke, or drink alcohol?
PATIENT: No, never smoked. Tried it once when I was young, didn’t like it. And I used to drink a little… a glass of wine with dinner, maybe. But not anymore. Haven’t had a drink in years. Just… didn’t feel right after my wife passed. So, no. No smoking, no drinking. Just… quiet evenings now.
DOCTOR: I appreciate you sharing that with me, Mr. Ferneding. That’s helpful to know. Now, to try and get a better understanding of this itch, could you tell me if it's worse at any particular time of day, or after any specific activities, like showering or exercising?
PATIENT: That’s a good question. It seems worse at night, definitely. Keeps me tossing and turning. And… I think it gets a little worse after I shower. Not immediately, but maybe an hour or two later. The water doesn't feel hot, but… maybe it dries my skin out? I don’t know. I use regular soap, nothing fancy. And it's not like it’s only after showering, just… a little worse then. It's just... always there, but some things seem to make it a little more annoying.
DOCTOR: Okay, so it's consistently worse at night and slightly exacerbated after showering. That gives us a few things to consider. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to take a closer look at your skin. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, that’s fine. Whatever you think is best, Doctor. I just want to get this figured out. It’s driving me crazy. Go ahead.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Okay, Mr. Ferneding, I'm not seeing any obvious rashes or lesions. Your skin appears generally normal in color, but it is noticeably dry to the touch. There are no signs of active infection or inflammation. I don't feel any significant swelling or tenderness. I'll also examine your back, legs, and feet.
PATIENT: Alright. Sounds good. I do feel like my skin is drier than usual, now that you mention it. And it’s gotten worse on my legs lately, especially behind my knees. Take your time, Doctor. I appreciate you looking into this. It’s just… frustrating.
DOCTOR: Okay, I am noticing some mild dryness and slight scaling behind your knees, as you mentioned. No visible rash or active lesions there either. Your feet are also dry, but otherwise appear normal. Based on the physical exam and your history, the most likely explanation for your symptoms is generalized dry skin, potentially exacerbated by environmental factors or your shower routine. However, given the persistence and worsening of your itch, we should rule out other possibilities. I’d like to order a complete blood count and a comprehensive metabolic panel to assess your overall health and rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to the itch. I'm also going to order a thyroid stimulating hormone test, as thyroid issues can sometimes cause skin problems. Does that sound alright to you, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… sensible. Whatever it takes to figure it out. Blood tests are fine. I don’t mind. CBC, CMP, and… TSH, you said? Okay. And will I need a referral for those? And how long will it take to get the results? I hope it’s not too long. It’s just… uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable.
DOCTOR: Yes, CBC, CMP, and TSH. We can do those right here in the clinic today. I’ll write you a lab requisition, and the phlebotomist will draw the blood samples. It usually takes about 3-5 business days for the results to come back. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend a few things to help manage your symptoms. I suggest using a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic moisturizer liberally throughout the day, especially after showering. Avoid hot showers or baths, and try to use lukewarm water instead. Also, try to wear loose-fitting, breathable clothing, such as cotton. If those measures don’t provide sufficient relief, we can consider a topical anti-itch cream or antihistamine. However, I’d like to see the lab results first to make sure we're addressing the underlying cause. Does that sound reasonable to you, Mr. Ferneding?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds… good. Moisturizer, lukewarm water, loose clothes. I can do that. I’ll try anything at this point. And I’ll wait for the lab results. No rush, I suppose, but… the sooner the better. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very helpful. I appreciate you taking the time to listen. It’s been… a long month. What happens next? Do I just go to the lab now?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I understand how frustrating this can be, and I'm glad I could help. Yes, please head to the lab now, and they will draw the blood samples. They’ll let me know when the results are available. Once I have them, I’ll give you a call to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss them and create a more tailored treatment plan. Here is your requisition. And in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to call the clinic if your symptoms worsen significantly, or if you develop any new symptoms, such as fever, chills, or body aches. Do you have any questions for me before you go?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers everything. Thank you again, Doctor Seil. I really appreciate it. I’ll go get the blood tests done now. I’ll wait for your call. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Ferneding. I hope the blood tests provide some answers. You have a good day as well. And please, don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. .
