DOCTOR: Well, Mr. Tati, have a seat. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Uh, hi Doctor. Cough. I got cough. Long time already. And… tired also. Very tired. Feel weak, you know? And my nose… always blocked. Then runny. Then blocked again. Happens a lot.
DOCTOR: "Long time" is…how long exactly, Mr. Tati?
PATIENT: Hmm… Maybe… six months? Or more? I dunno. A long time. Before Christmas, for sure. Maybe even before that? I work a lot, so… hard to remember exactly when it started. Always busy with the tires.
DOCTOR: Tires, right. And is this cough…productive?
PATIENT: Productive? What mean productive? I cough… and stuff come out. Yellow… sometimes green. Is that…productive? Sorry, I not good with words. Just fix tires, Doctor.
DOCTOR: Yes, that is productive, Mr. Tati. Good. So, yellow or green mucus. And any fever?
PATIENT: Fever? Sometimes… feel warm. Not very high. Just a little bit. Not every day, though. Mostly just tired and cough. And the nose… always trouble. Like… blocked pipe, you know? Then water come out. Then blocked again. Very annoying.
DOCTOR: Right. And have you noticed any shortness of breath, Mr. Tati?
PATIENT: Shortness… breath? I get tired when I lift the tires. Heavy, you know? But… always tired. Maybe that is why? I dunno. It hard to say. I always work hard, so I breathe hard. Is that normal? I not sure.
DOCTOR: Mr. Tati, are you able to walk up a flight of stairs without becoming significantly breathless?
PATIENT: Stairs… My house… no stairs. I live flat. But… sometimes I go to shop. They got stairs. I get a bit… puff puff. But I go slow. Old man shop, you know? Always slow. Not so bad, I think. But… maybe I just old? I 35 only, but feel like 50.
DOCTOR: Alright. And any chest pain with the cough?
PATIENT: Chest pain? Not really… pain. But sometimes… feels tight. Like… someone sitting on my chest. When I cough very hard. Not all the time, though. Just sometimes. And mostly at night, I think. When I lie down. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tati, do you have any allergies?
PATIENT: Allergies? Hmm… I dunno. I work with tires, you know? Dust and stuff. Maybe? Sometimes my nose itchy. And I sneeze a lot. But everyone sneeze, right? I not sure what is allergies. Is that like… special sneeze?
DOCTOR: Okay. And what about medications?
PATIENT: Medications? Sometimes… I buy cough syrup from the shop. The red one. Helps a little. And… panadol for the warm feeling. That’s it. I not like taking pills. Make me sleepy. And I need to work, you know? Fix tires.
DOCTOR: Alright. Now, I'm going to listen to your lungs. Please take a deep breath in… and out.
PATIENT: Okay. Sorry. I try. It hard.
DOCTOR: Okay. I hear some wheezing. And some crackles, especially on the left side. I'm also going to check your temperature and blood pressure. 100.8 Fahrenheit. Blood pressure is 130 over 85. Not terrible. It sounds like bronchitis, Mr. Tati, likely with a secondary infection. However, given the length of your symptoms, we need to rule out other possibilities. I want a chest X-ray, and I'm ordering a complete blood count to check for infection.
PATIENT: X-ray? Is that… bad? Will it hurt? I not good with hospitals, Doctor. And blood… I don’t like blood. Is it… necessary? I just got cough, you know? Long time cough, but… just cough. Can’t you just give me some strong syrup?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tati, the X-ray doesn't hurt. It’s just a picture. We need to see what’s going on in your lungs. And the blood test is routine. It helps us determine if you have an infection and how serious it is. Simply giving you syrup without knowing the cause could be… irresponsible. I'm ordering the tests. I’ll have the nurse draw the blood now, and then we’ll schedule the X-ray. It’s better to be thorough, alright?
PATIENT: Alright… Doctor. If you say so. But… can it wait a little? I got tire to fix. Customer waiting… Just… a little bit? Maybe after lunch?
DOCTOR: Mr. Tati, delaying this isn't advisable. We need to get this addressed. The nurse can draw the blood quickly, and then you can go back to your work. It will take less than an hour. I'm not going to postpone necessary medical investigation for a tire. I’ll have the nurse come in now to draw the blood.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. Whatever you say. Just… be quick, please. I got a business to run. .
