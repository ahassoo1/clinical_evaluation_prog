DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. McKinnon. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Glowka. It’s nice to meet you. So, to start, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Thanks for seeing me. It’s… muscle weakness, mostly. Been getting worse for a few weeks now, and it’s starting to make things difficult.
DOCTOR: Okay, muscle weakness, and it's been progressively worsening over the past few weeks. I understand. To help me get a better picture of what's going on, could you tell me a little more about that?
PATIENT: Well, it started with just feeling a bit tired after normal stuff, you know? Like, carrying groceries would leave me more winded than usual. Now… now it’s harder to even lift things at all. My arms feel… heavy. And my legs get shaky sometimes. It’s not pain, exactly. Just… not strong. I do auto damage appraisals, so I’m on my feet a lot, walking around wrecked cars, looking things over. It’s making that harder, obviously.
DOCTOR: I see. So it began with increased fatigue after normal activities, and has progressed to noticeable weakness in your arms and legs, making your work more difficult. You mentioned it’s not pain, but a feeling of heaviness and shakiness. That’s helpful to know. To clarify, when you say “shaky,” is that a tremor, like involuntary shaking, or more of a feeling of instability?
PATIENT: Hmm… instability, I think. Not like a tremble, no. More like… if I stand for too long, or try to walk on uneven ground, my legs just feel like they’re gonna give out. Like they don’t have the strength to hold me steady. It’s hard to explain. It's not constant, though. Sometimes they feel okay-ish, and other times… not so much. Does that make sense?
DOCTOR: Yes, that makes perfect sense. Intermittent instability, particularly with prolonged standing or uneven surfaces. Okay. And has this weakness been localized to specific muscle groups, or is it more generalized – meaning affecting muscles throughout your body?
PATIENT: It’s… mostly in my arms and legs, like I said. My back feels a little stiff sometimes, but that could just be from bending over looking at cars all day. I haven’t noticed it anywhere else, really. My hands are fine, I can still write and everything. It’s definitely worse in my limbs.
DOCTOR: Okay, primarily in your arms and legs, not affecting your hands. And the back stiffness you attribute to your work. Now, let's talk a little bit about other symptoms. Have you noticed any changes in your vision, any difficulty with swallowing or speaking, or any unexplained weight loss?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. Vision's fine, I can eat and talk normally, and… I think my weight’s been pretty stable. Maybe even a little up lately, if anything, but that’s probably just from stress eating, to be honest. I haven’t lost any weight that I’m aware of. It's just the weakness. That’s the main thing. I’m… starting to get worried about it, if I'm being frank.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Mr. McKinnon, and it's good you're being open with me. We’ll work through this. Let’s move on to some other questions, just to get a more complete picture. Have you had any fever, chills, or night sweats recently?
PATIENT: No, none of that. No fever, no chills, haven’t been sweating at night or anything. Just… tired. Really tired. But that’s been happening for a while, even before the weakness got bad. It’s just… a general feeling of being run down, I guess.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, chills, or night sweats, just a persistent feeling of fatigue. Now, thinking about your past medical history, have you ever been diagnosed with any medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or autoimmune disorders?
PATIENT: No, nothing like that. I've been pretty healthy, honestly. I get a check-up every year or so, and the doctor always says I'm fine. No major illnesses, no surgeries, nothing. I don’t even take regular medication. Just… over-the-counter stuff when I have a cold, that’s it. I haven’t been insured for a while now, so I don't get to the doctor as much as I should, probably.
DOCTOR: Okay, no prior medical diagnoses, no surgeries, and you generally consider yourself healthy, though you haven’t been to the doctor regularly due to lack of insurance. That’s good to know. Do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Nope, no allergies that I know of. I can eat anything, take any medicine. Never had a reaction to anything, thankfully. I'm pretty simple that way, I guess. It's… frustrating, because I can't think of anything obvious that would be causing this.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. That simplifies things. Now, let's talk about your family history. Are there any medical conditions that run in your family, such as muscle diseases, neurological disorders, or autoimmune conditions?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. My dad had some heart trouble when he got older, but that was when he was in his seventies. My mom… she had arthritis, I think. Nothing major, just aches and pains. I don’t think anyone else in the family had anything serious. We don’t really talk about health stuff much, to be honest. It’s… not really a topic that comes up. Does that help? I’m not sure I have much to offer there. It’s not like my family tree is full of doctors or anything, so… not a lot of detailed medical history to go on.
DOCTOR: Okay, a history of heart trouble in your father and arthritis in your mother. Limited family medical history available. And finally, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? What do you mean exactly? Like… do you want to know about my job? I already told you I'm an auto damage appraiser. Or… are you asking about drinking or smoking? I don't smoke, and I only drink socially, like a beer or two with friends every now and then. I don't do any drugs. I mostly just work and try to relax when I have time. Not a very exciting life, to be honest. Is there anything specific you’re looking for? I just want to be helpful, and I'm starting to get a little anxious about this whole thing.
DOCTOR: I apologize if that question was unclear, Mr. McKinnon. I simply meant to ask about habits like smoking, alcohol consumption, and your typical daily activity level. You’ve already answered those questions, so that’s very helpful. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam, if you’re comfortable with that. We’ll start with your vital signs, then I’ll assess your muscle strength, reflexes, and coordination. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Yeah, that sounds… fine. Just get it over with, please. I appreciate you trying to figure this out, but I have a lot to do today. I’m just hoping it’s something simple. Let's just get on with the exam.
DOCTOR: Certainly. I’ll be as efficient as possible. Please have a seat on the examination table. Okay, Mr. McKinnon, I’ve assessed your muscle strength, reflexes, and coordination. I’m noting some mild weakness in both your arms and legs, more pronounced on the right side. Your reflexes are slightly diminished, and your gait is a little unsteady. I don’t detect any significant sensory deficits. Your heart and lungs sound clear, and there’s no obvious swelling or joint pain. I will document these findings. Based on your history and this initial exam, there are several possibilities we need to explore. Given your progressive weakness, diminished reflexes, and unsteady gait, we should consider possibilities ranging from vitamin deficiencies to neurological conditions. However, it is too early to reach a definitive diagnosis. To get a clearer picture, I recommend some laboratory tests, including a complete blood count, a metabolic panel, Vitamin D levels, and possibly a creatine kinase level to assess muscle damage. I would also like to consider an electromyography and nerve conduction study to evaluate the function of your nerves and muscles. Does that sound agreeable?
PATIENT: Ugh. Tests… okay. Fine. Whatever it takes to figure this out. Vitamin levels, blood work, that's… manageable. But an EMG? What is that, exactly? Sounds… unpleasant. I just want to know what's wrong, and if there's something I can do about it. The sooner, the better. Can you explain what those tests involve, and what they’re looking for? And how much are we talking, cost-wise? Because, as I mentioned, I’m not currently insured.
DOCTOR: I understand your concerns, Mr. McKinnon. Let me explain the tests in more detail. A complete blood count and metabolic panel will give us a general overview of your health, checking for things like anemia, electrolyte imbalances, and kidney or liver problems. Vitamin D levels are important, as a deficiency can cause muscle weakness. An EMG, or electromyography, involves inserting a small needle into your muscles to measure their electrical activity. It's not necessarily painful, but it can be uncomfortable – some people describe it as a mild stinging sensation. It helps us determine if there's any damage to your muscles or nerves. We can discuss pain management options if needed. Regarding cost, as you are uninsured, the prices can vary. A complete blood count typically costs around $100-200, a metabolic panel around $150-300, and Vitamin D levels around $50-100. An EMG can be more expensive, ranging from $300-600 or more. I will have the billing department contact you with more accurate pricing estimates and discuss potential options for financial assistance or payment plans. I understand this is a financial burden, and we'll do our best to work with you. In the meantime, I'll order the initial blood work today. Depending on the results, we can then decide if the EMG is necessary. I also recommend avoiding strenuous activity until we have a clearer diagnosis to prevent further strain on your muscles. Does that sound like a reasonable plan?
PATIENT: Okay. Blood work first, then we’ll see about the… EMG thing. I appreciate you explaining everything, and offering to check on the cost. Avoiding strenuous activity is… doable. I’ve been feeling pretty tired anyway. Can I at least get a print-out of what I need to do for the blood work? Where do I go, what do I need to bring, and is there anything I need to stop doing before I go? Like, do I need to fast or anything? I really don’t want to have to come back again.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Here is the lab requisition form and a detailed set of instructions. You’ll need to go to City General Lab, located at 123 Main Street. Please bring your photo ID and this form with you. Regarding preparation, you will need to fast for at least 8-12 hours before the blood draw. That means no food or sugary drinks. You can drink water. Also, avoid strenuous exercise for 24 hours prior to the test. Please let the lab technician know if you have any allergies or if you’re taking any medications. The results should be available within 2-3 business days. Once I receive them, I will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the findings and determine the next steps. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: No, I think that covers it. Fasting, no exercise, get the blood work done… sounds simple enough. Hopefully, it’s just a vitamin deficiency or something easy to fix. Thank you, Doctor Glowka. I appreciate your help. I’ll go get the blood work done as soon as possible. .
DOCTOR: You’re very welcome, Mr. McKinnon. I’m glad I could help. Don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns before your follow-up appointment. We’ll do our best to get to the bottom of this and find a solution. Have a good day, and I look forward to seeing you again soon. .
