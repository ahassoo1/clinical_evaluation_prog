DOCTOR: Good morning, Nadene. It's nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Pfennig. What brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Good morning to you too, Doctor. Well, it’s this cough. It just won’t go away, and my heart… it hasn’t been feeling right either. It gets tired so easily, you know?
DOCTOR: Okay, a cough and some heart fatigue. Let's start with the cough. How long have you had it, Nadene?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… let me think. It started… maybe six weeks ago? At the beginning of June, I think. It was just a little tickle at first, but now it’s more… persistent. Especially when I lie down. It wakes me up at night, which isn't good.
DOCTOR: Six weeks, starting in early June. And it's worse when you lie down – that’s helpful to know. Is the cough producing any mucus, and if so, what color is it?
PATIENT: Yes, it does bring up some stuff. It’s usually clear, but sometimes… especially in the mornings… it’s a little yellowish. Not bright yellow, just… off-color. It doesn’t happen every day, but when it does, it worries me. My late husband, God rest his soul, used to get sick with things like that.
DOCTOR: I understand your worry, especially with your husband's history. Clear and sometimes yellowish mucus – alright. Have you had a fever at any point with this cough?
PATIENT: No, no fever. I check myself regularly, you know, just to be safe. Always have. I haven't felt warm or anything like that. It's just the cough and the tiredness… and my heart feeling weak. It feels like it’s working too hard.
DOCTOR: Okay, no fever, which is good. And you mentioned your heart feeling weak and like it's working too hard. Can you describe that feeling a little more?
PATIENT: Well… it's hard to explain. It’s not a pain, exactly. It’s more like… a heaviness in my chest. And sometimes, if I try to do too much – even just walking to the kitchen – I get very short of breath. Like I'm not getting enough air. And my ankles… they’ve been swelling up a bit lately, too. Not terribly, but enough to notice.
DOCTOR: Okay, a heaviness in your chest, shortness of breath with exertion, and some ankle swelling. That’s quite a bit of information, thank you. Let’s talk about your medical history for a moment. Do you have any known medical conditions, like high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh yes. Dr. Ramirez, bless his soul, he told me years ago I have congestive heart failure. That was… oh, maybe ten years ago now? And I take medicine for it. A water pill and something for the heart itself. I can tell you the names if you like, but I always forget the spelling. And I had high blood pressure for a long time, but the medicine seems to keep that under control. I also had a little bit of arthritis, but that's just a nuisance, really.
DOCTOR: Alright, congestive heart failure diagnosed about ten years ago, high blood pressure, and arthritis. It's perfectly fine if you don't remember the exact medication names right now, we can look that up in your record. Do you happen to know what the names of the medications start with, or what color the pills are?
PATIENT: Let me see... the water pill... I think it starts with an "H." H… Hydro… something. It’s a small white pill. And the heart medicine… that one’s a little trickier. It's pink, I remember that for sure. A sort of rose color. And it might start with a "D," but I’m not positive. I take them both every morning with my breakfast. I’m usually very good about it.
DOCTOR: Okay, Hydrochlorothiazide potentially for the water pill, and a rose-colored pill potentially starting with "D". Let’s confirm those in your chart. Yes, it looks like you are taking Hydrochlorothiazide 25mg daily and Digoxin 0.125mg daily. Excellent. Now, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, Digoxin, that’s it! Yes, that’s the pink one. And no, no allergies that I know of. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me my whole life, and I’ve never had a reaction to any medicine. Thank goodness for that! My sister, poor thing, she’s allergic to penicillin. But not me, thankfully.
DOCTOR: That's good to know. Now, just to get a complete picture, can you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history? Well… I live alone now, as I mentioned, my husband passed five years ago. I have a daughter, Elena, she lives in Florida with her family. We talk on the phone every week, she’s a good girl. I used to be very active in my church, but it’s a little hard to get around these days. I enjoy watching the cooking shows on television, and I still do a little bit of cooking myself, when I have the energy. I don’t smoke, never have, and I only drink a little bit of wine with dinner sometimes. Just a glass.
DOCTOR: Okay, that gives me a good sense. You live alone, have a daughter in Florida, are a former church volunteer, and enjoy cooking and television. You don't smoke and have a glass of wine occasionally. Alright. Now, I'd like to ask about any past surgeries you've had, if you recall.
PATIENT: Let me see... Oh, years ago, when I was younger, I had my appendix out. And then, when I broke my wrist falling in the garden, I had surgery to fix that. That was… oh, maybe twenty years ago now? And I had a cataract removed from one eye a few years back. Nothing else that I can think of. They were all… routine, really. Nothing major.
DOCTOR: Okay, appendectomy, wrist surgery, and cataract removal. Good to know. Finally, and this is important, can you tell me about your family history?
PATIENT: Oh, that’s a sad story, really. My mother, God rest her soul, she had a weak heart too. She died when she was in her seventies from heart failure. And my father… he had high blood pressure, like me. He lived a long life, but it was hard on him. And my brother… he had diabetes. He lost a leg because of it. So, yes, heart trouble and high blood pressure run in the family, unfortunately. And diabetes too. It’s something I worry about.
DOCTOR: Thank you for sharing that, Nadene. It's helpful to know about the family history of heart trouble, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam. I'll listen to your heart and lungs, check your blood pressure, and feel your ankles to see if there's any swelling. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, of course, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. I’m used to check-ups. Just be gentle, my old bones aren’t what they used to be.
DOCTOR: Certainly. Your blood pressure is a little elevated today, 150/88. I hear a bit of a murmur, and the rhythm is a little irregular. Your lungs sound clear, but there's some slight crackling at the bases, which can be a sign of fluid buildup. And yes, there is some mild swelling in both ankles. I also notice some slight pitting edema when I press on them. Alright, thank you, Nadene. I'm concerned about your heart failure being a bit more active than we'd like. The elevated blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, crackling in your lungs, and ankle swelling all point in that direction. I want to order a few tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Would you be willing to have a blood test to check your kidney function and electrolytes, and an EKG to look at your heart's electrical activity?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment. Blood tests and that… EKG, you said? Yes, I’ll do whatever it takes to get this figured out. I just want to feel better. This tiredness is wearing me down. When would I be able to get those done?
DOCTOR: Excellent. The lab is right down the hall, and they can do those tests right away. The EKG machine is in the room next door, and the technician, Miguel, is available now. It will only take a few minutes. Once we have the results, we can discuss the next steps. In the meantime, I want you to continue taking your Digoxin and Hydrochlorothiazide as prescribed. And I'm going to ask you to start monitoring your weight daily. If you notice a sudden weight gain of more than two pounds in a day or three pounds in a week, please call the office immediately. That could be a sign of fluid buildup. Does that make sense?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that makes perfect sense. Digoxin and Hydrochlorothiazide, continue as usual. And watch my weight – two pounds in a day, three in a week. I can do that. I have a scale right in my bathroom. So, the lab first, then that EKG with Miguel? Will Miguel need me to take off any clothes? I get cold easily, you know.
DOCTOR: Yes, that's right – lab first, then the EKG with Miguel. And no, you won't need to take off any clothes for the EKG, just loosen your clothing a bit around your chest. Miguel will place some stickers on your chest, arms, and legs, it doesn’t require any undressing. He'll explain everything to you, and he's very gentle. While you're getting those tests done, I'm going to have my nurse, Maria, come in and review your medication list with you just to be sure everything is accurate. Also, I want to discuss a possible adjustment to your diuretic dosage depending on the lab results. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds very thorough. Maria reviewing my medications, that’s good. And talking about the water pill dosage… yes, whatever you think is best. I just want to feel better. I appreciate you taking such good care of me. Should I go down to the lab now then? I don’t want to keep anyone waiting.
DOCTOR: Yes, please, go ahead and head down to the lab. Just let them know Dr. Pfennig ordered blood work for you. And don't hesitate to ask them if you have any questions. I'll be here when you get back to discuss the results. We'll get this sorted out, Nadene. Take your time.
PATIENT: Thank you, Doctor. You’re very kind. I will. And I will let you know when I’m done with the tests.
DOCTOR: .
