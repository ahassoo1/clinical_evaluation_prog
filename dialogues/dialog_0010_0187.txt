DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Sobkowicz. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I'm Dr. Annesley. Now, to get started, could you tell me what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Hmph. Doctor, yes. My wife make me come. She say… chest feel funny. And heart… beat too fast sometimes. Blood pressure, she say it high. I no like hospital. Waste time.
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand. Your wife is concerned about some chest discomfort and a racing heart, and she's noticed your blood pressure has been elevated. It's good she's looking out for you, and you're doing the right thing by coming in to get it checked. We'll try to be as efficient as possible. When you say "chest feel funny," could you describe that feeling a little more?
PATIENT: Efficient, you say? Good. Funny… like bird flapping inside. Not pain, exactly. More… tight. And sometimes… whoosh. Like wind. Only in chest. Happens when I… walk fast. Or when wife yell. She yell a lot.
DOCTOR: Okay, a fluttering sensation and tightness in your chest, sometimes like a whooshing feeling, particularly when you’re walking quickly or when you're feeling stressed... that's helpful. And it doesn't feel like actual pain, which is good to know. To get a better picture, has this been happening for a long time, or is it something new?
PATIENT: New. Maybe… two, three month? Before that, no problem. I work hard my whole life. Emergency management… very stressful job. Always running around. Always… problems. But no feeling like this before. Now… old age, I guess. Everything break down.
DOCTOR: Two to three months, and it seems to have started around the time you retired, if I understand correctly. And you mentioned a demanding job – emergency management, that is stressful. It's understandable that things might be changing now. Let's talk about some other things. Have you noticed any other symptoms along with the chest discomfort?
PATIENT: Symptoms? What kind of symptoms? You want me to list all my old age problems? I got aches. I get tired. I forget things… sometimes. Normal for old man. What you need to know? This chest… bird… that is what wife worry about.
DOCTOR: No, no, not all your problems, Mr. Sobkowicz. Just anything else that might be related to what's going on with your chest. For example, have you been feeling short of breath?
PATIENT: Short of… breath? Hmph. I walk upstairs… little slower now. Maybe that. But not like… cannot breathe. Just… tired faster. And sometimes… feet swell. Especially at night. Wife say it bad. She always say things bad.
DOCTOR: Okay, so some increased shortness of breath with exertion, like walking upstairs, and swelling in your feet, especially at night. That's good information. Now, regarding your medical history… do you have any known medical conditions, like diabetes, high cholesterol, or heart problems?
PATIENT: No. Never. I eat Korean food. Good food! Maybe little salt… but good food. No diabetes. No… chole… what you call it? High fat in blood? No. Doctor check me every year… always say okay. Until now, wife worry too much. She read too many internet things. Bad internet.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known medical conditions and annual check-ups have always been normal until recently. We'll take a look at your records to confirm that. And I understand your concern about your wife’s internet research. Do you take any medications at all, even over-the-counter medications like pain relievers or vitamins?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Wife make me take… little white pill. For… blood pressure, she say. Sometimes. When it very high. I forget what it called. And… sometimes, vitamin D. For bone. She say old man need bone. That is all. I no like take pills. Make me sleepy.
DOCTOR: Okay, so you take a blood pressure medication occasionally, as needed, and a vitamin D supplement. We’ll want to get the names of those medications to make sure there aren't any interactions. Now, have you ever had any surgeries or been hospitalized for anything?
PATIENT: No. Never. I strong man! Always work. Always take care of things. No time for hospital. Once… when I was young… broke arm. Fall from tree. But that long time ago. No surgery. Just… doctor put thing on arm. Now… old man break easy. But no hospital. Waste of time.
DOCTOR: Okay, so a broken arm when you were younger, but no surgeries or hospitalizations otherwise. That’s good to know. Now, let's talk a little about your family. Is there anyone in your family—parents, siblings, children—who has had heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes, or any other serious medical conditions?
PATIENT: Family… Hmph. My mother… she get sick. Old. Very old. In Korea. I no see her much. She get weak. Fall down. That is all. Father… strong man. Work hard. No sick. Siblings… brother, he okay. Live in Korea. We no talk much. No remember anyone sick. Old family. Far away. No important.
DOCTOR: Okay, so limited information about your family medical history. That's alright. Now, to finish up with your history, could you tell me a little bit about your lifestyle?
PATIENT: Lifestyle? What kind of lifestyle? I sit. I eat. I sleep. Sometimes I watch television. My wife likes to garden. I… used to run things. Emergency management. Now… I try to relax. She always telling me to relax. Very boring.
DOCTOR: Okay, you're mostly resting and relaxing now, with some television watching. And your wife enjoys gardening. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?
PATIENT: Smoke? No! Bad for health. My wife yell at me if I even think about smoke. Drink? Little bit of soju sometimes. With dinner. Very little. Just one cup. Maybe two. Recreational… what you call it? Drugs? No! I old man! I no need drugs. Waste of time and money.
DOCTOR: Okay, very occasional soju with dinner, but no smoking or recreational drug use. Alright. Now, I think I have a pretty good understanding of your history. Before we move on to a physical exam, do you have any allergies to medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… Hmph. No. Never. I eat everything. Korean food have everything! Spicy, salty, sweet… no problem. Wife try to give me some American pills once… for cold. Make me feel sick. But that is… American pills. Not allergy. Just… bad pills. No allergies. Strong stomach.
DOCTOR: Okay, no known allergies. Alright. Now, I’d like to do a quick physical exam to get a better sense of what's going on. Is that okay with you?
PATIENT: Exam… fine. Get it over with. Just… be quick. I have things to do. Mostly… sit. But fine. Get it over with.
DOCTOR: Alright, let’s start with listening to your heart and lungs. Please take a few deep breaths. Your heart rate is a bit elevated at 92 beats per minute, and I can hear a slight irregularity. Your lungs sound clear, but your pulses are a little weak. Blood pressure is 160 over 90, which is elevated as your wife has noted. Now, I'm going to listen to your abdomen. Just relax your stomach muscles. Sounds normal there. Finally, let’s take a look at your feet and ankles. I do notice some mild swelling in your ankles, as your wife mentioned. Okay, that's all for the physical exam. Everything seems to be consistent with what you’ve been describing. Based on what you’ve told me and the exam findings, it sounds like you might be experiencing some atrial fibrillation—an irregular heartbeat—along with some mild fluid retention, likely contributing to the swelling in your ankles. We need to run some tests to confirm this diagnosis. Would you be willing to do an EKG and some blood work?
PATIENT: Tests? EKG? Blood work? Hmph. What kind of tests? What are you trying to find? What kind of… fibrillation? Sounds… serious. And I don't like needles. Is it… bad? Tell me straight. I no want to waste time with many tests. Just tell me if I die or no.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's take a deep breath. An EKG – or electrocardiogram – is a simple, painless test that records the electrical activity of your heart. It will help us confirm if you're experiencing atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular heartbeat. It doesn't involve needles. And the blood work will give us a better picture of your overall health, checking things like your kidney function and electrolyte levels. It will help rule out any other underlying causes of your symptoms. Atrial fibrillation isn't necessarily life-threatening, but it can increase your risk of stroke. That's why it's important to diagnose it and manage it properly. The good news is that it's very treatable with medication. It’s much better to know what we’re dealing with, so we can take the right steps to protect your health. Would you be okay with getting those tests done today?
PATIENT: Stroke? Medication? Hmph. Fine. Tests. Get it over with. But make it quick. And no needles! You said no needles. And explain everything slowly. I no understand fancy doctor words. Just… tell me what they do. And how long it take. I have things to do, you know. Mostly… sit. But still. Things to do.
DOCTOR: Of course, Mr. Sobkowicz. I'll explain everything slowly and clearly. The EKG is completely painless. We’ll simply place a few small stickers—electrodes—on your chest, arms, and legs. These stickers detect the electrical signals from your heart, and the results are displayed on a screen. It takes about five minutes. The blood work will involve a small needle to draw a sample of blood from your arm. It usually takes just a few seconds, and the nurse will be very gentle. It will take a little longer for the lab to process the results, but we should have them back within a few days. We'll start with the EKG, then the blood work. Does that sound alright?
PATIENT: Fine. EKG first. Get it over with. But be gentle! And no fancy doctor talk. Just… stickers. And blood. Fine. Just… hurry up. Waste of time. But wife will yell if I no do it.
DOCTOR: Alright, let's get started then. I'll have the nurse come in to apply the stickers for the EKG. It'll only take a few minutes. Just relax, and try to breathe normally. We’ll get this done quickly. .
