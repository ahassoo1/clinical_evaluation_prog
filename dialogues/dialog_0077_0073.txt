DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. Woodring. It’s a pleasure to meet you. I’m Dr. Pirl. Now, could you tell me a little bit about what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly? It’s about… well, it’s embarrassing to even talk about. I’ve been having… stomach trouble. For a while now. And nothing seems to fix it. I’ve tried things. I really have.
DOCTOR: I understand. Many people find these kinds of issues difficult to discuss, so please don't feel embarrassed at all. It’s my job to help. “Stomach trouble” can mean a lot of different things. Could you describe what you’ve been experiencing?
PATIENT: Ugh. It’s… diarrhea. Okay? Just… constant diarrhea. It’s been going on for weeks. And I’ve taken… everything the pharmacy people suggested. Those pink things, the white liquids… you know. Over-the-counter stuff. Doesn't do a thing. It’s just… constant. And it's ruining my life, frankly. I have things to do.
DOCTOR: Weeks, you say?
PATIENT: Yes, weeks! I told you. Since… oh, I don’t know, maybe the middle of July? Longer, maybe? Look, I don’t keep a calendar of my bowel movements. I just know it’s been long enough that I’m starting to feel… weak. And frankly, I’m tired of being stuck in the house. It’s just… unpleasant. Is that enough detail for you?
DOCTOR: Yes, that is helpful, Ms. Woodring. I apologize for pressing, it’s just important to get a timeline. And please, don’t feel you need to apologize. Now, you mentioned feeling weak. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside the diarrhea?
PATIENT: Other symptoms? Well… I haven’t been very hungry. Which is odd for me, usually. And I’ve been… a little dizzy sometimes when I stand up too fast. It’s nothing major. Just… a little wobbly. And I'm always tired. But honestly, who isn't tired these days? It’s probably just… life. Honestly, I just want this to stop.
DOCTOR: Alright. Loss of appetite, dizziness, and fatigue… Okay. Have you noticed any blood in your stool?
PATIENT: Oh, now we’re getting personal. Really? Look, I’m not examining my… output. I know it’s bad, I told you that. No, there’s no blood. If there was, I think I’d mention it, wouldn’t I? This is ridiculous. I just need something to make it stop, not a detailed interrogation about… everything.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration, Ms. Woodring, and I apologize if my questions feel intrusive. It’s simply my responsibility to gather as much information as possible to determine the best course of action. Knowing whether or not there’s blood present is important. Now, let’s move on. Have you had any fever, chills, or nausea with this?
PATIENT: No fever, no chills. And… maybe a little nausea sometimes. But not often. It's more like… just not wanting to eat. Everything tastes… off. And frankly, eating sounds like the last thing I want to do when I know what’s going to happen afterward. I swear, I’m starting to lose weight. This is… very inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. No fever, occasional nausea, loss of appetite, and some weight loss. And you mentioned this started in mid-July… Are you currently taking any medications, or do you have any known allergies?
PATIENT: Medications? No. I don’t believe in all that stuff if I can avoid it. Just… the occasional ibuprofen for a headache. And allergies… dust, mostly. Nothing serious. Look, is this going to take much longer? I have a job to get back to, you know. I can’t just sit here all day discussing my… stomach.
DOCTOR: Not much longer, Ms. Woodring. Just a few more questions, then I'd like to do a quick physical exam, if you don't mind. Now, do you have any family history of digestive issues – things like Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, or celiac disease?
PATIENT: Family history? Honestly, I haven't really… asked. My mother wasn’t one for sharing medical details. She just… complained a lot, generally. I think my uncle had something… something with his stomach, maybe? But I don’t know what. Look, I’m not a doctor. I just know I feel awful, and I’d like a solution, please. This is starting to feel like a waste of time.
DOCTOR: Alright, I understand. Now, just one final question before the exam. Have you traveled anywhere recently, or eaten anything unusual lately?
PATIENT: Travel? No. I haven’t left the state in… years. And unusual food? I ate some salmon last week. Local salmon, from the store. What does that have to do with anything? Honestly, I'm starting to feel like you're trying to blame me for this. I just want to feel better. Can we just get to the part where you fix me? I have things to do. .
DOCTOR: I assure you, Ms. Woodring, I’m not blaming you for anything. I simply need to rule out all possibilities. Alright. If you don’t mind, I’d like to listen to your abdomen and check for any tenderness. It will only take a few moments. Would that be alright?
