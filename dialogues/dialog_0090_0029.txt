DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Obarr. I’m Dr. Kur. So, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Morning, Doctor. Please, call me Norval. Well, it’s… it's hard to explain exactly. I just don’t seem to be able to eat much these days before I feel full. Like, really full. It’s been going on for a little while now, maybe a month or so. Not sure exactly when it started, to be honest.
DOCTOR: A month, alright. And when you say “not much,” can you give me an idea of how much you’re typically eating before you feel this fullness?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me think. Usually, I have a good appetite. Always have. But now? Even just a few bites of something – a sandwich, a bowl of soup – and I’m stuffed. Used to be able to eat a good-sized plate, no problem. Now, I’m lucky if I get halfway through. And it’s not like I want to stop, it just… feels like I’ve eaten a whole feast after only a little bit.
DOCTOR: So, a significant reduction in your usual intake, and it’s happening fairly quickly after you start eating. Do you feel any pain or discomfort when you eat, or is it just the sensation of being full?
PATIENT: No pain, not really. It’s not a hurting feeling. Just… that stuffed-full feeling. Like someone put a brick in my belly, even if I haven’t eaten much. It's a bit uncomfortable, yeah, but not painful. More just… unpleasant. It makes me not want to eat, which is strange for me.
DOCTOR: Alright. And has anything changed recently that you can think of?
PATIENT: Hmm… let me see. Not really, not that I can think of. My wife, Elsie, and I haven’t changed our diet much. Still eating the same things we always do - lots of fish, some berries when they’re in season, you know. No new medications. We’ve been pretty quiet, staying close to home. Maybe a little more stressed lately, with my grandson moving away… but nothing major. Is that the kind of thing that could cause something like this? I don’t know much about these things.
DOCTOR: Stress can sometimes affect appetite, yes, but it’s unlikely to be the sole cause, especially with the quick onset and the degree of fullness you’re describing. Have you noticed any other symptoms alongside this?
PATIENT: Other symptoms… well, now that you mention it, I have been feeling a bit tired lately. More tired than usual, I mean. I always liked to work in my garden, but even that feels like a lot of effort now. And… Elsie says I seem a little more quiet than usual, but I just figured that was from being sad about my grandson. I haven’t really thought much of it, to be honest. Is that important? I'm not sure what would be important.
DOCTOR: Fatigue and a change in your energy levels can be relevant. Now, have you had any changes in your bowel habits?
PATIENT: Bowel habits…? Oh. Well… It's been a little… different, yeah. Not as regular as it used to be. More… constipated, I guess you’d say. It’s not painful, but it’s… a bit of a struggle sometimes. I haven't said anything to Elsie, didn't want to worry her. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: Alright. And have you experienced any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Hmm. Elsie does all the weighing, so I'm not sure. She hasn't said anything, but I have noticed my pants feel a little looser around the waist. Not a lot, mind you. But maybe… maybe a little. I haven't been keeping track, though. I usually don't worry about that sort of thing unless Elsie mentions it. She's the one who keeps us organized, you see.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Obarr. Given your symptoms – early fullness, fatigue, constipation, and possible unintentional weight loss – I’d like to do a quick physical examination. Then we’ll discuss some possible causes and next steps. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Yes, Doctor, that sounds good. Whatever you think is best. I just want to feel like myself again, you know? I miss being able to enjoy a good meal and working in my garden. So, yes, please, do whatever you need to do. I trust your judgment.
DOCTOR: Very well. If you could lie back on the examination table, please. I’m going to listen to your abdomen first. Please let me know if anything feels uncomfortable. Normal bowel sounds, though a bit diminished. Now, I'm going to palpate your abdomen. Just relax, and let me know if you feel any tenderness or pain. Slight tenderness in the lower abdomen, but no guarding or rigidity. Your abdomen is slightly distended. Let’s check your reflexes now.
PATIENT: Okay, Doctor. I'm trying to relax. It feels… a little strange, you know? Not painful, just… odd. The distended part... is that bad? And what does "guarding" mean? I don't want to bother you with questions if I'm just being silly. I'm just not used to all this medical stuff, you see.
DOCTOR: It’s not silly to ask questions, Mr. Obarr. Distension simply means your abdomen is slightly enlarged. It doesn’t necessarily indicate a serious problem, but we need to investigate further. Guarding refers to your muscles tensing up involuntarily when I press on your abdomen, which can indicate inflammation or pain. You're not exhibiting that, thankfully. Now, let’s check your reflexes. Reflexes are normal. Blood pressure is slightly low, but within acceptable range. Overall, it doesn't immediately suggest anything catastrophic, but we do need to rule out a few possibilities.
PATIENT: That's… reassuring, I guess. What sort of possibilities? Is it something serious, Doctor? Elsie would be terribly worried if I got sick. I don’t want to cause her any stress. I’m just an old man, you know. Maybe it’s just my age catching up with me.
DOCTOR: Mr. Obarr, it’s unlikely to be "just your age." While age does predispose us to certain conditions, your symptoms warrant further investigation. Possible causes could include gastritis, a bowel obstruction, or, less likely, something more serious. To rule these out, I’m going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and a stool analysis. We’ll also need to get an abdominal X-ray. These tests will help us determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and guide our treatment plan. I'll have the nurse draw the blood now. The X-ray can be done on-site, after we finish here. Do you have any questions about that?
PATIENT: Oh. Lots of tests. I… I suppose not. If you think it's necessary, Doctor. What exactly will those tests show? And… will they hurt? I’m not good with needles, you see. Elsie always has to hold my hand when I get them. I just want to know what’s going on, and hopefully, it’s nothing too serious.
DOCTOR: The blood tests will assess your overall health, including your red and white blood cell counts, electrolyte levels, and kidney function. The stool analysis will check for any signs of infection or inflammation in your digestive tract. The X-ray will give us a visual image of your abdominal organs to rule out any blockages or abnormalities. As for the needle, it will be a quick pinch, Mr. Obarr. It’s unpleasant, yes, but hardly agonizing. The nurse is very skilled and will minimize your discomfort. And I assure you, we’ll get to the bottom of this. Elsie can certainly come with you for support if she wishes, but it’s unlikely to be as dreadful as you anticipate. Do you have any further questions before we proceed?
PATIENT: No… I think that’s all for now, Doctor. Just… please let it not be anything too bad. I want to get back to my garden and spend time with Elsie. Alright. Let’s get the tests done. Tell the nurse I’m ready. And… thank you, Doctor. For explaining everything, and for trying to help.
DOCTOR: Very well. I’ll have the nurse come in now. Please try to relax, Mr. Obarr. We'll get this sorted out. .
