DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Mayhugh, good to meet you. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello doctor. It’s… well, it’s my ears, mostly. They’ve been acting up. It’s hard to explain… things go quiet sometimes, and I get really dizzy. It doesn’t happen all the time, but when it does, it’s… unsettling. And my daughter, Lani, she worried me into coming. She says it runs in the family. I… I can’t quite remember which family, to be honest. It's been a lot of years.
DOCTOR: Quiet, and dizziness… okay. And this has been going on for… how long now, would you say?
PATIENT: Oh dear… that’s a good question. It comes and goes, you see. I think… maybe a few months? It’s hard to be sure. It feels like longer, but Lani says it hasn’t been that long. She’s very good with dates, my Lani. I get muddled easily, these days. Is that alright? Am I explaining it properly?
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Mayhugh. It's common to have trouble pinpointing the exact start date with intermittent symptoms. A few months is helpful. Does this quietness and dizziness happen at the same time, or are they separate issues?
PATIENT: Oh, usually together, yes. The quietness… it feels like everything’s muffled, like underwater. And then the room starts spinning. Not always violently, thankfully. Sometimes it's just a wobble. It makes walking… difficult. I try to stay inside when it happens, you know? Don't want to fall. And it scares my grandson. He comes over sometimes... little Kiko.
DOCTOR: Okay, muffled hearing and dizziness occurring together. And it affects your balance… does anything specific trigger these episodes, Ms. Mayhugh?
PATIENT: Trigger? Hmm… I don’t think so, not that I’ve noticed. It just… happens. Sometimes I’m just sitting and reading, and suddenly whoosh, there it is. Other times I might be walking… or even just lying in bed. I haven’t been able to find any pattern to it, doctor. Honestly, I wish I could. It’s rather inconvenient.
DOCTOR: Alright. And you said your daughter mentioned this might run in the family?
PATIENT: Yes, Lani did. She’s very diligent about family history. I think it was… my mother, maybe? She had something similar. Problems with her balance, and… not hearing properly sometimes. But it was a long time ago, and I wasn’t paying much attention then, to be honest. She just got older, you know? It's hard for me to recall specifics, even about my own mother. Everything feels… a bit fuzzy. I hope that's alright.
DOCTOR: It’s alright, Ms. Mayhugh. It's very common to have difficulty with recall. We can try to get more information from Lani if needed. Now, have you experienced any ringing in your ears, or any pain, pressure, or discharge from your ears at all?
PATIENT: Ringing… let me think. No, not ringing, no. Not that I’ve noticed. And no pain, thankfully. Or discharge, either. Just… the quietness, and the dizziness. It's mostly just unsettling. It makes it hard to hear Kiko when he's telling me stories! I don't want to miss anything he says.
DOCTOR: Okay, no ringing, pain, or discharge. Just the muffled hearing and dizziness. And you’ve been experiencing this for a few months. Now, let’s talk about other medical problems. Do you have any other health conditions, like diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart problems?
PATIENT: Oh dear. Let me see… High blood pressure, yes. I take medication for it. And… I think that’s it. The doctor checks my blood pressure regularly. I haven’t been told about anything else. I get Medicare, so they check things often, you know? I'm not very good at remembering medical terms, if that’s alright. Everything sounds so complicated these days.
DOCTOR: Okay, high blood pressure, managed with medication. Good. And what medications are you currently taking for that, Ms. Mayhugh?
PATIENT: Oh, let me think… It's a small white pill… I believe it’s… Lisinopril? Yes, that sounds right. One tablet every morning. And I take a vitamin D supplement, because the doctor said my levels were low. That’s all, I think. I try to keep it simple. I don’t want to forget things!
DOCTOR: Lisinopril for blood pressure, and Vitamin D. Alright. Now, do you have any allergies to any medications, food, or anything else?
PATIENT: No, no allergies. Not that I know of, anyway. I’ve eaten everything put in front of me my whole life! My daughter always worries about that too, but I’ve never had a reaction to anything. I’m a pretty simple woman, doctor. Don't cause much trouble.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. Mayhugh. Thank you for that information. Now, I’m going to do a quick physical exam, just to check your ears, balance, and listen to your heart and lungs. Is that alright?
PATIENT: Yes, that sounds perfectly alright, doctor. Whatever you think is best. I’m ready when you are. Just… please be gentle. I'm not as steady on my feet as I used to be.
DOCTOR: Of course, Ms. Mayhugh. Please have a seat on the table. First, I'm going to look in your ears with an otoscope. This will just allow me to see if there’s any blockage or inflammation. It doesn’t hurt, but it might be a little uncomfortable.
PATIENT: Alright. Just let me know if it’s too much, doctor. My ears are rather sensitive, you see. I hope this doesn't take too long.
DOCTOR: Okay, looking at your right ear now… hmm. Some cerumen – earwax – present, but nothing significant. The tympanic membrane – that's your eardrum – appears intact, but slightly… dull. Now, the left ear… Similar finding here. Some cerumen, tympanic membrane appears intact, but also slightly dull. I’m also going to listen to your heart and lungs… Heart sounds are regular, but slightly… elevated. Lungs are clear, no wheezing or crackles. Now, I want to check your balance. Could you please stand up for me, and I'll have you close your eyes and try to maintain your balance for 30 seconds?
PATIENT: Alright. Thirty seconds, you say? Oh dear… I don't feel very steady… It’s a little hard to keep my balance… I think I'm going to need to sit down soon.
DOCTOR: Whoa, easy now. That's alright. Sit down, please. Your balance is… significantly impaired. And you seem a bit unsteady on your feet even when seated. Now, I’m going to do a quick Dix-Hallpike maneuver. This is a test to check for something called Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, or BPPV. It involves quickly turning your head while lying down. It can sometimes induce dizziness, but it’s a relatively safe test. Are you comfortable with that?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a maneuver? And it might make me dizzy? I… I don't know, doctor. I really don't like the feeling of dizziness. Is it absolutely necessary? Maybe we could just… skip that part? I'm starting to feel quite flustered.
DOCTOR: I understand your apprehension, Ms. Mayhugh. It's certainly not required, but it can help us determine the cause of your dizziness. Given your impaired balance and the description of your symptoms, BPPV is a strong possibility. If it is BPPV, there's a simple treatment that's often very effective. However, we can certainly proceed without it. Based on your history and exam, my preliminary assessment is that you are likely experiencing some form of vestibular dysfunction - meaning there’s an issue with your inner ear balance system. I recommend a referral to an audiologist for further testing, including a VNG to assess your inner ear function. Would that be alright with you?
PATIENT: An audiologist… and a VNG? Oh dear. That sounds… complicated. I suppose so, doctor. If you think it’s necessary. I just… I don't want a lot of fuss. And I don't want to be dizzy the whole time. Can you tell me what the VNG… does? And will it take long? I have to pick Kiko up from school later. I just want to feel normal again, you know?
