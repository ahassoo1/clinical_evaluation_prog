DOCTOR: Good afternoon, Ms. Wrye. Welcome to the clinic. My name is Dr. Seil. It’s a pleasure to meet you. What brings you in today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. Yes, well... it's about a letter. A pet ownership letter, I think they called it? Honestly, I don't really remember all the details. Something about needing it for… somewhere. It’s all a bit fuzzy, you see. I just know someone said I needed to come get it from a doctor.
DOCTOR: Certainly. A pet ownership letter, yes. Those are becoming more common with certain housing regulations and airline travel. It sounds like you may need documentation confirming your emotional support animal, or potentially a service animal. To clarify, Ms. Wrye, is this letter for housing, travel, or another reason?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Housing, I think. Yes, that sounds right. A new apartment building… they were being very strict about… everything. And something about a weight limit? Though I don't see what that has to do with anything. Honestly, paperwork is the bane of my existence. It’s all just… a bother, really. I just need the letter, if you can, to get them off my back.
DOCTOR: I understand your frustration with the paperwork, Ms. Wrye. It can be quite a process. To properly complete this letter for you, I'll need to gather some information. Let's start with a little bit about why you feel you benefit from having an animal in your housing. Could you describe the ways in which your animal supports your emotional or physical well-being?
PATIENT: Well… honestly? It's just nice to have something around. I live alone, you see. Divorced, a long time ago now. And the animal... it keeps me company. It's a small dog, a chihuahua. A bit yappy, truth be told, but it's good company. Helps me feel… less alone, I suppose. I don't know if that's enough. It’s not like I have any serious problems, you understand. Just… loneliness. Is that what they want to know?
DOCTOR: That's perfectly valid, Ms. Wrye. Feeling less alone and having companionship are absolutely important aspects of well-being. And those are certainly things I can document. To get a complete picture, could you tell me a bit more about how the dog specifically helps with those feelings?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Specifics… hmm. Well, it greets me when I come home. Always happy to see me, which is nice. And… I talk to it. Sounds silly, I know, but it’s a good listener. Doesn't judge. And it… makes me get out of the house. I have to walk it, you see. Forces me to be a bit active. Though I’m not much for exercise, to be honest. It’s just… a routine. A good routine, I think. Does that make sense? It’s not like it’s doing anything special, it just… is. A presence.
DOCTOR: That makes perfect sense, Ms. Wrye. Those are all very meaningful things. Having a routine, having a companion to greet you, and simply having a presence can be incredibly beneficial for emotional well-being. It sounds like your dog plays a valuable role in your life. To complete the documentation, I'd like to ask a few more questions, if you don't mind. Have you ever been diagnosed with a mental health condition, such as anxiety or depression?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Diagnosed… hmm. No, not officially. Never really saw much of a point in going to doctors for that sort of thing. I just… cope. You know? I’ve always been a strong person. It's just been… life. Divorces, you know? And… loneliness. It comes and goes. I don’t need a label, if that makes sense. I just… am. Is that a problem? I don’t want to make a big deal out of nothing. Honestly, I just want the letter and to be left alone.
DOCTOR: I completely understand, Ms. Wrye. You're not obligated to share anything you're not comfortable with, and you absolutely do not need a label to validate your feelings or experiences. It sounds like you've developed healthy coping mechanisms over time, and that’s commendable. To be thorough, and to ensure the letter is accurate and meets the requirements of your apartment building, could you describe any specific symptoms you experience that the dog helps to alleviate?
PATIENT: Symptoms… oh, goodness. Well, when I’m alone for too long, I do get… restless. And… a bit sad, I suppose. It’s just a… heavy feeling. Like something is missing. The dog… distracts me from that feeling. I cuddle with it, you see. And it licks my face, which is… silly, but it makes me smile. And I worry less when I have it around. It’s just… a comfort. But it’s not like I’m a mess or anything! I get things done, I go to the store, I… I live my life. It just… makes it a little easier. Is that good enough? I don’t know what they expect me to say. It's not like I have panic attacks or anything.
DOCTOR: That is perfectly good enough, Ms. Wrye. You've described a very clear picture of how your dog supports your emotional well-being, and that’s exactly the information I need. It sounds like the dog provides comfort, reduces feelings of loneliness, and offers a sense of security. Now, just to complete the necessary documentation, I'd like to ask a few quick questions about your past medical history. Have you ever been hospitalized for any reason?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Hospitalized… hmm. Let me think. Not recently, no. When I was a child, I had the measles, I think. And… when I gave birth to my son, of course. But other than that… no. No major illnesses or anything like that. Just… the usual aches and pains that come with getting older, you know? I’m fairly healthy, all things considered. I try to eat well, though I do enjoy a good glass of wine now and then. Is that relevant? Honestly, I’m starting to feel a bit silly answering all these questions. It’s just a dog, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: It’s not silly at all, Ms. Wrye. We're just being thorough to ensure the documentation is accurate. And you’re right, it is “just a dog” – a wonderful companion who brings you comfort and support, and that’s a valuable thing. One last question regarding your medical history. Are you currently taking any medications?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me think… I take a vitamin D supplement, sometimes. And occasionally, when my joints are acting up, I take ibuprofen. But that’s it, really. Nothing regular. I try to avoid taking pills as much as possible. I believe in letting the body heal itself, you know? Honestly, I'm not much of a medicine person. Is that a problem? I just want the letter, if you can. I have errands to run, you see.
DOCTOR: No, that’s not a problem at all. Thank you for sharing all of that with me. It sounds like you're very mindful of your health. Based on our conversation, and the information you’ve provided, I am happy to write a letter confirming your need for an emotional support animal to support your emotional well-being. It will state that your dog provides comfort, reduces feelings of loneliness, and helps to mitigate symptoms of stress and anxiety. It will also mention the importance of your routine with your dog. Do you have any concerns about the content of the letter, or would you like me to include anything else?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. That sounds… perfect, actually. Yes, that’s exactly it. Comfort, loneliness… routine. Yes. No, I don’t think I need to add anything else. Just… make sure it says it helps with the loneliness, okay? That's the main thing. And… thank you, Doctor. You’ve been very patient with me. I appreciate it. I just want to get this sorted and be done with it.
DOCTOR: Certainly, Ms. Wrye. I've emphasized the support your dog provides in alleviating feelings of loneliness. Here is the letter, and I've included a copy for your records. Please review it to ensure everything is accurate. I'll also provide a brief summary of our discussion for your personal reference. Do you have any questions about the letter or anything we've discussed today?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Let me see… Yes, that looks… perfect, actually. Yes, that's everything. You’ve done a wonderful job, Doctor. Thank you so much. Really. It will be a relief to get this to the apartment building and be done with it. I think… I think that’s all. I don’t want to bother you any further. Is there anything I need to pay?
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wrye. I'm glad I could help. There is a standard copay for a medical consultation, which is $75. The office assistant will process that for you before you leave. Do you have any follow-up questions for me at this time, or are you all set?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, of course. $75, right? No, I don't think I have any questions. Just… thank you again. You’ve been very kind. It was a pleasure meeting you, Doctor. And I appreciate your patience with my… forgetfulness. I suppose I should be going now. Have a good day.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Ms. Wrye. It was a pleasure meeting you as well. I’m glad I could assist. Have a wonderful day, and please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further concerns. .
