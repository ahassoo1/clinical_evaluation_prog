DOCTOR: Hi Lawton, good to meet you. I’m Dr. Rosanova. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Yeah, hi. Look, I don't really have a lot of time for this, to be honest. It’s… my stomach. It’s been bloated. Just feels full all the time, you know? Like I ate a Thanksgiving dinner and I didn’t. It’s annoying, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay, I understand you’re short on time, and we’ll try to be efficient. Bloating and feeling full – that is annoying. When did this start?
PATIENT: Ugh, honestly? I don't really keep track of dates. Sometime… a few weeks ago, maybe? It comes and goes. It's not like it's constant, but it's happening enough that it's bothering me. I just want it to stop. Is that really all there is to this?
DOCTOR: A few weeks, coming and going... Okay. And can you describe how it feels when it happens?
PATIENT: How does it feel? Like… pressure. Like someone inflated a balloon in my gut. And it’s gassy, obviously. Not like, painful, just… uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable. Look, I work construction, alright? Pile driving. I don’t have time to be dealing with stomach problems.
DOCTOR: Right, construction work. That makes sense – physically demanding. No sharp pain, just pressure and gas. Have you noticed anything that makes it worse or better?
PATIENT: Honestly? No. I eat what I eat. Doesn't seem to matter. Could be anything. I don’t pay attention to that kinda stuff. I just… live my life. It just happens. It’s probably just… stress, right? From work.
DOCTOR: Stress can definitely play a role. Let’s rule out anything else though. Have you had any changes in your bowel movements?
PATIENT: Bowel movements? Seriously? Look, I'm not here to talk about… that. I go when I go. Normal, I guess? I don't… analyze it. Is this really necessary?
DOCTOR: I understand it’s not the most pleasant topic, but changes in bowel habits can give us clues. Just a quick yes or no – have they been different than usual lately?
PATIENT: Fine. Yeah, maybe. A little. Sometimes… looser. But honestly, it could be the water I've been drinking at the site. It doesn't taste great. It's probably just that.
DOCTOR: Okay, looser stools sometimes. And the water quality is a good thing to consider. Any nausea, vomiting, or fever associated with this?
PATIENT: No. Absolutely not. Look, I haven’t been sick. Just bloated. I’m a grown man. I don’t get sick easily. I just want something to make this… puffiness go away. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: No, that’s not too much to ask at all. Let's do a quick exam, just to get a baseline. I’m going to listen to your stomach and feel it gently. Is that okay?
PATIENT: Ugh, fine. Whatever. Get it over with. I really don’t have all day. Just… don't poke too hard. I’ve got things to do.
DOCTOR: Okay. I'm hearing normal bowel sounds. Your abdomen is a little tender to the touch, especially in the lower left quadrant, but nothing alarming. No masses that I can feel. Your abdomen is slightly distended. I’m going to have you lie down on your back.
PATIENT: Lie down? Seriously? Look, this is ridiculous. I’m a construction worker, not a… a patient. But fine. Get it over with. Just… hurry.
DOCTOR: Okay, lying flat… I'm just checking for any fluid or enlarged organs. Everything sounds within normal limits so far. Now, I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs briefly, just to get a complete picture.
PATIENT: Whatever. Just… be quick about it. My back’s starting to hurt. I don’t usually lie down like this.
DOCTOR: Okay, heart and lungs sound good. Everything seems normal. Based on what you’ve told me, and the quick exam, it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or possibly some bloating due to gas. But we need to rule a few things out. I’m going to order some routine bloodwork – a CBC, a CMP, and a stool sample. The stool sample will check for any infection or parasites. Does that sound okay?
PATIENT: Bloodwork and… a stool sample? Look, I really don't like the sound of any of this. But fine. Whatever you think is necessary. Just tell me what I need to do and let me get out of here. I don't want to be poking around in… that. Just get it over with, alright?
DOCTOR: Okay. I’ll give you the lab orders and instructions for the stool sample. The stool sample kit has detailed directions. It’s important to collect it properly for accurate results. For the bloodwork, you can go to the lab across the street, and you don’t need an appointment. While we're waiting for the results, I recommend trying a bland diet – things like rice, toast, bananas – and avoiding carbonated drinks and foods known to cause gas like beans and broccoli. Over-the-counter simethicone can also help with the bloating. If the bloating gets significantly worse, or you develop a fever, nausea, vomiting, or blood in your stool, please come back immediately, or go to the nearest emergency room. Does that all make sense?
PATIENT: Rice, toast, bananas… fine. Less gas, less… everything. Look, I got it. Don't need a lecture. Just give me the papers and let me go. I'll try the bland diet and the gas stuff. And if it gets worse, I'll come back. Happy?
DOCTOR: Yes, very happy. I'll have the nurse schedule a follow-up appointment for you in a week to discuss the results. Hopefully, this will get you feeling better quickly. Here's my card, in case you have any questions. And just one last thing - do you have any known allergies or medications you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Ugh, allergies? No. And medications… just ibuprofen, sometimes. For my back. That’s it. Look, can we please be done now? I really need to get back to work.
DOCTOR: Okay, no allergies, ibuprofen as needed for your back. That’s good to know. Alright, Lawton. You're all set. Get some rest, try the bland diet, and we’ll follow up next week. If anything changes or gets worse, don’t hesitate to call. Here’s the nurse – she’ll get you checked out. Have a good day, and I hope you feel better soon.
PATIENT: Yeah, whatever. Thanks. I guess. This whole thing was a waste of time.
