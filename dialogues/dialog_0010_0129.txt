DOCTOR: Good morning, Dawnetta. Welcome to the clinic. I'm Dr. Annesley. It’s nice to meet you. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Morning. Honestly, I haven't got all day, so let's get right to it. It's my stool. It's... dark. Black, like. And I take those pain pills, you know, the ones for my arthritis. Been taking 'em for years. That got something to do with it, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Okay, Dawnetta, I understand you're concerned about the color of your stool and are wondering if your arthritis medication is related. We’ll get to the bottom of this as efficiently as we can. Just to confirm, you mentioned pain pills for arthritis – can you tell me the name of the medication and the dosage you're currently taking?
PATIENT: Honestly? I don't keep track of those things. My husband, Harold, handles all that. He's the organized one. It's... a white pill, I think. Smallish. And he gives me two every morning, sometimes three if my knees are really acting up. Look, is this important? Can't you just... look at the stool?
DOCTOR: It is important, Dawnetta, because different medications can affect your stool color in different ways. Knowing exactly which medication will help us figure out what’s going on. But we can certainly proceed. Dark, black stool can sometimes indicate bleeding in the digestive tract, which we need to rule out. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels – feeling more tired or weak than usual?
PATIENT: Bleeding?! Good heavens. Well, no, I haven’t been bleeding. And tired? I’m seventy-three, Doctor! Of course I’m tired. It's called getting old. I’ve always been a bit… low energy, if you must know. I don't go running marathons. But no more tired than usual. Look, I eat reasonably well. Harold makes sure of that too. It's probably just the pills. Are you going to tell me to stop taking them? Because if you are, I'm leaving. My arthritis would kill me faster than any black stool.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern about stopping the medication, Dawnetta, and I wouldn’t suggest that without a thorough look at everything first. We’ll try to figure this out without making drastic changes. Just to be sure, has there been any change in your appetite recently?
PATIENT: Appetite? No, not really. Harold makes a good roast chicken on Sundays. I always have a bit of that. And toast with my tea in the mornings. I'm not one for fancy eating, never have been. It’s not like I’ve gone off my food, if that’s what you’re asking. It’s just… black. Stool. You keep asking me all these roundabout questions. Is this going to take long? I have a bridge club meeting at two.
DOCTOR: No, we’re not going to take long, Dawnetta. I just want to get a complete picture. Have you noticed any nausea or vomiting recently?
PATIENT: Nausea? No. And vomiting? Absolutely not. I’ve got a strong stomach, thank you very much. I haven’t been sick a day in my life, practically. Look, honestly, Doctor, this is ridiculous. It’s a bit of dark stool. Old people get all sorts of things. It’s probably just… a bad batch of tea. Now, are we finished here? I really need to go. Harold will be wondering where I am.
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. I understand your concerns. Given your history and the fact that you're not experiencing any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or changes in appetite, and you're understandably anxious about your bridge club meeting... I'm going to recommend a simple stool test – a fecal occult blood test – just to rule out any hidden bleeding. It's a quick, non-invasive test you can do at home. Would you be willing to do that?
PATIENT: A test? Oh, for heaven's sake. Fine. Whatever. Just get me the box and tell me what to do. And make it quick. I haven't got all day, you know. And I swear, if it interferes with my bridge on Thursday, I'm blaming you. Now, where do I pick this up?
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. Here are the instructions. You'll collect a small sample at home, and then you can drop it off at the lab just down the street – 14 Oak Avenue. They’re open until 5:00 pm. The results usually take 3-5 business days. We can discuss them over the phone or schedule a quick follow-up appointment. Do you have any questions about how to collect the sample?
PATIENT: No. Instructions are instructions. Harold's good at following them, I'm sure I can manage. Honestly, Doctor, I just want to go. This has been a complete waste of my time. Thank you for nothing. .
DOCTOR: Alright, Dawnetta. If you experience any new symptoms – abdominal pain, significant weakness, or a change in your bowel habits – please don't hesitate to call the office right away. Have a good day, and enjoy your bridge club meeting. .
