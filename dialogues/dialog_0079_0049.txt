DOCTOR: Good morning, Mr. Schneer. I’m Dr. Gonzalezperez. It says here you're an 83-year-old gentleman. Now, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, good mornin’ to ya, Doctor. Schneer is the name. Eighty-three, is it? Seems like yesterday, honestly. Well, I reckon it’s my ears. They just… ain’t what they used to be. Things are gettin’ muffled, ya know? Hard to hear folks sometimes. Not sure when it started, to be honest. A little bit at a time, I suppose.
DOCTOR: I see. A gradual decrease in hearing. That’s quite common at your age, Mr. Schneer, although we should certainly investigate to determine the cause. Can you tell me more about this muffling?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, it's just… everything sounds a bit far away, even when people are right near me. Like talkin’ through a pillow, maybe? And sometimes it’s worse than others. When there’s a lot of noise, it's awful. Can’t make heads or tails of anything. I mostly just nod and smile, pretendin’ I heard somethin’. Gets me into trouble sometimes, I reckon.
DOCTOR: Nodding and smiling… yes, a common coping mechanism. And you mentioned it’s worse with background noise. Do you have any difficulty hearing specific sounds, or is it all sounds that are muffled?
PATIENT: Hmm… that’s a good question. Let me think. I think… high-pitched sounds are the worst. Like, the birds chirpin’… I barely hear ‘em anymore. And when the grandkids talk, they got such little voices, I can't follow a word they say. Lower sounds... well, I can still hear the TV alright, if I turn it up a bit. Not sure if that makes sense.
DOCTOR: That does make sense, Mr. Schneer. Difficulty with higher frequencies is often an early sign of hearing loss. Now, have you noticed any ringing, buzzing, or other noises in your ears?
PATIENT: Ringing… now, that’s a funny thing. Sometimes, yeah, I think I do hear a kinda… faint ringin’. Not all the time, though. Comes and goes. Mostly when things are quiet, I suppose. Like when I’m tryin’ to get to sleep. It's not loud, just… there. Annoyin’, more than anything. I mostly just ignore it, to be honest.
DOCTOR: Tinnitus – that ringing you hear – is quite common, and often accompanies hearing loss. Alright. Now, I'm going to ask a few more general questions, if you don't mind. Have you ever been exposed to loud noises at work or during any hobbies?
PATIENT: Loud noises… oh, yes. I worked in a shoe factory for… goodness, must’ve been forty years. Lots of machines clatterin’ and bangin’ all day long. They gave us earplugs, but I didn’t always wear ‘em, to be honest. Too uncomfortable, and I needed to hear what folks were sayin’. Didn’t think much of it at the time, I suppose. Never expected it to catch up with me.
DOCTOR: I see. Prolonged exposure to noise is a significant risk factor. And have you had any history of ear infections, or any injuries to your head or ears?
PATIENT: Ear infections… hmm… I think I had one when I was a little boy. Real bad one, but I don’t remember much about it. Other than that… no, not really. No head injuries, no nothin’. I was always pretty careful. Though, I did slip on the ice last winter… landed on my bum, but didn’t hit my head, far as I recall.
DOCTOR: Alright, Mr. Schneer. I’d like to conduct a brief ear exam now, if you don’t mind. It will involve looking in your ears with an instrument called an otoscope, and we’ll do a simple hearing test to assess your hearing levels. Would that be alright?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, that sounds fine, Doctor. Whatever you need to do. Just let me know if it's gonna be uncomfortable. I ain't as spry as I used to be. Go right ahead, then.
DOCTOR: Excellent. Please have a seat, and I’ll begin. It shouldn’t be uncomfortable at all, but if you feel any pain, please let me know immediately. External auditory canals appear clear bilaterally. Tympanic membranes are slightly dull and retracted bilaterally. No signs of acute inflammation. Cerumen is minimal. Decreased hearing to whisper testing bilaterally. Difficulty with high-frequency sounds. Alright, Mr. Schneer. The examination confirms some hearing loss, which is consistent with your reported symptoms and history. The hearing loss appears to be more pronounced in the higher frequencies, and is present in both ears. This is likely due to a combination of age-related changes and noise exposure.
PATIENT: Oh, is that so? Well, that’s… not surprising, I suppose. I figured as much. So, what does that mean, Doctor? Am I goin’ deaf? Is there anything you can do about it?
DOCTOR: No, Mr. Schneer, you are not “going deaf.” Hearing loss is a spectrum, and it sounds like you have a mild to moderate loss, which is very common at your age. It means you may have difficulty hearing softer sounds, or understanding speech in noisy environments. There are several options we can consider. The most common is a hearing aid. They are quite sophisticated these days and can significantly improve your ability to hear and communicate. We could also consider strategies to help you cope with your hearing loss, such as ensuring good lighting when communicating, asking people to speak clearly, and minimizing background noise. We can also discuss assistive listening devices. Would you be interested in learning more about hearing aids?
PATIENT: Hearing aids… hmm. I always thought them hearing aids were for… older folks, really old folks. I still feel pretty good, ya know? I don't know… I'm not sure I want somethin’ stuck in my ear all the time. And are they expensive? My pension don’t stretch too far. What would Medicare cover? I'd like to know a bit more, but I'm a bit hesitant, to be honest.
DOCTOR: I understand your hesitation completely, Mr. Schneer. There's a lot of stigma surrounding hearing aids, but the technology has improved dramatically. They’re much smaller, more discreet, and more comfortable than they used to be. And you’re right to ask about cost. Medicare Part B typically covers the cost of a hearing evaluation and a hearing aid fitting, but it does not cover the cost of the hearing aid itself. However, there are some Medicare Advantage plans that may offer hearing aid benefits, and there are various assistance programs available to help with the cost. I can provide you with a referral to an audiologist, who can conduct a more comprehensive hearing test and discuss your options in detail, including the different types of hearing aids available, their cost, and potential funding sources. Would you like me to do that?
PATIENT: Yes, that would be lovely, Doctor. An audiologist… that sounds sensible. Someone who knows all about ‘em. I’d like that, very much. And if you could give me some information about them assistance programs, that’d be grand. It's good to know what's available. Thank you for explainin’ everything so clearly. I feel a bit better now, knowin’ what’s what.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schneer. I'm glad I could help. Here’s a referral to a reputable audiologist in the area, Dr. Emily Carter. She’s very experienced and patient. And here’s a list of local and national organizations that offer financial assistance for hearing aids, as well as information about Medicare coverage. I recommend scheduling an appointment with Dr. Carter as soon as possible. She can assess your hearing loss more thoroughly and recommend the best course of action. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
PATIENT: No, I think that’s everything, Doctor. You've been very kind and helpful. Thank you again for takin’ the time to explain everything. I appreciate it very much. I'll give Dr. Carter a call tomorrow. Have a good day now. And thank you again.
DOCTOR: You're very welcome, Mr. Schneer. It was my pleasure. Please don’t hesitate to contact the office if you have any questions or concerns. I wish you all the best with your hearing. Have a good day as well.
