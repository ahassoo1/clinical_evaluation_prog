DOCTOR: Right. Mr. Drahota, yes. So, what brings you in today?
PATIENT: Honestly, Doctor… it’s really quite simple. I’m… darkening. And tired. Terribly tired. It’s been going on for… well, I don’t recall precisely how long. Some weeks, it’s worse than others. It’s… unsettling. I simply haven’t the time for this, you understand. I have work. Important work.
DOCTOR: Darkening… and fatigue. Right. By "darkening," are you referring to changes in your skin tone?
PATIENT: Is that not abundantly clear? Yes, my skin. It's… becoming less vibrant. Less… refined. As for how long… I really can’t say. Things slip my mind these days. I'm a working man, not a… a color chart. Do you need a precise date? It feels like months, perhaps. It’s bothersome, truly. Is this going to take long? I have a girder waiting for me.
DOCTOR: Months, alright. And you haven’t noticed any other changes alongside this… loss of vibrancy?
PATIENT: Changes? What sort of changes? I feel tired, as I’ve already stated. A little… achy, perhaps. Old age, Doctor, it comes for us all. And the sun, naturally. I work outdoors. Though, I assure you, I take precautions. What precisely are you fishing for? I haven’t any… spots, if that’s what you’re implying. I assure you, my hygiene is impeccable.
DOCTOR: Right. No spots. Any recent unintentional weight loss?
PATIENT: Weight loss? Goodness, no. If anything, I’ve gained a little. My wife makes excellent meals, you see. Though, my appetite hasn’t been… robust lately. But that's likely due to this… exhaustion. Really, Doctor, are you suggesting I’m wasting away? I’m a strong man, still capable of lifting considerable weight. It’s a waste of my time, this entire discussion. Perhaps a simple tonic would suffice?
DOCTOR: Alright. And what about bowel habits?
PATIENT: I beg your pardon? Such… indelicate questions, Doctor. Is this truly necessary? I came here because I’m darkening, not to discuss… such private matters with a woman I’ve just met. It's… uncouth. Frankly, I find this line of inquiry quite offensive. I assure you, my constitution is perfectly sound. Now, are we going to address the problem, or are you merely going to interrogate me?
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, these questions are standard procedure. It's important to get a complete picture. However, if you're truly unwilling to provide further information… we can proceed with a basic physical exam. I can take a look at your skin, check your vital signs. But a diagnosis will be difficult without a more thorough history. Is that acceptable?
PATIENT: Very well. Examine me. Quickly. I haven't all day. Though I doubt you'll find anything of consequence. It’s probably just… the sun. Or stress. My wife has been… particularly demanding lately. Get on with it, Doctor. And please, refrain from any further… personal inquiries. I have girders to reinforce.
DOCTOR: Alright. Please, have a seat. I'll start with your vital signs. Blood pressure first. And then we'll take a look at your skin. Please remove your shirt.
PATIENT: Honestly… the indignity of it all. Must I completely disrobe? This is… unnecessary, wouldn't you agree? It's a simple darkening, not a… a full medical investigation. Get it over with, Doctor. The sooner this is finished, the better.
DOCTOR: 148 over 82. Slightly elevated. Heart sounds regular. Lungs are clear. Mr. Drahota, I noticed this mole. Has it changed in size, shape, or color recently?
PATIENT: A mole? I hadn't noticed. Honestly, Doctor, I've got dozens of them. Been working in the sun my whole life. It's probably just… another one. I doubt it's changed. Why would it? It’s been there for… well, a long time. Are you trying to frighten me with a harmless blemish? This is precisely what I feared. Unnecessary alarm over a simple… darkening.
DOCTOR: Mr. Drahota, I understand your frustration. However, any new or changing mole requires evaluation. It’s standard practice. I recommend a biopsy to determine if it’s benign. It’s a simple procedure. Would you like me to schedule it for you?
PATIENT: A biopsy? For a harmless mole? Absolutely not! That sounds… barbaric. And entirely unnecessary. I assure you, Doctor, it’s nothing to worry about. I’ve dealt with far worse. This is preposterous. I came here for a simple consultation, not a… a surgical procedure. I decline. I think I’ve wasted enough of my time. .
DOCTOR: Very well, Mr. Drahota. However, I strongly advise you to reconsider. If you notice any changes – itching, bleeding, or further discoloration – please seek immediate medical attention. I will document your refusal of biopsy. .
