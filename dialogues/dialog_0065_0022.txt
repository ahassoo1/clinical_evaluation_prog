DOCTOR: Good morning, Ms. McConnon. I’m Dr. Duplichan. So, tell me, what brings you in to see me today?
PATIENT: Oh, hello Doctor. It's… my tummy. It feels big, you know? And I don't want to eat much anymore. Not like I used to. It just… doesn't feel right. It's been a little while now, maybe a few weeks? Hard to say, time goes so fast.
DOCTOR: A few weeks, alright. “Feels big,” you say. Can you describe that feeling a bit more?
PATIENT: Hmm… like full of water, maybe? Not painful, exactly. Just… stretched. And heavy. Like I swallowed a big balloon, but a gentle balloon. I don’t know if that makes sense. I used to be very small, you know. And now… not so small. It worries me a little.
DOCTOR: “Full of water” and “stretched,” and you’ve noticed a change in your size. I understand your concern. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation along with this feeling of fullness?
PATIENT: Oh dear… let me think. Nausea… no, not really. I haven’t been sick at all. Vomiting, no. Diarrhea… sometimes. But I get that sometimes anyway, you know, old age. Constipation… not really. Everything… goes. Just not a lot of want for it, if you understand. It’s hard to explain. I just don’t feel hungry.
DOCTOR: Alright. So, no nausea or vomiting, occasional diarrhea that you attribute to age, and a decreased appetite. Have you noticed any changes in your bowel movements besides the occasional diarrhea – like the color of your stool, or if it’s thinner than usual?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Doctor, you ask a lot of questions! Let me see… the color… I think it's normal? Brown, mostly. I haven't really looked, if I'm being honest. I just… go. And I don't pay attention, usually. Thinner? Maybe a little? Now that you mention it. But I don't remember for sure. It's all a bit of a blur, you know. Everything is a blur these days.
DOCTOR: I understand. It's a lot to keep track of. We just want to rule things out. Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?
PATIENT: Weight loss… Oh, yes. I think so. My clothes… they are a little looser. Not because I lost weight on purpose, mind you! I just… haven’t felt like eating. My friend, she said I look thinner. She worries too. A little weight loss, yes. Is that bad?
DOCTOR: It’s good that your friend is observant. Any weight loss, especially unintentional weight loss, warrants investigation. Now, let’s talk about your past medical history. Do you have any known medical conditions?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness. Medical conditions… Well, I had a bad hip once, a long time ago. They fixed it. And… I think I had a little bit of trouble with my heart, maybe ten years ago? But the doctor said it was okay then. Nothing serious, I don't think. I take a little pill for my blood pressure, sometimes. But I forget to take it sometimes, too. Old age, you know. Everything gets… mixed up.
DOCTOR: Alright, a previous hip repair, some heart trouble in the past, and medication for blood pressure, which you don’t always take. Do you remember what medication you’re taking for your blood pressure?
PATIENT: Oh dear… no. I really don’t. It’s a little white pill. A very little white pill. The doctor gave it to me. I have a box of them somewhere, but I don't remember the name. I just take it when I remember. And sometimes my daughter reminds me. She is a good girl. But she doesn't live nearby, so… It’s all a bit of a mess.
DOCTOR: I see. Well, we can sort through it. Do you have any allergies to any medications, foods, or anything else?
PATIENT: Allergies… hmm. Not that I know of. I eat everything. I used to love pickled herring, you know. And cabbage rolls. Never had any trouble with food. And I don’t take many pills, so I don’t think so. No allergies, I don't think. I get itchy sometimes, but that's just old skin, probably. Old age is full of itches.
DOCTOR: Alright, no known allergies. And you mentioned you had some heart trouble in the past. Do you know what specifically was wrong with your heart?
PATIENT: Oh, goodness… Doctor, you are very thorough! I really don’t remember. Something with the rhythm, maybe? The doctor said it wasn’t serious, that it would… regulate itself. I had some tests, and then he said everything was okay. It was a long time ago. I was younger then, and I forget things so easily now. I just remember being tired, and then the doctor fixed it. That's all I know.
DOCTOR: Alright. We can try to obtain those records if needed. Now, let’s move on to your family history. Are there any significant medical conditions that run in your family, like heart disease, cancer, or diabetes?
PATIENT: Oh, family… My mother… she was strong. Very strong woman. She lived a long life. She had a little bit of trouble with her legs, maybe? Something with the veins. And my father… he was a farmer. A very hard worker. He… he died when I was young. I don't really remember him being sick. I don't think there was much cancer in my family. No, not that I know of. We didn't talk about these things much, you know. It was a different time. It’s all a bit foggy.
DOCTOR: Alright. And lastly, could you tell me a little bit about your social history?
PATIENT: Social history… hmm. Well, I used to be a sociologist, you know. I studied people. Interesting work. I traveled a lot, met many different folks. I never married, never had children. Just me, mostly. I have a daughter, from… a long time ago. She's very good, but she lives far away. I live alone now. Quiet life. Mostly reading, and… remembering. It’s a peaceful life, but sometimes… a little lonely.
DOCTOR: Alright, Ms. McConnon, thank you for sharing all of that information with me. Now, I’d like to perform a physical exam. I’m going to listen to your heart and lungs, and I’ll also need to feel your abdomen to see what’s going on with your tummy. Is that alright with you?
PATIENT: Oh, yes, Doctor. That’s fine. Whatever you need to do. I trust you. My tummy… it doesn't hurt, but it feels strange, you know? Like a big balloon, full of air. Go ahead. I’ll try to be still.
DOCTOR: Okay. Your heart sounds… are a little bit faint, but regular. No murmurs that I detect. Lungs are clear, normal breath sounds bilaterally. Now, your abdomen… is soft, but there’s some mild distension. There's no significant tenderness to palpation in the upper quadrants. In the lower quadrants… there’s some mild fullness, but no sharp pain. Percussion reveals tympany throughout. Bowel sounds are present, but slightly diminished. Alright. I'm documenting "mild abdominal distension, tympany on percussion, diminished bowel sounds, no tenderness to palpation." Are you experiencing any pain at all right now as I was pressing on your abdomen?
PATIENT: No, Doctor. No pain. Just… strange. Like a big bubble. A gentle bubble, you know? Not sharp, not hurting. Just… full. And heavy. I don’t know if that makes sense. It’s better when I’m lying down, maybe? I haven't really paid attention. Is something wrong?
DOCTOR: Alright. It’s good that there’s no pain. Based on what you’ve told me, and the findings of the physical exam – the distension, diminished bowel sounds – and given your unintentional weight loss and decreased appetite, I'm concerned about a few possibilities. One possibility is a simple slowing down of the digestive system, which can happen with age, but we need to rule out other things. Another possibility is a blockage or partial obstruction in your intestines, although the lack of pain is reassuring. And, finally, we need to consider the possibility of an underlying malignancy. We need to do some further testing to get a clearer picture of what’s going on. I'm going to order a complete blood count, a comprehensive metabolic panel, and an abdominal X-ray. This will help us to assess your overall health and look for any signs of a blockage or other abnormalities. Do you have any questions so far?
PATIENT: Oh dear… a blockage? A malignancy? That sounds… frightening. I don't want a blockage, or… anything bad. X-rays… are those safe? And blood tests… will they hurt? I don't like needles. Is it serious, Doctor? What do you think is wrong with me? I just want my tummy to feel better.
DOCTOR: I understand your concern, Ms. McConnon. It’s natural to be worried when you hear these terms. Let me assure you, we’re doing these tests to rule things out and get a clearer understanding of what’s going on. The X-ray uses a very low dose of radiation, and the benefits of getting a diagnosis far outweigh the risks. As for the blood tests, there will be a small pinch, but it’s very quick. We’ll do our best to make you comfortable. Based on the information we have right now, it’s difficult to say definitively what’s wrong. That’s why we need to do these tests. I don't want to speculate without concrete evidence. However, given your age and symptoms, it’s important to be thorough and rule out any serious possibilities. I’m going to order these tests right away. The lab is just down the hall, and they can take the blood samples before you leave. Once we have the results, we’ll discuss them with you and decide on the next steps. Do you have any other questions for me at this time?
PATIENT: Oh… alright. A pinch… I suppose I can handle a pinch. And the X-ray… if it's necessary. Will my daughter need to come? She lives so far away… I don't want to bother her. Do you think it could just be… old age, Doctor? Maybe my tummy is just tired? I don't want a lot of… fuss. I just want to feel better. And maybe eat a little bit of cabbage rolls. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: It’s possible it’s simply age-related, Ms. McConnon, but we can’t rule out anything until we have the test results. And it's best to be cautious. I understand your reluctance to bother your daughter, and she doesn’t need to come unless you specifically want her here. You’re perfectly capable of handling this on your own. As for the cabbage rolls, absolutely not too much to ask! We want to get you back to enjoying things like that as soon as possible. I’m ordering the CBC and CMP now, and I’ll send the order for the abdominal X-ray to the radiology department. Once the lab technician is ready, they’ll come and get you. The X-ray can be done right here in the clinic after the blood tests. It will likely take about an hour or so for the results to come back. Do you have any allergies to contrast dye?
PATIENT: Contrast dye? Oh dear… I don’t think so. I’ve never had any dye before. I don’t think I’ve ever had anything like that. I don’t think so. But… what is contrast dye? Will it hurt? And what will the X-ray show? Is it like… seeing inside my tummy? I’m getting a little nervous now.
DOCTOR: That’s perfectly understandable, Ms. McConnon. It’s natural to be nervous. Contrast dye is sometimes used with X-rays to help make the images clearer, but we won’t be using it in your case right now. We're just doing a plain abdominal X-ray. The X-ray is like taking a picture of the inside of your tummy. It won’t hurt at all. You’ll just need to stand or lie still for a few moments while the technician takes the picture. It can help us to see if there are any blockages, abnormalities, or other issues going on. The lab technician should be coming for you shortly. They’ll explain the blood test procedure in more detail. I’ll be here if you have any questions or concerns. Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable while you wait?
PATIENT: Oh… just to sit, I think. And maybe a little water? My mouth feels dry. Thank you, Doctor. You're very kind. I'm just… worried about what they'll find. I always worry. I hope it's not too serious. I just want to eat my cabbage rolls. Is that too much to ask?
DOCTOR: Absolutely not too much to ask, Ms. McConnon. And I understand your worry. We're going to take things one step at a time, and we'll figure out what's going on together. I'll have the nurse bring you a glass of water right away. And please, don’t hesitate to let me know if you’re feeling anxious or uncomfortable at any point. We want to make this as easy as possible for you. The nurse will be in shortly. Just rest and try to relax. We'll get through this. .
